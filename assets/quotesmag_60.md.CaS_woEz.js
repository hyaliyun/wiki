The Dresden White's name is derived from Dresden, the capital city of Saxony, Germany, and from the gem's white color.  History  When the diamond was first shown to Frederick Augustus I, the King of Saxony, he was so captivated by the cut, clarity, and color of the gem that he chose to acquire it at any cost. He supposedly paid somewhere between $750,000 and $1,000,000 for the diamond. The Green Vault in 2012 In order to house his enormous collection of treasures, he set up the Green Vault in Dresden Castle. In 1746, goldsmith Jean Jacques Pallard designed the elaborate Golden Fleece ornament for Frederick Augustus and the Dresden White was placed at the top of the design. However, after the end of the Seven Years' War the Golden Fleece was broken up. The Dresden White was then incorporated into a shoulder knot ornament designed around 19 large diamonds and 216 small stones. After World War I, the items in the Green Vault were put on public display. They remained there until the beginning of World War II, when they were placed back under lock and key. At the height of the war in 1942, the items were transferred to the K√∂nigstein Fortress. In 1945, the Soviet Trophies Commission took the Green Vault contents to Moscow, but safely returned them in 1958. The contents were then placed on display in Dresden's Albertinium, which was built on the same site as the original Dresden museum. On November 25, 2019, a group of thieves stole much of the jewelry in the Green Vault during the 2019 Dresden heist, including the White Diamond.

Early life  Peck is from West Hartford, Connecticut. In 2007, she graduated from Columbia University in New York City.  Blogging career  On January 14, 2009, Peck wrote for the Vice blog in a piece titled, \\"I work in a biography factory\\". In December of 2010, Peck first received notoriety when she was interviewed in the New York Observer for her blog with Village Voice Media called Naked City NY, which although had been live, the existence of which had yet to be announced by the Village Voice itself. She was the sole editor for the blog and had wrote 519 posts during Naked City's run. However, she announced that Village Voice Media had informed her they were cancelling the site. She told the New York Observer in an interview \\"never been the sole editor of a blog before\\" and that contributing to the site \\"was definitely a good experience\\". Peck continued her writing career, and was still being published in the Village Voice as well as for the site The Gloss. In June of 2012, her work on the site Crushable.com about the television show Girls was referenced in a New York Times article about the show in its 'Fashion' section. One month later, the New York Observer featured a story about Peck's writing for The Gloss about her apparent \\"Missed Connection for Friendship\\" with Luka Rocco who had been accused of cannibalism. One month after that, another of her stories (while blogging for Crushable) was referenced in an LA Times article about how Chris Brown reacted to Rihanna's Oprah Winfrey interview. In 2013, she announced she would be leaving The Gloss but would continue write for the Village Voice and other outlets. On April 22, 2015, it was announced that Peck would be joining the blog Death + Taxes. It was writing on this site that in December 2016, Peck would again be featured in the New York Times, this time in an article about Hillary Clinton under its 'Politics' section.  Sexual misconduct allegation against Terry Richardson  On November 30, 2011, Peck wrote an account for The Gloss about her experiences with photographer Terry Richardson when she was 19. In the account she alleged that during a 2004 photo-shoot, he disrobed and had \\"asked her to touch his penis\\". This story was picked up by Jezebel and later the New York Times. During a follow-up story two days later, Jezebel wrote that \\"Following the publication of Peck's allegations, other stories of Richardson's questionable behavior at work poured forth.\\" In a 2014 article about the allegations The Cut credited Peck's article itself writing that \\"It was after Peck's vividly detailed account that the narrative of Richardson as predator, as opposed to kinky eccentric, gained traction.\\" In a 2017 piece about the subject, The Untitled Magazine gave wrote that it was Jezebel's coverage of Peck's article that was the tipping point in the controversy, writing that after Jezebel picked up the story \\"scores of models, stylists, fashion writers, and modeling bookers came forward [...] describing their own stories of abuse. Since then, models including Coco Rocha, Rie Rasmussen, Felice Fawn, and Charlotte Waters have also spoken out against Richardson.\\" When asked about Peck's article in 2012, The New York Times wrote that Richardson had \\"declined to discuss Ms. Peck's comments\\". In 2014, Peck wrote once more about her experience in article for The Guardian, where she wrote \\"From Roman Polanski to Woody Allen and thousands of 'nice guys' in between, it should be obvious by now that artists and predators aren't mutually exclusive. Sexual predators aren't drooling monsters that hide in caves: they are husbands, fathers, employees, friends and, yes, sometimes artists.\\"  Podcasting  On October 24, 2017 Peck made her first appearance on the The Majority Report with Sam Seder where she would later become a contributor. On International Women's Day, 2018, Peck along with co-host Shaun KB and producer Matt Lech launched the podcast The Antifada which has since released over 100 episodes to Patreon.  Personal life and political activism  Peck resides in Brooklyn, New York. In June of 2019, Peck announced that she would be running with the 'EngageNBK' slate for to be a citywide leadership committee (CLC) representative for the North Brooklyn Democratic Socialists of America. In her platform, Peck stated \\"I first got into political activism as a teen through Food Not Bombs\\" and that she joined the DSA in 2016 where she had \\"participated in a variety of projects since, from canvassing for electoral candidates to planning outward-facing events like fundraising parties and a healthcare fair.\\" Later that month, it was announced that she had won her election. She remained an active member of the committee until her term came to an end. Peck has stated that she is a member of the New York-based Emerge caucus of the Democratic Socialists of America. On August 22, 2020, Peck moderated a 'teach-in' for the caucus titled Work Sucks (I Know!).

I define myself as a naturally inclusive leader and I believe this is a distinct advantage because I see potential in every person that I work with... Growing up, my family life was generationally diverse; three generations lived together in our home. We had diverse ethnicity and nationality; my parents were a ‚Äúmixed marriage‚Äù and my grandfather grew up in Copenhagen... What I grew up thinking was normal, I now know was an incredibly valuable and special experience of immersive diversity that has given me unique perspectives and versatility of thought.\\"  Education  Hoskins received her undergraduate degree in architecture from MIT in 1979. She then worked at the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill before returning to school to pursue a Master of Business Administration from the Anderson School of Business at UCLA. In an interview with Glassdoor in 2017, she explained how the pedagogy of MIT's architecture program at the time which focused on human-centered design impacted her thinking about the importance of designing with users in mind.

It computer resources within a computer server to be separated from storage resources without modifying any physical connections. A form of composable disaggregated infrastructure, disaggregated storage allows resources to be connected via a network fabric providing flexibility when upgrading, replacing, or adding individual resources. It also allows servers to be built for future growth, offering greater storage efficiency, scale and performance than traditional data storage without compromising throughput and latency.  Background  in the past, data center storage existed in two forms. * Direct- attached storage ‚Äì disks or drives attached to a single server. Disk capacity and performance were available to that server, and only that server. Capacity expansion was limited to the number of drive bays in the server or the limits of expansion chassis. Capacity and performance can scale-up (adding drives to a server) or out (by adding servers). * Storage area networks ‚Äì disks or drives in a storage array which could be provisioned to one or many servers on the network. Capacity expansion is limited to the number of supported expansion chassis. Direct-attached storage has one critical advantage‚Äîit offers high-performance for any workloads running on that server. However, it comes with two critical disadvantages: Overall performance across the network is low, as storage can't be shared over the network without performance impact. Capacity utilization is low because disk capacity can't be directly used by other servers. Storage area networks are used to allocate storage to dozens or possibly hundreds of servers, which increases capacity utilization, but storage area networks use specialized network hardware and/or protocols that can come with disadvantages. Conventional storage networking does not provide sufficient throughput or latency minimization needed by many applications, and fails to provide enough bandwidth to utilize the full performance of new flash technologies.  Disaggregated storage overview  Disaggregated storage is a form of scale-out storage, built with some number of storage devices that function as a logical pool of storage that can be allocated to any server on the network over a very high performance network fabric. Disaggregated storage solves the limitations of storage area networks or direct-attached storage. Disaggregated storage is dynamically reconfigurable and optimally reconfigures physical resources to maximize performance and limit latency. Disaggregated storage provides the performance of local storage with the flexibility of storage area networks. A number of technology improvements are combining to make storage disaggregation a reality. These include: * Modern server performance: due to PCIe Gen 4, many servers can deliver more than 8GB/sec of throughput, which far exceeds traditional storage networking performance capabilities. * The shift toward NVMe: The shift from disk to SAS/SATA flash, and now NVMe flash, puts pressure on servers and networks alike. A single NVMe drive delivers millions of IOPS, far beyond the usual capabilities of conventional storage networking. * 10Gb/25Gb/40Gb/100Gb Ethernet. More and more data centers are replacing slower network connections, removing bandwidth limitations and bottlenecks. Protocols like NVMe-oF on these very high bandwidth connections take full advantage of network improvements, removing bottlenecks, boosting performance and reducing latency. Different levels of storage disaggregation functionality exist, with the most flexible, full disaggregation, enabling storage capacity and/or performance to be provisioned from any storage device to any server on the network, then expanded, shrunk, or reprovisioned as new requirements emerge.

Siddiq started selling drugs around the age of 14 and was imprisoned at the age of 19 for trafficking in cocaine. He served 6 years of a 15 year sentence in the Ruben M. Torres Unit in Hondo, Texas. It was during his incarceration, while telling jokes to fellow inmates, that he discovered his ability to make people laugh. He worked in the prison's laundromat and his workmates were his captive audience. After his release from prison in 1997, Siddiq started doing stand-up at the Just Joking Comedy Cafe in Houston. His first stage appearance was during the comedy club's Apollo Night, which tended to attract a college crowd. Siddiq was booed on his first occasion on stage because he was wearing a suit. He decided to wait a couple of weeks before trying again while wearing jeans and a t-shirt. Siddiq became the co-host of the Apollo Night show a month later. Career Siddiq's stand- up comedy tends to be in the storytelling style, versus the more common setup/punch-line style. Siddiq's sets involve stories from his personal life, as well his observations on current events, race and politics. Siddiq's first television appearance was in 2008 on HBO's Def Comedy Jam. In 2012 he appeared on BET's Comic View and also appeared at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal. In 2013 he was named Comedy Central's \\"#1 Comic to Watch\\". In 2015 he appeared on the Comedy Central web and television series This is Not Happening and told his story of a prison riot where he learned the meaning of the phrase \\"Mexican got on boots!\\" The video of this story received 5 million hits on YouTube. Siddiq also appeared on AXS TV's Gotham Comedy Live (filmed at the Gotham Comedy Club) that same year. In 2016 he released his first half hour special on Comedy Central. In 2017 he began production on his one-hour special Ali Siddiq: It‚Äôs Bigger Than These Bars, which was filmed at the Bell County Jail in Belton, Texas. Released on Comedy Central in 2018, Siddiq can be seen performing in front of a group of inmates interspersed with scenes of him sitting down with smaller groups of incarcerated men and women in their cells, as well as with prison administrators. In 2019 Siddiq appeared on D.L. Hughley's late night talk show The D.L. Hughley Show, as well as the Comedy Central series This Week at the Comedy Cellar, in addition to being a finalist on the NBC comedy competition series Bring the Funny. Siddiq has released five comedy albums: Talking Loud Saying Something (Live at the Improv) released in 2010; Enjoy Your Life and Freedom of Speech, which were both released in 2013; Damaged Goods released in 2016 and The Prison Manual released in 2019. Philanthropy Since 2009 Siddiq has hosted the annual Jive Turkeys Comedy Show to raise money for the Houston Food Bank. The show is performed each November close to Thanksgiving. In 2017 he organized and performed at a benefit for Houstonians affected by Hurricane Harvey. In 2018 Siddiq also performed at an annual benefit held by Saba Homes, an orphanage organization created to help orphans of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake in Pakistan. Siddiq has also volunteered for Harris County‚Äôs Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Program.

Kilmer is a Republican politician who served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1998 to 2004, representing the 7th District. She unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2004 against Congressman Allen Boyd, and again for the Florida House in 2016. History Kilmer was born in Detroit, Michigan, and dropped out of high school to have a family. She later earned her GED and attended the Matrix Institute of Business, and moved to Florida in 1970. She became a hairdresser and opened up a chain of hair salons in Tallahassee, ultimately deciding to run for office after testifying against a proposed regulation that she thought would hurt hair stylists. Florida House of Representatives In 1998, Kilmer announced that she would run against incumbent Democratic State Representative Jamey Westbrook in the 7th District, which stretched from Miramar Beach to Marianna and Tallahassee. Shortly after Westbrook filed for re-election, he was indicted for defrauding a federal peanut quota program after he falsified farming quotas and federal disaster claims for farmers. Shortly afterwards, Westbrook's wife, Gayle Westbrook, also filed to run in the Democratic primary, and they announced that they would decide which of them would actually run for the seat. Ultimately, Gayle dropped out of the race, leaving Jamey Westbrook as the Democratic nominee. A contentious general election ensued in the ancestrally Democratic district, with Westbrook emphasizing his humble roots, and his innocence of the charges brought against him, by airing television advertisements showing him riding his tractor through his peanut fields‚Äîwhich inadvertently reminded voters of his looming indictment. In the end, Kilmer narrowly defeated Westbrook, 51‚Äì49%, winning by just 800 votes, which came from her sizable margins in Bay County, which she won 66‚Äì34%, and in Walton County, where she won 76‚Äì24%. Kilmer joined a Republican-dominated legislature and Republican Governor Jeb Bush, which was the first time that the state had been governed exclusively by Republicans since Reconstruction. When Kilmer ran for re-election in 2000, she was challenged by Westbrook, who was acquitted of the charges against him just weeks after he lost re-election in 1998. The state party targeted Kilmer for defeat, hoping that Westbrook's acquittal and the district's history of voting for Democrats would allow them to pick it up. However, Kilmer ended up expanding her margin of victory over Westbrook, defeating him 53‚Äì47% as the Florida Panhandle overwhelmingly backed George W. Bush over Al Gore in the presidential election. Kilmer sought a third and final term in the House in 2002, when she was opposed by businessman Cliff Thomas, the Democratic nominee. Despite Kilmer's close previous races, Thomas received little outside support and ultimately lost in a landslide, receiving only 41% of the vote to Kilmer's 59%. 2004 congressional campaign When U.S. Senator Bob Graham opted to run for President rather than seek re-election, Congressman Allen Boyd, who represented the 2nd District, considered running to replace Graham. If Boyd vacated the seat, Republicans were bullish on their chances of replacing him, and began recruiting Kilmer to run for the seat. Though Boyd ultimately declined to run for the Senate, Kilmer nonetheless jumped in the race. She joined the race with significant support from the Republican establishment, with First Lady Laura Bush, House Speaker Dennis Hastert and NRCC Chair Tom Reynolds coming to the district to host fundraisers on Kilmer's behalf. Kilmer was able to keep relative financial parity with Boyd, raising $1 million to Boyd's $1.6 million, and had influential figures in the Republican Party come to the district to campaign for her. Boyd ran a television advertisement accusing Kilmer of voting to provide her husband's company, All-Tech Southeast, with a $600,000 grant from the state Department of Community Affairs, which prompted All-Tech to file a lawsuit against Boyd for defamation of character. Meanwhile, Kilmer attracted criticism for copying her answers to an AARP questionnaire from materials distributed by the NRCC, which prompted an internal investigation on Kilmer's campaign as to how the copying had occurred. By the end of the campaign, however, observers predicted that Boyd had a clear advantage, which was ultimately borne out on Election Day, when Boyd defeated Kilmer in a landslide, winning 62% of the vote to her 38%. After the House After losing her 2004 congressional campaign and leaving the State House, Kilmer took a job as a grants administrator for the Florida Department of Education. When Kilmer's successor in the State House, David Coley, passed away from liver cancer in 2005, Kilmer considered running to succeed him in the special election that followed, but ultimately deferred to Coley's widow, Marti Coley, who ended up winning the seat. In 2016, Kilmer announced that she would challenge State Representative Brad Drake, who eventually succeeded Coley in Kilmer's old seat, in the Republican primary. An early poll showed Drake with a wide lead over Kilmer, who was largely unknown by the district's Republican voters. As the primary drew closer, Kilmer came under fire in local news coverage for whether she met the constitutional residency requirements. Kilmer had, ostensibly, moved to Texas, where she had registered to vote and cast ballots in several elections, which would have made her ineligible to run for the legislature until the following year. Kilmer, however, argued that she and her husband had maintained property in the district and that she was being \\"singled out because I'm the outsider.\\" In the end, however, Kilmer lost her comeback bid by an overwhelming margin, receiving only 26% of the vote to Drake's 76%, and winning none of the counties in her former district.

Early life Khan was born on 10 March 1991 in Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom, to Pakistani immigrant parents. He attended Haywood High School. Khan spent some part of his teenage years in Pakistan. According to the British Parliament's Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation 2013 report, Khan travelled to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan before his arrest in December 2010. Khan dropped out of school and preached for al- Muhajiroun. He became a community organiser, helping to put together a sharia law conference in 2009. 2008 anti-terror raids Khan's home in Stoke-on- Trent was raided by counter-terrorist police in 2008. Khan was interviewed by the BBC in 2008, when he denied being a terrorist; he issued the same denials to a local paper using a false name. He was 17 at the time. Following a 20-month investigation, it was determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with a crime. 2010 arrest and 2012 terrorism conviction Following his recent return from Pakistan, Khan was one of a group of nine men arrested in 2010 who were the focus of MI5's anti-terror Operation Guava and all pleaded guilty in 2012 to Al-Qaeda-inspired terrorism offences, which included plans to bomb the London Stock Exchange, the Houses of Parliament, the US embassy, two rabbis at two synagogues, the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, the home of then London Mayor Boris Johnson, build a terrorist training camp in land Khan's family owns in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, attending terrorism related operational meetings, preparing to travel abroad, and assisting others in travelling abroad for terrorist activities. Khan, like all the others, envisioned returning to the UK from their Kashmiri training camp, together with future recruits, to engage in unspecified terror attacks. Khan proposed to raise funds in the UK as opposed to overseas, arguing supporters in the UK earn in a day what donors in Kashmir earn in a month. He added: \\"On Jobseeker's Allowance we can earn that, never mind working for that.\\" His home bugged by MI5, he was recorded calling non-Muslims \\"dogs.\\" Following his arrest, Khan admitted travelling to the plotter's 2010 tactical meetings in Cardiff in November and in Newport in December. Khan's plans to build a terror-training camp in Kashmir never materialised and \\"there was no evidence that there was any real funding to build it\\". The group had formed in October. The terror network's organisational chart was found in Khan's home. In addition to confessing to terrorism planning, Khan admitted terrorism fundraising and possession of the Al Qaeda magazine Inspire. Following his arrest, Khan was known as an expert in field craft; his cell was described as having \\"well developed field craft\\" in court documents. Khan received an indeterminate sentence in 2012 with a minimum term of eight years. At sentencing, the judge said that Khan and his Stoke-on-Trent associates were \\"more serious jihadis\\" who operated \\"at a higher level of efficacy and commitment than the rest\\", the other six convicts.  Rehabilitation and release from prison  Under the indeterminate sentence, Khan would have remained in prison for as long as it was felt necessary to keep the public safe. However, Khan's original sentence was quashed. Along with Nazam Hussain and Mohammed Shahjahan, also from Stoke, Khan appealed against the sentences and had the indeterminate sentences dropped by the Court of Appeal in 2013. The appeal panel, headed by Lord Justice Leveson, found the original decision had \\"wrongly characterised\\" the three men as more dangerous than the other defendants. Khan's sentence was changed to a 16-year term which allowed him to be automatically released after serving eight years. Khan was allowed to leave Belmarsh Prison on temporary release licence in December 2018. Following his release, Stafford Borough Council provided suitable accommodation for Khan, though the Ministry of Justice said \\"multiple agencies\\" were involved in his housing. During his time under custody, Khan completed the Healthy Identity Intervention Programme, which later became the UK's principal rehabilitation scheme for terrorism convicts. Following Khan's release, he participated in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, which is designed to \\"address the root causes of terrorism\\". He was considered a \\"success story\\" for a Cambridge University rehabilitation programme, and was featured as a case study. Khan had been \\"befriended and helped\\" by Cambridge University rehabilitation employees, whom he later murdered. The Times reported that Cambridge University was considering admitting Khan as an undergraduate. In April 2020, the CTC Sentinel published a paper over the extent to which fear of recidivism was \\"overblown\\". It described Khan and another recent terrorism recidivist as \\"eye-catching outliers\\", arguing that less than 5% of terrorists such as Khan attack again. 2019 attack The terms of Khan's temporary release licence did not allow for travel to London, special permission would have been needed for him to participate in Cambridge University's Learning Together \\"Five Year Celebration\\" on the day he perpetrated the stabbing. Khan sat quietly during the celebration event, attending storytelling and writing workshops; he gave feedback on one. He then stabbed two Learning Together organisers in the chest, killing them, and injured three other people. He was wearing an electronic tag and a fake suicide jacket when he was shot following the stabbing. Burial and aftermath Following his death, Khan's body was taken to a mosque in Birmingham, for a ritual janazah Muslim funerary ceremony. The body was then flown to Islamabad. Khan's burial took place in Kajlani in Kashmir. \\"Usman Khan Call 4 Justice\\" graffiti in support of Khan appeared in multiple walls in his Stoke hometown in the week following his death. Links to terror group Khan had previously been connected to Al-Muhajiroun, the group led by Anjem Choudary. He was said to be inspired by Al-Qaeda. Khan's solicitor Vajahat Sharif claimed that Khan had become disillusioned with Al- Muhajiroun and that during his prison sentence he had repeatedly requested the help of a deradicaliser, to no avail. Sharif said that in 2018 Khan appeared to be rehabilitated, and that he may have been \\"re-groomed\\" by extremists after his release.  Political and social debate  In 2012, after being convicted of offences related to a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange, Khan was sentenced to be kept in prison for an indeterminate time. This meant that he could not be released whilst he was still considered to be a danger to the public. Following an appeal in 2013, his indeterminate sentence was quashed, and in its place he was given a 16-year prison sentence, which meant he would be entitled to automatic release on licence after having served eight years. Questions were also raised about the level of monitoring he was subject to by the authorities responsible after his release. The Parole board confirmed that it had no involvement in deciding when Khan was released from prison, saying Khan \\"appears to have been released automatically on licence\\" even though he had a \\"serious long-term plan\\" and a commitment to terrorism. Chris Phillips, former head of the UK National Counter Terrorism Security Office, commented the justice system was \\"playing Russian roulette\\" with the lives of the public. Phillips commented that the original trial judge \\"wanted this man in prison for a very very long time\\", and described Khan's release as \\"quite incredible\\". Paul Gibson, former head of counter-terrorism at the UK Ministry of Defence, supported the criticism, commenting on the release: ‚ÄúA lot of people will find that extraordinary.‚Äù References Category:1991 births Category:2019 deaths Category:21st-century English criminals Category:English Islamists Category:English male criminals Category:English murderers Category:English people of Azad Kashmiri descent Category:Criminals from Staffordshire Category:Deaths in Greater London Category:Male murderers Category:People convicted on terrorism charges Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United Kingdom Category:People from Stoke-on- Trent Category:British people of Pakistani descent Category:People educated at Haywood Academy ","title":"Usman Khan (terrorist)"},{"id":"62463715","text":"The Summerville Depot, at 120 E.

He established large cattle stations around Cloncurry and participated in several massacres of Aborginal Australians who were resident to this area. Kennedy was also involved in the creation of the copper mining industry in this region. In later life he became interested in aviation and was a founding investor and director of the Qantas airline company. Kennedy became the first passenger to fly on a regular air service route for the Qantas airline. Early life Alexander Kennedy was born in Dunkeld, Scotland in 1837 to parents John Kennedy and Christina Duff. As an adolescent, he worked as a farm labourer on the nearby Glen Ogle estate. At the age of 23, he signed up to a migration scheme that facilitated the emigration of Scottish locals to the British colony of Queensland. Central Queensland Kennedy arrived at port of Gladstone, Queensland in 1861. He found work on sheep stations located on the Dawson River and later at Wealwandangie. He was tasked with overseeing blackbirded South Sea Islander labourers whom he thrashed with a stockwhip when they refused to work. When the wool industry collapsed in the early 1870s, Kennedy attempted to grow sugarcane on a property near Rockhampton. This also failed and Kennedy returned to managing and purchasing sheep stations, this time near the town of Tambo. In 1876 he decided to sell out of the area with the view of establishing cattle stations in the far north-west of Queensland, which was yet to be colonised by the British. Cloncurry region In 1878, Kennedy with his family and business partners, drove a large mob of cattle 1,127 kilometres from Rockhampton to his newly selected property on Suleiman Creek located between Boulia and Cloncurry. Aboriginal Australians living in the region immediately began defending their lands by killing four cattlemen at Woonamo waterhole on Suleiman Creek. Armed groups of Native Police and British settlers, including Kennedy, went on a number of punitive expeditions after this event, where they \\"speedily shot\\" down native people as they encountered them. As was the custom at the time, Kennedy also took young Aboriginal boys from the native camps to utilise them as servants. In this period Kennedy established a number of cattle stations in the Cloncurry area including Buckingham Downs, Noranside and Bushy Park. In 1882 he took up another large parcel of land to the northwest of Cloncurry which he named Calton Hills. Again he used force against local Aboriginals to acquire the land and led at least two missions to destroy local native camps. Kennedy quickly obtained a reputation for \\"shooting blacks\\" with the noted Cloncurry prospector and explorer Ernest Henry admonishing his actions. Despite his own efforts, Kennedy was not able to fully negate Aboriginal resistance at Calton Hills and travelled to Brisbane to meet with the Queensland Police Commissioner, David Thompson Seymour, where he demanded more action toward the removal of Aboriginal people from his property. Seymour promised Kennedy that more patrols would be undertaken by the Native Police in the region and also indicated that Kennedy could continue with his own punitive expeditions in the meantime. Conflict continued with the local Kalkadoon and Maithakari people at Calton Hills, and in 1884 Kennedy's business partner, James White Powell, was killed. Kennedy, together with sub-inspector Frederic Urquhart of the Native Police and his troopers, conducted a large, month long punitive mission resulting in a number of massacres of Aboriginal people. Kennedy and Urquhart became close associates with Kennedy participating in later Native Police patrols which eventually subdued Aboriginal resistance in the area. By 1892, Kennedy had established another cattle property near Cloncurry which he named Devoncourt and ran a total of nearly 30,000 head of cattle on his combined land holdings. He became a member of Cloncurry's first council while his son discovered a large copper deposit south of the town in 1897 which was sold to a mining company for ¬£15,000. Kennedy continued his profitable enterprises in the region until he retired with his wife to Brisbane in 1919. Qantas Alexander Kennedy (in aircraft) just before the first Qantas passenger flight In later life, Kennedy became keenly interested in aviation and in 1920 he was convinced by Hudson Fysh and other founders of Qantas to become a provisional director and initial investor in the fledgling airline company. On 3 November 1922, at the age of 84, Kennedy became the first paying customer on a scheduled Qantas passenger service, flying from Longreach to Cloncurry. Death Alexander Kennedy died in Brisbane on 12 April 1936. Kennedy's and his wife's ashes were transported by a Qantas aircraft from Brisbane to his Devoncourt property near Cloncurry where they were interred a monument.

It had operated since 1925 as KFXY, based in Flagstaff, becoming KUMA and moving to Yuma in 1932. As a result of an unauthorized transfer of control of the radio station, the Federal Communications Commission ordered its license revoked in 1939 and the station off air as of February 1, 1940. History KFXY in Flagstaff KUMA traces its roots to the first radio station to broadcast from Flagstaff, Arizona, KFXY, which went on air December 10, 1925. KFXY operated with 25 watts from facilities backstage at the Orpheum Theater; it was put on the air by Mary M. Costigan, who was the first woman to be a licensed radio broadcaster in the state. At the time she obtained the license, national newspapers in the United States claimed that Costigan was thus the only woman known to own a radio station anywhere in the world. After being moved from its initial frequency assignment of 1460 kHz to 1420 kHz under General Order 40 in 1928, the station relocated its facilities to room 105 of the Hotel Monte Vista in 1929. Costigan sold the station to Albert H. Schermann of Flagstaff; the license was assigned to Schermann on July 28, 1931. The sale came the same year that Costigan left town, afraid she would witness another family death after her father and brother both died in Flagstaff. Long-distance move On February 3, 1932, KFXY filed for a construction permit to move its facilities from Flagstaff to Yuma, a relocation spanning . The May 31, 1932 Radio Service Bulletin announced that KFXY's call letters had been changed to KUMA, which it began using upon commencing broadcasts from Yuma on June 22. Schermann sold an interest in KUMA to E. B. Sturdivant, the operator of movie theaters in Yuma and Somerton, in February 1934, and in June 1935, Sturdivant took outright control of the radio station. Under Sturdivant, the station commissioned a new, taller tower in 1937, built at a cost of $20,000 by D. H. Harrel of Chicago. License revocation On February 20, 1939, the Federal Communications Commission announced that it was revoking KUMA's license due to false statements made by Schermann in his application to renew it. The FCC claimed that Schermann‚Äîwho was still the licensee‚Äîhad certified that he was in control, though Sturdivant had been operating the station for five years. KUMA was ordered off the air by April 1 unless it asked for a hearing, in which case the outcome was stayed. Ahead of the July 24 hearing, Sturdivant filed to take control of the KUMA facilities itself, while the Yuma Broadcasting Company, 45 percent owned by KTAR radio of Phoenix, filed to build a station at 1210 kHz. The application from KTAR was significant, as KUMA was a supplementary member of its Arizona Broadcasting Company statewide chain. The station also suffered through the collapse of its transmitter tower in early June, causing $5,000 in damage. The hearing was held on December 1, 1939, before FCC hearing examiner Paul Walker. At the hearing, Schermann's lawyer indicated that he was willing to relinquish the license because the station had been an unprofitable venture and the new Yuma station application, taking the KYUM call letters, had been accepted, but he requested that KUMA be allowed to remain in operation until KYUM was ready to sign on. The financial difficulties had led to Schermann suing E. B. and E. N. Sturdivant in Yuma County court that July to recover $8,000 in equipment and other property, a lawsuit Schermann won. In a newspaper advertisement that served as a notice to creditors, E. B. Sturdivant announced that he had sold his remaining interest in KUMA to Schermann effective November 11, 1939. On January 25, 1940, the FCC announced it had upheld the revocation order and ordered KUMA off the air February 1. It additionally denied Schermann the authority to keep the station running until KYUM was ready to broadcast.

Description  E. coryi is a Gymnosperm and a member of the Gnetophyta. E. coryi is a perennial shrub. Plant height ranges from 1‚Äì3 ft. The man photosynthetic structures of E. coryi are the stems, as is typical of the genus. The stems are thin and green with thicker, hardened bases covered in dark brown bark. Internodes are 1‚Äì5 mm in length. As a gymnosperm, E. coryi produces cones. The female cones are about 4‚Äì6 mm long and typically appear orange or yellow when mature. The cones grow on bare peduncles 7‚Äì15 mm in length and produce two smooth brown oval-shaped seeds. Cone maturation occurs from March to April. The plant forms conic terminal buds 1‚Äì3 mm in length. Mature female cones are sometimes mistaken for flowers at a distance, as they appear in groups of several cones at stem joints. E. coryi is similar to, and may be confused with the more common E. aspera, but E. coryi has two seeds per in each cone while E. aspera only has one.  Distribution  Ephedra coryi is found in the southern continental United States. Native populations can be found growing in the county of Socorro, New Mexico, and several counties in Texas including; Andrews, Dawson, Ector, Gaines, Howard, Loving, Lubbock, Midland, Terry, Ward, and Winkler. This species is well-suited to arid environments and is capable of surviving in rocky, thin-soil areas including mesas.  Ecology  This species is a rhizomatous shrub. It is found growing in nutrient scarce soils, such as sandy soils, rocky cliffs, dunes, semi-arid grassland prairies, and \\"shinneries\\" (dense thickets) of scrub oak.  Conservation status  Cory's joint-fir is considered a rare plant due to its restricted geographic range. The IUCN Red List classifies this species as one of Least-concern because there are currently no threats facing the known populations. Their population numbers are classified as stable. While this plant is rare, it is not considered endangered by the terms of the IUCN Red List. NatureServe, a non-profit organization that assesses the conservation status of plants (amongst other things), lists the conservation status of E. coryi as G3N3, meaning it is vulnerable globally and nationally. It is listed as S3 in Texas, meaning it is considered vulnerable in that state as well. New Mexico has not listed the same vulnerable conservation status. Additionally, in a 2011 meeting, the New Mexico Rare Plant Technical Council (NMRPTC) determined that Cory's joint-fir did not meet their organization's standards for \\"rare\\" classification. For ex situ (off-site) conservation methods to be employed, a seed collection would need to be conducted. IUCN has noted that no known seed collections have been made in recent years, making it unlikely that such methods will be utilized in the near future.

The forerunners of the United Firefighters Union of South Australia broke away from the union in the early 1970s after being dissatisfied with their representation. In 1974, the union faced scandal when its secretary was charged and acquitted of eight counts of fraud. The charges led to a bitter internal dispute which included a legal battle and a physical brawl at a union meeting and threatened to spill over into internal state Labor politics.

Venod Skantha, a 30-year-old Dunedin doctor, was subsequently charged with her murder. The trial of Skantha commenced in 4 November 2019 at the Dunedin High Court on a charge of murder and four counts of threatening to kill. On 26 November 2019, Skantha was found guilty of all charges. In 2020 he was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum non-parole term of 19 years. Background Amber-Rose Rush was a 16-year-old from the Dunedin suburb of Corstorphine. Her family described her as a talented artist who had drawn her own tattoo. She also had ambitions of becoming a police officer. According to a media report, she had recently left school to start work as a supermarket checkout operator. On 3 February 2018, Amber-Rose Rush's mother Lisa Ann Rush, her partner Brendon MacNee, and older brother Jayden Rush had found the Dunedin teenager dead in her own bedroom. In court, Jayden recalled that he had knocked on her door after midnight but did not get a response from her and assumed she was asleep. The family subsequently contacted the police. Investigation The Police cordoned off the property and carried out a forensic scene examination over the weekend. Emergency services also searched a nearby Dunedin quarry as part of the investigation into her death. Police officers also searched a nearby pond at Blackhead Quarry. They also sought to speak to anyone who have visited the quarry or beach area between 11.30pm on February 2 and 12.30am on February 3. Police also took an interest in the a dark-coloured vehicle believed to be a Toyota Camry, which was parked in the car park at Blackhead Quarry. As part of their investigation, the Police drained a swamp at Blackhead Quarry, from which they recovered Amber-Rose's Huawei cellphone. The phone was replicated and its contents was later used as evidence by the Crown. Suspect The sole suspect was Venod Skantha, who at the time of Amber- Rose Rush's death had worked as a house officer at the Dunedin Public Hospital, which is managed by the Southern District Health Board. According to media reports, the Malaysian-born Skantha had previously lived in Auckland's North Shore suburb with his parents. He studied medicine at the University of Auckland. In mid-2016, Skantha started his medical career at Southland Hospital in Invercargill before transferring to the Dunedin Public Hospital the following year. According to media reports, Skantha and Amber-Rose knew each other. While living in Dunedin, Skantha had socialized with young people including teenagers, to whom he supplied drugs and alcohol. He also gained a reputation for alcoholism and erratic attention-seeking behaviour. Skantha sought relationships with several women and girls, reportedly fondling them and offering money for sex. Prior to Amber-Rose's death, Skantha had reportedly faced dismissal from the Dunedin Public Hospital for being drunk while performing an procedure and negligent behaviour. However, he had escaped dismissal by claiming that his mother had died, which turned out to be untrue. Amber-Rose was part of Skantha's Dunedin social circle but relations between the two had deteriorated by early February 2018. According to the Crown, the victim had threatened during a heated exchange on February 2, 2019, to report Skantha to his employers and the authorities for molesting teenagers, offering them money for sex and supplying them with alcohol during a heated Instagram exchange. The Crown argued that the defendant had hired a teenage friend to drive him to Amber-Rose's house where he murdered her in order to prevent her from reporting him to the authorities. The witness had later cleaned Skantha's silver BMW and shoes but afterwards reported him to the police. Legal proceedings Pre-trial On 5 February 2018, Venod Skanta appeared in the Dunedin District Court and was charged with the murder of Amber-Rose. The accused was given interim name suppression but was identified as a registered junior doctor who was popular with teenagers. On 21 May, Skantha was identified as the suspect after the Court of Appeal declined his application for name suppression. In addition, the defendant was also charged with four counts of threatening to kill. On 23 May, Skantha was also charged with indecent sexual assault. In August 2018, Skantha dismissed his Auckland-based defence lawyer Mark Ryan in favour of the Christchurch-based Jonathan Eaton. That same month, Skantha's application for electronically-monitored bail was denied by the Dunedin High Court. In September 2018, that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. On 15 August, Skantha appealed to the Court of Appeal for bail. The defendant had been remanded into custody at the Otago Corrections Facility in Milton in the Otago Region. In early September 2018, the Court of Appeal dismissed Skantha's appeal against the refusal of bail. On 22 November 2018, Skantha appeared via video link in the Dunedin High Court to discuss pre-trial issues. On 17 January 2019, the Dunedin High Court dismissed Skantha's bid to have his trial moved out of Dunedin. Following a hearing held in March 2019, Skantha was denied bail a fourth time on 2 April 2019. Skantha's application for bail had been denied by the Dunedin High Court and the Court of Appeal three times. Trial The trial of Venod Skantha commenced on 4 November 2019 before Justice Gerald Nation and a jury of ten men and two women. The Crown prosecutor Richard Smith said that Amber-Rose Rush was part of a group of teenagers that Skantha had befriended and supplied alcohol and drugs. The Crown argued that Skantha had allegedly indecently assaulted Amber-Rose in early 2018 and claimed that he had murdered her in order to prevent her from informing the authorities, which would have ended his medical career. The Crown also said that Skantha had gotten a 16-year-old friend (who has name suppression) to drive him to Amber-Rose's house so that he could murder her. The Crown said that blood likely to belong to Amber-Rose had been found in the defendant's silver BMW, a plastic bag containing the defendant's clothes, and a pair of shoes found at the defendant's girlfriend's house in Balclutha. Skantha's defence lawyer Jonathan Eaton QC disputed the Crown's evidence, claiming that his client did not know the layout of the Rush home. During the first week, the forensic pathologist Dr Kate White, who conducted the autopsy on Amber-Rose, testified that the victim had died from an 11 cm-long incised wound to the left side of her neck, which penetrated her carotid artery and windpipe, causing her to bleed to death. Jurors were provided with photos depicting Amber-Rose's body. White also testified that the victim had sustained stab wounds to the back of her neck and two \\"superficial\\" horizontal cuts to her throat. Defence lawyer Eaton asked White whether she could verify that the attack was left or right-handed. The Crown also presented CCTV photos of a car matching Skantha's silver BMW traveling on the route to Amber-Rose's house on the night of her death and social media communication between the defendant and Amber-Rose prior to the alleged murder. Amber-Rose's older sister Shantelle also testified that she had warned her younger sister against the idea of moving into Skantha's home, believing that he was planning to sexually groom her. Amber-Rose's boyfriend Kristin Clark also testified that Amber-Rose had sent him screenshots of her messages with Skantha. On 6 November, the Crown said that Skantha had burnt his bloodstained clothes in a large terracotta pot at his girlfriend Brigid Clinton's home in Balclutha. Skantha's former girlfriend Brigid Clinton testified that Skantha had visited Amber-Rose's grieving mother, initially suggesting her daughter's death was a suicide before naming some potential suspects. Clinton also testified that Skantha had been agitated and anxious following Amber-Rose's death, wounding himself with a samurai sword shortly before they were questioned by Police on 4 February 2018. On 11 November, the Crown's star witness, the teenager who had accompanied Skantha during the time of the alleged murder, testified that Skantha's clothes had been bloodstained. He also told the Court that the defendant had admitted killing Amber-Rose, and had also taken her cellphone and driver's license. He testified that the pair had driven to Blackhead Quarry to dispose of Amber-Rose's phone before heading to Skantha's Fairfield home where the alleged clean-up began. The teenager claimed that he had deliberately done a sloppy cleaning job in order to leave a trail of evidence for the police, including a blood stain on Skantha's grey suede shoes. The witness also testified that they had then driven to Clinton's house in Balclutha where Skantha allegedly burned his bloodstained clothes. The witness admitted being a \\"compulsive liar\\" but maintained that his account of the events were true. The Crown has also earlier claimed that Skantha had threatened to kill the teenager. During cross-examination, defence lawyer Eaton QC accused the teenage witness of killing Amber-Rose, citing his estranged relationship with the victim and his knowledge of her house layout. During the second week of the trial, Crown witness ESR (Institute of Environmental Science and Research) scientist Timothy Power testified that blood found on the defendant's suede shoes and car window were 800,000 million times more likely to have originated from Amber-Rose than anyone else. A mixed DNA profile belong to Skantha and Amber-Rose was also recovered from the inside passenger door. Defence lawyer Eaton QC accused the Crown's teenage witness of planting the evidence on the shoe in order to frame the doctor. In addition, Amber-Rose's blood was found in a bag containing the defendant's clothes. None of the defendant's DNA was found in Amber-Rose's room. On 18 November, Detective Constable Amy Stewart, who had posed as a friend of the Rush family, testified that Skantha did not appear upset when meeting with the Amber-Rose's mother Lisa-Ann following her daughter's death to offer his condolences. She also testified that Skantha had suggested other possible suspects including her step-father and an ex-boyfriend who had broken Amber- Rose's arm. On 19 November, two female Crown witnesses alleged that the defendant had groped them. That same day, Skantha's former supervisor, Southern District Health Board chief medical officer Dr Nigel Millar, testified that Skantha had lied about his mother's death in order to escape being dismissed from his employment for drinking while working and negligence. On 22 November, the Crown played Skantha's police interview in court. During the interview, Skantha claimed that Amber-Rose was a friend and denied killing her. On 26 November, the Crown and defence delivered their closing arguments to the court. Crown prosecutor Bates argued that Skantha had murdered the defendant to prevent Amber-Rose from exposing his indiscretions to the authorities, which would have caused him to lose his career and lifestyle. Defence lawyer Eaton QC disputed the Crown's case, claiming that the Crown's teenage star witness was unreliable due to his habit of lying and that the Crown had failed to investigate whether the witness had murdered the defendant. During the trial, the defence did not produce any witnesses. On 26 November, Skantha was unanimously found guilty by the jury of murder and four counts of threatening to kill the Crown's witness and their family. The trial lasted three and a half weeks with the Crown calling 69 witnesses and presenting more than 1,000 pages of evidence. The verdict was welcomed by Amber-Rose's family including her father Shane Rush. The defendant was remanded into custody until 6 March 2020 for sentencing. On 6 March 2020, Skantha was sentenced to a life sentence with a non-parole term of 19 years in the Dunedin High Court. The sentence was welcomed by Rush's family including her father. Skantha has maintained his innocence and his lawyer Eaton announced that he would be appealing the verdict on the basis of a miscarriage of justice. Rush's family were upset that Skantha wore earplugs during the victim impact statement by her deceased mother and subsequent sentencing. He was not convicted of indecent assault. Reactions Amber Rose-Rush's family and friends held a funeral at Hope and Sons Chapel in South Dunedin. Several family members also got tattoos based on Amber's bird and flower design as a tribute to the late teenager. A \\"Givealittle\\" fundraiser page was also set up, which had raised NZ$8,445 by 14 February 2018. In 14 June 2018, a fake Instagram account of Amber-Rose was taken down after complaints from her family. That same month, it was reported that Amber-Rose's mother Lisa-Ann had died in an alleged suicide. In 10 November 2019, Radio New Zealand broadcaster Colin Peacock compared the media coverage of the Amber-Rose Rush murder trial to the Grace Millane murder trial, arguing that foreign media outlets' breaches of New Zealand name suppression orders in both cases threatened the fair trial rights for defendants. Similarly, an Otago Daily Times editorial published on 23 November argued that the Rush and Millane murder cases highlighted the fact that women were statistically more likely to be victims of violent crimes than men.

The debut novel was published on 18 June 2019 by Penguin Random House. It tells the story of a Manhattan couple undergoing a bitter divorce. Writing Brodesser-Akner was working as a staff writer at The New York Times during the writing of the novel. Its narrative style mirrors that of her celebrity profiles, by having the titular character's troubles presented through the eyes and ears of an intermediary, who has been seen as a stand-in for the author herself. She has stated that having the male as the center of the plot was a conscious decision so as to look at male sexuality from an outside perspective. The book has drawn comparisons to Philip Roth and John Updike, albeit from a feminist perspective. Brodesser-Akner has acknowledged the influence of those authors on her writing. Plot Toby, a 41-year-old hepatologist, is undergoing a bitter divorce from his wife Rachel, a successful talent agent in New York. One day, she drops off their children, 11-year-old Hannah and 9-year-old Solly, at Toby's house while he is still sleeping and takes off. She does not respond to texts or calls from him for the following weeks. The story, narrated by Toby's college friend Libby, a former writer for a men's magazine, follows their lives over this period and the events that led to the breakdown of their 14-year-marriage, as well as reflections of Libby's own life. Themes Fleishman Is in Trouble deals with the themes of gender roles, marriage and divorce, online dating, midlife crises, and class anxiety. The novel mocks the affluent Manhattan professional class and its pretensions while embracing their anxieties, especially those relating to marriage and gender. An underlying theme of the book is the relegation of women to the background in a male-centric society. At one point in the book, the narrator says that \\"the only way to get someone to listen to a woman [is] to tell her story through a man\\", which is what the book in itself does. The novel also deals with the nature of marriage and relationships, in particular the strain that arises in marriages in which the wife is the primary breadwinner. It has been seen as a larger commentary on marriage in modern America and the way in which it appears to strip people of their identities and force them into routines. Brodesser-Akner also parodies the app-based dating culture, from grammatically poor sexts to the names of dating apps (such as Hr, Choose, Forage and Reach). In particular, the novel focuses on the generation that got married before the advent of dating apps and who, upon divorcing, had to adjust to new dating practices. Reception The book received mostly positive reviews from critics. The Guardian called it an \\"an honest, powerful, human story with no apologies\\", while The Rolling Stone praised its \\"unsparing yet sympathetic depiction of the way we live now\\". The Washington Post opined that the novel \\"slices through the demeaning rules of the patriarchy just as effectively as she slays the fatuous optimism of that 'girl-power' propaganda fed to modern girls\\". The BBC praised its \\"enjoyable satirical touch\\", but found it \\"laborious to read and ultimately not very interesting\\". The Harvard Crimson panned its writing as \\"lazy\\" and further said that the book \\"rarely [shows] more than the various characters' selfish desires to run away from the lives they've willingly signed up for\\". Similarly, Kay S. Hymowitz also criticized the characterization in the book, commenting: \\"What's telling about our current cultural moment is that Rachel's shallow, snobbish status obsessions didn't attract any attention from the book's many reviewers; it's as if those obsessions are so obviously acceptable that they don't notice their corrupting effect. Instead, they endorsed the novel's supposed depiction of 'the impossible pressures that talented women endure'.\\" Honors and Awards The novel was selected for the longlist for the Women's Prize for Fiction 2020.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/womens-prize-for-fiction- lines-up-heavy-hitters-on-2020-longlist  References  Category:2019 American novels Category:Random House books Category:2019 debut novels ","title":"Fleishman Is in Trouble"},{"id":"62464330","text":"Carolyn M. Hansson (nee Russell; March 15, 1941) is a Canadian materials engineer. She was the first female student to attend the Royal School of Mines at Imperial College, London, and the first woman to graduate with a PhD in metallurgy from there. Hansson was honoured for pioneering a monitoring system for evaluating the integrity of concrete structures. Early life and education Hansson was born on March 15, 1941 in Hazel Grove, Cheshire, England. Growing up, she attended an all-girls school in England and applied for metallurgy at Imperial College. Upon being accepted, she was the first female student to attend the Royal School of Mines at Imperial College, London, and the first woman to graduate with a PhD in metallurgy from there. She was also only one of two women in the United Kingdom with a PhD in metallurgy. Career In 1976, Hansson joined AT&T; Bell Labs where she stayed four years before spending the following nine as a research scientist, and eventually as head of the Research Department, at the Danish Corrosion Centre. When her husband was extended a position in Maryland, Hansson accepted an appointment within the Martin Marietta‚Äôs Institute for Advanced Studies. In 1990, she became a professor and head of the Materials and Metallurgical Engineering Department at Queen's University and then joined the University of Waterloo in 1996 as Vice President of University Research. The following year, she was elected a Fellow of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society. Hansson was eventually replaced as VP by Paul Guild in 2001 after a five year term. Hansson's research focus is on the corrosion of steel inside concrete. She has identified techniques for measuring the amount of corrosion and also studies rust-resistant reinforcing materials. Hansson has worked as a consultant to the Ministry of Transportation Ontario and Alberta Transportation in corrosion monitoring of bridge structures. In 2005, Hansson resigned from Hydrogenics Corporation upon their acquisition of Stuart Energy.

Those affected often have neurological and skeletal abnormalities, as well as frequent urinary tract infections. Language and walking are usually delayed. Facial features include prominent, downturned ears, an open, downturned mouth and drooping eyelids (ptosis). The syndrome is caused by mutations in the HNRNPK gene, which codes for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K. This protein is involved in the process of DNA transcription and translation into proteins. A mutation in this gene impairs DNA transcription, disrupting some developmental processes. As an autosomal dominant disorder, only one faulty copy of the gene is required for the condition to occur. The syndrome is typically diagnosed based on the physical symptoms and then confirmed by genetic testing. Treatment has centred around the symptoms. Sign language and assistive language technology can aid communication. The prognosis is not yet fully known, due to the lack of patients in literature, however most of the patients have at least lived through childhood. The urinary system defects have been the most significant contributors to mortality. , 26 individuals worldwide were known to be affected. The syndrome was first described in 1997 by Nobuhiko Okamoto et al., and the gene responsible was first identified in 2015 by Ping-Yee Billie Au, Antonie D. Kline et al. In 2019, Okamoto proposed that Au‚ÄìKline syndrome and Okamoto syndrome were synonymous.  Signs and symptoms   Kidneys  Individuals with Okamoto syndrome are usually born with hydronephrosis, or dilation of the internal structures of the kidneys, due to narrowing (stenosis) of the passage between the kidneys and the ureters (the ureteropelvic junction), leading to a build-up of urine. There is also often vesicoureteral reflux, in which urine passes backwards from the bladder to the ureters, and frequent urinary tract infections.  Heart  Individuals with Okamoto syndrome are typically born with heart defects, which can include aortic valve stenosis, atrial or ventricular septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve or patent ductus arteriosus.  Physical features  The syndrome has a characteristic facial appearance which is similar to that of Kabuki syndrome, including prominent, downward-displaced ears that are underdeveloped, long eyelids, epicanthic folds, a short, broad nose, an open, downturned mouth and a deep groove in the midline of the tongue. Cleft palate occurs in about half of those affected. There is sometimes webbing of the neck or bulging eyes, and less commonly there is excessive hair on the forehead or other parts of the body or a unibrow. Individuals with the syndrome may also have a broad first toe and crowding of the toes, and at least two affected individuals have had polydactyly of the fifth digit (postaxial polydactyly). Some of those affected have had undescended testicles (cryptorchidism). A small minority of those affected have had congenital joint contractures such as club foot.  Neurological  Those with Okamoto syndrome typically have severe mental disability and are usually born with microcephaly. There are typically language and walking delays, and those affected have very low muscle tone and decreased reflexes. They may have neural tube defects such as lipomyelomeningocele (a form of spina bifida) or may have syringomyelia (a cyst in the spinal cord). Those with the syndrome may also have symptoms of dysautonomia (impairments in the autonomic nervous system), including gastrointestinal dysmotility, contributing to gastroesophageal reflux disease, or neurogenic bladder dysfunction, in which bladder control is limited. Dysautonomia has also led to high pain tolerance and reduced sweating in some patients. Some of those with the syndrome have been found to have an underdeveloped corpus callosum, the main band of white matter that connects the two cerebral hemispheres.  Skeletal  Okamoto syndrome patients often have skeletal problems such as scoliosis or hip dysplasia, which can lead to hip dislocation. They may be born with congenital vertebral anomalies; parts of the spine may be fused and fail to segment. There may also be extra vertebrae in the lower back. Some of those affected have been reported to have premature fusion of the skull bones (craniosynostosis), particularly those across the midline and at the front of the skull. This has led to an elongated skull shape known as scaphocephaly as well as a ridge on the forehead known as a metopic ridge.  Growth  Those affected may be born with low weight and size and may display stunted growth in childhood, although this symptom has been variable and not in every individual with Okamoto syndrome.  Hearing and eyesight  A minority of those with Okamoto syndrome have had hearing loss of both sensorineural and conductive types, and a smaller minority have had optic nerve abnormalities.  Cause  392x392px Okamoto syndrome is caused by a mutation in the HNRNPK gene, located on chromosome 9 at position q21.32. HNRNPK codes for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K. Ribonucleoproteins are proteins that form complexes with RNA, and they are involved in the transcription of DNA into RNA in the nucleus. They usually bind with precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), which is messenger RNA that has not yet had its introns removed during splicing to be ready for translation. A mutation in one of the two copies of HNRNPK results in defects in DNA transcription, and therefore some developmental processes are disrupted or not completed. Mutations in HNRNPK that have been reported include nonsense mutations, in which the protein is truncated and usually non-functional as a result, frameshift mutations, splice-site mutations and microdeletions encompassing the gene. Rarely, missense mutations, in which one amino acid in the protein is replaced by another, have also been reported. Deletions in the region encompassing HNRNPK have been found in the cells of acute myeloid leukemia in approximately 2% of cases. Acute myeloid leukemia cells are immature white blood cells (myeloblasts) that remain in the stem-cell stage, dividing continually. Additionally, a 2015 study found that a majority of mice who had one of their HNRNPK genes artificially knocked out developed myeloid cancers, with a third developing lymphoid cancers and 4% developing hepatocellular carcinomas. The mice were also smaller, had less developed organs and had higher postnatal mortality (30%). The median lifespan of the mice that survived was less than 50% that of wild-type mice. However, blood cancers had not yet been detected in any of the Okamoto syndrome patients . Mutations in both copies of HNRNPK are embryonic lethal in mice. Mice with both copies of the gene knocked out die before the 14th day of embryonic development.  Diagnosis  The condition has usually been diagnosed based on the physical symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing. Methods have included whole exome sequencing and comparative genomic hybridization (for microdeletions). Sanger sequencing can confirm the nature of the mutation.  Treatment  Treatment is focussed on the symptoms. Atrial or ventricular septal defects are usually treated with observation but can be surgically corrected in severe cases. Some patients have been able to use sign language or assistive language devices to facilitate communication.  Prognosis  The prognosis of the disorder is not yet fully known. A minority of patients have died in infancy due to complications from their urinary system defects, including infections in Okamoto's first two patients, however most have lived through childhood and into adolescence. Motor and language skills typically improve as the patient ages. The prognosis in adulthood is not yet known, due to the lack of known patients in this age group. As an autosomal dominant condition, there is little risk of recurrence in future conceptions from unaffected parents. However, there is a slight possibility (around 1%) due to germline mosaicism, a phenomenon in which some sperm cell precursors have the mutation and others don't. Genetic counselling may be offered for this.  Epidemiology  The prevalence of the disorder is as yet unknown. , 26 individuals worldwide were known to be affected, with 13 of these reported in literature, mostly from 2010 to 2019.  History  Okamoto syndrome was first described in 1997 by Nobuhiko Okamoto et al. from the Department of Medical Genetics at Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital after observing very similar symptoms and physical features in two unrelated Japanese infants. Both infants had congenital hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction stenosis, low muscle tone, developmental delay and characteristic facial features including an open mouth and low-set ears. Au‚ÄìKline syndrome was first described in 2015 by Ping-Yee Billie Au, Antonie D. Kline et al. after mutations in HNRNPK were found in two individuals with similar symptoms at their respective practices in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The practices were united with each other after both submitted the gene as a candidate to the online service GeneMatcher, which matched them together and allowed them to confirm the syndrome. In 2019, Okamoto proposed that Au‚ÄìKline syndrome and Okamoto syndrome were synonymous, because a mutation in the HNRNPK gene had been found in a new Okamoto syndrome patient, and the symptoms were virtually identical.

Ismail rose from delivering newspapers as a boy to become the CEO of Singapore's largest real estate company, PropNex. Career After he left army, Ismail was in insurance briefly before starting a real estate business, Nooris Consultants, with his wife on 1 January 1996. He dealt mainly in the Malay-Muslim property market with about 250 agents and about $10 million in annual revenue. To compete and develop further, he decided he had to merge with big players who dealt with other communities, and formed a partnership with the founders of Prulink Realty in 1999 called First Class Consultants. In 15 July 2000, together with three other companies, he formed PropNex. However, within six months, the conglomeration collapsed due to differences among the partners. Two partners pulled out and in 2004, he bought the other two companies and became the sole proprietor of PropNex. By 2019, his company's agents rose from 1,000 to the current 8,400 agents or more, the biggest in Singapore, and it has also branched out to Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Personal life Ismail is the third son of Abdul Gafoor, a Tamil from Kudavasal in Tamil Nadu. His father came to Singapore penniless in 1945 at the age of 17 and ventured into various small businesses, including distributing newspapers. Ismail grew up in a one-room rental flat in Lengkok Bahru, where his father set up his shop. From age seven, he would get up 4.30 every morning to deliver newspapers before going to school and then help out in his father's shop in the evening. During Ismail's National Service, his army buddy revealed that his uncle had sold a property along Cavenagh Road and made a profit of about $250,000. It was then that he decided that he wanted to own properties, believing that owning a property is the best way to be successful. In 1983, he signed up as an army regular for another six years as he did well in the army and was recognised. He met his wife Nooraini in the army. He extended his contract with the army for another two years. Later, he was offered a retirement pension of $1 million if he signed on full-time. In 1995, at the age of 32, he quit his army career at the rank of Colonel (COL).

The Vancouver Police Pipe Band is a Canadian pipe band based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is the official police band of the Vancouver Police Department and is considered to be the official band of the City of Vancouver. It performs for all citywide, provincial, national and international events available to them. Like many pipe bands in the British and Canadian Army, they performs in full highland dress which includes a feather bonnet. It is the oldest non-military pipe band in British Columbia and ranks amongst the most senior police pipe bands in Canada. In its international visits, it has performed in countries such as Singapore, Japan, and the United States. History Unit history The band's foundation in June 1914 occurred at the opening of the new police station on Cordova Street, during which a handful of pipers within the department were mobilized to play for the opening ceremonies. As a result, Chief Constable Malcolm MacLennan authorized the formation of a departmental pipe band. At the time, it was one of a handful of police musical units in the world. In its history, it has recorded three compilations including The Pipe Band (1978), Music in Motion (1983), and 90 Years on the Beat (2004). Performance timeline The band during the Rogers Santa Claus Parade in 2011. The band in police coats during parade in 2012. *November 1963 - The band was touring Hawaii when the Assassination of John F. Kennedy occurred. In honour of the late President of the United States, they covered their drums in black cloth and joined a military band during a tribute the day after. As a show of appreciation, his successor Lyndon B. Johnson inspected the band during his visit to Vancouver the following year. *February 1991 - The band paid a return visit to Honolulu, during which the then-Mayor Frank Fasi declared 15 February as \\"Vancouver Police Pipe Band Day\\". The visit was also used to pay tribute to the US troops and the troops of the international coalition who died during the Gulf War. *September 2010 - The band took part in the Canadian Naval Centennial Tattoo in Pacific Coliseum celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy. Among the bands it performed alongside included the Band of the Royal Marines, the Pipe Band of The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada and the Naden Band of Maritime Forces Pacific. *May‚ÄìJune 2014 - The band stayed in London, the capital of the United Kingdom to take part in events in the city, including performing at the changing of the Queen's Guard at the forecourt Buckingham Palace as well as Windsor Palace. The visit took two years of coordination with the Household Division and was part of the celebrations of the band's centennial year. It was the first time a non-military pipe band had performed during the ceremony. During the guard mounting proceedings, the band drum major was acconpanied by Maurice Brown of the Pipes and Drums of the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards. It also played at Royal Chelsea Hospital and the beating retreat on Horse Guards Parade. The visit saw a contingent that included a range of ages and even included 2 members from Washington state in the United States. *12-17 April 2019 - The band takes part in a tour of India to commemorate 100 years of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. It was the Constable Sukhi Sunger, who was the first Sikh member of the band. During the tour, it visited Amritsar, Nawanshahar and Chandigarh. In Amritsar, the band performed at the Golden Temple (also known as Harmandir Sahib) and Guru Nanak Dev University. At a mall in Chandigarh, it performed Sare Jahan se Accha, which is an Urdu language patriotic song that translated means \\"Anthem of the People of Hindustan\\". The Queens New Guard In January 2018, a film covering the pipe band was released titled The Queens New Guard. Premiering at the Vancouver International Film Centre, it focused on the band's visit to London in 2014. The Vancouver Police Foundation made a large contribution to the creation of the documentary and was also funded through contributions on Kickstarter. Proceeds went to the Gordon Sinclair Fund, a charity set up in memory of band member Gordon Sinclair who was killed in 1955. Awards and honours The following is a list of awards and honours by the band: *Stewart Trophy (six times) *Best Pipe Band Trophy at the Scottish Festival *Silver Star (November 1963) Notable members *Staff Sergeant Jim McWilliams - A former Pipe Major of the band who was also associated with the Calgary Boy Scout Pipe Band and the Pipes and Drums of The North Saskatchewan Regiment *Hugh Peden - Member of the band in from 1990 up until he became acting director in early 2006. He would later become pipe major of the RCMP \\"E\\" Division Pipe Band. *Andrew Perrie - Pipe Major from 1967 to 1984 and band member from 1951 to 2011.

In its first year under head coach Charles M. Justice, the team compiled a 6‚Äì0 record, outscoring their opponents 101‚Äì46. The team played its home games at Lewis Field (also known as Lewis Stadium) in Durham, New Hampshire. The team's prior head coach, George Sauer, enlisted in the Navy in April 1942. Justice, who had been the team's line coach, was named as Sauer's successor in early May. After this season, the Wildcats' football program would be idle due to World War II until a four-game limited schedule in 1944, with their next full season being 1946. Highlights This was the Wildcats' first undefeated football season in school history. New Hampshire averaged 310 yards rushing per game, while holding their opponents to a 225-yard average, and completed 47% of their passes while holding opponents to 25% pass completion. Running back Theo \\"Tuffy\\" Fitanides gained 735 yards on 144 carries, while missing the final game of the season due to an injury sustained during military training on campus. Fitanides was later selected to captain New Hampshire's 1943 team; however, the season was cancelled due to the war. Fitanides would go on to be the first Wildcat drafted by a National Football League (NFL) team, being selected in the fifth round of the 1944 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. Schedule Games against Colby and Bates were cancelled due to an expected delay in players arriving at the university due to \\"working in war industries during the summer\\". The 1942 game remains the last time that the New Hampshire and Norwich football programs have met. Wildcat captain Charles Judd became a high school teacher and restaurant owner; he died in July 2006 at age 89. Tuffy Fitanides died in March 2012 at age 90.

Her body was found in Shadnagar on 28 November 2019, the day after she was murdered. Four suspects were arrested and, according to the Cyberabad Metropolitan Police, confessed to having raped and killed the doctor. The Telangana Police Department stated that the victim had parked her scooter near a toll plaza, which caught the attention of two lorry drivers and their assistants. According to police, they deflated her tire, pretended to help her, and pushed her into nearby bushes, where they raped and smothered her. Then they allegedly loaded her corpse onto a lorry and dropped it on the roadside. The police arrested four men based on the evidence gathered from CCTV cameras and from the victim's mobile phone. The accused were taken into judicial custody at Cherlapally Central Jail for fourteen days. The Telangana Chief Minister ordered the formation of a fast-track court to try the accused for their alleged crimes. The rape and murder elicited outrage in several parts of the country. Protests and public demonstration against rape were organised nationwide after the incident, with the public demanding stricter laws against rape and rapists. The Minister of Home Affairs criticised the Telangana Police and stated that the government intended to amend the Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure to introduce laws for quicker punishment by fast-track courts. All four accused were killed in a police encounter on 6 December 2019, under a bridge on Bangalore Hyderabad national highway, while they were in police custody. According to the police, the suspects were taken to the location for a reconstruction of the crime scene, where two of them allegedly snatched guns and attacked the police. In the ensuing shootout, all four suspects were shot dead. Some accused the police of extrajudicial execution, while thousands of people celebrated the men's deaths. The first post-mortem of the four accused who were killed in the encounter was conducted on the same day itself at a government hospital in Mahabubnagar from where the bodies were subsequently moved to the Gandhi Hospital. The Telangana High Court on 21 December ordered the re-postmortem of the four accused. The second autopsy was done by a team of forensic experts of AIIMS, Delhi at a hospital in Hyderabad. After re-postmortem, the bodies have been handed over to the next of kin after due identification process was done. Background alt= Rape is the fourth most common crime against women in India. India has been characterised as one of the \\"countries with the lowest per capita rates of rape\\". Many rapes go unreported in various countries including India. The willingness to report rape has increased in recent years, after several incidents of rape received widespread media attention and triggered public protest. Most notably, the 2012 Delhi gang rape led the Government of India to reform its penal code for crimes of rape and sexual assault.

She was a resident of Shamshabad and was working as an assistant veterinarian at the state-run hospital at Kollur village.  Rape and murder  According to the Telangana Police Department remand report, the victim had parked her scooter near Tondupally toll plaza, attracting the attention of the suspects, two lorry drivers and their assistants, who had been drinking whiskey before allegedly planning the crime. According to the remand report, on 27 November 2019 at around 6:15 p.m., after parking the scooter, the victim took a taxi to a dermatologist's office in Hyderabad. The suspects allegedly deflated her scooter's tire in her absence. After returning at around 9:15 p.m., she noticed the flat tyre and made a call to her sister. The accused told police they offered to help her, then ambushed her. Three of the suspects pushed her into bushes near the toll gate and turned off her phone. She continued screaming for help, so the men poured whiskey into her mouth in an attempt to silence her. The four men removed her clothes and took turns sexually assaulting her until she started bleeding and lost consciousness. When she regained consciousness, they smothered her, wrapped the corpse in a blanket, transported it in their truck 27 km to a location near the Shadnagar interchange on the Hyderabad Outer Ring road, and at approximately 2:30 a.m. burnt it under a bridge using diesel and petrol purchased for the purpose. Investigation  The police arrested the four accused based on the evidence gathered from CCTV cameras, an eyewitness, and the victim's mobile phone. It was reported that they were drunk during the rape and murder. The woman's charred corpse was found under Chatanpally Bridge in the Shadnagar located from the toll booth where she was abducted. Her scooter was found at a distance of from the place where her body was found. The police found her clothes, handbag, footwear and a liquor bottle near the toll booth. 70% of the body was covered with burns. A locket of Ganesha found on the charred corpse helped her family to identify the victim. The body was handed over to the family after a post mortem. The executive magistrate sent the four accused into custody for 14 days to Cherlapally Central Jail. On 1 December 2019, Telangana Chief Minister ordered that a fast-track court be formed to try the accused of this crime. Aftermath Although the case was solved by the police in twenty-four hours, the family was dissatisfied. According to the victim's family, the response by the Cyberabad Police was improper, claiming that a quicker response by the police could have saved the victim's life. The victim's father had approached the police at 11 p.m. on 27 November, after which the police allegedly wasted time over the applicability of the jurisdiction of the police station and inappropriate questioning of the family. Constables were only sent for a search along with the family at 3 a.m. to Thondupally toll plaza and could not find the victim. The day after the incident the local police suspended three policemen, including a sub- inspector, belonging to the Shamshabad airport police station for negligence and the delay in registering a missing person case. The local police convinced the victim's family to allow the use of a fictional name, Disha, in place of the victim's true name in media reporting. They also suggested using the hashtag #JusticeForDisha for social media posts instead of using the real name. Indian laws prohibit naming rape victims, and violations are subject to legal penalties. On 3 December, a man from Nizamabad district was arrested by the Cyberabad police, after a cyber crime case was filed against him, for posting pictures and spreading derogatory posts about the victim. Attempt to communalise According to the police, among the four accused, three were Hindus and one was Muslim. Members of the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Raja Singh, BJP's IT Cell chief Amit Malviya and some party supporters made posts on social media that gave the incident a false communal spin by selectively focusing on the Muslim suspect. Cyberabad Police stated that it will take action against people trying to communalise the incident, and the DCP stated \\"It is absolutely not communal in nature as the accused are of all communities so it is incorrect to say it is anything related to religion.\\" Many tweets were reported for \\"inciting communal hatred\\", and Twitter locked Payal Rohatgi's account after her tweets were reported. Second corpse The half-burnt corpse of another woman was found nearby, and the case is under investigation as of 1 December 2019. The police stated that it was not clear if it was a case of self immolation or if she was set on fire. Police have not confirmed a link between the second corpse and the veterinarian's murder. Protests The rape and murder caused outrage in several parts of the country. Protests against rape were organised across the country including the major cities, New Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad. Hyderabad was the centre of the protests. Politicians including Rahul Gandhi, expressed shock over the incident that happened near Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. Protesters across India demanded stricter laws against rapists. After the arrest of the four suspects, a crowd of local residents gathered at the Shadnagar police station to protest against the crime and demanding that the police either hang or shoot the culprits. Due to the crowd of protestors around the police station, the accused could not be brought to court. Instead the executive magistrate arrived to the police station and passed the order to send the accused on judicial custody for 14 days. While the police were transporting the accused from the Shadnagar police station to the prison in Hyderabad, several protestors threw stones over police vehicles. Police used force and wielded batons to control the crowd, who were demanding the police hand over the accused to them. The public sentiment was against the police. The protestors questioned the priorities of the police and demanded that police act in a sensitive, responsive and proactive manner. Discussion in Parliament On 2 December 2019, the incident was discussed in both houses of the Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The members of the two houses expressed outrage on the incident and demanded concrete action. In the Lok Sabha, the Union Minister Rajnath Singh stated that the government was \\"open to every suggestion to curb such heinous crimes\\" and ready to explore strongest legal provisions. Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy said, \\"There is zero tolerance towards crimes against women and children. Our government will soon bring requisite amendments to CrPC and IPC.\\" He further added that the government will possibly try to bring the changes in the ongoing winter session of Parliament. In Rajya Sabha, an adjournment motions over the incident was rejected by Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, but he allowed the members to discuss such incidents in the country. Member of Parliament Jaya Bachchan said during a heated debate that the rapists should be lynched. P. Wilson suggested courts be empowered \\"to surgically and chemically castrate convicted rapists before they are released from jails\\" to prevent repeat offenders. He stated that the list of sexual offenders should be released publicly. Vijila Sathyananth asked for faster delivery of justice and the hanging of the accused before 31 December. A speedy trial and death penalty for the accused was common demand of the members. Mohd. Ali Khan asked for defined timelines for the trial in fast-track courts. He also asked to avoid giving a religious colour to the accused since they belonged to different religions. The Communist Party of India which generally opposes capital punishment demanded it for the accused and its member Binoy Viswam stated \\"I do not believe in death penalty but these accused should be hanged for such a heinous crime\\". Proposed legal changes In an interview to NDTV while visiting the family of the victim, Union Minister of State for Home, Kishan Reddy criticised the casual attitude of Telangana Police and their lack of a sense of urgency, saying it might have saved the victim. He stated \\"No one can be turned away from the police station like that. We will make it compulsory for every police station to accept a complaint. The FIR can be filed later; first they should have helped to search [for] the girl\\". He added \\"We take a very serious view of the developments. We intend to amend the IPC (Indian Penal Code) and CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) to make the law such that punishment is quick through fast-track courts. We will discuss this in great detail in a meeting of DGPs (senior police officers) between December 6 and 8. We want to publicise 112 as an emergency response system. Every woman must download the app to use in emergency. At the same time, the police and law enforcement authorities, her family, even some volunteers will be alerted, so response can be quick. We have recently introduced it in Delhi and want to publicise it everywhere.\\" The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D;) has made additional suggestions for changes to IPC and CrPC rules. The Government of Andhra Pradesh passed a bill named Disha Act (also known as, Andhra Pradesh Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2019) to award death penalty for rapists within 21 days after the crime is committed.  Killing of the suspects  All four accused were killed in an \\"encounter\\", a term used in India for killings by police, at around 3:30 am IST on 6 December 2019, under a bridge on Bangalore Hyderabad national highway, prompting accusations of extrajudicial execution. The New York Times reported that police \\"had been under enormous pressure to bring the rapists to justice\\". According to Prakash Reddy, Deputy Commissioner of Shamshabad Police in Hyderabad, the four suspects were taken to the location for a reconstruction of the crime scene, where two of them snatched guns and attacked the police. In the ensuing shootout all four suspects were shot dead. According to reports in the Indian Express, police alleged that one of four accused had gestured to the other three to flee after attacking the police. The four tried to run towards a deserted pathway when police opened fire in what they described as self- defence. The suspects were not wearing handcuffs. According to Cyberabad police chief V. C. Sajjanar, the suspects had managed to snatch and use the weapons because the guns were unlocked. He stated \\"All four accused got together and started attacking the police party. Officers maintained restraint and asked them to surrender but without listening to us they kept firing. Our officers retaliated\\". Response The family of the victim welcomed the encounter. Thousands of people celebrated at the scene of the men's deaths the following day, some setting off firecrackers, distributing candies, showering police with flower petals, hoisting police to their shoulders, and shouting \\"hail the police!\\" The New York Times reported that crowds celebrating in the streets had brought traffic to a standstill. Celebrations were also reported in other areas. Politicians and celebrities thanked police for the encounter on social media. The BBC attributed the celebrations to frustration with the \\"meandering pace\\" of the judicial system in India, which often requires years and occasionally decades to adjudicate clear cases. The BBC noted the popularity of films featuring \\"trigger-happy, vigilante cops brazenly carrying out extrajudicial executions\\" and the number of tweets comparing the Cyberabad police officers with the hero of Singham, a 2011 film about an avenging police officer. The families of the accused were shocked with the news and questioned the killings. Human rights organizations and activists condemned the encounter. Maneka Gandhi stated that the case should have been tried in court. Karuna Nundy expressed concerns that \\"now nobody will ever know if the four men killed by the police were innocent men, arrested fast to show action. And whether four of the most brutal rapists roam free, to rape and kill more women.\\" Amnesty International India stated that the \\"alleged extrajudicial execution\\" had raised disturbing questions and asked for an independent investigation. The Pioneer reported that multiple rights activists had termed the encounter as a distraction from the government's failures to safeguard women's rights. Meenakshi Ganguly of Human Rights Watch tweeted, \\"To appease public rage over state failures against sexual assault, Indian authorities commit another violation.\\" Activist Rukmini Rao criticized some members of parliament for adding to the pressure on police, telling News Today \\"The police are acting on what they see as public support. And today we find not just public support, ordinary citizens, but we are finding members of parliament demanding lynchings, demanding killings, and if that is the case, how do you expect the police to act? The parliament has to uphold constitutional law.\\" The Telangana High Court ordered to preserve the bodies of the accused until 13 December, and permitted their transfer (due to lack of morgue space) to Gandhi Hospital. The National Human Rights Commission of India initiated an investigation of the killings and will send a team led by a senior officer to Telangana. News Today has questioned whether the encounter was staged.

The official record shows an estimated death toll from 100,000 to 150,000. Methods of slaughter included beheading, beating, live burial, stoning, drowning, boiling and disemboweling. In certain areas including Wuxuan County and Wuming District, massive human cannibalism occurred even though no famine existed; according to public records available, at least 137 people‚Äîperhaps hundreds more‚Äîwere eaten by others and at least thousands of people participated in the cannibalism. Other researchers have pointed out that in a county alone, 421 people had been eaten, and there were reports of cannibalism across dozens of counties in Guangxi. After the Cultural Revolution, people who were involved in the massacre or cannibalism received only minor punishments during the \\"Boluan Fanzheng\\" period; in Wuxuan County where at least 38 people were eaten, fourteen participants were prosecuted, receiving up to 14 years in prison, while ninety-one members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were expelled from the party and thirty- nine non-party officials were either demoted or had a salary cut. Although the cannibalism was sponsored by local offices of Communist Party and militia, no direct evidence suggests that anyone in the national Communist Party leadership including Mao Zedong endorsed the cannibalism or even knew of it.  Historical background  General Wei Guoqing. In May 1966, Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution. Starting from March 1967, two factions gradually formed among troops and civilians in Guangxi: one faction (known for short as \\"the United Headquarters\\") unconditionally supported Wei Guoqing‚Äîthen Chairman of Guangxi and a high-ranking CPC official‚Äîto direct the revolution in Guangxi, while the other faction (known as \\"4.22\\") opposed such unconditional support, asking Wei to do self-criticism first. Clashes such as \\"violent struggles\\" between the two factions along with massacres soon took place in rural regions of Guangxi. Even though the \\"4.22 faction\\" received support from Premier Zhou Enlai in August 1967, it was at a disadvantage throughout Guangxi except in the city of Guilin. In February 1968, Guangzhou Military Region ordered the troops which supported \\"4.22 faction\\" to move away from the region; in April 1968, Huang Yongsheng, then head of Guangzhou Military Region, declared that the \\"4.22 faction\\" was a \\"reactionary organization\\" and started massive suppression (at the same time, the Guangdong Massacre also took place). Since the summer of 1968, the massacre had spread from rural regions to cities of Guangxi.  Methods of killing  In the massacre, methods of slaughter included \\"beheading, beating, live burial, stoning, drowning, boiling, group slaughters, disemboweling, digging out hearts, livers, genitals, slicing off flesh, blowing up with dynamite, and more\\". * In one case, according to official records, a person was bound to dynamites on the back and was blown up into pieces by other people‚Äîjust for fun. *In another case of 1968, \\"a geography instructor named Wu Shufang () was beaten to death by students at Wuxuan Middle School. The body was carried to the flat stones of the Qian river where another teacher was forced at gunpoint to rip out the heart and liver. Back at the school the pupils barbecued and consumed the organs.\\"  Death toll   First investigation group  In April 1981, an investigation group of over 20 people was formed under the arrangement of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the General Office of the Communist Party of China, the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China, the Ministry of Public Security, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate. In June 1981, the investigation concluded that the death toll was over 100,000, while some officials and civilians claimed privately that the death toll was 150,000, 200,000 or even 500,000. In addition, Qiao Xiaoguang reported to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection that the death toll was 70,400.  Second investigation group  In March 1983, another investigation group of 40 people was formed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In January 1984, the investigation concluded that 89,700 deaths could be identified by names and addresses, over 20,000 people were missing, and over 30,000 deaths could not be identified by names or addresses. In particular, due to the violent struggles between the two opposing factions, 3,700 people died during direct fighting, 7,000 were persecuted to death, while 79,000 were beaten or shot to death in a planned and systematic matter. In Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, eight out of fourteen counties saw a death toll of over 1,000, with Binyang County alone losing 3,777 people.  Academic studies  In 2006, Professor Su Yang () of University of California, Irvine argued that the Guangxi massacre was the most serious massacre during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He stated that among the 65 accessible official county documents of Guangxi, 43 counties report local massacres with 15 of them recording a death toll of over 1000, while the average death toll was 526 among all the counties which reported massacre.  Massive cannibalism  Wuxuan County of Guangxi, where cannibalism was prevalent during the Cultural Revolution. The image shows the quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong on a street wall of Wuxuan. Human cannibalism occurred in Guangxi during the Cultural Revolution. According to Zheng Yi (), a scholar who conducted detailed research on the topic in the late 1980s and later smuggled some copies of official documents to the United States, at least 137 people‚Äîperhaps hundreds more‚Äîwere eaten by others and thousands of people participated in the cannibalism. Documents also record a variety of forms of cannibalism, including eating people as an after- dinner snack, slicing off the meat in big parties, dividing up the flesh so each person could take a large chunk home, barbecuing or roasting the liver, and so on. According to Yan Lebin (), a member of the Ministry of Public Security who joined both of the investigation groups: > In 1968, 38 people in Wuxuan County were eaten, and 113 officials of the > county participated in eating human flesh, hearts and livers. Chen Guorong > (), a peasant from Guigang County who happened to pass by Wuxuan, was caught > and killed by local militia because he was fat; his heart and liver were > taken out while his flesh was distributed to 20 people. A female militia > leader ate 6 human livers in total, and cut the genitals of 5 men and soaked > them in alcohol which she would drink later, claiming that these organs were > beneficial to her health. The behavior of eating human flesh, hearts and > livers occurred in many counties of Guangxi including Wuxuan, Wuming, > Shangsi, Guigang, Qinzhou, Guiping, and Lingyun......After the \\"Committee of > Revolution\\" was established in Shangsi County, a \\"killing conference\\" was > held at Pingshan Square () on September 1, 1968, during which more than 10 > officials and civilians were beaten to death. After the conference, a > committee member, Li Hao (), removed the hearts and livers from the corpses, > sauteing them and preparing them as dishes for other representatives who > attended the conference. According to Song Yongyi (), a Chinese historian who worked at the California State University, Los Angeles: > Independent researchers in Guangxi counted a total of 421 people who were > eaten in a single county. But there were reports of cannibalism across 27 > counties in Guangxi; that's two-thirds of all the counties in Guangxi. There > was one man who was said to be in the so-called fifth category, who was > beaten to death where he stood. He had two kids, one of 11 and one of 14. > The local officials and armed militia said that it was important to > eradicate such people, and so they not only killed those two children: they > ate them too. This took place in Pubei county, Guangxi, where 35 people were > killed and eaten in total. Most of them were rich landowners and their > families. There was one landowner called Liu Zhengjian whose entire family > was wiped out. He had a 17-year-old daughter, Liu Xiulan, who was gang-raped > by nine people [for 19 times] who then ripped open her belly, and ate her > liver and breasts. There were so many incidents like this. According to Frank Dik√∂tter, Chair Professor of Humanities at the University of Hong Kong, Senior Fellow at Hoover Institution of Stanford, and winner of the 2011 Samuel Johnson Prize: > Throughout 1967 but also '68, there are factions in the countryside that > start not just eliminating each other physically, but literally in a couple > of small towns they start ritualistically eating each other. In other words, > it is not enough to eliminate your class enemy. You have to eat his heart, > so there are very well-documented cases of ritual cannibalism. > There was a hierarchy in the consumption of class enemies. Leaders feasted > on the heart and liver, mixed with pork, while ordinary villagers were > allowed only to peck at the victims‚Äô arms and thighs. >  Public responses   Witnesses  Quotations of Mao Zedong in Wuxuan, Guangxi. *In 2016, Agence France-Presse (AFP) interviewed a local man with last name Luo who responded, \\"Cannibalism? I was here then, I went through it. But Wuxuan has developed rapidly in recent years and now. That history 'has no meaning'.\\" *In 2016, a high-ranking member of an early 1980s official investigation told AFP that \\"[a]ll the cannibalism was due to class struggle being whipped up and was used to express a kind of hatred. The murder was ghastly, worse than beasts.\\" *In 2013, Yang Liping, a notable Chinese dancer, claimed that she had seen cannibalism during the Cultural Revolution, although not necessarily in Guangxi. She stated that \\"I am pessimistic about humanity and pessimistic about humans. Because we have been through the Cultural Revolution, we have become very alert. I am very alert, alert like a peacock. Be careful, because humans are the most horrible animals, otherwise Michael Jackson wouldn't have died......I saw people eat people, and people hurt people, just like nowadays. Nowadays people can hurt you anytime, yet they don't even know why they hurt you.\\" *In 1995, Donald S. Sutton, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, wrote in his research paper, \\"Did cannibalism actually take place in Wuxuan?......That the incident truly occurred was independently confirmed by a recent visitor to Wuxuan, the scholar and journalist, John Gittings. An off-duty local clerk spoke airily of the killings and the cannibalism-obligingly writing down his name and address when asked-and added with a touch of pride, \\"In Wuxuan . . . we ate more people than anywhere else in China\\" (The Guardian, November 27, 1993).\\"  Researchers  * In 2016, Ding Xueliang (), a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told AFP that \\"[t]his was not cannibalism because of economic difficulties, like during famine. It was not caused by economic reasons, it was caused by political events, political hatred, political ideologies, political rituals.‚Äù * In 2013, Qin Hui, a professor at Tsinghua University, discussed the contributions of Deng Xiaoping with Ezra Vogel, a professor with Harvard University, when Qin said \\"my hometown is in Guangxi, where people were killed in massacres during Mao's era, and some of them were eaten by others! In the bloody summer of 1968, people in Hong Kong and Macau all knew that there were corpses floating down from Xi River to Pearl River.\\" * In 2006, Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals disputed that it was communism that compelled the Zhuang in this area towards cannibalism, noting that similar incidents occurred under pressure from the Kuomintang secret police in the republican period.Roderick MacFarquhar, and Michael Schoenhals. Mao's Last Revolution. Harvard University Press, 2006. p. 259 * In 2001, Perry Link, a professor of Chinese at Princeton University, stated that \\"I believe Zheng's story [of cannibalism]. He's a writer of integrity, and the rich detail has the ring of authenticity.\\" * In 1999, sinologist Gang Yue questioned how \\"systematic\\" the cannibalism could have been, given the inherent factionalism of the Cultural Revolution. *In 1997, Key Ray Chong, a professor of history at S≈çka University, wrote in his review of Zheng Yi's book of cannibalism that \\"[d]uring the Cultural Revolution, quite a few Chinese officials knew of this horror, the equivalent of the Nazi Holocaust in the 1940s and the killing fields of Pol Pot in the 1970s. But they remained silent about the subject.\\"  Media  *In 2016, The Irish Times stated in its review of Cultural Revolution that \\"[t]errible stories abounded. There were tales of cannibalism in Guangxi province where 'bad elements' were publicly butchered and more than 70 victims were eaten in Wuxuan.\\" *In 2016, The Guardian stated in its review of Cultural Revolution that \\"[p]erhaps the worst affected region was the southern province of Guangxi where there were reports of mass killings and even cannibalism.\\" *In 2013, Renmin Wang, the official media of the Communist Party of China, as well as some other Chinese media reprinted an article from China Youth Daily, which stated that during the Cultural Revolution \\"in some places such as Guangxi, the hearts and livers of people were eaten after they were beaten to death, and, surprisingly, such cannibalism was prevalent in that region!\\" The article further stated, \\"throughout the human history of the 20th century, was there any country that had experienced the Cultural Revolution like ours? The only comparable time was Nazi Germany. However, up to this date, we do not even have a decent review or reflection on this period of history...... A society that does not reflect on the Cultural Revolution is perhaps still a tribe of cannibalism. Such tribe, no matter how beautiful people look on the outside and how modernized the fruits of civilization are used (in society), is still a tribe of cannibalism without humanity.\\" *In 2001, Time stated that \\"Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution was an eruption of ideological fervor, mass hysteria and outright brutality that left an estimated 10 million Chinese dead and ruined the lives of millions more. Now tales of even more horrible excesses from the years between 1966 and 1976 are coming to light: allegations of cannibalism, involving hundreds of men and women who violated mankind's most powerful taboo in the name of revolutionary purity.\\" *In 1996, The Washington Post stated, after Zheng Yi published his book that \\"[t]he party wants to block any deep-going analysis of the role played by the late Chairman Mao Zedong and numerous party members. Full disclosure of the truth might destroy what little legitimacy the party still clings to.\\" *In 1993, Newsweek stated that \\"[t]he accounts were harrowing. Principals killed in schoolyards by students, then cooked and eaten. Government-run cafeterias displaying human bodies hanging from meat hooks and dishing them out to employees....... Documents smuggled out of China last week described atrocities of the Cultural Revolution in grotesque detail.\\" *In 1993, The New York Times stated that \\"[t]he incidents reported from Guangxi were apparently the most extensive episodes of cannibalism in the world in the last century or more. They were also different from any others in that those who took part were not motivated by hunger or psychopathic illness. Instead, the actions appeared to be ideological: the cannibalism, which the documents say took place in public, was often organized by local Communist Party officials, and people apparently took part together to prove their revolutionary ardor.\\"  See also  *Guangdong Massacre *Violent Struggle *Boluan Fanzheng *Reforms and Opening-up *Mass killings under communist regimes *List of massacres in China *Cannibalism in China *Scarlet Memorial: Tales of Cannibalism in Modern China  References   Further reading  *Frank Dik√∂tter.

The Bahamas are considered a tax haven given the lack of income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax or company tax. Government tax revenue is instead derived from consumption, property and import taxes as well as licence fees. The country's lack of income and corporate profit taxes has seen it become a popular drawcard for high net-worth individuals moving to the Bahamas and becoming residents for tax purposes to avoid high taxes in their home countries, including a number of high profile people such as Eugenie Bouchard and Sean Connery. Tax residency certificates are issued to individuals who spend at least 90 days in the Bahamas and under 184 days in any other single country and purchase a property worth in excess of $1.5 million. Tax revenues made up 22.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the Bahamas in 2016. The Bahamas has not entered into any double tax agreements. Income and individual taxes The Bahamas does not impose income tax, inheritance tax or wealth tax. Social security tax is payable to the National Insurance Board at 3.9% by employees and 5.9% by employers, or 8.8% for self-employed individuals, up to maximum amounts. Property taxes Property tax is imposed on all properties, with the rate for residential properties dependent on whether the home was occupied by its owner for at least six months of the calendar year, under reforms introduced in 2019. If the residency requirement is met, the first $250,000 of property value is exempted, while the value up to $500,000 is taxed at a rate of 0.75% and at 1% on value in excess of $500,000. If the residency requirement is failed, a 1% tax is imposed for the value up to $500,000 of assessed value and 2% for the value in excess of $500,000. Prior to 2019, property taxes were capped annually at $500,000. Furthermore, stamp duty is payable on the transfer of realty and marina slips, at 2.5% for valuations under $100,000 and 10% over $100,000. Corporate taxes There is no corporate tax, withholding tax, payroll tax or transfer tax levied on businesses in the Bahamas. However, businesses require a licence to operate, which is charged at either a flat-rate of $100 or at up to 3% of turnover depending on the amount of revenue generated. Value added tax (VAT) A value added tax applies to a majority of transactions at a rate of 12%. The VAT was increased from 7.5% in 2018. The VAT was introduced in 2015, replacing a 10% tax on hotel lodgings. A number of essential items, such as grocery staples, medicines and property insurance, are exempt from VAT. Import duties Import duties are applied to a wide variety of goods being brought into the Bahamas. The Ministry of Finance maintains a list of commonly imported items, each with its own import duty payable before release to the owner, which can range from zero to 75% of the item's value. VAT, stamp duties and fixed-price environmental levies are also applicable to some imported goods applied at various rates.

He was a key figure in the long process that by the start of the 21st-century had made St. George a key center of retirement and growing commubnity. Hafen was a native of Santa Clara, Utah. He received an associates degree from Dixie College (now Dixie State University) and completed his undergraduate studies at Brigham Young University. He then went to work in Washington, D.C. while taking night courses at George Washington University. He then received his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1929. In 1932 he moved back to Washington County, Utah and settled at St. George, Utah. He came to practice law and to head the local farmers cooperative at the urging of Dixie College president Joseph A. Nicholes. In 1933 Hafen was serving as a member of the St. George Stake presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He also was the president of the St. George Chamber of Commerce that year. He was involved with operating Dixie College from when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stopped funding the institution in 1933 until the state of Utah took over operations in 1935. Hafen also served as both St. George city and Washington County attorney. He was also Washington County Chairman for the Republican Party. The cooperative that Hafen came to run in St. George failed after he was there about a year, and never paid him his promised salary. He then along with other civic boosters was involved in organizing the Pioneer Protectiong and Ivestment Company. This group pooled the small amount of capital available in St. George to inport fertilizers and sell it to farmers to boost crop output. In 1934 Hafen married Ruth Clark. She had been born in Panguitch, Utah, but largely raised in Provo, Utah. She and Hafen had met when they were both students at BYU. She had since worked as a teacher in Nephi, Utah. She married Hafen with the understanding that their stay in St. George would be short. Hafen was involved with five other men in forming the Dixie Education Association in 1935. This group worked to raise money in case Dixie faced a later crisis of funding. Its funds eventually were key in the 1960s in Dixie College moving to a new campus. Later Hafen established a Ford car dealership and car maitenance garage.Adler. \\"Senator Orval Hafen\\", in Utah Historical Quarterly, p. 82 He also developed a subdivision in the area of Main Street and 6th South. In 1943 Hafen served as president of the Utah State Bar Association. He served a total of 12 years as a member of the Utah State Senate, first elected in 1952. When first elected his district covered Washington County Utah and Iron County Utah. In 1955 he was made Republican Party whip in the Senate. He was the president of the state senate starting 1957. In 1953 he worked closely with Ernest L. Wilkinson to draft the legislative bills to provide for the return of Dixie, Weber and Snow college to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This move eventually was narrowly defeated when it was put to voters.David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism, p. 184 Also as a member of the legislature Hafen managed to push through budget bills to build new buildings at Dixie College. Hafen supported the compromise that gave the rural Utah counties (including Washington County) which had 25% of the population control of 11 of the 14 state senate seats while the majority of the state house seats were controlled by the urban counties with 75% of the population. Hafen opposed the idea of the majority always controlling in government. He did push through a bill that changed the balance so the state senate districts were split 14 to the rural counties and 13 to the four Urban counties of Utah, Salt Lake, Davis and Weber. This balance was later ended after the U.S. supreme court ruled to mandate all legislative districts represent the principle of one man one vote and regular redistricting to preserve such a blance. He and his wife Ruth were the parents of five children, including Bruce C. Hafen. Sources *Douglas D. Alder.

It was released on December 4, 2019, through Virgin EMI Records and Interscope Records. Originally meant to serve as the lead single for Uchis‚Äô upcoming second studio album, the track would later be demoted to a stand-alone single. Composition \\"Solita\\" was written by Kali Uchis, Anthony Clemons, Jr., Marco Masis, Rupert Thomas Jr., and Jahaan Akil Sweet, with production being handled by the latter three alongside Austen Jux-Chandler. It runs for 2 minutes and 58 seconds. Described by Uchis as \\"sad, yet horny,\\" the song was written in 2018 and is inspired by a breakup she experienced. According to her, the song comments on the positive points of being alone, rather than the \\"toxic stuff\\" commonly associated with a single person. The Fader's Jordan Darville described the track as a \\"Latin trap-influenced slow burn,\\" and Pitchfork's Colin Lodewick noted a reggaeton beat. Brazilian news portal R7.com labeled the track as a \\"modern R&B; with Latin touches.\\" Mxdwmm's Ashwin Charey compared the song's production to that of 1980s synth-pop, while noting its influences from hip hop and format which follows a crescendo and diminuendo pattern. Writing for Clash, Robin Murray characterized \\"Solita\\" as an \\"ode to independence, to rejecting societal pressure to embrace a relationship\\" and an \\"ultra-addictive pop riot\\", whilst Peter Helman from Stereogum deemed that it \\"returns to [Uchis'] old theme of isolation.\\" Uchis' vocals on \\"Solita\\" are described by MTV News' Trey Alston as \\"stronger than it initially lets on, deepening into a swift and booming wind.\\" The song features Uchis singing in both English and Spanish. Music video An accompanying music video for \\"Solita\\" premiered on December 18, 2019, and was directed by Amber Grace Johnson and filmed in Los Angeles. Johnson hired frequent collaborator Object & Animal to produce the music video, which presents Uchis in different characters and personalities, with Nia Groce from Hypebeast describing her looks as \\"outer-space themed [...] transforming into the likes of an exotic dancer and a goddess.\\" Clash's Murray wrote that the video is \\"a colourful, vivid return from a vital force.\\" Synopsis The video starts with Kali in a cocoon of glass in the middle of the desert. She then performs with white pythons in the sand while short clips of Uchis featuring a futuristic mask in between scenes. Afterwards, she wears a red bodysuit while men appear to be worshiping around her. Later, she becomes surrounded by oiled-up men holding Zippo lighters while she smokes. The video ends with the same men who were surrounding her close their lighters individually and leaving Uchis in darkness.

Season summary The new season opened with the Leinster Senior Cup, with Dundalk exiting in the second round. The League Cup followed and, after qualifying from a four team mini-group to reach the quarter-finals, they were knocked out by St Patrick's Athletic. The 33-round League programme commenced on 13 September 1987, and was completed on 21 April 1988. Shamrock Rovers had won the title for the previous four seasons and were expected to challenge again, while St Patrick's Athletic, Bohemians and Cork City were all strongly tipped. Dundalk went top of the table early, but slumped to fourth after back-to-back defeats in October. They then put together a seven match winning streak, to lead by three points in the run up to Christmas. They continued to lead into March, until a five match winless streak saw them slip to third. With three games remaining, the season appeared to swing back in Dundalk's favour when, after going two goals down to Derry City in Oriel Park, they scored three times in the final 13 minutes to win the match. A big win the following week over Bray Wanderers meant that, going into the final match of the season, they only needed a draw against St Patrick's Athletic ‚Äì their closest challengers ‚Äì to become Champions. Pats themselves required a win to pip Dundalk to the title. The televised finale, described as being played out in the \\"emotion charged atmosphere of Oriel Park\\", ended 1‚Äì1. Dundalk had won the League for the first time since 1981‚Äì82, and their first title in the Premier Division era. They went on to win the 1988 FAI Cup Final, with a 1‚Äì0 victory over Derry City on 1 May 1988 ‚Äì the club's second League and Cup Double ‚Äì to cap a season that had seen them play 50 matches. As FAI Cup runners-up from the season before, they qualified for the 1987‚Äì88 European Cup Winners' Cup. In the first round they drew a glamour tie against the holders, Ajax Amsterdam (many of whose players would be in the Dutch squad that would win Euro '88).

Keenan (October 15, 1894 ‚Äì April 12, 1970) was an American politician who served as the 34th Mayor of Burlington, Vermont. Keenan was the last Republican elected to the mayoralty of Burlington until Peter C. Brownell was thirty years later. Life On October 15, 1894 Keenan was born in Oswego, New York to Edward and Bessie Keenan. He attended both Oswego High School and later the University of Vermont. On June 1, 1916 he married Marjorie B. Cooper in Oswego and later had two children with her. In 1929 he moved his family to Montpelier and then to Burlington. After retiring in 1959 from his position as an office manager with Green Mountain Power, Keenan was elected as an alderman from ward five in Burlington, narrowly defeating Democratic incumbent Paul L. Heininger with 382 votes to Heininger's 353. In 1961 he easily won reelection with 451 votes against Charles A. Brunnelle's 232 votes. In 1963 incumbent Mayor Robert K. Bing announced that he would not seek a second term and party officials asked Keenan to run for mayor, but refused to make a decision until January 30, 1963 when he announced that he would run and received Bing's endorsement. On February 8, 1963 he was given the Republican nomination and on March 5 defeated Robert W. Larrow with 4,475 votes against Larrow's 4,267 votes. During his tenure he supported the city government using a weak-mayor system rather than a strong-mayor system. On January 15, 1965 he announced that he would seek reelection and the Republican Committee in Burlington announced that it had voted unanimously to support him. On March 2 he was defeated by alderman Francis J. Cain with 5,520 votes for Cain against Keenan's 3,447 votes. After losing reelection he was invited to a briefing with President Lyndon B. Johnson along with the mayors of every city with over 100,000 people to discuss how the cities were coping with the Johnson administration's programs. In May he was a member of a four person delegation supported a bill in the state legislature that would reapportion the state house to 150 seats which was successfully passed. Following his defeat for reelection as mayor he led a successful write-in campaign for the Republican nomination, placing second out of eleven candidates, as one of six candidates for state senate seats. Keenan was unable to campaign for state senate due to being hospitalized and the initial results of the election showed him losing by one vote. Later recounts found an error in the vote totals that under-reported Hector Marcoux's total by 100 votes and after it was included gave him a lead of 101 votes against Keenan. Shortly before his death Keenan lived in Sarasota, Florida and on April 12, 1970 he died in Pompano Beach, Florida from a heart attack after being taken to the hospital earlier that day. The city hall flag in Burlington was flown at half-staff until after his funeral services by the orders of Francis J. Cain.

Life  Harriet Shorr was born in 1939 and grew up in Sea Gate in Brooklyn. She received her BA from Swarthmore College in 1960 and BFA from Yale School of Art and Architecture in 1962. After graduating from Swarthmore and earning BFA from Yale Shorr returned to Swartmore College to teach art. From 1963 to 1974 she directed Swarthmore‚Äôs Studio Arts Program. In 1971 Shorr was selected a McDowell Fellow and worked in Alexander studio. Shorr was a member of the Foundation‚Äôs Artists Advisory Committee that initiated and developed the Sharpe Walentas Studio Program as a service to living artists. She was a professor emerita of art and design at Purchase College. Harriet was married to Jim Long and had two daughters, Ruth and Sasha. She died on April 9th 2016 at Beth Israel Hospital at the age of 76.  Art  Harriet Shorr is mainly considered as a realist artist, however during life her work has transitioned from observation of everyday objects and domestic items painted when she was at Swarthmore, to the objects placed on scarves that she painted after she came to New York, and to objects that are carefully chosen for literary, mythological, or metaphorical possibilities. While selecting objects for the painting Shorr consciously tried not to look for them with a specific agenda in mind, nor questioned what makes them click together. When all the objects were gathered, she arranged the items on a table in her studio trying to vary the spaces between them. Shorr didn‚Äôt believe in a necessary connection between drawing and painting and did no preliminary drawing for her still life works. She used bristle brushes for the larger areas of color and longhaired brushes for the more precise modeling, created the different shapes, their shadows and the spaces between shapes, maintaining the fluidity of the painting and the practice of painting wet- into-wet that she developed after studying with Alex Katz at the Yale School of Art and Architecture. Shorr demonstrates her method of direct painting in her book The Artist‚Äôs Eye. For her subject matter is still life, which Shorr believes is the most compatible with her method of painting. Shorr was one of four realist still life painters who experimented painting same four objects not revealing the results to one another until all four paintings were done. They repeated the same experiment in ten years and presented the results on the group exhibition Four Artists, Four Objects, Ten Years (1997). Among four artists Shorr appeared to be the most abstract in her approach. 2005 exhibit Cythera marked a new direction for Shorr, who is known for her more straightforward still lifes. Here, she attempted radically new works that wrestle with allegory in the guise of porcelain figurines, textiles, flowers, branches and reflective surfaces. Shorr was among 7 artists selected for the study of Margery B. Franklin and Bernard Kaplan presented in their book Development and the Arts: Critical Perspectives (1994). Harriet Shorr‚Äôs work has been offered at auction multiple times, with the record price $2,375 USD for Oysters and Pearls, sold at Freeman‚Äôs in 2009. Her paintings are a part of collections at numerous organizations, among them Citicorp,Hyatt, Hess Corporation, Estee Lauder Companies, ARCO, and others.

He was elected in 2019 as member of the IXth Sejm as a member of Law and Justice. Czarnek is known for his opposition to LGBT rights, women's rights, and children's rights, and filed a criminal case in opposition to recognition of Ukrainian victims of the Home Army in the 1944 Sahry≈Ñ massacre. On 19 October 2020, Czarnek was appointed Minister of Education and Science, after a delay related to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Childhood and education Czarnek grew up in Goszczan√≥w in the powiat of Sieradz in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship of western Poland. His mother was a nurse and his father a truck driver. He moved to Lublin to live with an uncle at the age of 15. Czarnek graduated from the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin (KUL) in 2001 in law, obtained his doctorate in constitutional law from KUL in 2006, and obtained his habilitation at KUL in 2015. Academic career Czarnek was appointed as a university professor at KUL on 1 October 2019. According to an analysis by OKO.press, at the time Czarnek's publications had no citations in Scopus, three citations of his habilitation thesis in Google Scholar and most of his publications were in low-ranked publications made by or linked with the Catholic Church. Czarnek was awarded a medal for services rendered to the Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska University (UMCS) on 28 October 2019. During the award ceremony, activist Anna DƒÖbrowska held up a banner \\"Medal for the hater ‚Äì shame\\". UMCS staff member Tomasz Kitli≈Ñski said that the decision to award the medal had not been consulted with university staff and was a surprise, and that it took place in a context of decreased democracy within the university. Political career Czarnek was appointed as the voivode of the Lublin Voivodeship in 2015. He was elected as a member of parliament in the 2019 Polish parliamentary election, resigning from his position as voivode. Minister of Science and Education In early October 2020, Czarnek was announced as the likely new minister of education and science (which was earlier divided into the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, MNISW, and the Ministry of National Education, MEN), shortly before he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. His nomination was delayed after his SARS-CoV-2 positive status was announced. Czarnek was formally appointed Minister of Science and Education on 19 October 2020. Positions on human rights Czarnek has made several public statements in relation to human rights. Prior to the 2018 Equality March in Lublin in favour of LGBT rights and the rights of other minorities including the disabled, refugees, ethnic minorities and religious minorities, Czarnek described the march as promoting \\"perversion, deviance and denaturing\\" and called for the march to be forbidden by the authorities. LGBT rights Czarnek is known for repeatedly making homophobic statements. He described the 2018 Lublin Equality March as \\"promoting pedophilia\\". Bartosz Staszewski, one of the organisers of the march, sued Czarnek, demanding that Czarnek publicly apologise. During the 2020 Polish presidential election campaign Czarnek stated in a live television broadcast that \\"[we] should stop listening to this nonsense about human rights, or any equality. These people [LGBT] are not equal to normal people\\". On 3 August 2020, Czarnek stated that it was certain that \\"LGBT ideology was derived from neomarxism and came from the same roots as German Hitlerian national socialism.\\" Women's rights Czarnek stated in relation to women's rights that \\"Career first, maybe later a child, leads to tragic consequences. If the first child is not born [when the mother is aged] 20‚Äì25 years, only at the age of 30, how many children can [the mother] bear? Those are the consequences of telling a woman that she doesn't have to do what she was destined to do by the Lord God.\\" Children's rights One of Czarnek's research themes is that violence against children is allowed by the Polish constitution, as the violence is a method of raising children. Artistic freedom In relation to artistic freedom, Czarnek wrote in a publication that \\"There is also a lack of justification for privileging artistic freedom and freedom of speech at the cost of religious freedom and the associated right to protection of religious sentiment\\". Ukrainian victims of war crimes by Poles In July 2018, a commemoration of the Sahry≈Ñ massacre, in which hundreds of Ukrainian civilians were killed by the Polish Home Army on 10 March 1944, was held. Czarnek described the commemoration as a \\"great provocation\\". He officially informed the police that the commemoration was, according to him, a crime by the president of the Lublin Ukrainians' Association under the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance.

Rather, with a brother two years older, from a young age she'd roleplay the heroes in stories and do other boys' things. She was class representative every year of elementary school, an honor student in whom the teachers placed great faith. In her 6th year of elementary school, she happened to catch Takarazuka Moon Troupe's \\"Gone with the Wind\\" on television. She fell immediately in love with the star, Amami Yuuki, and began collecting all the shows she appeared in on video and watching them on repeat. A year later, Nanami went to see Amami Yuuki live for the first time in \\"Me And My Girl,\\" and made the decision that she wanted to enter Takarazuka. Though she had no previous dance experience, after entering middle school, Nanami enrolled in a ballet class in Tokyo that her father found specifically for those aspiring to enter the Takarazuka Music School.

She entered a high-level high school and her parents gave her the ultimatum that she couldn't take the exam to enter the Takarazuka music school if her school grades slipped, so she worked hard on her studies and took her lessons simultaneously She passed the Takarazuka exam in her second year of high school on her second try. Her stage name, \\"Nanami\\" takes one character from her real name (\\"Mi\\" from \\"Êµ∑,\\" \\"Sea\\"), combined with \\"Nana\\" (\\"‰∏É,\\" \\"Seven\\") from the name of a character she liked from the anime \\"Tico of the Seven Seas.\\" \\"Hiroki\\" (which can contain the character for \\"vast\\" in Japanese) comes from the vastness of the ocean. After graduating from the Takarazuka music school, she made her onstage debut in 2003 in Moon troupe‚Äôs Takarazuka Floral Diaries/ Senor Don Juan. She was then assigned to Cosmos troupe, where she would stay until 2015. During her time in Cosmos troupe, she was given the opportunity to play many different background roles, and in 2009, she received her first and only shinjinkouen (young performers) lead role, Justin in Raindrops Fall on Roses. In 2011, she was cast in a female role, Natacha Rambova in Valentino- playing the wife to then- Top Star Oozora Yuuhi. In 2013, Nanami had her first true theatrical lead in a Western-themed musical titled The Wild Meets The Wild. Following this, she was cast as Scarlett O‚ÄôHara in Gone With the Wind. During her time in Cosmos troupe, Nanami was also offered a voice acting role in an anime, an uncommon occurrence for a current Takarazuka actress, and in 2014, she voiced the character of Uesugi Kenshin in Satelight‚Äôs Nobunaga the Fool. In 2015 Nanami was transferred from Cosmos troupe into Star troupe, where she would spend the rest of her time in Takarazuka. Through her time In Star troupe, Nanami progressed to playing larger roles, from the lead role of Takenaka Shigeharu in Strategist Takenaka Hanbei, to Shou Fu Kan in both the local productions and overseas tour of the stage adaptation of Thunderbolt Fantasy, a Taiwanese puppet drama. In 2019, Nanami decided to retire from the Takarazuka revue, stating that she had: ‚Äú...decided I wanted to leave at the time when I could show my fans the best possible otokoyaku I could be.\\" Nanami Hiroki resigned from the Takarazuka revue on March 24th, 2019, after sixteen years as an actress with the company.  Post-Takarazuka career  Three months after her retirement from the Takarazuka Revue, Nanami announced her signing with Andstir entertainment and the King Records music label. She made her post- Takarazuka artist debut with the release of her first mini album, 'Galaxy', and an accompanying one-man live show with a four-concert run in Tokyo and Osaka. At the same time, she announced her post-Takarazuka seiyuu debut as Shizuno in Satelight‚Äôs Somali and the Forest Spirit. On November 8, 2019, she was instated as a cultural ambassador for Ibaraki Prefecture. Her first theatrical performance post-Takarazuka was the titular role of Red, in Red and Bear, an original musical which ran from January 24, 2020, to February 2, 2020 at the Sunshine Theatre in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, Japan. In addition to her voiceover, theatrical, and musical work, Nanami currently hosts a weekly radio show on Tokyo FM, and a television program on the Takarazuka Revue‚Äôs television channel, Takarazuka Skystage.

It was constructed in 1907 after a local resident won a High Court ruling against the South Staffordshire Waterworks Company for poor water- supply pressure. The brick tower held a cast-iron water tank at a height of to provide sufficient hydraulic head to improve water pressure. Constructed on Scalpcliffe Hill, the tower is visible from across the town and is a well known local landmark. The tower ceased to have any role in water supply in the 1990s but has since been used as a radio tower.  Description  Winshill Water Tower is one of Burton upon Trent's most prominent buildings, visible on the skyline from far afield, and has been used as a landmark by road and rail travellers for decades. It is constructed atop Scalpcliffe Hill, from which there are views across most of the town, and lies close to Winshill's boundary with Brizlincote parish. The tower stands adjacent to a small section of woodland known as Waterloo Clump which was planted by local people to commemorate the Duke of Wellington's victory in 1815. On the Brizlincote side of the hill an area of woodland, planted by the National Forest Company, has been named Tower Woods after the landmark. The tower is constructed on an thick concrete foundation that is square. The exterior is brickwork, largely brown brindle Staffordshire bricks laid in English bond, with details picked out in different coloured bricks. The top of the tower is castellated. Inside the tower, at a height of and supported on rolled steel joists atop a brick pier, stood a cast-iron water tank. Water was pumped to this tank to provide the necessary pressure to supply the houses of Winshill. The tank measured by and in service was kept full to a level of by a float-operated valve, providing a head of water exactly above sea level. The tank was fed by water pumped up a pipe internal to the structure, to protect it from freezing. History  In the early 20th century the residents of Winshill complained about the poor water pressure from their taps. One resident, Harry Mills Barrow, took the South Staffordshire Waterworks Company to the High Court, at his own expense, over the matter in 1905. In 1906 the court decided in his favour and compelled the water company to remedy the situation. For his efforts, Barrow was rewarded with a sum of money and an illuminated house sign, that remained in use at an address in Ashby Road until the 1960s. Construction of the water tower was carried out in 1907 and the Burton Town Council made a contribution of ¬£1,000 towards the costs. The tower was originally supplied from the nearby water main in Ashby Road via an electric pump in Hamilton Road. The feed was later switched to the company's water main in Saxon Street (Stapenhill), which was the main supply to Burton from the pumping station at Chilcote. The Ashby Road supply was maintained as a backup. During the First World War local scouts mounted a guard on the tower, primarily as fire wardens, owing to the fear of German invasion or Zeppelin attack. The town would become one of the first in Britain to be attacked by German strategic bombing when a Zeppelin raid of 31 January 1916 killed 15 people and wounded 72. During the 1960s the South Staffordshire Waterworks Company installed aerials onto the tower as part of a short-wave radio system used by its engineers to contact the company headquarters. Other antennas and mobile-phone masts have since been added, particularly since the tower lost its role in water supply in the 1990s. The tower remains in the ownership of South Staffordshire Water.

Biography  Louisa Elizabeth How was born in England in 1821 and married James How, a labourer from Malvern, Worcestershire. They and their two sons, William (b. 1844) and Edward (b. 1848?) arrived at Port Phillip aboard the Royal George on 28 November 1849 under the assisted passage scheme.Persons on Bounty Ships Arriving at Port Phillip: Assisted Passage 1849-51. Series: State Archives & Records NSW, NSW Government 4/4817, reel 2145 In Melbourne James How was employed by Joseph Raleigh, a merchant and wharf owner and by 1857 was listed as one of the principal directors of How, Walker & Co., a merchant and shipping business started by a relative, Robert How. The family resided at 'Woodlands', next door to the present-day Admiralty House on Kirribilli Point, North Sydney.  Early photographer  How, whose surviving output is found in one album made over only two years, was evidently an accomplished and enthusiastic artist whose photographic knowledge was derived, historians surmise, from any of several possible sources; perhaps from practitioners in England before migrating, from her reading, or from local contacts, or any combination of those. Most likely she read the several extensive and instructive articles on the processes of photography that she herself used, in her copy of the English Art-Journal from vol.12, of 1850; in fact, it is presumed that the first photograph How made was of a Richard Austin Artlett engraving from the same volume, a portrait on page 297 of Emma Jane, Dowager Countess of Darnley after the unfinished painting by Sir Thomas Lawrence,Isobel Crombie, 'Louisa Elizabeth How, Pioneer Photographer', Australian Business Collector (1984), pp.82-6. now in the British Museum. Robert Hunt on pages 38ff of the Art-Journal discusses the advantages of negatives on glass and decries the patent laws preventing development in England as rapid as that in France in photography; instructions and advice appear on p. 147 for those who \\"are at a distance from other sources of information‚Äù on the construction and use of a camera, and the selection of lenses; a report on M. Blanquart-Evrard‚Äôs ‚ÄòImprovements in Photography‚Äô includes instructions for preparing and sensitising albumen paper for use ‚Äòdry‚Äô in the camera; an essay on page 261 ‚ÄúPhotography: On Paper and on Glass‚Äù notes that ‚Äúit is eleven years since Mr Fox Talbot‚Äôs‚Äù announcement of his photographic process and asserting that ‚Äúthe Talbotype at this moment remains the best and most practical of the photographic processes hitherto proposed‚Äù compared to the Daguerreotype‚Äôs ‚Äúdelicately constituted and easily destroyed image‚Äù on a ‚Äúheavy and expensive metallic plate,‚Äù the essay going on to provide detailed instructions on evenly coating glass with albumen and sensitising with ‚Äòiodide of silver‚Äô, in effect a ‚ÄòTalbotype‚Äô on glass and its transformation, with added silver in development, into a positive image. Louisa How may before her migration have been taught the medium at professional studios in England, but more likely she learned from William Hetzer to make salted paper prints from half-plate glass negatives for which the Sydney merchant was known, and for which he was the supplier of materials and the printer of his clients' negatives, including those of E.W. Ward and Robert Hunt. There are plausible claims that it was Hetzer's wife Thekla who, from 1850 assisted him at his studio at 15 Hunter Street, who was the first woman photographer in Australia, but no works known to be hers have survived. Hall and Mather suggest that Louisa Anne Meredith, nine years her senior, may have preceded How in making photographs which appear, copied as drawings, in her 1861 book Over the Straits documenting her travels in Victoria in the 1850s.  Photographic album  In the same month of 1858 that the earliest exclusively photographic exhibition was held in Australia was mounted at the Sydney Philosophical Society, How made portraits of her guests on Christmas Day and Boxing Day at Woodlands. She set up a makeshift studio on her verandah, using furniture, drapes and props including a stereoscope and stereo cards,Reeder, W. (1999). The stereograph and the album portrait in Colonial Sydney 1859‚Äì62. History of photography, 23(2), 181-186. so as to shorten exposure conditions with brighter lighting, but make it appear that the pictures were made indoors.Crombie, Isobel, 'Louisa Elizabeth How.' In The resultant prints are amongst forty-eight salted paper prints from the period October 1857 to January 1859 in her only surviving album, carefully titled and signed, which is now held in the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra. Her varied subjects include visitors to Woodlands, appearing relaxing in conversation, drinking and dining, several in groups and some of those more formal, and the rest being individual portraits; the merchants George S. Caird, Robert P. Paterson and Hendricks Anderson, the explorer William Landsborough with his Aboriginal companion 'Tiger‚Äô, the settlers Charles Morison from Glenmorison, New England and John Glen. Photography historian Gael Newton admires How's \\"fine sense of composition\\" and Judy Annear notes that her portraits are \\"most compelling, posed and yet relaxed, outdoor, convivial and engaged,\\" while Professor Martyn Jolly argues that they are rare in that they \\"take us so closely into the bodily interrelationships of colonial Australians.\\" As well as portraits, How made views of Sydney Cove, Government House, Campbell‚Äôs Wharf and around her own house and garden and its Harbourside boatshed.  Later life  The Hows remained in Woodlands until about 1866, then moved to 'Calingra' in Woollahra when, due to losses, the How merchant company had ceased business. It appears How did not continue to make photographs after this downturn in fortune. Her husband James died in about 1869, and a year later she relocated to Heaton, also in Woollahra, then moved several times before her death in 1893 at the age seventy-two.

Biography  Cheng was born in 1961 in Jiamusi, Heilongjiang, China. After graduating from high school, he worked as a truck driver from 1979 to 1984. In October 1983, he struck a horse-drawn carriage while driving, injuring one person. He was later involved in another traffic accident and decided to change his career. In 1986, Cheng tested into the Art Academy of Harbin Normal University, majoring in design. However, after his then girlfriend broke up with him, he quit his studies and moved south to Hainan Island in 1989. In the late 1980s, Hainan was designated a special economic zone by the Chinese government and attracted migrants from all over the country. Like many other migrants, however, Cheng was unable to find a job there and had to sleep on the street after spending all his money. Desperate for work, he went to a film director he had met on the ferry to Hainan for help. The director took pity on him and gave him a background role as a migrant worker in the film Hot Love (), which marked the beginning of Cheng's acting career. He then auditioned for a role (as Li Yi) in the film Tianya Liren (). Li Yi is an artist who is out of a job and becomes homeless in Hainan, which closely matched Cheng's own experience. He was therefore selected to play the role, his first credited appearance in a film. Cheng moved to Beijing in 1995. In 1998, he had his breakout role as Zhu Fu in the television series The Water Margin, based on the eponymous classical novel. He later appeared in the TV series Mission of the Warriors (Ê≠¶ÊûóÂ§ñÂè≤, 2001), Wind and Cloud (2002), The Proud Twins (2005), and Journey to the West (2010). He also starred in many films, including The Painted Veil (2006), Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons (2013) and The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2017). He was known for his freewheeling and often exaggerative performance, and is considered by many as a comedian.  Personal life  Cheng was married twice. He had a daughter and a son, Cheng Zemiao (). Cheng died on 6 November 2019 from a heart attack, aged 58.

This double markup induces a deadweight loss, because the end product is priced higher than the optimal monopoly price a vertically integrated company would set, thus leading to underproduction. This deadweight loss is additive to the loss of surplus induced by monopolistic competition. Double marginalization is considered to be clearly negative from a welfare point of view. The double markup means that the overall profit of companies is lower, consumers have to pay a higher price, and a smaller amount is consumed. All social groups are thus strictly worse off. Example Consider an industry with the following characteristics - \\\\text{Demand:}\\\\quad \\\\mathrm{Q}=10-p \\\\text{Marginal Cost:}\\\\quad \\\\mathrm{MC}= C'(\\\\mathrm{Q})=2 \\\\text{Total Profit:}\\\\quad \\\\pi = p \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{Q} - c \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{Q} In a monopolistic situation with a single integrated firm, the profit-maximizing firm would set its price at p = 6, resulting in a quantity of \\\\mathrm{Q} = 4 and a total profit of \\\\pi = 16. In a non-integrated scenario, the monopolist retailer and the monopolist manufacturer set their price independently, respectively p_r and p_m. *The retailer's profit (marginal profit * quantity sold) is given by (p_r - p_m)(10 - p_r). Thus, to maximize profits, it will set its price at p_r = 5 + 0.5p_m. * The manufacturer's profit is given by (p_m - 2)(5 - 0.5p_m). Thus, it will set its price at p_m = 6. The retailer will respond by setting its price at p_r = 8. * This results in a total quantity produced of \\\\mathrm{Q} = 2. The producer's profit is 4, and the retailer's profit is 8. Not only the total profit is lower than in the integrated scenario, but the price is higher, thus reducing the consumer surplus. Solutions There are numerous mechanisms to prevent or at least limit double marginalization. These include, among others, the following. * Vertical integration: A merger of the company concerned ensures that pricing is chosen from a corporate point of view. Equivalent to this is a cartel of the companies concerned. * Franchise fee: The first company sells the second the right to distribute their products through a one-off price, the so-called franchise fee, which is independent of the quantity sold. In addition, a price per piece sold will be charged. If this unit price is chosen to exactly match the marginal costs of production, it is best for the second company to choose the monopoly price for the final product. Profits make the first company here just above the franchise fee. * Nonlinear pricing: The first company does not charge a quantity-independent price per item, but makes the unit price dependent on the total quantity sold. If the discount scheme is optimally selected, it corresponds exactly to the franchise solution. * Resale price maintenance: The first company prescribes the second the selling price of the final product. * Competition: If a manufacturer sells its products through competing dealers, competition among them reduces the second markup. Note that the above mechanisms only solve the problem of double marginalization. From the point of view of overall welfare, however, the problem of monopoly pricing remains. It should also be noted that some of the solutions presented above, such as mergers or cartels, are damaging in horizontal competition but positive in vertical competition as described here, as they have the advantage of preventing the double markup. References The phenomenon of double markup was already anticipated in the 19th century by the French mathematician Augustin Cournot (1838).

Mathilde was a musician and suffragette, and was imprisoned twice, also for smashing windows, and was a founder of London's women's chess club and active vegetarian.  Life and suffrage activism  Elsie and sister Mathilde Wolff Van Sandau (also known as 'Matilda') were the granddaughters of Dr. E. Schwabe, private chaplain to the Duchess of Kent. Mathilde was a pianist, a music teacher and became a founder member of the London Ladies Chess Club, and became a leader in vegetarian groups. Black Friday - police and suffragette The Wolff Van Sandau sisters joined the militant Women's Social and Political Union protesting on women's right to vote. They were among the three hundred women brutally attacked by police and men in the crowd for about six hours, on what is known as 'Black Friday' on 18 November 1910, when the women's deputation approached the House of Commons but were prevented from entering. Over 100 women were arrested, including Miss Wolff de Sandau, as noted in the following day's Times newspaper but all women were eventually released, without charge. Elsie's activism included joining the two hundred women, organised on 1st and 4 March 1912, to carry out what was a second wave of window smashing protests in Covent Garden, London. This took place at the same time as the Parliament was debating a Conciliation Bill (for some women to get the right to vote, which was not passed). Meanwhile, Mathilde, with Katie Mills, was arrested for smashing the windows of the Howick Place Post Office: postal services were seen by suffragettes as a 'symbol of oppressive male government'.  Hunger strike  poster showing a suffragette being force-fed Elsie Van Sandau was sent to prison and immediately went on hunger strike. Suffragettes on hunger strike were frequently force-fed and objected to this 'treatment' as well as being treated as criminals not as 'political' prisoners. A roll-call of those being released, excluding Patricia Woodlock, who got a longer sentence was created (probably for the WSPU welcome event). In recognition of Elsie Van Sandau's suffering in prison, the WSPU awarded her a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' designed by Christabel Pankhurst, with the ribbon in the colours of the women's suffrage movement - green, white and purple, representing 'hope, purity and dignity' and a bar dated 4 March 1912. The presentation box was inscribed > ELSIE WOLFF VAN SANDAU - BY THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL & POLITICAL UNION IN > RECOGNITION OF A GALLANT ACTION, WHEREBY THROUGH ENDURANCE TO THE LAST > EXTREMITY OF HUNGER AND HARDSHIP, A GREAT PRINCIPLE OF POLITICAL JUSTICE WAS > VINDICATED. National Archive record lists suffragette prisoners, including Elsie and Mathilde Wolff Van Sandau, who were officially pardoned when the WSPU discontinued militancy at the start of World War One.  First women's chess club  In 1895, Mathilde had set up one of the first women's chess clubs, being elected as the first vice-president of the London Ladies Chess Club, which initially had to compete against men's clubs. She hosted chess committee meetings at her home 49 Elgin Crescent. Mathilde also advertised her music teaching and performances and availability for a more formal school engagement in the chess club magazine.  Women leading in vegetarian societies  In 1897, Mathilde, a confirmed vegetarian was among those who performed to an audience of 700, at the 4th International Vegetarian Congress in London. Later in her life, Mathilde Wolff van Sandau was chosen to be the honorary secretary of Brighton and Hove Vegetarian Society. How the Wollf Van Sandau sisters lived during or after the First World War, and when and where they died is not known.

It was first performed at the Teatro Pubblico in Reggio Emilia in 1719, with designs by Pietro Righini. The first production included Francesco Borosini in the title role, Antonio Bernacchi (Tamerlano), Marina Benta Bulgarelli (Asteria), Faustina Bordoni (Irene), Diana Vico (Andronico), Antonio Piasi (Clearco), Battista Roberti (Leone) and Girolamo Bartoluzzi Regiano (Zaida). A second production was staged in Venice in 1723. Three versions of the work are known, but it is only the 1719 one for which all the music is known to have survived. Composition Bajazet was a nearly complete rewrite of Tamerlano - there are only six arias in common between them. The rewriting was prompted by the need to rework the material around the renowned tenor Francesco Borosini. The original libretto by Agostino Piovene was extensively rewritten by Ippolito Zanelli - the role of Bajazet was expanded and made central to the new work, with his suicide now shown on stage rather than merely described. The number of parts and the distribution of arias also changed significantly between Tamerlano and Bajazet. Musically the focus of Tamerlano was Asteria, who had 9 arias, with only 6 for Bajazet and 5 for Tamerlano. The parts in Bajazet are more evenly balanced, and the minor characters were rewritten and given more arias to sing.

Handel had already written his own opera Tamerlano on the basis of the 1711 Piovene libretto, simplifying it by eliminating all the secondary characters except Leone. However when Borosini showed him the score for Bajazet he rewrote his own material again, adding in a death scene for Borosini in the title role. The libretto Handel eventually used was written for him by Nicola Francesco Haym and amalgamated elements from Gasparini‚Äôs libretto from both 1711 and 1719. Handel also cut much of the recitative in Gasparini‚Äôs version, as was his usual practice. Modern revival Gasparini‚Äôs 1719 score may have been performed once of twice after the Reggio Emilia production, but the work was then neglected until 2014, when it was revived by Auser Musici and performed at the Opera Barga Festival.

He was convicted of killing three elderly pensioners during robberies between 1984 and 1996, receiving life imprisonment for his crimes. He is currently incarcerated at Corradino prison. Murders A native of ≈ªejtun, Mangion, also known by his alias \\"Kalang\\", was an unemployed schizophrenic who had depressive episodes. He was also addicted to alcohol and prescription medication. At the time of the murders, however, it was determined that he was fully aware of his actions and did them by his own volition, the motive always being robbery. Rozina Zammit On February 8, 1994, the body of the 54-year-old was found at the doorsteps of her home in Safi. Zammit had sustained 37 stab wounds to her neck, chest, and abdomen. The motive appeared to be robbery, as a small sum of 200 liri were found to be stolen from her home. Mangion confessed to stalking the woman to her home on the day of the murder and knocking on her front door. When Rozina opened, Silvio attacked her and she began shouting. He stabbed her and went to get the money, but, realizing that she had died from her injuries, fled the scene. Maria Stella Magrin On October 30, 1986, 68-year-old Magrin, who lived only a few doors down from former President Ugo Mifsud Bonnici in Cospicua, heard a knock on her door and opened without asking who it was. Three men, Mangion and uncle- nephew duo Leli and Oswaldo Spiteri, entered into the house and demanded that she gave them all her money. Maria guided them through the house with a torchlight, as there was no electricity, and handed them a sum of around 15,000 Euro. Magrin was then stabbed 13 times by Mangion, to prevent identification, as none of the criminals had worn masks, before all of them left. She later died from her injuries. Francesco \\"Frenc\\" Cassar On August 16, 1998, Silvio decided to rob his neighbors: 71-year-old Giuseppa and 75-year-old Francesco \\"Frenc\\" Savario Cassar. After he swallowed some pills and drank some pills to pluck up courage, he rang the Cassars' doorbell, surprising Giuseppa with a knife when she opened the door. He stabbed her in the stomach and right arm, but she managed to fight back, calling upon her brother for help. Mangion saw Francesco and lunged at him, fatally stabbing him in the chest. Seeing Cassar lying bleeding on the ground and his T-shirt covered in blood frightened him, so he fled, disposing of his knife and T-shirt in a reservoir at President Anton Buttigieg Street. Trial, imprisonment and confessions Some time after the Cassar murder, Mangion was arrested and soon indicted. During a November 26, 2002 hearing, jurors determined that he was sane at the time of the murder, and on January 5, 2004, at the beginning of his jury trial, he pleaded guilty. Mangion was given a 21-year sentence for killing Frenc and attempting to kill Giuseppa. The other murders remained a mystery until a year after Mangion's conviction, when he implicated himself as the one responsible to several inmates at Corradino prison, one of them being Steven Spiteri. Steven later reported those claims to the police, and Silvio was questioned on their validity, to which he confessed. He also implicated the Spiteris, but, by then, Leli had already died in 2000 and Oswaldo had committed suicide, hanging himself while in custody. Silvio was asked to walk the investigators through the crime scene, explaining the layout accurately. At some point during the trial proceedings, one inspector inquired about two peculiar tattoos Mangion had on each ear: one had the letter 'S', while the other had a 'K'. In response, the murderer joked that it stood for 'serial killer'. On June 23, 2010, Silvio Mangion was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Rozina Zammit, and was given another life sentence for the murder of Maria Magrin at a later date.

History The parish (parochia de Trembleium) was established a long time ago and became the property of Saint-Denis Abbey in the 9th century. A church dedicated to Saint Medard was mentioned in 1163. Several elements of the foundation are said to date back to the Merovingian period. Three tombs of that time were found on the site. Several stone blocks from the 13th century were found in the base of the church. However, the choir of the current building dates back to 1543, and the nave to the 18th century. In 1781, at the request of intendant Louis B√©nigne Fran√ßois Bertier de Sauvigny, architect Jacques Cellerier offered to re-build the nave and the belltower without altering the foundations. This project led to further restoration works in the 19th century. The church of Saint-M√©dard was listed as a Class Historic Monument in 1939. The church is adorned with liturgical furniture made by sculptor Jacques Dieudonn√©: an altar, an ambon, crosses and candlesticks.

It was ordered by Supreme National Security Council and imposed by the Ministry of ICT. The blackout was one of the Iranian government's efforts to suppress fuel protests. During the blackout, Iranian citizens could only access the National Information Network. Mohammad-Javad Jahromi was sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury because of his role in Internet censorship in Iran.  Extent  The 2019 blackout was the most wide- scale internet shutdown ever in Iran. It was \\"the most severe disconnection tracked by NetBlocks in any country in terms of its technical complexity and breadth.\\" Although It was a near-total shutdown, top Iranian politicians still had access to the Internet. The 2019 blackout was the first-ever and longest total Internet shutdown in a large country. It was also the first blackout that effectively isolated a whole nation. Doug Madory, the director of Internet analysis at Oracle, has described the operation as \\"unusual in its scale\\" and way more advanced. Iranians usually use VPNs to access social media, but none of them worked during the shutdown. As a result of that, some people used Toosheh to get news and other Internet-related content. A new study by, Human Rights organization, Article 19 has revealed how Iranian authorities were able to cut off the internet of tens of millions of Iranian people in November 2019. And use another \\"local\\" type of Internet instead. This study outlines the structure of Iran's Internet and provides a picture of control that is unparalleled anywhere in the world. This consolidation of technologies means that Iran is in a unique position to exercise control over its citizens' Internet.  Execution  It took 24 hours for MICT to cut off people's access to the Internet. The ministry had to order a range of ISPs and mobile data providers to stop providing users with international network and connect to NIN. Some providers withdrew their routes from the Internet and some continued to announce routes but block traffic. Although the global network was not accessible, local services including banks, state-run messaging apps, and vehicle for hire mobile apps continued to operate through National Information Network. State-owned web search engines and GPS navigation software were also enabled.  Timeline and statistics  Users first reported minor outages in Mashhad on 15 November. The disruptions increased in extent and severity with impact also visible on overall connectivity charts. Iran's largest mobile network operators, including MCI, Rightel and Irancell, fell offline on the evening of 16 November. The Internet blocking gradually increased until the country reached the point of total shutdown. By 20 November, national connectivity was at 5% of ordinary levels. On 23 November, NetBlocks reported that \\"Internet access is being restored in Iran and connectivity levels have risen to 64%\\".  Impact  Iranians couldn't contact their friends and families abroad through the Internet. Hundreds of currency exchanges and travel agencies closed down. Movie ticket sales dropped 60%. Estimates of total damage to the economy range from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The Washington Post reported that the blackout has had a severe impact on start-ups and small businesses.

He is best remembered today for his lavish, 40-day-long funeral ceremony of 1919, reputedly the most expensive ever held in Java. Family background Tan Tjin Kie was born in Cirebon to the Peranakan couple Oey Te Nio and Luitenant Tan Tiang Keng (1826‚Äì1884), later raised to the post of Kapitein der Chinezen of Cirebon ‚Äì Chinese headman ‚Äì in 1882. The institution of Chinese officers was a civil arm of the colonial bureaucracy, through which the Dutch authorities governed their Chinese subjects in the Indies. Through his father, Tan was a grandson and grandnephew of Cirebon‚Äôs earlier Chinese headmen: Tan Kim Lin, who was Kapitein from the early 1830s until his death in 1835; and Tan Phan Long, who was Kapitein from 1836 until his retirement in 1846. He was also a great-grandson of Tan Kong Djan, Kapitein der Chinezen of Cirebon in the 1820s. In line with Chinese naming conventions, he acquired at least three other known names over the course of his life in addition to his birth name, Tjin Kie, which was taboo to younger family members. His courtesy name as an adult was Keng Bie, while his government name as an official was Sie Hoen. His school name was Boen Siang. Bureaucratic career Aged 29, Tan was installed as a Luitenant der Chinezen in 1882, the year his father acceded to the Captaincy of Cirebon. On his father‚Äôs death in 1884, Luitenant Tan Tjin Kie was passed over in the succession in favor of an older Chinese officer, befitting the established custom of the time. That year, however, saw the elevation to the post of Luitenant der Chinezen of Tan‚Äôs two in-laws, the cousins Kwee Keng Eng and Kwee Keng Liem, husbands respectively of the Luitenant‚Äôs sister Tan Oen Tok Nio and cousin Tjoe Soei Lan Nio. In 1886, another in-law, Aw Seng Hoe, husband of the Luitenant‚Äôs cousin Tan An Nio, was appointed as Luitenant der Chinezen of Majalengka. When the Captaincy again became vacant in 1888, Luitenant Tan Tjin Kie, aged 35, finally succeeded to the headman post of Kapitein of Cirebon, an office once occupied by his father, granduncle, grandfather and great-grandfather. In 1893, Kapitein Tan Tjin Kie received an honorary imperial appointment from the Guangxu Emperor of China as a Mandarin of the Second Rank (To-Ham). A rare promotion to Mandarin of the First Rank (To-Wan) followed in 1908. In 1909, the Dutch authorities awarded the Kapitein with the Gouden Ster voor Trouw en Verdienste, the highest rank in the colonial equivalent of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. A hallmark of Kapitein Tan Tjin Kie‚Äôs tenure was his management, in Cirebon, of the Java- wide communal infighting of 1912 between local Chinese and Arabs. Tan negotiated a peace deal with leaders of the Arab community, and ‚Äì in a widely applauded and brave move ‚Äì led a procession of 50 Chinese community leaders to Cirebon‚Äôs Arab district to confirm the agreement. In so doing, the Kapitein was widely credited with the maintenance of peace and order in Cirebon, which contrasted with the many lost lives in the rest of Java. In 1913, in celebration of Tan‚Äôs 25th-year jubilee as a Chinese officer and in recognition of his role in resolving the Arab-Chinese conflict of 1912, the Dutch colonial government elevated the Kapitein to the rank of Majoor-titulair der Chinezen. This rare mark of esteem was only once awarded in the whole history of the Chinese officership of Cirebon; unlike the colonial capitals of Batavia, Semarang and Surabaya, Cirebon's Chinese community was normally headed by a Kapitein instead of the higher-ranked Majoor. Courtier and philanthropist The Tan family of Cirebon lived as part of the royal courts of Cirebon for generations, and were keen patrons of Javanese art and culture. Majoor- titulair Tan Tjin Kie was part of this tradition, collecting Javanese masks, puppets and rare manuscripts, and maintaining private gamelan orchestras. Beyond Cirebon, the Majoor also maintained close relations with Pakubuwono X, the Susuhunan of Surakarta and Java‚Äôs premier native prince. The latter visited Majoor-titulair Tan Tjin Kie a number of times, including in 1916, when the Susuhunan stayed at the Majoor‚Äôs palatial residence in Loewoenggadjah. As the highest-ranking Chinese bureaucrat in Cirebon and head of the city‚Äôs oldest bureaucratic Chinese family, Majoor-titulair Tan Tjin Kie supported many social causes. For instance, he was an important donor behind the founding of the Ziekenhuis Oranje (today Gunung Jati State Hospital). Within the local Chinese community, he continued the long association between the Chinese officership and , Cirebon‚Äôs most important Chinese temple. In 1889, he inaugurated a plaque to celebrate the temple‚Äôs renovation under his patronage, noting that an earlier renovation was completed in 1830 under the auspices of his great-grandfather, Kapitein Tan Kong Djan. The Majoor was President of Kong Djoe Koan, a funeral service foundation, and Bechermheer (Patron) of Hok Sioe Hwee, a Chinese funeral trust. Similarly, he was also the founder and Bechermheer of the Confucian revival and educational organization Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan in Cirebon. Death, funeral and posterity Majoor- titulair Tan Tjin Kie died in office in 1919. By his wife, Ong Hwie Nio, Tan had two sons, Tan Gin Ho and Tan Gin Han, and a daughter, Tan Ho Lie Nio. His eldest son, Tan Gin Ho, and his son-in-law, Kwee Tjiong In, served as Luitenants der Chinezen, the former from 1898 until 1913, and the latter from 1907 until 1910, then again from 1913 until 1920. His younger son, Tan Gin Han, married Phoa Kiat Liang, a grandniece of the community leader Phoa Keng Hek, and a great-granddaughter of Phoa Tjeng Tjoan, Kapitein der Chinezen of Buitenzorg. The late Majoor‚Äôs magnificent, 40-day-long funeral ceremony was reputed to have been the most expensive ever to have been held in Java. Preceded by eight military bands from Batavia and Bandung, the procession itself was divided into nine sections. Accompanied by a platoon of police officers sent by Johan Paul, Count van Limburg-Stirum, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, there was a four-horse carriage with a portrait of the deceased. After a procession of members of various organizations and schoolchildren under the late Majoor‚Äôs patronage, his coffin arrived in a four-horse carriage, pulled in addition by 250 coolies in uniform. The funeral service itself was presided by Tibetan Buddhist Lamas, brought over from Tibet. De Preangerbode, a colonial newspaper, estimated the funeral and associated costs at 280,000 guilders, excluding a 300,000-guilder mausoleum built for the deceased Majoor by his children. In today‚Äôs currency (2019), the combined sum of the funeral and mausoleum amounted to a multimillion-US dollar fortune.

For the residents of Warsaw, Annopol is known for being a tram terminus, with several Warsaw tram lines stopping here, and it is also an industrial centre. History In the second half of the 19th century, on the territory of the Marywil farm, a fortress was erected here, known as Fort XIV Marywil or Pelcowizna. The task of this fort was, among others, to cover of the route of the Vistula River. By order of January 31, 1909, the fort was liquidated and eventually destroyed in the summer of 1913. Construction of a canal began to the north of the fort. A housing estate for construction workers of the canal was built in 1927 and the area became known as Annopol. The canal, completed after World War II, was named the ≈ªera≈Ñski Canal (Kana≈Ç ≈ªera≈Ñski). The area was developed for industrial purposes, with the canal able to accommodate for 1350-ton barges.

She started in the beauty industry as a teenager finding acceptance for being a young gender non-conforming, gay, Black man in the South. Through her celebrity clients she became a semi-regular on The Real Housewives of Atlanta (RHOA), appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, talking about her experiences on RHOA, and co-hosted the three seasons of Fashion Queens, all three shows on Bravo, which led to cameos on Lee Daniels‚Äô Empire series. From 2016-2019 she co-starred as Miss Bruce in Daniels‚Äô musical drama Star. In 2019 she was cast as Miss Freddy in Daniels‚Äô upcoming biographical drama The United States vs. Billie Holiday.  Early life and education  Lawrence Washington was born circa 1982/1983, and grew up in a working class family in South Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta is the state‚Äôs capital, and at around age ten, Lawrence was a House page on the floor of the Georgia House of Representatives. She said ‚Äúgrowing up gay and Black on the South side of Atlanta was challenging because I could not find any images of people that resembled me.‚Äù While her family did accept her, they would pose questions, and Lawrence felt that her explanations were not understood. They made her join the Boy Scouts, but ‚Äúthat shit didn't work out. They tried all those things and they were of that era.‚Äù Later, when in high school, she was made to join the football team, the locker room being the only aspect she enjoyed. Her parents thought the American Dream was to be a white-collar professional, or sports star. She credits them for instilling the strength to be herself, ‚ÄúI exude confidence because my parents made me feel OK with being myself. Of course, they had questions, but they never put me down.‚Äù Her favorite show while growing up was Fame, the 1980s musical drama set in a fictional New York City high school for the performing arts. Lawrence herself was in musical theatre, and the performing arts in high school but said she did not feel accepted compared to other students. In her teens she toured Europe as part of a musical group but did not feel comfortable in the tuxedos they wore. She started experimenting with make-up, and then with fashions, ‚ÄúI loved ostentatious pieces. I loved pieces that were whimsical and that wasn't normal‚Äù. In an interview she shared that she‚Äôs always been ‚Äúflamboyant and fashion flexible‚Äù but that was not considered acceptable for a young black man in the South, she said ‚ÄúI experienced a lot of psychological dismemberment with my passion because of societal norms‚Äù. She feels gay people have to learn how to navigate the streets totally different than straight people. The negative reactions she got persuaded her to pursue the beauty industry instead of performing arts, as she has ‚Äúalways had a keen interest in women and their beauty‚Äù. In the late 1990s, at age fifteen, she started as an intern in the beauty industry, and said it gave her the freedom to explore who she could become; ‚ÄúThat is where I realized exactly who I was: where I saw all of my feminine traits and how they crossed paths with my masculine traits.‚Äù She trained to be a hairstylist at the Paul Mitchell Institute. Her parents felt hair stylists were not respected, but Lawrence was determined. She felt the salon was a place that as a feminist she found her passion, ‚Äúbeing able to go to a salon every day and interact with so many different people allows you a space to be free. It's a very freeing space.‚Äù She has loyalty to women, as they were first to accept her, beginning with her mother and sister. When asked what identifying as gender non-conforming meant, Lawrence states, ‚ÄúBeing a gay, gender-non-conforming man means that I‚Äôve never bought into what society thinks a man should look like or act like‚Äîor what a woman should look like and act like. I‚Äôm a person who is very in-tune with my masculine side and my feminine side. I embrace both and I walk with both. It‚Äôs been very important that I display that at every opportunity on a public platform and in my every day walk.‚Äù Ballroom culture In interviews, Lawrence talks about the history of, and her involvement in drag ball culture, a social network of houses for mainly Black and Hispanic LGBTQ youth. When her biological family did not really understand her, she found family ‚Äúin ballroom culture or in gay families. Ballroom is one of those things. It's magical.‚Äù Her mentor is Raquell Lord, a founding member of The House of Balenciaga, an Atlanta ballroom family. The vogue and ballroom culture, as seen in the FX series Pose, has houses, that stage performative competitions which also provide ‚Äúsupport networks, mentorship and a place to sleep‚Äù when needed. As of October 2017, Lawrence is a house mother named Mother Balenciaga. In May 2019, Lawrence and Bevy Smith were among the celebrity guests to Andr√© Leon Talley‚Äôs L‚Äôhommage gala which ‚Äúhonored the pioneers and stars of ballroom,‚Äù and benefited FIERCE (Fabulous, Independent, Educated, Radicals for Community Empowerment). In June 2019, Lawrence was a celebrity judge at Life Ball III, produced by Susanne Bartsch with the Council of Fashion Designers of America, it marks the 30th anniversary of the first Life Ball, all of which have been fundraisers to end the AIDS pandemic.  Career   Real Housewives of Atlanta  Lawrence owns Pressed For Time, a midtown salon, and Lawrence Washington Salon, both in Atlanta; over time she built up a clientele including corporate professionals. Notable clients include the ladies of Bravo‚Äôs The Real Housewives of Atlanta (RHOA), Jennifer Holiday, Ciara, Serena Williams and Kenya Moore, the first celebrity she styled. She came to national attention on RHOA, a Southern regional version of the series focused on upper class women of the city, as a confidante and hairstylist of Shere√© Whitfield, and later, Kenya Moore. Lawrence was asked to join as part of a storyline as hairstylist which was her career at that point. According to Paper, she won over audiences with her charm, and ‚Äúunwavering commitment‚Äù to her authentic self. In March 2011, Lawrence was announced as joining \\"The Steve Harvey Project,\\" a television behind-the-scenes version of his daily four-hour syndicated radio show, The Steve Harvey Morning Show on BET‚Äôs Centric channel. Lawrence hosts ‚ÄúSpilling the Tea With Miss Lawrence,‚Äù a segment covering entertainment and fashion, saying ‚ÄúThey picked the right girl for this one\\". Tea is Southern black drag queen slang for gossip or truth. Before these experiences Lawrence had never thought of being an actor, as she had never seen someone like herself represented. In season three of RHOA (2011), Lawrence was featured performing her first single ‚ÄúCloset Freak,‚Äù in RHOA‚Äôs Kandi Burruss‚Äô studio where she recorded the ‚Äúempowering dance anthem‚Äù which called out a closeted lover. In a March 2013 interview Lawrence revealed that she had declined the 360 deal to be signed to Burris‚Äô Kandi Koated Entertainment instead of a traditional recording contract. In a 360 deal the label fronts expenses and develops an artist for a significant percentage of all sales. Lawrence reasoned it was unfair as she would not be getting any signing bonus, and was developed as a singer with vocal training, and as an artist before the two met. Even though Lawrence co-wrote ‚ÄúCloset Freak,‚Äù she was not paid for singing it or any work she did. She also released \\"Over It,\\" and in March 2012, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop,‚Äù a maxi-single with remixes by Mancias and Craig C. She shared that even though she loves singing, as of 2013, a career in the industry was on hold as she had to be pragmatic about where her income was generated. Lawrence has a line of hypoallergenic lipsticks, Les Levres (French for lips); a line of t-shirts, Signed by a Queen, using her own quotes; and, Androgyny Hair, a line of hair extensions.  Fashion Queens  Multiple appearances on RHOA led to Andy Cohen asking her to co-host Bravo‚Äôs Fashion Queens (FQ), filmed in New York City from 2013-2015, along with fellow Atlanta hairstylist Derek J, and New York‚Äôs fashion expert Bevy Smith. Lawrence and Derek J had previously found a natural working chemistry working several times at Bonner Brothers Hair Shows‚Äîan Atlanta ‚Äúover-the-top annual spectacular‚Äù convention of 20,000 attendees celebrating hair in black culture‚Äîdoing show commentary. Then RHOA producers paired them again for a one-off show, Real Hairstylists Tell All, without any promotion, according to Lawrence, they had 1.4 million viewers. Bravo‚Äôs Cohen asked if they would do a new but expanded show which became FQ. On FQ the three conducted various segments focused on ‚Äúpraising and critiquing the sartorial choices celebs make each week‚Äù. Lawrence said of his personality on the show, ‚ÄúI have always been me, I've always been flamboyant, always been gender non-conforming.‚Äù Lawrence counts as friend and mentor television host and ‚Äústyle aficionada‚Äù Bevy Smith. They were concerned if the ratings would be enough, given the late time slot and the show being hosted by two flamboyant gay black men and a full-figure woman, but according to Lawrence they never dipped below 700,000 viewers. Lawrence and Derek J also co-host Spilling the Tea, a web series on Bravo.com recapping RHOA each week. Lawrence has also made appearances on talk shows The Real, and Bethenny. As of 2019, she is represented by The Chamber Group. Lawrence had met openly gay director Lee Daniels in Beverly Hills, later on she was having fun re-enacting an Empire scene in a FQ dressing room, and co- host Smith emailed it to Daniels. He reached out to Lawrence asking for a singing audition tape. She sent him one of her performing Sylvester‚Äôs \\"You Make Me Feel (Might Real),\\" which she later performed on Empire. Daniels had her filming scenes, as herself, in Chicago in Summer 2015. Of the experience she said, \\"I'm a very spiritual person. I had to go into a space of thanks. Give thanks to my higher being.\\" Her cameo came in the second season premiere of the show, Lawrence was featured singing the Sylvester hit. Lawrence cites Sylvester, as well as Big Freedia, known as the queen of bounce music, as inspirations. In late 2015 Lawrence announced she would no longer appear on RHOA due to what she saw as the cast: appropriating LGBTQ culture, acting homophobic, and not holding accountable anyone for homophobic violence as seen on the show; held in tension with her need to be a responsible LGBTQ social activist. She said, ‚ÄúThe one episode where Kenya Moore's [‚Äúgay best friend/assistant‚Äù Brandon Deshazer] got beat up at Nene's party, no one was held accountable, there was no real apology put in place. I knew then that was not a place to occupy my time. I knew that there‚Äôs no way I can call myself a social activist and be a real activist for my community on that show.‚Äù The Atlanta Journal-Constitution‚Äôs Rodney Ho said it was ‚Äúone of the most violent fights in the six-year history of the program.‚Äù Lawrence was also angry that the RHOA producers just allowed the attack to happen. She also felt she was a ‚Äútoken gay for entertainment purposes‚Äù on the show.  Star  Lawrence auditioned for Star‚Äîa musical drama set in Atlanta about three aspiring young women hoping to be the next Destiny‚Äôs Child‚Äîeven though Daniels already knew she was ideal for the role. Lawrence credits Star, filmed in metro Atlanta, for having a diverse cast and characters. For the first two seasons of Star, Lawrence cites two of her favorite moments as when she sang ‚ÄúGooder Than A Mother‚Äù with Queen Latifah during the first season, and singing Diana Ross‚Äô ‚ÄúThe Boss‚Äù in the second season. Her character, Miss Bruce, is ‚Äúoutspoken, real, and gutter‚Äù and is also gender non-conforming, Black and gay; Lawrence said of her character, ‚ÄúMiss Bruce is a kind of unpolished but very talented person who hasn‚Äôt really experienced a fair shot at life because he is very gender fluid.‚Äù Lawrence finds the character liberating, as her own insecurities are irrelevant as Miss Bruce is fearless. Her role caused her estranged father of twenty years to reach out. On October 21, 2016, Lawrence was an invited guest at BET‚Äôs ‚ÄúLove & Happiness‚Äù farewell party for the Obama‚Äôs, the last in a series of concerts the first couple hosted at the White House. In their eight years there, they became known for hosting concerts, including a lengthy roster of hip hop performers. BET‚Äôs event was packed with Black celebrities, and was a celebration of Black culture; the crowd celebrated the historic first Black president unaware that Trump would become his successor until a few weeks later. Lawrence wore a gold kimono and gold heels, with long eyelashes and red lipstick; on the dance floor she vogued to The Clark Sisters‚Äô ‚ÄúYou Brought the Sunshine,‚Äù and noticed the crowd staring. Her friend Bevy Smith told her to look behind, and she saw Barack Obama dancing along with her, later stating in the moment she felt uniquely validated as a Black gay man by the ‚Äúmost famous Black man in the world‚Äù. She felt Obama ‚Äúset a new standard for what love and acceptance looked like‚Äù, and it helped her get along with straight black men better. She said it was the ‚Äúmost affirming moment in life‚Äù. Later, at Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs‚Äô Miami New Year's Eve party, she was shocked to be hugged by Diddy, and realized there are straight Black men who have love for the gays. In June 2017, Lawrence was the featured performer for the Native Son Awards, an event celebrating ‚Äúthe achievements of Black gay men.‚Äù Also in June 2017, Lawrence performed in San Francisco at Soul of Pride‚Äôs Pink Ball, part of San Francisco Pride‚Äôs events for LGBTQ people of color. In October 2017, Lawrence performed as part of the Atlanta AfroPunk Festival. In May 2018, Lawrence was the featured entertainer at Harlem EatUp!, ‚Äúrecognizing the diversity in arts, culture and food,‚Äù an event honoring designer Dapper Dan, and Bevy Smith. Post-Star projects In 2019 she was cast as Miss Freddy in Daniels‚Äô upcoming biographical drama The United States vs. Billie Holiday. The film will cover Holiday‚Äôs career as she was under federal drug investigation, her addiction issues, struggles with fame and love affairs.  LGBTQ activism  Lawrence‚Äôs activism has included National Action Network, the Human Rights Campaign‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis is Luv,‚Äù and the Ali Forney Center, the Black AIDS Institute, and ‚Äúother local and community foundations focused on uplifting the LGBTQ community.‚Äù As of October 2017, she sees her mission as using her platform to get rid of negativity ‚Äútowards gender fluid and gender non-conforming people‚Äù. In June 2017, Lawrence was a featured speaker in New Orleans at the 2017 Essence Music Festival‚Äîthe nation‚Äôs largest event celebrating African-American culture and music‚Äîon the Beauty & Style stage talking about gender fluidity in fashion. In September 2017, at the Pure Heat Community Festival (PHCF), a part of Atlanta Black Gay Pride, Lawrence was presented a PHCF Legacy Award by Jaime Balenciaga. Also in September 2017, Lawrence was honored as a LGBTQ influencer at the 6th Annual Gentleman's Ball for her commitment to social change within the LGBTQ community. In May 2018 Lawrence was named to the newly formed LGBTQ Advisory Board by Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. In June 2018, along with singer Keri Hilson, Lawrence joined Atlanta‚Äôs Fulton County Board of Health as celebrity ambassadors to start StopHivATL, a HIV/AIDS prevention campaign. In January 2019, Lawrence‚Äôs work on Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms‚Äô LGBTQ Advisory Board, her mentorship as house mother for the House of Balenciaga, as well as her acting work, were honored by a Georgia House of Representatives proclamation from queer Representative Park Cannon. In a June 2019 interview with Essence she questioned the excuses made by people ‚Äúthreatening or perpetuating violence against Black queer, gay, and trans people.‚Äù She also called out celebrities who make homophobic jokes without any accountability. In July 2019, Lawrence was one of three panelists on the Gender Justice Matters Fireside Chat in Detroit for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People‚Äòs national conference talking about LGBTQ issues. They focused on two main areas; violent crimes against the black LGBTQ community, and how ‚Äúanti-gay crimes and suicides of LGBTQ people‚Äù are caused within black communities by homophobia. In June 2020, Lawrence spoke out during the Black Lives Matter protests that started in Minneapolis, Minnesota and have gone global in response to the police murder of George Floyd. Lawrence emphasized that LGBTQ Black lives also matter, and referenced Iyanna Dior, a trans woman ‚Äúpummeled by multiple men after allegedly causing a fender bender‚Äù. Lawrence feels that if the Black community cannot also fight for non- heterosexual and non-gender conforming Black people then the whole movement suffers.

Their debut EP Don't Feed Us Shit reach number twenty on the UK Independent chart. Steve Lamacq cited their second EP Let The Vultures Fly... as one his favourite U.K. punk records of all time. History Prior to forming the band, Sharp-Weir and Holmes had played together in local punk rock bands including the Jackets and Terminal Boredom. They formed the band in 1979 with Phil Smith and Dicky Walton while attending Temple Moor High School, under the name Icon. They frequently performed at the venues such as the F‚ÄìClub and Tiffany's. After sending a home-recorded demo to the members of the Crass, they were including on their 1980 compilation album Bullshit Detector. They officially broke-up in 1981, when the members left high school, however Sharp and Holmes continued rehearsing together. In 1982, the pair entered the studio half-heartedly, with Sharp's sister and Holmes' wife, Caroline Holmes and her younger sister Bev Smith on vocals and took on the name Icon A.D. They released the Don't Feed us Shit EP in September of the same year which reached number twenty on the UK Independent Singles and Albums Charts, through Radical Change records. They soon recruited bassist Roger Turnbull of Leeds post-punk band F-3 and recommenced performing live, however Caroline Holmes stepped down soon after, leading to Bev Smith being the sole vocalist. In October they recorded a session for BBC Radio 1 presenter John Peel, followed by the recording and release of their second EP Let The Vultures Fly.... Soon after, they broke up in early 1983.

Both stories are about an intergalactic sleuth, Miro Hetzel, who uses his wits to pursue challenging cases. Plot summary The sleuth Miro Hetzel, who calls himself a \\"galactic effectuator\\", resolves two mysteries in this combined short novel and short story. In The Dogtown Tourist Agency, he investigates a plan to deliver weapons to the fairly primitive \\"Gomaz\\" race on a distant planet called Maz. The story starts with Hetzel tracking a playboy, and then moves onto him taking a case for Palladian Micronics, a robot firm. Hetzel meets with Palladian's CEO, who cannot understand how a competitor is selling a similar robot at a much cheaper price. While the CEO does not know how the competitor is beating his price, the clues point to the primitive planet of Maz. To find the answer to the mystery, Hetzel must penetrate deeper into the primitive zones of the planet, where encounters with the aggressive Gomaz race add to his peril. In the short story Freitzke's Turn, Hetzel takes on a case for Conwit Clent, who has had his testicles stolen by a rogue doctor. To track down the doctor, Hetzel has to go to his old university, where he studied as a young man. There he encounters a former rival, the brilliant Faurence Dacre, who may be the key to resolving the mystery. Reception Kirkus Reviews generally praises the \\"...pleasures of the Vance intelligence and the Vance prose style\\", but calls this volume a \\"...trifle exiguous\\", as \\"...there is a lot that might profitably have been left in here in the way of plot\\", as \\"...neither mystery is worth the elegance expended on it\\".

History  295x295px  Ancien R√©gime  The whole fief counted about 100 ha for Maizeret and about 160 ha for Moinil. The Moinil lot consisted in 1314, of a \\"tower\\" and a house, which would become the nucleus of the future castle. The \\"sub-fief\\" of Moinil frequently changed owners: in 1645 the seigniory and its castle are sold for 22,000 guilders, to be sold again in 1677 for 2,440 guilders, the castle and the buildings being in ruins. The fief became the property of Vincent de la Boverie, mayeur of the ferrons and master of the forges who rebuilt it and transformed it into a real \\"pleasure home\\". The de Bar√© family obtained the lands of Maizeret and Moisnil in 1753. The last lord of Maizeret in the Ancien R√©gime was Baron Jacques de Bar√© de Moisnil, lord of Houchen√©e.  20th century  The Ch√¢teau in 1924 In 1902, the extensions made by Jules van Dievoet after the plans of architect Octave Flanneau were made. In June 1922, the ¬´ Les Journaux R√©unis de Lille √† Roubaix ¬ª company bought the ch√¢teau including its grounds of 35 hectares from Marguerite Anspach, widow of Jules van Dievoet. As a result of this purchase, Mrs Duhamel, owner of this press company, occupied the property for nearly 17 years. Later, Marguerite de la Barre d'Erquelinnes, wife of Count Antoine d'Ursel, acquired the land of Moisnil on 21 March 1939. The family built a new porch in 1960. It was also around this time that the operations of the adjoining farm ceased. Since 1988, the Ch√¢teau has been inhabited by their son, Count Didier d'Ursel.  WWII  Shortly before the war, the castle was requisitioned to house the garrison of Fort Maizeret. Beginning from the general mobilization of September 1938, it served as cantonment to the soldiers in charge of the defense of the valley of the Meuse. On May 12, 1940, the castle was bombed by surprise by the Luftwaffe, at the same time as the city of Namur. The oldest parts of the old Ch√¢teau were destroyed, and today only the cellars remain, hidden under a layer of gravel.  Anecdote  It is said that the old ch√¢teau had been inhabited in the 17th century by Henri de La Fontaine who happened to be related to Jean de La Fontaine, the famous fabulist. It is said that Jean de La Fontaine, who followed Louis XIV as a historiographer during the siege of Namur, stayed there in 1692 with this distant cousin and composed \\"Les Animaux malades de la peste\\" there. The stone bench from which he could admire the beauty of the Mosan landscape is still there.

Life Drexler was born in Brooklyn and attended the High School of Music and Art, and The Cooper Union studying architecture and served with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Second World War. After the war Drexler worked with the office of industrial designer George Nelson and was Architecture Editor of Interiors magazine. Drexler joined the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1951 as Curator of Architecture and Design and was promoted to Director of the Department in 1956 succeeding Philip Johnson. Drexler has lectured at New York University, Yale University, Harvard University, Pratt Institute, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and other universities and institutions. Drexler had the longest curatorship in the Museum of Modern Art history. Over thirty-five years Drexler conceived, organised and oversaw trailblazing exhibitions that not only mirrored but also foresaw major stylistic design developments in industrial design, architecture and landscaping. During Drexler‚Äôs curatorship, MoMA played a central role in examining the work and reinforcing the reputations of twentieth-century architects, among them Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Richard Neutra, Marcel Breuer, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Drexler explored unexpected subjects: from the design of automobiles (he was the first to include automobiles in art museums) to a reconstruction of a Japanese house and garden. Drexler‚Äôs pioneering shows promoted new ideas about architecture and design as modern arts and left an indelible mark on the course of midcentury modernism. He designed the Philip Johnson Gallery at MoMA. Drexler retired from the MoMA post due to poor health in 1986 and died in January 1987. In 1977, Drexler received the American Institute of Architects Medal for \\"vast contributions in documenting the art of architecture.\\" Exhibitions Drexler curated and organized many exhibitions at the MoMA some of those were: * Eight Automobiles (1951) * Ten Automobiles (1953) * Japanese House in the Garden (1954 and 1955), * 20th Century Design from the Museum Collection (1958‚Äì59), * Visionary Architecture (1960) * The Drawings of Frank Lloyd Wright (1962) * Le Corbusier: Building in Europe and India (1963) * Twentieth Century Engineering (1964) * The Architecture of Louis I.

She is also the Canon Theologian at the Washington National Cathedral. She has written five books, including The Black Christ (1994), Black Bodies and Black Church: A Blues Slant (2012) and Stand Your Ground: Black Bodies and the Justice of God (2015). Her book Sexuality in the Black Church: A Womanist Perspective (1999) was groundbreaking for openly addressing homophobia within the black church. Biography Early life Kelly Brown was raised in Dayton, Ohio. She grew up in a middle-class family, her father was a professional, and her mother stayed home to take care of her children. She attended college at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, where she pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. She was active as a student leader and served on a search committee for a new president of the university in 1976. She was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society, and graduated summa cum laude in 1979. She later served on the Dennison Alumni Council. Graduate education and ordination Following her college graduation, Douglas moved to New York City to attend Union Theological Seminary. She graduated with a Master of Divinity in 1982. On September 1, 1985, she was ordained by Walter Dennis as an Episcopal priest at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Ohio. Women's ordination was officially approved in the Episcopal Church USA in 1976, and the first woman to be ordained in the Southern Ohio Diocese was Doris Ellen Mote. Douglas was the first black woman to be ordained in the diocese, and one of the first ten black women ordained in the Episcopal Church USA. After earning her MDiv, Douglas stayed on to pursue a PhD at Union. She completed her doctorate in Systematic Theology in 1988, studying with Professor James Cone, a pioneer in black theology. Academic career At the start of her academic career, Douglas found a position as Assistant Professor of Religion at Edward Waters College in Jacksonville, Florida. However, she soon accepted an offer to teach at the Howard University School of Divinity, where she was Associate Professor of Theology from 1987 to 2001. In addition to teaching, Douglas contributed to the development of womanist theological discourse through her writings. While at Howard, she published her first two books: Black Christ, in 1993, and Sexuality and the Black Church, in 1998. Her most well known work, Sexuality and the Black Church, is considered to be the first book to openly address the issue of homophobia in the Black Church from a womanist perspective. In 2001, Douglas left Howard to join the religion department at Goucher College, a small liberal arts college in Baltimore. As the Elizabeth Connolly Todd Distinguished Professor of Religion, and later the Susan B. Morgan Professor of Religion, she taught at Goucher for six years, and still retains professor emerita status. She continued writing and publishing, completing three additional books, as well as numerous articles and book chapters. Stand Your Ground: Black Bodies and the Justice of God was written by Douglas in response to the death of Trayvon Martin, and analyzes the \\"systemic failure to hold individuals accountable for racist aggression and murder.\\" In 2018, she became the inaugural dean for Episcopal Divinity School at Union Theological Seminary. She is the first African- American woman to head a seminary affiliated with the Episcopal Church. Ecclesiastical ministry For twenty years, Douglas served as an associate priest at the Holy Comforter Episcopal Church in Washington, DC. Then, in 2017, she joined the staff of the Washington National Cathedral as the Canon Theologian. In this role, she helped lead discussions on current issues with the congregation, providing theological background and interpretation. In 2015, a controversy emerged over two stained glass windows in the Cathedral that honored Andrew \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson and Robert E. Lee. Douglas was part of a task force assigned to study the issue and make recommendations on what to do with the windows. In 2017, after two years of discussions among the cathedral worshipping community, the cathedral chapter voted to remove the windows. In 2019, Douglas preached at the consecration of Kimberly Lucas as bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Colorado. Lucas is the first woman bishop and first African-American bishop in the diocese. Family Douglas is married to Lamont Douglas, and they have one son, Desmond. Awards In 1995, Douglas received the Grace Lyman Alumnae Award by the Women's Studies Department at Dennison University. In 2000, she was awarded Dennison's Alumni Citation. While teaching at Goucher College, she was awarded the Goucher College Caroline Doebler Bruckerl Award. She is also a recipient of the Anna Julia Haywood Cooper Award, given by the Union of Black Episcopalians.

They offer medical advice and assessments to English local authorities and to the British Home Office, but they do not make medical or legal decisions.  History  NowMedical was founded in 2004 by John W. Keen, whose background is as a general medical practitioner. Local housing authorities have increased their use of NowMedical over the last 20 years. Bracknell Forest Council was one of more than 100 councils in December 2019 using the company, providing the council with 44 assessments during 2019. From 2016 to 2019, NowMedical advised Islington Council on more than 6,000 cases. They were paid ¬£17,525 in the 12 months to November 2018. In January 2020 it was reported that the council would stop using the service because of concerns about outsourced medical assessments. NowMedical replied to these concerns that they \\"[do] not and cannot make any decision on behalf of a local authority\\". In April 2020, the London Borough of Islington decided to discontinue their contract and stop using services by NowMedical.Islington Tribune 18th February 2020 Medical firm has Islington housing contract scrapped  Criticisms and controversies  In 2015. NowMedical was criticised for providing medical opinions to councils without seeing the people or the medical records of those whose health they assess, thereby \\"providing secondhand evidence\\" to the councils. The Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said that there should be \\"be a review of how companies like NowMedical are awarded contracts to make these kinds of assessments.‚Äù In November 2019 Keen advised that a woman who was housebound after having a stroke was able to return to Sudan on a plane, recommending frequent exercise whilst on board the plane by walking around the cabin. Thanet District Council defended its use of the company in 2019, stating that \\"their role is to assess whether someone‚Äôs housing conditions impact on their health. They are not there to replace the services provided by the NHS and people should visit their own GP to discuss their health and medication.‚Äù  Criticisms by courts  In 2017, it was criticised by the County Court at Central London for its advice to Lambeth Council, stating that \\"[NowMedical‚Äôs] approach to reaching a conclusion was flawed as a means of providing information that would help the decision maker\\". In 2017, NowMedical provided a medical opinion to Haringey Council relating to a mother having to care after a child with autism. The case concerned the suitability of accommodation provided to her and her family, and specifically the potential risk to the child stemming from the flat being situated on the first floor with access to balconies. Keen stated that the optimum solution would be a ground-floor property, however \\"given a fall from a first floor is unlikely to be fatal, and that availability of ground floor properties may be so scarce as to potentially delay a relocation, then I think that a first floor property is an acceptable alternative.\\" This advice was commented on by the High Court in 2018, which stated that it was \\"not clear on which medical basis he comes to [his] conclusion\\".

His father was Koretami(Á∂≠Ê∞ë). His posthumous name was Tsunezumi(Â∏∏ÊæÑ). His Go (pen name) was Taiso(Â§™Á¥†). Nanbu Toshitaka's reforms were that there was no death penalty, and even those who committed serious crimes were in prison. As a result, there were significant violence and frequent complaints from the people. One day he met a castle keeper. At that time, he told this castle keeper that he was ready to go on a business trip at any time, and listened loudly where thousands of peasants were in trouble. There was no prospect of being told, and when he continued to push up even if he talked about one thing, he told his opinion that if he cut off two people who moved forward, only a few people would be dispatched. He was never ordered to travel, perhaps because his opinion did not fit the reform plan of the then daimy≈ç Nanbu Toshitaka. After Toshitaka's death in 1820, his father thought it was time and filed a white paper with the Morioka clan, along with several samurais, including Tsut≈ç. However, the white paper was not accepted, and his father was taken up on a semi-land and expelled to Tanabu(now part of the city of Mutsu). When his father was exiled from Morioka Domain, Tsut≈ç also lived with his father. At that time, he decided to make a living as a merchant, went to Morioka to learn commerce, went back to his father's home and started commerce, and went up to Edo at the request of a timber dealer. In 1852, he applied to Morioka Domain for the development of a new rice field in Sanbongi. In 1855, he was appointed Sanbongi Shinden Goyogakari (new rice field affairs official in Sanbongi). In 1869, he assumed the post of Daisanji (second to a governor) of the Shichinohe Domain. He died on November 9, 1871.

Later, responding to Meienberg's new focus on prison reform in Kenya, Faraja Foundation's work on prison reform gained prominence. Faraja Trust was initially fully financed by Meienberg's networks in Switzerland, forming the Swiss Donors' Association of Faraja Trust. Later, Meienberg purchased land in the Westlands to construct 24 luxury apartments to rent to expatriates, who worked for embassies, the UN, or NGOs. Presently, Faraja Foundation is also financed by donor fundraisers.  Current Work  Faraja Foundation focuses on supporting the rehabilitation of incarcerated individuals. Currently involved in 50 prisons or correctional institutions, the Foundation aims to improve existing institutions that tackle rehabilitation, by streamlining congestion, improving documentation process, and implementing more concrete rehabilitation programmes.

It grew as an independent community, and became the City of Woodlawn, and built a substantial City Hall building in 1908, but was annexed by Birmingham in 1910. The community area experienced a surge of growth after it was annexed. Woodlawn Historic District The Woodlawn Historic District in Birmingham, Alabama is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. It included 608 contributing buildings and a contributing site, as well as 89 non-contributing buildings. It comprises much of the original city of Woodlawn, including its city hall, but the district also reflects much development after it was annexed into Birmingham. The boundaries were defined to include \\"surviving portions of the Woodlawn neighborhood which retain sufficient historic character and resources to convey a sense of the district's historical development. Areas excluded from the district generally possessed higher ratios of noncontributing to contributing resources.\\" The district includes 14 contributing resources already listed on the National Register as the Woodlawn Commercial Historic District, which itself includes the Woodlawn City Hall, already itself separately listed on the National Register. The core commercial area includes mostly brick buildings, one- to three-stories tall, with architecture representative of late-nineteenth and early twentieth century styles. Prominent buildings in the core area include: *Woodlawn City Hall (1908), Beaux Arts style *Woodlawn Fire Station (c.1930), romantic French revival style *Woodlawn Methodist Church (1909‚Äì12), Victorian Gothic Revival style *Woodlawn Masonic Building (1915) *Woodlawn High School (1922), Tudor Revival style, with an associated gymnasium and stadium *Grace Episcopal Church (c.1910) *Woodlawn Public Library (1950), modern style. *Wood Family Cemetery (1824), only resource documented to be older than 1880, The district is roughly bounded by 1st Ave. N, 47th St. N, 61st St.N, and Interstate 20/59. It includes Queen Anne and various late 19th and early 20th century Revival styles. Includes map on last page. With History The Hawkins, Riley, Eubank and John Smith families arrived in 1815-16 and may have been the first European-descended settlers in the area. Early houses included \\"Woodlawn\\", the home of Obadiah Washington Wood Sr. on the Georgia Road, and \\"Willow Wood\\", residence of Edmund Wood, which was located where Willow Wood Park is now. O.W. Wood Sr. established the first general store, the first post office (in 1832, when the community was known as Rockville), and first saw mill in the area. He also granted \\"rights of way for railroad and streetcar construction, and donat[ed] land for four churches, a school, and for the settlement of former slaves at nearby Zion City. A church shared by all denominations in what were known as \\"Union services\\" was built on land donated by Obadiah Washington Wood, Sr., at what is now 56th Street and Second Ave., where the Woodlawn Elementary School was later located. The Wood Family Cemetery holds about 150 graves starting around 1824, including those of seven generations of the Wood family, from Obadiah and Edmund Wood on. The cemetery is about on 57th Street North at First Avenue. \\"Like other settlements in the county, Woodlawn appears to have remained a sparsely populated agricultural region well into the mid-nineteenth century, attractive to settlers for its convenient location on the Georgia Road and its fertile, well-watered valley land.\\" It had population 89 in 1880, then 1506 in 1890. The first churches were \\"established by the Baptists in 1886, Methodists in 1887, and Presbyterians in 1888. The Georgia Pacific Railroad (later Alabama Great Southern) was completed by 1883 and the Central of Georgia (later Seaboard Coast) and Birmingham Mineral line by 1888. The community was renamed Woodlawn in 1886, and, January 26, 1891, it was incorporated under a municipal government. Boundaries of the new city extended generally from 47th Street to 65th Street, between 12th Avenue North and 7th Avenue South.\\" Street car services supported great growth. It was annexed into Birmingham on January 1, 1910. This greatly improved city services and led to much development and growth.

It was founded in November 1999 as a citizen platform with the goal of demanding a fair and equal treatment for the province of Teruel. In 1999, Teruel still had no motorways, and on the only railway line (which was single- track without electrification) the train had derailed 8 times in a year. Encouraged by the success of the strike called for 4 October 2019 in twenty Spanish provinces, to protest the \\"forgetfulness\\" suffered by the so-called \\"empty Spain\\", the platform chose to establish itself as a grouping of electors to contest the upcoming November general election in the province. It became the most voted provincial force, securing one out of the three Teruel Congress seats and two out of its four directly-elected senators, as well as becoming the first grouping of electors since the Spanish transition to democracy to be successful in entering the Spanish parliament. The platform was instrumental in the investiture of Pedro S√°nchez as Prime Minister of Spain on 5‚Äì7 January 2020, for whose support its leader, Tom√°s Guitarte, received intense threats and coercion from right-wing to far-right groups, which resulted in the Ministry of the Interior having to provide him of a policial escort for security reasons.

She designed a number of creatures for the Pok√©mon franchise, including one of the most well-known Pok√©mon species, the franchise's mascot Pikachu.  Career  Nishida was working at Game Freak on the game Pulseman with the art director for Pok√©mon, Ken Sugimori. In his initial character design, he made most of the Pok√©mon scary, but he realized he also wanted to have cute characters in the game. This led to the design of Pikachu, which was originally based on a daifuku, a Japanese sweet treat. She changed the design later, basing it on a squirrel, as Nishida said she was obsessed with squirrels at the time. Squirrels were also her inspiration for the electric cheeks, as they tend to store food in their cheeks. Pikachu was later changed to be a mouse by Satoshi Tajiri, one of the Pok√©mon creators. The original design included the Raichu evolution, as well as a third evolution, which was later abandoned. Nishida other Pok√©mon design credits include Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle. She furthermore designed some of the Eevee evolutions (or \\"Eeveelutions\\"), including Glaceon and Sylveon. On Sugimori's request, she helped design Xerneas and Yveltal, the two legendary Pok√©mon that appear on the covers of the Pok√©mon X and Y games. She was also the artist on a large number of Pok√©mon Trading Card Game cards, including the Pikachu Illustrator card, which was sold for $195,000 in 2019, winning it the Guinness World Record of most expensive Pok√©mon trading card (at auction). This beat the previous record from 2016 when a card with the same design by Nishida was sold for $54,970. Nishida also worked for the Japanese game development studio TOYBOX Inc. on Hometown Story, a Nintendo 3DS game.  Personal life  Nishida is a very private person; she spent the entirety of a 2018 interview hidden behind a giant Pikachu plush doll.

History thumb According to local tradition, this Mughal architecture style mosque was built by Hayat Muhammad, the zamindar of Umedpur Pargana during the rule of the Nawabs of Bengal in the 18th century. Hayat Muhammad was rebellious to the British government and exiled to Penang Island (formerly Prince of Wales island) in Malaysia. His family was stripped of Umedpur's zamindarship. It was after Hayat's return to Bengal, sixteen years later, in which he built the Miah Bari Mosque taking inspiration from the Kartalab Khan Mosque in Old Dhaka. However, some believe the mosque was built by Muhammad Jahid, the son of Hayat, in 1704. The mosque is now under the protection of Department of Archaeology. Architecture It is a two-storey mosque with 6 doors on the ground floor and 3 on the top floor. The mosque has three domes and eight big minarets, four on the front wall and four on the back wall.

The 33-round League programme commenced on 2 September 1990, and in the opening match Dundalk were well beaten by Shelbourne, 5‚Äì1. That defeat, after a poor sequence, sparked a recovery and, with the exception of two defeats to newly promoted Sligo Rovers, they went the rest of the season unbeaten. Midway through the season, however, they suffered a shock 1‚Äì0 defeat in the FAI Cup to non-League Ashtown Villa. The league schedule was completed on 21 April 1991 and, in an end of season, winner takes all match in Turner's Cross against Cork City, Dundalk won the title for the eighth time, with the winning goal being scored by cult hero, Tom McNulty.

There are also several minor islands and islets. The seven main Canary Islands originated as separate submarine seamount volcanoes on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, which is deep in the Canarian region. Lanzarote and Fuerteventura are parts of a single volcanic ridge called the Canary Ridge. These two present-day islands were a single island in the past. Part of the ridge has been submerged and now Lanzarote and Fuerteventura are separate islands, separated by an wide, deep strait.Carracedo, J.C. and Troll, V.R.

(2001) ‚ÄúVolcanoes of Europe‚Äù, Harpenden, Terra Publishing, , page 101 Growth stages Volcanic oceanic islands, such as the Canary Islands, form in deep parts of the oceans. This type of island forms by a sequence of development stages: *(1) submarine (seamount) stage *(2) shield-building stage *(3) declining stage (La Palma and El Hierro) *(4) erosion stage (La Gomera) *(5) rejuvenation/post-erosional stage (Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, Gran Canaria and Tenerife). The Canary Islands differ from other volcanic oceanic islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands, in several ways ‚Äì for example, the Canary Islands have stratovolcanoes, compression structures and a lack of subsidence. The seven main Canary Islands originated as separate submarine seamount volcanoes on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. Each seamount, built up by the eruption of many lava flows, eventually became an island. Subaerial volcanic eruptions continued on each island. Fissure eruptions dominated on Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, resulting in relatively subdued topography with heights below . The other islands are much more rugged and mountainous. In the case of Tenerife, the volcanic edifice of Teide rises about above the ocean floor (about underwater and above sea level).Hoernle, K. and Carracedo, J.C.

Distribution In addition to its type locality, Venkidds Valley Estate south of Madikeri in the eponymous Kodagu district, Ichthyophis kodaguensis is known from another locality in the Kodagu district north of Madikeri, and from the Chickmagalur district; all these records are from southern Karnataka state. It has been implied to occur in adjacent Kerala. Description The type series consists of seven females that measure in total length. Width at the midbody is . There are 276 to 306 ventral annuli. A later discovered, unsexed specimen measured in total length and had 343 ventral annuli. The body is subcylindrical and slightly dorso-ventrally compressed. The head is slightly wider than the body. The eyes are surrounded by narrow whitish ring and are visible through unpigmented skin as small, dark circles with lighter grey central lens; they are slightly elevated above adjacent skin. Living individuals have long and thin tentacles. The body is dorsally uniform dark chestnut brown, with a slightly lighter snout. A bright, cream-yellow lateral stripe runs all along the length of the body; it has irregular margins and is interrupted at the first collar. The ventrum, paler than the dorsum, is lilac- grey-brown, slightly darker posteriorly and immediately adjacent to the lateral stripe. Habitat and conservation The type series was collected from a mixed coffee and areca nut plantation at above sea level. The holotype was collected by digging in soil by a small stream. Another specimen was found at night on a dry pathway on a hill slope, just outside a wet evergreen forest fragment and some 50 m away from the closest water body, a rivulet. Two specimens have been found on a coffee plantation at an altitude similar to the type locality. In 2008, before new distributional records were published,, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified Ichthyophis kodaguensis as \\"data deficient\\". IUCN acknowledged the species as being able to live in agricultural habitat and thereby able to tolerate disturbed habitats, but considered available information too scarce to assess its conservation status.

When the public library was established, it had 3,500 volumes, almost all in English, a problem acknowledged when the library was rededicated on July 25, 1968 and had grown to 90,000 with a quarter of them being in Spanish. In September 1942, Harry M. Lydenberg, director of the Biblioteca, wrote the article \\"Why a North American Library in Mexico?\\" and provided two primary reasons for such an endeavor \\"number one, because the European market is closed. Number two, because independently of that, Mexico has been turning more and more towards the United States as a source of mutual intercourse in things intellectual or cultural\\". In 1952, the library had a second building located at Nice Street # 53. In 1968, the library moved again to London Street #16. A re-dedication ceremony was held in 1968, where attendees were treated to demonstrations of advances in technologies available for libraries including microfiche and copy machines, video recordings, and \\"high-fidelity chromographic reproductions\\" that would be available to the public. 2003 was the latest relocation of the library, where it still provides traditional library services, along with guided tours, tech services for building English language skills, movie nights, 3-D printing services, and karaoke.

Above, hom(H,G) is the set of graph homomorphisms, or adjacency preserving maps, from H to G. Density can also be interpreted as the probability that a map from the vertices of H to the vertices of G chosen uniformly at random is a graph homomorphism. There is a connection between homomorphism densities and subgraph densities, which is elaborated on below.  Examples  * The edge density of a graph G is given by t(K_{2},G). * In a graph with n vertices, where the average degree is greater than or equal than pn, the edge density is at least p. * The density of triangles in a graph G is given by t(K_{3},G). * The density of 4-cycles in a graph G is given by t(C_{4},G).  Subgraph densities  We define the (labeled) subgraph density of H in G to be d(H,G):=\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\# \\\\text{ labeled copies of } H \\\\text{ in } G}{V(G)^{V(H)}}. Note that it might be slightly dubious to call this a density, as we are not quite dividing through by the total number of labeled subgraphs on V(H) vertices of G, but our definition is asymptotically equivalent and simpler to analyze for our purposes. Observe that any labeled copy of H in G corresponds to a homomorphism of H into G. However, not every homomorphism corresponds to a labeled copy ‚àí there are some degenerate cases, in which multiple vertices of H are sent to the same vertex of G. That said, the number of such degenerate homomorphisms is only O(n^{V(H)-1}), so we have t(H,G)=d(H,G)+O(1/n). For instance, we see that for graphs with constant homomorphism density, the labeled subgraph density and homomorphism density are asymptotically equivalent. For H being a complete graph K_m, the homomorphism density and subgraph density are in fact equal (for G without self-loops), as the edges of K_m force all images under a graph homomorphism to be distinct.  Generalization to graphons  The notion of homomorphism density can be generalized to the case where instead of a graph G, we have a graphon W, t(H,W)=\\\\int_{[0,1]^{V(H)}}\\\\prod_{ij\\\\in E(H)}W(x_{i},x_{j})\\\\prod_{i\\\\in V(H)}dx_{i} Note that the integrand is a product that runs over the edges in the subgraph H, whereas the differential is a product running over the vertices in H. Intuitively, each vertex i in H is represented by the variable x_{i}. For example, the triangle density in a graphon is given by t(K_3, W) = \\\\int\\\\limits_{[0,1]^3} W(x,y)W(y,z)W(z,x) dx dy dz. This definition of homomorphism density is indeed a generalization, because for every graph G and its associated step graphon W_{G}, t(H,G)=t(H,W_{G}). This notion is helpful in understanding assymptotical behavior of homomorphism densities of graphs which satisfy certain property, since a graphon is a limit of a sequence of graphs.  Important results: inequalities  Many results in extremal graph theory can be described by inequalities involving homomorphism densities associated to a graph. For instance, Mantel's Theorem states, in the context of graphons, that if t(K_{3},W)=0, then t(K_{2},W)\\\\leq 1/2. Another example is Tur√°n's Theorem, which states that if t(K_{r},W)=0, then t(K_{2},W)\\\\leq (r-2/r-1). According to Hamed Hatami and Sergei Norine, one can convert any algebraic inequality between homomorphism densities to a linear inequality. In some situations, deciding whether such an inequality is true or not can be simplified, such as it is the case in the following theorem. > Theorem (Bollob√°s). Let a_{1},\\\\cdots,a_{n} be real constants. Then, the > inequality \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}t(K_{i},G)\\\\geq 0 holds for every graph G if > and only if it holds for every complete graph K_{m}. However, we get a much harder problem, in fact an undecidable one, when we have a homomorphism inequalities on a more general set of graphs H_{i}: > Theorem (Hatami, Norine). Let a_{1},\\\\cdots,a_{n} be real constants, and > \\\\\\\\{H_{i}\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{n} graphs. Then, it is an undecidable problem to > determine whether the homomorphism density inequality > \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{r}t(H_{i},G)\\\\geq 0 holds for every graph G. A recent observation proves that any linear homomorphism density inequality is a consequence of the positive semi-definiteness of a certain infinite matrix, or to the positivity of a quantum graph; in other words, any such inequality would follow from applications of the Cauchy Schwarz Inequality.  Description of D_{2,3}  Another recent development consists in the completion of the understanding of a homomorphism inequality problem, the description of D_{2,3}, which is the region of feasible edge density, triangle density pairs in a graphon: > D_{2,3}=\\\\\\\\{(t(K_{2},W),t(K_{3},W))\\\\;:\\\\;W\\\\text{ is a graphon}\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq > [0,1]^{2} Observation 1. This region is closed, since the limit of a sequence o graphs is a graphon. Observation 2. For every 0\\\\leq r\\\\leq 1, the set D_{2,3}\\\\cap[0,1]\\\\times\\\\\\\\{r\\\\\\\\} is a vertical line segment, with no gaps. Proof: Consider two graphons W_{0}, W_{1} with the same edge density; then, the family of graphons of the following form, as t varies from 0 to 1 W_{t}=(1-t)W_{0}+tW_{1} achieves every possible triangle density between the values t(K_{3},W_{0}) and t(K_{3},W_{1}), by continuity of this map. Observation 3. For every , graphon W:[0,1]^{2}\\\\rightarrow[0,1], we have the upper bound t(K_{3},W)\\\\leq t(K_{2},W)^{3/2} Proof: It is sufficient to prove this inequality for any graph G. Say G is a graph on n vertices, and \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_{i}\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{n} are the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix A_{G}. By spectral graph theory, we know hom(K_{2},G)=t(K_{2},G)V(G)^{2}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\lambda_{i}^{2}, hom(K_{3},G)=t(K_{3},G)V(G)^{3}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\lambda_{i}^{3}. The conclusion then comes from the following inequality: hom(K_{3},G)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\lambda_{i}^{3}\\\\leq\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\lambda_{i}^{2}\\\\right)^{3/2}=hom(K_{2},G)^{3/2} Observation 3. The extremal points of the convex hull of D_{2,3,\\\\cdots, r}=\\\\\\\\{(t(K_{2},W),t(K_{3},W,\\\\cdots, t(K_{r},W))\\\\;:\\\\;W\\\\text{ is a graphon}\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq [0,1]^{r-1} are given by W=K_{m} for each m positive integer. In particular, The extrema of D_{2,3} are given by the following discrete set of points in the curve y=x(2x-1): p_{m}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{m-1}{m},\\\\frac{(m-1)(m-2)}{m^{2}}\\\\right) Observation 3. This is a theorem due to Razborov, which states that for a given edge density r=t(K_{2},W), if \\\\frac{k-1}{k}, for some positive integer k, then the minimum feasible triangle density is attained by a unique step function graphon W with node weights a_{1}, \\\\cdots a_{k} with sum equal to 1 and such that a_{1}=\\\\cdots=a_{k-1}\\\\geq a_{k}. More explicitly, the minimum possible t(K_{3},W) is \\\\frac{(k-1)\\\\left(k-2\\\\sqrt{k(k-r(k+1))}\\\\right)\\\\left(k+\\\\sqrt{k(k-r(k+1))}\\\\right)^{2}}{k^{2}(k+1)^{2}}.

His works include bronze sculptures of his patron Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena, designs of various coins and medals, a wide range of mainly religious works in silver, engraved portraits, designs for temporary triumphal arches and designs for works in a number of churches, most notably the altar of repose at the Mdina cathedral. Biography Pietro Paolo Troisi was the son of Carlo Antonio Troisi and Ninfa n√©e Bison, and he was the second of eight or nine children. His family was probably of Sicilian descent. He was born in Valletta on 29 June 1686, and he was baptised at the Porto Salvo parish church on 2 July. Troisi's first training was at his father's bottega in Malta. Between 1704 and 1705, Troisi studied at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, on the recommendation of Grand Master Ramon Perellos y Roccaful. He is the second known Maltese artist to have been admitted into the academy, after Melchiorre Caf√†. While in Rome, he joined the bottega of the sculptor Pietro Papaleo. Due to his talent, he was promoted to the advanced students' class, and in 1705 he and Antonio Arrighi won first prize in a competition with a religious subject, the Concorso Clementino Prima Classe. Magisterial Palace, Mdina, attributed to Troisi Upon his return to Malta, Troisi made a name for himself as a successful artist in multiple genres. He was a silversmith, medallist, bronze sculptor, portraitist, designer and scenographer. He made designs for works which were carried out by other artisans, and although he was also given the title of architetto, he does not seem to have designed buildings. He also taught drawing of nude figures, and he co-founded a school of design and painting at the Mint in Valletta together with Marc'Antonio Zondadari (who would later become Grand Master of the Order of St John). Troisi was patronised by Zondadari's successor, Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena, who seems to have held him in high esteem. Throughout his career, Troisi collaborated with a number of Maltese sculptors and stone carvers such as Pietro Paolo Zahra and the Fabri brothers. His father was the Master of the Mint of the Order, and Troisi also worked as his assistant. In April 1714, he petitioned Perellos to take his father's place, but remained an assistant until he finally became Master of the Mint in 1736. He retained the post until his death. Troisi was a member of the Confraternity of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in the Carmelite church in Valletta from at least 1713 to his death, and at times he was appointed as the Confraternity's secretary, treasurer or rector. Troisi married Magdalena Marcella Desira, a woman from Senglea, on 26 August 1716. They had five children: Philippus, Xaveria, Veronica, Gaetanus (later known as Gioacchino) and Paola (who died in infancy). Troisi drew up his will on 27 March 1743, and he died soon afterwards, either in late March or early April, at the age of 57. In his will he wished to be buried at the Carmelite church in Valletta. His wife Magdalena died in January 1758. Works Triumphal arches for Zondadari and Vilhena Troisi designed two temporary triumphal arches for the possesso ceremonies of 1720 and 1722. This was a celebration held at Mdina on the occasion of the election of a new Grand Master, in which officials of the city's Universit√† would present the keys of the city to the new Grand Master. For the occasion, a temporary triumphal arch made out of wood would be built near the Banca Giuratale, and it would be dismantled shortly afterwards. When Zondadari was elected Grand Master, Troisi was one of four artists who were invited to submit designs of the triumphal arch. Troisi's design was chosen, and the ceremony was held on 30 June 1720. Zondadari was succeeded by Vilhena in 1722, and Troisi was once again commissioned to design a triumphal arch which was to be made by remodelling the 1720 arch. Troisi made the designs and supervised its construction, while the woodwork was done by Andrea Camilleri and the painting was renewed by Aloisio Buhagiar. Vilhena's possesso was held on 20 September 1722. Drawings of both arches still survive, and they were built in three tiers with a central coffered doorway. The arches depicted the emblems of the Universit√† and the Grand Master along with a variety of military paraphernalia, while Vilhena's arch also contained his portrait and symbols of the Kingdom of Sicily. Altar of repose at the Mdina cathedral In 1727, Troisi was commissioned by Canon Gourgion on behalf of the Metropolitan Chapter to design an altar of repose for St Paul's Cathedral in Mdina. This is a moveable chapel intended for the exposition of the Eucharist on Maundy Thursday, and it is erected annually during Holy Week. Troisi was paid 5 scudi for his design, but other artists were also invited to submit their designs and the altar was not built during Troisi's lifetime. However, in 1751 the Chapter decided to build the altar and Troisi's design was chosen. The altar was built by Francesco Zahra and it was inaugurated in 1752. The chapel consists of a triumphal arch- like portico with stairs leading to a circular space which contains a partial dome and richly decorated walls. A silver capsure made by Giovanni Andrea Troisi (Pietro Paolo's brother) and Annetto Pullicino serves as the centrepiece of the altar. Engravings Troisi engraved portraits of Grand Masters Zondadari and Vilhena in 1720 and 1724 respectively. The latter was published in the code of laws Leggi e costituzioni prammaticali. He also made engravings on silverware, such as a dish depicting Victory over Land and Sea which was commissioned as a gift on the occasion of a marriage between the Pallavicini and Spinola families. Bronze busts and statues statue of Vilhena (1736) originally at Fort Manoel, attributed to Troisi Troisi made a number of bronze busts depicting Grand Master Vilhena. He is known to have made two busts located at the Magisterial Palace and the Banca Giuratale in Mdina; the latter is now found at the Manoel Theatre museum. Other portraits of the Grand Master such as a tondo relief at the Magisterial Palace, and busts at the Franciscan convent in Valletta, the Conservatorio in Floriana and the Chancery in Valletta are also stylistically attributed to Troisi, although there is no documentary evidence of this. The design of a life-size statue of Vilhena which was commissioned by the knight Felician de Savasse in 1734 is also attributed to Troisi. The statue was cast in bronze by Louis Bouchet, and it was installed in the piazza of Fort Manoel in 1736. The statue was relocated multiple times after 1858, and it is presently located in Pope John XXIII Square in Floriana. Silverwork Troisi was a skilled silversmith, and he gained these skills through apprenticeship with his father. His brothers Massimiliano and Giovanni Andrea and their children also worked in this trade. In 1721, he was commissioned to produce a silver ceremonial mace, possibly for the jurats of the Universit√† of Mdina. He also manufactured a number of silver religious objects for churches, and details of some of his works are known through transactions. In 1718, Troisi manufactured an altar antependium for the Archconfraternity of the Holy Cross at the Franciscan Church of St Mary of Jesus in Valletta. He is known to have produced a number of silver sanctuary lamps, including for the altar of Our Lady of the Rosary at the Senglea parish church in 1719 and for the high altar of St Paul's parish church in Valletta in 1733. In the 1720s, Troisi made a number of liturgical objects for the Lija parish church, including a case for the consecrated host, a pyx, a chalice and a paten; some of these were gilded in gold. He also manufactured a silver cross spearhead for the banner of the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary in Lija in 1726, and a reliquary for the Naxxar parish church in 1732. In 1738, he was commissioned to produce silver cards for the altar of Baby Jesus at the Franciscan Church of St Mary of Jesus in Valletta. Coins and medals Troisi was Master of the Mint from 1736 to his death in 1743, and he had previously been the assistant to his father who had held the post until his death 1730. Troisi designed dies of coinage depicting Grand Master Vilhena, and the artistic quality of the gold coins minted during Vilhena's magistracy was never surpassed during the Order's rule in Malta. Today these coins are highly sought after by collectors. He also designed a number of commemorative medals during Vilhena's magistracy, such as a silver medal commemorating the construction of Fort Manoel in 1724. Other works Troisi also designed a number of reredoses at the Franciscan Conventual church in Rabat between 1710 and 1722, and collaborated with the sculptor Pietro Paolo Zahra and the Fabri brothers on a number of altar reconstructions in the same church along with the parish churches of Balzan and ≈ªebbuƒ°. Troisi also designed the reredos of the main altar of the Carmelite church in Mdina and that of the choir altar of the old church of St Mary in Birkirkara. He designed choir stalls in the churches of Lija and ≈ªebbuƒ°. In the latter, he also designed the choir altar and a monstrance for a relic of the arm of St Philip. Troisi designed the frame of a marble slab commemorating the consecration of the Parish Church of St George in Qormi in 1731. In 1735 he produced designs for wood carvings at the altar of St John the Evangelist in the Church of Our Lady of Victories, Valletta.

This disorder is called Neu-Laxova syndrome in neonates. Symptoms and signs In addition significantly shortening lifespan, PHGDH deficiencies are known to cause congenital microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and seizures in both humans and rats, presumably due to the essential signaling within the nervous system that serine, glycine, and other downstream molecules are intimately involved with. Cause Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) cause Neu-Laxova syndrome and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency. Mechanism 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase catalyzes the transition of 3-phosphoglycerate into 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, which is the committed step in the phosphorylated pathway of L-serine biosynthesis. It is also essential in cysteine and glycine synthesis, which lie further downstream. This pathway represents the only way to synthesize serine in most organisms except plants, which uniquely possess multiple synthetic pathways. Nonetheless, the phosphorylated pathway that PHGDH participates in is still suspected to have an essential role in serine synthesis used in the developmental signaling of plants.

Early life and career Apilado was born on April 30, 1908, in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents were Stewart and Clara (n√©e Whetsel) Mays. Her maternal grandmother had emigrated from Canada to Ohio, and was partly indigenous. Her paternal great-grandfather was a slave owner in Virginia. Apilado attended McKinley High School, which closed in 1954. She became a teacher in 1928, after graduating from Chicago Normal College (now Chicago State University). She began her journalistic career in 1942, when she briefly worked as an editor for the newly-created Negro Youth Photo Scripts Magazine. In 1945, she wrote a letter to the editor expressing her criticism of Richard Wright's memoir Black Boy, stating that it was an inaccurate depiction of the typical childhood of African-Americans. In 1950, Apilado published a novel called The Joneses, which was about the hardships of a black family living in Chicago. After retiring from teaching in 1973, Apilado founded America's Intercultural Magazine (AIM), a quarterly-published journal that set out to \\"bridge the gap between races, cultures, and religions.\\" Already in 1948, an initiative of creating such a journal (called Freedom Press) took place, when she requested the newspaper Berkeley Daily Gazette to assist her and her associates with marketing. Her anti-racism stance was reflected in the editorials that she wrote; for example, she praised the activist and church leader Willa Saunders Jones in 1975. On June 16, 1990, she participated as a panelist at a writers' conference in Elgin Community College in Illinois. Personal life Apilado's husband was Filipino-American Inosencio Apilado. Their son, Myron Apilado, was the vice-president of minority affairs at University of Washington until the year 2000, as well as an editor of AIM. On August 26, 2004, at age 96, she was interviewed by Larry Crowe of The History Makers, a project that produces oral history material by African-Americans. Her second cousin was journalist Lu Palmer. She was 110 years old as of December 19, 2018.

Description  The height of a mature Syagrus rupicola ranges from 4-6 ft and it appears to be stemless. As it matures, to a height of approximately 1 meter, its short underground stem spans 10-20 centimeters. It possesses large pistillate flowers, and its fruits split at the apex. A perpendicular bract, fibrous and fleshy mesocarp, as well as silvery-blue leaves are some defining characteristics of Syagrus rupicola. The leaves of this species has a leathery texture The leaves are approximately 1 meter long and arched with a 3-6 inch crown. They are grouped into clusters of 2-5 and appear to be angled at different positions along the stem. The stalk that bears the plant's fruit grows to be 30-40 centimeters long. Syagrus rupicola has a woody perpendicular bract. This species can be referred to as \\"sawtooth\\", \\"fox llicuri\\", or \\"palm of stone.\\" This palm has a light frost tolerance, and grows at a slow, steady rate.  Etymology  The species name \\"rupicola\\" translates to \\"rock-dweller\\" in English.  Distribution  Syagrus rupicola is native to the Chapada dos Veadeiros region in the state of Goias, Brazil. It is known to favor high-altitude terrains of over 1,000 meters. This palm species generally grows optimally in well-drained, rocky soil types.  Ideal growth conditions  From an early age, S. rupicola requires a lot of sun to grow. It has a high wind tolerance, making it capable of growing in conditions with high disturbance. S. rupicola grows in light shade in dry, hot climates; it requires moderate amounts of water for growth.  Uses/cultivation  Serves as a food source for small animals and humans. This species is used for its seeds, landscaping, and for ornamental purposes. The perpendicular bract of this species is used in many handicrafts.  Properties  This species possesses male and female reproductive organs, making it a monoecious evergreen species.  See also  * Syagrus (plant)  References  Dave‚Äôs Garden. (2019).

It occurs in Africa, Southern Asia and Northern Australia, and is a pest of coconut and other palm trees. Distribution Diocalandra frumenti is found in Somalia, Tanzania, Madagascar, the Seychelles, Mauritius, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, Papua New Guinea, various Pacific island groups and Australia. It has also been recorded in the Canary Islands. Although infesting a number of species of palm, it is a major pest of coconut (Cocos nucifera), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis), date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), California fan palm (Washingtonia filifera) and Mexican fan palm (Washingtonia robusta). Life cycle The adult Diocalandra frumenti is about long. It is a glossy black colour with four large rusty-brown or blackish-brown coloured spots on the elytra (wing covers}. The female lays eggs in crevices in the stems of palms which hatch in about a week. The larvae bore into the stem where they form extensive galleries. After eight to ten weeks they pupate, the adult emerging from the pupal case about eleven days later. Damage Eggs may be laid among the flowers, in cracks in the leaf or flower stalks, or near the base of the stem just above the adventitious roots. As the larvae bore deeper into the palm, a gummy exudate forms in the entry hole. The galleries can damage any part of the palm including the roots. Leaves may turn yellow and fruit may drop off, and severe infestations may cause the plant to die. It has been found that the males emit a pheromone which attract females, and this may make it possible to trap the insects, which are strong fliers, and reduce the level of infestation. The weevil has a number of natural enemies including a parasite Spathius apicalis, a predatory fly Chrysophilus ferruginosus and a predatory beetle Plaesius javanus.

Almost all the works are by New Zealand artists, including Robyn Kahukiwa, Bill Hammond, and Toss Wollaston. Acquired between 1974 and 2014, the collection is particularly strong in artists from the 1980s and 1990s.  Origin  Dick Lucas in 2004 The collection owes its existence to two Lincoln University faculty members, Dick Lucas and Mike Smetham, both lecturers in the Plant Science department. Lucas was an expert on legumes for dryland pasture, and Smetham an authority on subterranean clover. Both were also collectors and appreciators of New Zealand art. Although Lincoln College had from its earliest days acquired portraits of former principals and other people of note, it did not have a formal collecting policy. In 1970, the sale of cigarettes and biscuits at morning and afternoon teas in the staff common room had raised a reasonable amount of money, and staff debated how to spend it. After heated discussion, a motion was passed on 16 December 1970 to allocate $600 for buying artworks to decorate the Senior Staff Common Room that were \\"considered of good artistic merit, and, in addition, constitute a good financial investment.\\" By the end of 1974, an Art Committee had been formed, with Lucas as Chairman and Smetham as curatorial manager, as well as Gavin Daly. They enlisted the director of the Robert McDougall Art Gallery, Brian Muir, to recommend suitable work, and made the first purchases in the collection: Doris Lusk's Hill and Stream near Kurow (1971) was bought for $350, followed by Michael Smither's Rocks and Butterfly: Rakaia River (1971). Later, Louise Henderson's Bush Revisited (1972), Toss Woollaston's Tobacco Kiln (1972), and a Marilynn Webb print Cloud Landscape, Central Otago 2 (1972) were added. The Committee determined all acquisitions would be work by contemporary New Zealand artists who had exhibited in public galleries, \\"mainly but not exclusively from the South Island\\". As it was to hang in public spaces for staff and students to appreciate, the work also needed to have aesthetic appeal.  Collecting  Graham Bennett (2012) Over a 40 year period the Lincoln University Art Collection grew from six works to 280. Funding was haphazard until art acquisition budget was formally established in 1987 by Vice-Chancellor Bruce Ross, who made the case to the College Council that art was an appropriate expenditure for what was then an agricultural college. This allowed for the purchase of works such as Bill Sutton's Plantation Series No XVIII (1988). The relocation of the George Forbes Memorial Library and the redevelopment of Ivey Hall in 1989 released additional funds. From 1988 on there was a recognition that the collection poorly represented work by women and MƒÅori, and a separate account for purchasing MƒÅori art was set up, which enabled the acquisition of Treaty Painting (1990) by Robyn Kahukiwa, three works by John Bevan Ford, one by Peter Robinson, and a set of nine Max Hailstone prints, Te Tiriti o Waitangi (1990). After 1990, the Art Purchasing Committee controlled its own budget and would buy new works each year. This was a time of growth for Lincoln, with its change from college to university, the expansion of the library, and the construction of two new lecture theatres. Because Lucas also sat on the Works Committee, he was able to stipulate that the newly built lecture theatres had foyers able to display large artworks, such as Robyn Kahukiwa's Still MƒÅori but Comely (1993) in the Stewart Building. Work from the collection was used for teaching Cultural Landscape in landscape architecture and design courses. Still MƒÅori but Comely (1993) had been purchased to commemorate both the 1993 centenary of women's suffrage in New Zealand and the Year of Indigenous People, and it was the centrepiece of the University's first public art exhibition, in the Stewart Building. Entitled In the Far South, the exhibition celebrated Suffrage Year by displaying all 30 works by women in Lincoln's collection. It included Joanna Braithwaite's controversial NZ Still Life No 3 (1990), which depicted a severed sheep's head; seemingly appropriate for a school of agriculture, this generated several complaints, notably from the conference of the New Zealand Society of Animal Production held at Lincoln in 1992. As well as art for halls and lecture theatres, sculptures by Chris Booth, Llew Summers, and Neil Dawson were purchased for the university grounds; Llew Summers' Joy of Living (1992), the first outdoor sculpture purchased, is a popular photo spot for graduating students. Graham Bennett's 2012 work Oversight was created during his time as Sculptor-in-Residence. By the late 1990s, art funding had declined, and new purchases were essentially frozen following the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010‚Äì11. Although the acquisitions budget was negligible, works continued to be gifted or loaned, such as Cheryl Lucas's Jug-skin Fence (2009) and Susan Chaytor's Still Life 1987. Lucas and Smetham were both honoured with inaugural Lincoln University Medals in 2008, for their \\"sustained voluntary contributions to art and heritage\\". After 40 years' service, ten years after their retirement, they both stood down from the Art and Heritage Committee in 2014.  Conservation  Although acquisition had largely ceased, there was a need to conserve the collection. Megan Clayton became the chair of the Art Committee, and a $200,000 grant from the Lottery Board Environment and Heritage Fund was secured, supplemented by funds from the University. This enabled the appointment in 2018 of art curator Fiona Simpson, who began a three-year project to conserve the entire collection. Simpson has expressed concern that there has not been a programme of new acquisitions by contemporary New Zealand artists ‚Äì \\"There are many gaps in the collection due to the lack of a recent acquisition budget\\" ‚Äì and some works, having never moved from when they were first hung, have \\"faded into the background\\".  The collection  Neil Dawson's H‚ÇÇO (2005) The Lincoln University Art Collection consists of over 280 works; the oldest dates back to 1639, but most are by New Zealand artists in the 1970s‚Äì1990s.

He was appointed chief of staff of the Governor of Dahomey in 1925, before becoming Acting Governor of St Pierre and Miquelon in 1929, serving until 1932. He was appointed Resident Commissioner of the New Hebrides in 1932, a post he held until becoming Acting Governor of Tahiti in 1935. He returned to his post in the New Hebrides in 1937. Following the occupation of France in 1940, Sautot declared the New Hebrides' allegiance to the Free French on 20 July, the first territory to do so. On 13 September Charles de Gaulle appointed him Governor of New Caledonia. He sailed to New Caledonia and, greeted by large crowds on his arrival, went straight to Government House and removed Colonel Denis from office. He subsequently set up the Pacific Battalion, which sailed in May 1941 to fight in North Africa and Europe. He was made a companion of the Order of Liberation on 1 August 1941, later also becoming a Commander of the Legion of Honour and an Officer of the British Empire. However, after the new French High Commissioner in the Pacific Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu arrived in 1942, disagreements between the two led to Sautot being deported to Auckland in New Zealand in May 1942. Later in 1942 Sautot was appointed Governor of Ubangi-Shari by de Gaulle, a post he held until retiring in 1946. He then returned to New Caledonia with his New Caledonian wife. He entered local politics, and served as mayor of Noum√©a between 1947 and 1953. Sautot died in a clinic in Noum√©a in March 1963.

Although there are conflicting reports of her parentage (due to the similarity of names reused in the extended family), one credible source says her parents were Francois Couperin (the \\"first\\") and his second wife, Louise Bongard.

Marie-Anne was a cousin of the noted soprano and organist Marguerite-Louise Couperin (born about 1675), and Marie-Anne was aunt to the first woman to be appointed a royal court harpsichordist, Marguerite-Antoinette Couperin (1705 ‚Äì c. 1778). Marie-Anne became known as the organist and harpsichordist at Maubuisson Abbey (also called Notre-Dame-la-Royale).

It was signed and dated by the senior artist. In 1810 it was acquired from Fran√ßois Cacault by the mus√©e d'Arts de Nantes, where it still hangs.. The work was commissioned by Henri de La Fert√©-Senneterre, governor of Lorraine, where La Tour lived and worked. de La Fert√©-Senneterre is recorded as paying 650 francs for a work entitled The Denial of St Peter in 1650, possibly the work now in Nantes. He was then one of the most important collectors of La Tour's work. The work's approach is very Caravagist, sidelining the work's supposed main subject and placing the soldiers gaming at a table at its centre. In 17th century French society, \\"gaming was inseparable from luxury\\" and was evidence of \\"indifference to salvation\\" - a similar link is made in the artist's The Card Sharp with the Ace of Diamonds, contemporary with Tristan L'Hermite's The Disgraced Page. The gaming soldiers also refer forwards in time to those casting lots for Jesus' clothing at the foot of the crossMark 15.24; Matthew 27.35; Luke 23.24; John 19.34.

She will become the second Meraviglia Plus-class ship for the cruise line and will be the sister ship to MSC's current flagship, MSC Grandiosa. Originally scheduled to debut on 8 November 2020, her delivery is postponed to early-2021.  History   Construction  On 1 February 2016, MSC Cruises announced that they had converted their options for two new ships into firm orders, with the new vessels being a part of a sub-class that evolves from the cruise line's original Meraviglia-class platform, dubbed \\"Meraviglia Plus\\". Each new vessel was designed to be larger than their older Meraviglia-class sisters, at 181,000 GT, with a maximum passenger capacity of 6,334 guests. On 14 June 2018, MSC Cruises celebrated the steel-cutting for the second Meraviglia Plus-class vessel and also announced her name as MSC Virtuosa at the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard. Her coin ceremony was performed on 27 February 2019. She was floated out on 29 November 2019 and moved to a wet dock to complete construction.  Debut  MSC Virtuosa was originally scheduled to be delivered in October 2020 and sail her maiden voyage on 8 November 2020 from Genoa. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, construction delays arose at the shipyard and have slowed the ship's construction progress.The delivery has been postponed to early-2021 to help Chantiers de l'Atlantique and MSC better prepare the ship for debut.  Operational career  MSC Virtuosa was scheduled to begin sailing weekly itineraries in the Western Mediterranean in fall 2020. However, due to the construction delays, MSC Grandiosa will replace all of the ship's scheduled itineraries through the winter 2020-2021 season. In spring 2021, she is scheduled to cruise in Northern Europe and the Baltic region, before re-positioning to Dubai in the fall, where she will be based throughout the winter, sailing 7-day itineraries in the Persian Gulf to the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.  Design and engineering  Like MSC Grandiosa, MSC Virtuosa will be equipped with a selective catalytic reduction system that helps to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 80 percent, along with a closed- loop exhaust gas cleaning system that reduces ship sulfur emissions by 97 percent. She will also be capable of running on shorepower when docked at ports.

Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Lillooet and Hurley Rivers. The mountain was named in association with Sampson Creek, which flows south from the mountain. In 1911, E.N. Sampson acquired a preemption located on the east side of the locally named Sampson Creek. It was spelled Samson Mountain when it was first adopted in 1967 on maps. The spelling was officially corrected and adopted April 29, 1983, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada to conform with the creek. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1935 by Preston Tait, John Ronayne, and Ronald Ronayne. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Sampson is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The mountain and its climate supports an unnamed glacier on its northern slope. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Sampson.

ValhallaDSP: The company and its personnel ValhallaDSP as a company was founded by Sean Costello, who handles coding. Kristin Costello handles graphics and marketing. Sean Costello has always been interested in the interaction between musicians and the academic and professional worlds. He has co-written academic papers about reverberation, including a 2009 paper about using algorithmic reverberation with the Ambisonics system and a paper about implementing a digital simulation of a spring reverb. ValhallaDSP was founded in 2009; Sean worked as an audio DSP designer and consultant for about a decade before founding his own company. Before Valhalla DSP, Sean Costello had his first plugin work made public when he provided four reverb algorithms for the Audio Damage EOS reverb plugin which was initially released in 2009; one of those four algorithms was not available until 2017, when Audio Damage released EOS 2. Don Wendell Gunn has helped Sean Costello with R&D;/preset design for ValhallaDSP's plugins. Products ValhallaDSP makes a combination of reverb, delay, and sound effect plugins. Reverb-centered plugins These plugins are designed primarily to provide reverberation effects. Valhalla Room Valhalla Room is a reverb plugin which mainly simulates the acoustics of realistic rooms and halls, although it can also be used for special effects. It has 12 different algorithms. ValhallaDSP says this reverb is best for \\"idealized room impressions\\". One review felt that, while Valhalla Room sounds really good, it sounds more \\"hyper-real and lush\\" than \\"gritty and realistic\\". They also felt that its user interface could use some improvement. Valhalla Vintage Verb Valhalla Vintage Verb is an plugin with the sounds of various late 1970s and 1980s digital reverberators, including ones which sound like Lexicon and EMT reverbs. This plugin has been used in the songs Hello and Water Under the Bridge by Adele, as well as on Lana Del Rey's album \\"Lust for Life\\". It is possible to change the decay rate of different frequencies, and the early and late diffusion can have separate settings. As of November 2019, the plugin has 18 different algorithms, including: * Concert Hall, emulating a \\"late 1970s and early 1980s\\" reverb in \\"hall\\" mode * Plate, emulating an \\"early 1980s\\" reverb in \\"plate\\" mode * Chamber, a \\"transparent\\" algorithm described as being \\"smooth yet dense\\" * Random Space and Smooth Room, which are inspired by or emulate \\"late 1980s\\" reverb hardware * Sanctuary, which emulates a \\"a classic German digital reverberator from the 1970s\\" * Nonlin, a modern representation of 1980s gated reverb algorithms * Chaotic Neutral, a \\"colorless\\" sounding reverberation ValhallaDSP says this reverb is best for the sound of \\"old school digital hardware reverbs\\". One review feels that while it is excellent for getting the unreal larger than life sound of a classic Lexicon reverb, it does not work as a subtle reverb effect and is not a reverb for every occasion. Valhalla Plate Valhalla Plate is a plug in which simulates the sound of a plate reverb or small chamber. It has 12 different algorithms. ValhallaDSP says this reverb is best for the sound of \\"warm and dense reverbs of the 1960s and 70s\\". Third party reviews of Valhalla Plate have been generally positive, but one review pointed out that \\"it won't serve all needs\\", since it only simulates plates and small chambers, and does not emulate larger spaces. Valhalla Supermassive Valhalla Supermassive is an effect unit which can run various types of delays and reverbs; it is good at, among other things, emulating large spaces. It is a free download. Delay and sound effect plugins These plugins provide a combination of delay, sound effect, and reverberation effects. Valhalla √úberMod Valhalla √úberMod is a plugin which is geared towards delay effects, but can also create reverberant effects. Valhalla Shimmer Valhalla Shimmer provides a combination of reverberation and pitch shifting, inspired by the sound of some 1980s Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois collaborations. Valhalla Freq Echo Primary a sound effect, the free Valhalla Freq Echo plugin provides a combination of delay and a Bode frequency shifter. This is mainly for making unusual sounds. Valhalla Space Modulator Valhalla Space Modulator is a plugin, free with the purchase of any other ValhallaDSP plugin, which simulates some kinds of flanging and pitch shift effects. Valhalla Delay Valhalla Delay is a plugin which simulates the sounds of a number of vintage delays, including tape based delays (such as the sound of Roland Space Echo, Maestro Echoplex, or reel to reel based tape delay units), \\"bucket brigade\\" delays, 1980s digital delays, and delays with pitch shifting. It features a \\"ghost\\" mode which combines delay with frequency shifting. This plugin can do both classic delay sounds and unusual sound effects. Valhalla Delay is on Music Radar's list of five best plugins released in 2019, and they consider it the best delay plugin in 2020.

They defended the legal enslavement of people for their labor as a benevolent, paternalistic institution with social and economic benefits, an important bulwark of civilization, and a divine institution similar or superior to the free labor in the North.Daniel Walker Howe, What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815‚Äì1848, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 58, p. 480Allan Kulikoff, Abraham Lincoln and Karl Marx in Dialogue, Oxford University Press, 2018, p. 55 Proponents of enslavement as \\"a good ‚Äî a great good\\" often attacked the system of industrial capitalism, contending that the free laborer in the North, called by them a \\"wage slave\\", was as much enslaved by capitalist owners as were the African people enslaved by Whites in the South.Ethan S. Rafuse, \\"John C. Calhoun: The Man Who Started the Civil War,\\" Civil War Times magazine, October 2002  The \\"positive good\\" defense of slavery Characterizing American perceptions of slavery at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the 1998 documentary series Africans in America: America's Journey Through Slavery, the historian Douglas R. Egerton said: > The planter class in the Age of Revolution never believed for a moment the > blacks were happy in their condition and wouldn't try for freedom, the way > that white planters in the 1830s and '40s tried to convince themselves that > their slaves loved their situation. Americans who lived through the American > Revolution understood that this was a violent world and that slaves were > held in place only by white military power. See also . A narrative that enslaved African peoples lived in a care-free, comfortable state dates back to the late 1700s. This argument mostly focused on the economic feasibility of enslaving people for their labor despite the inherent subjugation and degradation of human beings. The enslaved people of the time were members of what historian Ira Berlin called the and in his pivotal 1998 work Many Thousands Gone he described the transition in popular sentiments about the Africans and their descendants among ethnically European settlers of North America as, > If in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries transplanted Europeans > denounced Atlantic creoles as audacious rogues and if in the eighteenth > century the nascent planter class condemned the newly arrived Africans for > their \\"gross bestiality and rudeness of their manners,\\" nineteenth-century > white Americans redefined blackness by endowing it with a new hard edge and > confining people of African descent to a place of permanent inferiority.. But by the 1810s a new rationale arose that began to treat legalized enslavement as a \\"positive good\\" and not as an economically \\"necessary evil,\\" while still affirming its alleged economic benefits. It appears that this new premise was first expressed by Robert Walsh in 1819: > The physical condition of the American Negro is on the whole, not > comparatively alone, but positively good, and he is exempt from those > racking anxieties‚Äîthe exacerbates of despair, to which the English > manufacturer and peasant are subject to in the pursuit of their pittance. Such justification about the \\"goodness\\" of enslavement for those who were enslaved became more common in the 1820s. By the late 1820s, the defense of institutional slavery changed over to a national benefit for state governments, enslavers, and enslaved people alike. Legal enslavement drifted from a simple economic system of private enslavers to a political and philosophical position that portrayed enslavement as possessing national importance, providing benefits to the states, including more tax revenue. A well-known example of this new pro-enslavement approach was voiced by Governor Stephen D. Miller in his 1829 speech to South Carolina's legislators: > Slavery is not a national evil; on the contrary, it is a national benefit. > The agricultural wealth of the country is found in those states owning > slaves, and a great portion of the revenue of the government is derived from > the products of slave labor‚ÄîSlavery exists in some form everywhere, and it > is not of much consequence in a philosophical point of view, whether it be > voluntary or involuntary. In a political point of view, involuntary slavery > had the advantage, since all who enjoy political liberty are then, in fact, > free. Not long after Governor Miller's speech, the general defense of involuntary servitude drifted towards a position where a \\"proper social order and foundation of social welfare played a major role\\" in the pro-enslavement debate.Eugene D. Genovese, The World the Slaveholders Made: Two Essays in Interpretation, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1971, p. 135 Another economic defense of enslaved labor came from economist Thomas Roderick Dew, professor at and then president of the College of William and Mary, who downplayed the evil of owning humans after the Virginia House of Burgesses almost passed legislation for the emancipation of enslaved people in 1832.Gregory S. Schneider, \\"The birthplace of American slavery debated abolishing it after Nat Turner's bloody revolt\\" , The Washington Post , June 1, 2019 Dew supported enslavement on philosophical, economic and Biblical grounds, arguing that chattel slavery was not necessarily an immoral system. Daniel Walker Howe, What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815‚Äì1848, Oxford University Press, 2007, pp. 476‚Äì477 In portraying Southern enslavement-based society as \\"superior\\" to Northern free society, Dew's pro-slavery argument turned into a \\"positive good\\" defense.David F. Ericson, The Debate Over Slavery: Antislavery and Proslavery Liberalism in Antebellum America, New York University Press, 2000, pp. 100‚Äì102 James Henry Hammond On February 1, 1836, Congressman James Henry Hammond from South Carolina spoke on the House floor for two hours about the perceived menace of abolitionism. He launched an attack on pro-human rights opponents in the North, while defending the social and economic benefits to whites of enslavement in the South. Hammond's speech on enslavement was considered a new departure in the American Congress, distinguished as the \\"first explicit defense of slavery as a positive good.\\" Drew Gilpin Faust, James Henry Hammond and the Old South, Baton Rouge and London, Louisiana State University Press, 1982, p. 176, 246 In that 1836 speech, Hammond attempted to justify the practice: > Slavery is said to be an evil‚Ä¶ But is no evil. On the contrary, I believe it > to be the greatest of all the great blessings which a kind Providence has > bestowed upon our glorious region‚Ä¶ As a class, I say it boldly; there is not > a happier, more contented race upon the face of the earth‚Ä¶ Lightly tasked, > well clothed, well fed‚Äîfar better than the free laborers of any country in > the world,‚Ä¶ their lives and persons protected by the law, all their > sufferings alleviated by the kindest and most interested care.... > > Sir, I do firmly believe that domestic slavery regulated as ours is prodoces > the highest toned, the purest, best organization of society that has ever > existed on the face of the earth A Democrat, Hammond was elected Governor of South Carolina in 1842. He was best known during his lifetime as an outspoken defender of the South and the institution of slavery. Drew Gilpin Faust, James Henry Hammond and the Old South, Baton Rouge and London, Louisiana State University Press, 1982 p. 134 After traveling through Europe, Hammond concluded that free laborers were being exploited by soulless materialism in England and the North, where workers had the \\"liberty only to starve,\\" while Southerners were far more protective, assuming \\"responsibility for every aspect of the lives\\" of their slaves. Drew Gilpin Faust, James Henry Hammond and the Old South, Baton Rouge and London, Louisiana State University Press, 1982, pp. 280‚Äì281 Hammond co- authored The Pro-Slavery Argument with William Harper, Thomas Roderick Dew, and William Gilmore Simms, who composed part of the \\"sacred circle\\" of proslavery intellectuals.The Pro-Slavery Argument as Maintained by the Most Distinguished Writers of the Southern States, Containing the Several Essays, on the Subject, Philadelphia, Lippincott, Grambo & Co., 1853 John C. Calhoun and \\"positive good\\" slavery The best-known political figure to defend black slavery as a \\"positive good,\\" was John C. Calhoun, a political theorist and the seventh Vice President of the United States. Calhoun was a leader of the Democratic-Republican Party in the early nineteenth century who, in the Second Party System, initially joined the proslavery Nullifier Party but left by 1839 and, despite having refused to attend the inauguration of Democratic president Martin Van Buren two years before, voted with the Democratic Party for the remainder of his career. To Calhoun, slavery was a great benefit for an inferior race that had no ability to exercise their freedom positively. Calhoun argued: > Never before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history > to the present day, attained a condition so civilized and so improved, not > only physically, but morally and intellectually‚Ä¶ It came to us in a low, > degraded, and savage condition, and in the course of a few generations it > has grown up under the fostering care of our institutions.John C. Calhoun,A > Positive Good ‚Äì Teaching American History,\\"Slavery a Positive Good\\" > (February 6, 1837) The concept of slavery as a positive good came to the forefront in Calhoun's February 6, 1837, speech on the US Senate floor. In an attempt to disarm the abolitionists' moral outrage over slavery as \\"man-stealing,\\" ignoring the anti-slavery tradition of the Founders, Calhoun, like many proslavery Southerners, pointed to the ancient world to help them defend the institution of slavery, especially Aristotle's theory of natural slavery.Richard Alston, Edith Hall, and Justine McConnell, editors, Ancient Slavery and Abolition: From Hobbes to Hollywood, Oxford University Press, 2011, Chap. 9, S. Sara Monoson, \\"Recollecting Aristotle Pro-Slavery Thought in Antebellum America and the Argument of Politics Book 1\\" p. 247-278 Greek democracy along with the grandeur of the Roman republic provided Southerners with a perspective that great cultures and slavery were inseparable.Paul Finkelman, Defending Slavery: Proslavery Thought in the Old South‚ÄîA Brief History with Documents, Bedford/St. Martin's, 2003, p. 29 Attempting to claim the moral mantle for the social defense of involuntary servitude, Calhoun declared: > I take higher ground. I hold that in the present state of civilization, > where two races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other > physical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, the > relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, is, > instead of an evil, a good‚Äîa positive good. In that 1837 speech, Calhoun further argued that the slaveholders took care of their slaves from birth to old age, urging the opponents of slavery to \\"look at the sick, and the old and infirm slave, on one hand, in the midst of his family and friends, under the kind superintending care of his master and mistress, and compare it with the forlorn and wretched condition of the pauper in the poor house\\" found in Europe and the Northern states.John C. Calhoun, [ https://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/clyde-wilson-library/john-c-calhoun-and- slavery-as-a-positive-good-what-he-said/\\"Slavery a Positive Good\\" speech], February 6, 1837 Such an assertion was predicated on the virtues of benevolent paternalism, the glory of past civilizations, and the traditions of white supremacy.Clyde Wilson, \\"John C. Calhoun and Slavery as a \\"Positive Good:\\" What He Said\\" June 26, 2014, Abbeville Institute, Clyde Wilson Library In an effort to illustrate that the North was also guilty of treating and exploiting its free laborers like slaves, Calhoun declared in his speech \\"that there never has yet existed a wealthy and civilised society in which one portion of the community did not...live on the labour of the other.\\" Most Southern slaveholders and intellectuals favored Calhoun's ideas and maintained that the institution of slavery \\"benefited both master and servant.\\"Ethan S. Rafuse, \\"John C. Calhoun: The Man Who Started the Civil War,\\" Civil War Times, October 2002 In that arrangement, the slaveholder acquired his labor and the slave was given a standard of living far beyond what he could ever hope to achieve on his own. While Calhoun sought to defend slavery as a positive good, he expanded his argument to condemn the North and industrial capitalism, asserting that slavery was \\"actually superior to the 'wage slavery' of the North.\\"Ethan S. Rafuse, \\"John C. Calhoun: The Man Who Started the Civil War\\" , Civil War Times, October 2002 He believed that free laborers in the North were just as enslaved as the Negro workers in the South. However, in the case of slaves in the South, Calhoun argued that Negros were receiving special protection under a caring and paternalistic master, and therefore were more fortunate.Ethan S. Rafuse, \\"John C. Calhoun: The Man Who Started the Civil War,\\" Civil War Times magazine, October 2002 In his manifesto, A Disquisition on Government, Calhoun opposed equality upon birth assertion that the Founders declared in the Declaration of Independence, arguing that not all people are \\"equally entitled to liberty.\\"https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/disquisition-on- government/ A Disquisition on Government], 1840 To bolster the prospects of slavery, he asserted that liberty was not a universal right but should be \\"reserved for the intelligent, the patriotic, the virtuous and deserving,\\" which would exclude both free and enslaved Negros. Moreover, in 1820, Calhoun explained to John Quincy Adams that slave labor was the mechanics by which to maintain social control, calling it the \\"best guarantee for equality among whites.\\"John Niven, John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union: A Biography, LSU Press, 1993, p. 85, The Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, Comprising Portions of His Diary from 1795‚Äì1848 , New York: Scribner, 1951. \\"John Quincy Adams and John Calhoun discuss the Compromise\\", March 2, 1820 The effects of \\"positive good\\" slavery Before the 1830s, the support for slavery was weakening in the South. During this period many Southerners agreed that, in the abstract, slavery constituted an evil. They claimed that they had no participation in its introduction, and laid blame of the involuntary servitude of blacks on \\"old Grandam Britain.\\"The Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, Comprising Portions of His Diary from 1795‚Äì1848, New York: Scribner, 1951. \\"John Quincy Adams and John Calhoun discuss the Compromise\\", March 2, 1820 Nonetheless, few Southerners were willing to also call slavery \\"a sin.\\"Eugene D. Genovese, The World the Slaveholders Made: Two Essays in Interpretation, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1971, p. 132 This attitude resulted in a situation where \\"slave states contained a great many more anti-slavery societies than the free states.\\" Wolfgang Schivelbusch, The Culture of Defeat: On National Trauma, Mourning, and Recovery, New York: NY, Picador: A Metropolitan Book, 2004, p. 44 After the abolitionists escalated their intellectual attacks against slavery as a violation of natural rights and self-ownership principles, pro- slavery Southerners felt threatened, and retaliated with their own philosophical and morality-based justifications to defend involuntary servitude. The pro-slavery adherents felt compelled to take a hardline stance and engaged in a vehement and growing ideological defense of slavery.David Brion Davis, Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World, Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 186‚Äì189 Pro-slavery intellectuals and slaveholders began to rationalize slavery as a positive good that benefited both owners and the enslaved. Calhoun believed that the ownership of Negros was both a right and an obligation, causing the pro-slavery intelligentsia to position enslavement as a paternalistic and socially beneficial relationship, that required reciprocal \\"duties\\" from the enslaved. Another aspect of \\"slavery as a positive good\\" motivated Southern white women to offer the enslaved on plantations material goods, as well as maternal care of those they considered unfit or feeble-minded Negros. However, all Negroes were generally, though not universally, believed to be a genetically inferior \\"race\\". Plantation mistresses spent considerable time in an attempt to \\"civilize\\" their enslaved laborers by providing food, shelter, and affection. In this sense, antebellum Southern women saw the enslaved as childlike, in need of protection. While engaging in this type of social welfare activity, they also attempted to convince the plantation enslaved, who were denied contact with the many abolitionist newspapers, that their condition was far better than those of the white or black factory workers (\\"wage slaves\\") in the industrial North. George Fitzhugh's extreme defense of slavery George Fitzhugh was a slave owner, a prominent pro-slavery Democrat, and sociological theorist who advanced the argument for slavery as a social-welfare plantation structure that would provide blacks with better care than the free labor in the North. He took the positive-good argument to its final extreme conclusion.Eugene D. Genovese, The World the Slaveholders Made: Two Essays in Interpretation, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1971, p. 135 Fitzhugh argued that Southern slaves had a \\"guarantee of livelihood, protection and support,\\" and that if a master failed to perform his social welfare duties, he could be forced to sell his slaves to a more capable slaveholder.Eugene D. Genovese, The World the Slaveholders Made: Two Essays in Interpretation, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1971, p. 222 In this way, Fitzhugh contended that slavery relieves slaves of their cares altogether and that \\"slavery is a form...[the] very best form, of socialism.George Fitzhugh, Sociology For The South: Or The Failure Of A Free Society, Richmond, VA, A. Morris, 1854, p. 27-28 He believed that \\"Slavery protects the infants, the aged and the sick,\\" along with the healthy and the strong.George Fitzhugh, Sociology For The South: Or The Failure Of A Free Society, Richmond, VA, A. Morris, 1854, p. 46 Fitzhugh declared that \\"the unrestricted exploitation of so-called free society is more oppressive to the laborer than domestic slavery.\\"George Fitzhugh, Cannibals All!, or Slaves Without Masters, 1857, Preface, p. ix In later years, Fitzhugh not only supported slavery for blacks, but like other proslavery intellectuals, came to the conclusion that it was also suitable for whites, if considered unfit.Craven, Avery (1944). \\"Southern Attitudes Toward Abraham Lincoln,\\" Papers in Illinois History and Transactions for the year 1942, The Illinois State Historical Society, p. 17 He believed that to uphold paternalistic and equalitarian values, whites, if trained well and domesticated, could be as \\"faithful and valuable servants\\" as blacks.

Taking an authoritarian position, Fitzhugh argued that \\"All government is slavery,\\" and that \\"no one ought to be free.\\" George Fitzhugh, Sociology For The South: Or The Failure Of A Free Society, Richmond, VA, A. Morris, 1854, p. 170 And yet he, like other proslavery theorists, believed that \\"slavery ultimately made democracy work.\\" Paul Finkelman, Defending Slavery: Proslavery Thought in the Old South‚ÄîA Brief History with Documents, Bedford/St. Martin's, 2003, p. 37 Despite his views on democracy, Fitzhugh summed up his proslavery stance by arguing man's duty to protect the weak from the strong, writing: > 'It is the duty of society to protect the weak;' but protection cannot be > efficient without the power of control; therefore, 'It is the duty of > society to enslave the weak.' Cannibals All!, or Slaves Without Masters, > Richmond, VA, A. Morris, 1857, p. 278 Fitzhugh's views were influential and widely acknowledged in the South. The Richmond Enquirer found Fitzhugh's pro-slavery sentiments to be sound, declaring that the justification of slavery was not an issue of \\"mere negro slavery,\\" but that in of itself \\"slavery is a right, natural and necessary.\\"J. Watson Webb, Speech of General J. Watson Webb, at the Great Mass Meeting on the Battle Ground of Tippecanoe, 60,000 Freeman in Council, Third Edition, New York: NY, 1856, p. 57 Fitzhugh maintained that slavery was the best institution to ensure \\"the rights of man.\\" Wolfgang Schivelbusch, The Culture of Defeat: On National Trauma, Mourning, and Recovery, New York: NY, Picador: A Metropolitan Book, 2004, p. 45 Democratic Party's role in reshaping the issue of slavery Founded in 1828, the Democratic Party's success and prominence across the political landscape has been attributed to its ability to reshape the issue of slavery as a \\"morally beneficial institution,\\" especially to the more radical faction of Southerners within the Democratic Party.Colleen J. Shogan, The Moral Rhetoric of American Presidents, Texas A&M; University Press, 2007, p. 150 By the mid-nineteenth century, Democrats had become not only the most ardent defenders of slavery, but the most important institutional supporter of slavery.Andrew Prokop, \\"23 maps that explain how Democrats went from the party of racism to the party of Obama\\" , Vox, July 29, 2016 Andrew Jackson, who owned throughout his life up to 300 slaves,H.W.

Fox, starring Wild Bill Elliott, Tex Ritter, and Frank Mitchell. Plot Queen Katey is the owner of a large ranch. There is the beginning of a movement among the local homesteaders to drive Katey out, so that her land can be divided. Queen has a long-lost son, Prince, who she sends one of her ranch hands, Cannonball, to find. Cannonball arrives at the office of the Badlands County sheriff, Tex Martin. Cannonball explains to Tex that Prince has the letters \\"KT\\" on his forearm, where they had been branded when he was a youth by a man named Clem Jeter. Tex thinks he's seen that brand, and directs Cannonball to the saloon. While Cannonball is still on his way, Wild Bill Hickok is at the bar in the saloon. He observes a man who he could be the double for, playing cards. As he watches, he sees his double cheating, eventually taking all of another gambler's money. The double is Prince Katey. When Hickok confronts Prince and demands he return the other gambler's money, Prince draws on Hickok, but Hickok is faster and guns down Prince. Right after the gunfight, Cannonball enters the saloon and mistakes Hickok for Prince. He hustles Hickok out of the saloon, afraid that he might be charged with murder. As the two men ride off, Tex arrives at the bar and checks the body of the dead man. In so doing he discerns that Prince had been shot twice, once by Hickok, and another shot which entered his back. Tex realizes that it was the shot in the back which actually killed Prince. As they ride off, Cannonball lets Hickok know that he thinks he is Prince, and that Prince's mother needs his help in holding off a land grab by Jeter. Jeter is instigating the homesteaders in an attempt to run Queen Katey off her land. Understanding Queen's predicament, he agrees to accompany Cannonball to the ranch, playing along with the mistaken identity. They arrive at the ranch, where Queen accepts Hickok as her prodigal son. As they head to the Katey ranch, Beetle, the man who shot Prince in the back, arrives at Jeter's cabin, where he informs him of the demise of the Katey heir. With what he feels his final roadblock taken care of, Jeter rides off and gets a court order appointing him as Queen's guardian. However, when he arrives at the Katey ranch to serve the order, he is dumbfounded to find Prince (he assumes) alive and well. When Jeter demands that Hickok prove he is Prince, the two men fight, and Jeter is thrown off the ranch. Jeter confronts Beetle, who is adamant that Prince is dead, so this man must be an imposter. Meanwhile, Tex has set off after Cannonball and Hickok. He comes upon the burnt out ranch of the Brown's, Dakota and her father Bert. They tell him that it was Queen who burned down their house, in an attempt to drive them out of the county. As he is having dinner with the Browns, Jeter arrives and tells Tex that the man who killed Prince is posing as him at the Katey ranch. At the ranch, Queen realizes that Hickok is not Prince, and tells him that it has been Jeter who has been terrorizing the local homesteaders, including the arson at the Brown ranch, and blaming his actions on Queen. Hickok pledges to help Queen withstand Jeter's plan. When Tex arrives, he asks Hickok to turn himself in, which Hickok agrees to do, just later at the Brown's ranch. When Tex arrives at the Brown's ranch, someone takes a shot at him, which misses. He takes off after his assailant, but in doing so runs into Hickok. Initially he thinks it was Hickok who fired the shot, but when he sees that Hickok is free of soot, which would have been present if he had been hiding at the Brown's ranch to waylay him, he realizes that it wasn't Hickok. The two take off trying to track down the man who fired at Tex. The next morning, Hickok arrives back at the Katey ranch. There he finds Jeter and his men waiting for him. Jeter accuses Hickok of murder. Queen pulls a gun and a conflict ensues wherein Cannonball manages to ride off for help. Hickok and Queen manage to gain the ranchhouse, where they manage to hold off Jeter and his gang until Cannonball returns with Tex and Dakota. The bad guys are captured, and Dakota agrees to move in with Queen and look after her and the ranch.

The principle of public access to official documents also means that government officials and other central and local government employees are free to divulge information. Similar laws exist in over 70 countries, whereas 19 countries' legislation applies to information held by the government as well as private bodies, whereas the others apply to government information only.  Sweden  The principle of public access to official records has existed in Sweden since 1766 and has been enshrined in one of Sweden's fundamental laws: the Freedom of the Press Act (Swedish: Tryckfrihetsf√∂rordningen). Chapter 2, section 1 of Swedish law states: > In order to promote a free exchange of opinion, free and comprehensive > information, and free artistic creation, everyone should have the right to > take part in public documents The principle of public access to official records is designed to ensure that the public has a good understanding of, and can exercise civilian control over, the actions of the authorities. However, it does not give publicity to all governmental documents. For example, the deliberations of boards and working committees are usually not public.  Finland  The principle of public access to official records is established in Finland's constitution in Freedom of Expression and Right of Access to Information (Finnish: Sananvapaus ja julkisuus) chapter 2, section 12: > Documents and other records in the possession of the Authority shall be > publicly accessible unless, for imperative reasons, their disclosure is > specifically restricted by law. Everyone has the right of access to a public > document and record.  European Union  Since 2001, a type of public principle has also been the basis of public access to documents within the European Union. According to both the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Public Regulation, records must be provided on request, normally within 15 working days and in any of the official languages of the Union. However, there are several far-reaching exceptions that allow for the restriction of this principle of publicity. For example, with regard to public safety, the private life of the individual and the business interests of companies. In addition, the institutions may refuse to disclose internal documents that form the basis for decision-making processes that are ongoing if the disclosure is assumed to be able to influence the decision-making process.

The show features Adam Thorn, a wildlife biologist, and Rob \\"Caveman\\" Alleva, an animal handler. In the show, they attempt to get stung and bitten by animals and insects from different parts of the world, in order to measure the amount of pain they each receive from each bite or sting. Concept Inspired by the Schmidt Pain Index, biologist Adam Thorn and handler Rob \\"Caveman\\" Alleva test the bites and stings of animals with a new 30 point scale within 3 categories: intensity of initial physical pain, the duration of the pain, and the after effects or \\"damage\\". The scores from the three are rated from1-10 (10 being worst) and then added together and averaged out. The animal is then ranked among the scale using the honeybee sting as the baseline. Along with creatures from the Schmidt Pain Index, animals from other categories such as reptiles and marine animals are also tested. In addition to testing the bites and stings of animals, Thorn and Alleva have started another pain index which they call the \\"nature hurts\\" pain index, which is intended to measure the pain from hot peppers.

It is easy to see that if the random variables \\\\xi and \\\\eta are independent and normally distributed, then their sum and difference are also independent.

For later, see Timeline of Baltimore. * 1608 ‚Äì Captain John Smith, (c.1580-1631), sails north up Chesapeake Bay from the newly established Virginia colony at Jamestown, settled on the James River the year before, and records in his journal, first descriptions of the area that would become the future site of the city of Baltimore, then a hunting ground for local American natives. Smith records in his map and journal \\"a river not inhabited yet navigable\\", which he names the \\"Bolus Flu\\" for the reddish soil with iron ore found ‚Äì Indians who hunt in the region call it the \\"Patapsco\\". * 1624 - Sir George Calvert, (1579-1632), resigns office of King James I's Secretary of State, for the Kingdom of England and announces himself as converted to the minority, formerly outlawed faith of Roman Catholicism, and withdraws from public life. He received the title of nobility as Baron Baltimore (\\"Lord Baltimore\\") as a sign of personal friendship and gratitude from the English Monarch. He is added to the Irish peerage for the town of Baltimore, in the western half of County Cork in the province of Munster on the southern coast tip of Ireland, which England dominates. He will be succeeded by descendants of five more \\"Lord Baltimores\\" until title is extinguished in 1771 with the death of the sixth and last, Frederick Calvert. * 1632 ‚Äì After an unsuccessful attempt by Calvert to found an English colony in Avalon in Newfoundland (today's eastern Canada), a second Charter is granted to a colony further to the south in a more temperate climate by King Charles I of England to Sir George Calvert, (1579-1632), First Lord Baltimore, his father was King James I's former Secretary of State and respected friend of the monarch. This second grant is named \\"Maryland\\" for the King Charles's wife and Queen Consort Henrietta Maria of France, (1609-1669), and is laid out with straight but irregular inexact boundaries along the eastern and western shores of the Chesapeake Bay, north of the earlier 1607 colony of Virginia, above the separating Potomac River, and south and west of the Delaware River and Bay. Bordering the Swedish (New Sweden) and Dutch colonies of New Netherland, to the northeast and to keep them from moving south from the town of New Amsterdam with its Fort Amsterdam (modern New York City) along the Hudson River. These lay in between and south of other extensive English colonies settled beginning 1620 in New England, such as Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Boston and Connecticut colonies. * 1634 ‚Äì The Ark and The Dove, ships of George's eldest son, the second Lord Baltimore Cecilius Calvert's (1605-1675), first colonizing expedition, led by his younger brother Leonard Calvert, (1606-1647), (sent as first provincial governor), land on March 25th (later celebrated as an official state holiday, \\"Maryland Day\\") at Blakistone Island (St. Clement's Island) off the north shore of the Potomac River, bringing the first European settlers and African slaves to the new colonial Province of Maryland, * 1650 ‚Äì \\"Ann Arundell\\" County \\"erected\\" (established) further north along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near St. Mary's City along the Potomac River. Named for Lady Ann Arundell, [antique spelling different from modern], (1615/1616-1649), wife of Cecilius Calvert, second Lord Baltimore. * 1659 ‚Äì Baltimore County established in the northeast section of the Province, north of previous Anne Arundel County laid out nine years before, which it is cut from. Includes what is now Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Harford and Cecil counties. Officeholder of Sheriff for Baltimore County first designated in legal papers from the General Assembly is mentioned in writing for serving of legal papers. * 1661 ‚Äì First court sits for Baltimore County, meeting at Captain Thomas Howell's place in what is now modern Cecil County in the far northeast corner of the province. ** Charles Gorsuch, a Quaker, patents 50 acres of land on narrow jagged peninsula which juts out between two branches into the main lower Patapsco River, ending in \\"Whetstone Point\\". He promises to pay Lord Baltimore, the amount of 61 English pounds sterling per year for the use of the land. ** David Jones hires Peter Carroll to survey 380 acres along the stream which is later named \\"Jones Falls\\" in his honor. He built a house and is known as Baltimore's first settler. * 1663 ‚Äì Alexander Mountenay patented land named \\"Mountenay's Neck\\" along the Harford Run stream, where Central Avenue, formerly Canal Street, is now paved over in old east Baltimore's Jonestown and which is later sold and resurveyed to William Fell. ** Land is patented along Curtis Bay and Curtis Creek southwest off the lower Patapsco River estuary to Paul Kinsey naming it \\"Curtis's Neck\\". * 1664 ‚Äì Capt.

Later Parish is named as St. Paul's Church or Parish (of the \\"Anglican\\" Church) with small log building erected. One of the authorized \\"Original Thirty\\" parishes designated in the Province. Oldest church and congregation in greater Baltimore area and one of the oldest in the state. * 1693 ‚Äì Gov. Francis Nicholson (1693-1699) orders that a \\"garrison\\" or stone blockhouse be built in western reaches of Baltimore County (near modern community of Owings Mills) on what was Capt. Risteau's plantation. Built of stone, twenty by fifty feet, with a fireplace and small embrasures for musketry. The blockhouse is manned by one captain and nine soldiers. Fort Garrison now considered as the oldest colonial fort in Maryland and one of those in America. 18th century 1700s‚Äì1740s * 1704 ‚Äì Provincial law requires that enough trees be cut down to widen the main roads to twenty feet and that roads be marked. Marking system consists of cutting slashes in tree trunks: one vertical slash on a road leading to a church and three horizontal lines, two close together and one a bit higher on roads leading to a county courthouse. * 1706 ‚Äì Port of Baltimore established as an authorized for shipping of tobacco and other products by colonial General Assembly of the Province of Maryland for the upper Chesapeake Bay region at the head of the Patapsco River's Northwest Branch, in \\"The Basin\\" (now called \\"Inner Harbor\\"), west of inlet and small island at the mouth of the \\"Jones Falls\\" stream and \\"Harford Run\\" (later covered by Central Avenue in the 19th century) further to the east, both of which flow from the north, and a small stream flowing from the west, later called \\"Uhler's Run\\". Situated below the jagged cliff heights (later known after 1788 as \\"Federal Hill\\") to the south which overlook the protected harbor which has a twelve-foot depth, enough for ocean-going sailing ships, along a narrow peninsula (old South Baltimore) leading to Whetstone Point. Although only a few ships make anchor the first years by Whetstone Point, it never grows into a town as did deeper anchorages further upstream at future Fells Point and Baltimore Town. * 1711 ‚Äì Charles Carroll of Annapolis, (1702‚Äì1782), sells 31 acres to Jonathan Hanson who erects a mill, probably the first along the Jones Falls in the vicinity of the intersection with later-day Holliday Street. * 1715 ‚Äì General Assembly of the colonial Province of Maryland authorizes convening of a Court to serve the growing numbers of residents ‚Äì farmers, merchants, mechanics, shipbuilders in northeastern Maryland which is now called \\"Baltimore County\\", since 1659 and sets four sessions per year for the Court on the first Tuesday of March, June, August and November. * 1723 ‚Äì Capt. Robert North takes up residence in the County and is one of the original lot owners. He commands the ship \\"Content \\" which he carries in freight this year. * 1726 ‚Äì Richard Gist lays out future port community for Edward Fell called \\"Fell's Prospect\\", and surveys three dwellings, several tobacco houses, an orchard and a mill ‚Äì Jonathan Hanson's. Fell builds a store, and the area eventually came to be called \\"Fell's Point\\". Edward Fell's brother William, a carpenter arrives from Lancashire, England in 1730 and purchases 100 acres named \\"Copus Harbor\\" at \\"Long Island Point\\" (vicinity of modern Lancaster Street, near Philpot Street ‚Äì east of Jones Falls mouth ‚Äì today's \\"Harbor East and new developments at \\"Harbor Point\\" in 2013) and builds house and shipyard. * 1728 ‚Äì John Cockey (whose brother Thomas purchased property in \\"Limestone Valley\\" on the York Road up in central Baltimore County giving his name to the future Cockeysville) purchases land near the Patapsco. * 1729 ‚Äì County citizens petition the colonial General Assembly to establish a Town for the ease of exporting tobacco and importing goods from overseas and further expanding the 1706 Port and Harbor. Original site planned and designated was on north shore of the Patapsco's \\"Middle Branch\\" (also known as \\"Ridgeley's Cove\\") owned by John Moale, a merchant from Devonshire, England who later objected to the site of the new Town, believing that valuable iron ore deposits were located there. So the first commissioners appointed ‚Äì (\\"Gentlemen of Consequence\\": Thomas Tolley, William Hamilton, William Buckner, Dr. George Walker, Richard Gist, Dr. George Buchanan, and William Hammond) instead purchased to the northeast, 60 acres of land of Charles Carroll's \\"Cole's Harbor/Todd's Range\\" along the north side of the future \\"Basin\\" (Inner Harbor) at the head of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River from Daniel (1696‚Äì1751), and Charles Carroll of Annapolis, (1702‚Äì1782) and county surveyor Philip Jones plans to lay out three streets: Calvert, Forest (later called Charles) which ran north to south, and the east- west Long or later called Market (after the 1760s and still later further as East and West Baltimore) Street. \\"The Town of Cecilius Calvert, Lord Baltimore\\" was then founded with the sole resident of the area at the time: John Fleming (whose house stood near southeast corner of Forest (future South Charles) and King George (later East Lombard) Streets). * 1730 ‚Äì The \\"Original Survey\\" taken on January 12, and 60 one-acre lots were laid out by County Surveyor Philip Jones beginning at an oak tree located then at present site of Forest (South Charles) and future Camden Streets. Three streets laid out and confirmed: Calvert, Forest (Charles), and Long (later renamed Market, then Baltimore Street), with smaller streets/alleys: Hanover, German and Water Streets with \\"Great Eastern Road\\" running along the northwest edge of the new town connecting with Philadelphia, 90 miles to the northeast, and with Georgetown, Maryland on the Potomac River to the southwest and the provincial capital town of Annapolis to the south (colonial capital since 1694). Southwestern village boundary is along \\"Uhler's Run\\" stream ‚Äì later Uhler's Alley, ‚Äì southwest of Forest and King George Streets (later South Charles and West Lombard Sts.). Waterfront shoreline to the south with first wharves located along riverside of \\"The Basin\\" (later Inner Harbor) at German and Water Streets (at approximate site of modern Redwood/Water Streets ‚Äì three blocks further north of modern (2019) shoreline/\\"Harborplace\\"). \\"Steiger's Meadow\\" (northeast of town) and \\"Harrison's Marsh\\" (east of town) were along the west bank of the Jones Falls stream to the east of new Town. Charles Carroll of Annapolis as owner of the property has first choice and chooses Lot #49 at Calvert Street and the Basin, Philip Jones, the surveyor picks Lot #37 on the Basin at the foot of Charles Street. Sixteen men take up lots that first day, many along the waterfront. Process continues over the next few years with some later forfeiting their claim for not building within eighteen months. Ten years later some lots are still held by the town commissioners ‚Äì so not exactly a boom town right off. ** St. Paul's Anglican Parish, of the \\"established\\" (colony-supported) Church of England, established earlier in 1692 as one of \\"Original Thirty\\" parishes in the colonial Province of Maryland, is moved from a rough church structure near Colgate Creek on the \\"Patapsco Neck\\" peninsula (near modern Dundalk and Sea Girt Marine Terminals of the Port of Baltimore, which had been site of old Harbor Field and Baltimore Municipal Airport in the 1930s and 40s), between the lower Patapsco and Back Rivers to the southeast of Baltimore County. Later a year after establishment of the new town, the Vestry (congregation council) of St. Paul's Parish purchases Lot #19 at southeast of Forest Street (later North Charles Street) and large lot extends to the east to St. Paul's Lane (later St. Paul Street/Place/\\"Preston Gardens\\") overlooking rugged cliffs above Jones Falls loop to the southwest before turning north again, with south lot boundary line extending to New Church Lane (later East Lexington Street ‚Äì renamed after American Revolution ‚Äì later vicinity known as North Charles and East Saratoga Streets). Construction of church as first brick building in town begins the following year. * 1731 ‚Äì Baltimore Ironworks Company formed by Daniel Dulany the Elder, Benjamin Tasker, Sr., and members of the Carroll family: Dr. Charles Carroll, Charles Carroll, Esq., and Daniel Carroll who establish iron ore pits, furnace works and export through Baltimore and Fells Point. * 1732 ‚Äì \\"Jones's Town\\", a tract of ten acres of 20 lots along four streets (also later called \\"Old Town\\" by the 19th century) laid out by county surveyor Philip Jones for relative David Jones; established along northeast bank of Jones Falls which flows into the Patapsco's Northwest Branch, east of \\"The Basin\\". * 1739 ‚Äì First brick building completed in town built for church for \\"Old St. Paul's Anglican Parish\\" at Forest (Charles) Street and Fish Lane (later East Saratoga Street) on northern edge of town perched on cliffs to the east overlooking St. Paul's Lane (now Street/Place) and the Jones Falls loop using 600,000 bricks newly manufactured in Baltimore by Charles Wells. Building faces future Lexington Street side to the south and Lower Town. Cemetery laid out around church building. New Church Street laid out south of new church building (later renamed Lexington Street after American Revolution). * 1740 ‚Äì Methodist itinerant preacher and missionary George Whitefield (1714‚Äì1770), preaches here inspired by evangelical \\"First Great Awakening\\" religious revival meetings and Church of England ministers John Wesley (1703‚Äì1791), and Charles Wesley (1707‚Äì1788). * 1741 ‚Äì First brick house built in town for Edward Fortrell from Ireland with free-stone corners, two stories high with peaked roof at northwest corner of Calvert Street and Fish Lane (later East Fayette Street). Later site of large sumptuous James Buchanan mansion/townhouse of 1799 ‚Äì later sold to noted U.S. Senator Reverdy Johnson, (1796‚Äì1876), and ransacked in 1835 during infamous Baltimore bank riot, also future site of southeast corner of 1894‚Äì1900 Baltimore City/Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr. Courthouse, opposite future Courthouse/Battle Monument Square. * 1745 ‚Äì Merger of \\"Jones's Town\\" (later also known as \\"Old Town\\") and \\"Baltimore Town\\" authorized on September 28th by General Assembly of Maryland enlarges the original settlement on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River with an important wooden bridge constructed at Bridge Street (later named Gay Street) connecting the two, crossing the Jones Falls stream (flowing south from upper Baltimore County and Pennsylvania) and the adjacent \\"Harrison's Marsh\\" (on land of Thomas Harrison) to the south and \\"Steiger's Meadow\\" to the northwest by the \\"Loop\\" of the Jones Falls flowing from the north to southwest, with then turning northeast, then continuing further south to drain into the Patapsco River's \\"Basin\\" at the head of its Northwest Branch, separating the two villages. The merged two villages are now according to the Assembly's Act to be called \\"Baltimore Town\\". * 1746 ‚Äì Town Commissioners hire Capt. Robert North to build fence around former Jones's Town area and then follow two years later with a subscription by townspeople to build post and fence around Baltimore Town and keep in repair, prohibiting raising hogs and geese, with three gates ‚Äì one at west end of Long Street (later known as Market Street, then Baltimore Street), one at the upper part of Bridge Street (later renamed Gay Street) over the Jones Falls and a third smaller portal near the north end of Charles Street near old St. Paul's Anglican Church for foot passengers, completed 1750. Unfortunately, the next few winters are severe and scavengers strip pieces for winter firewood and by 1752, fence remnants are sold off as lumber. * 1747 ‚Äì Act of the Maryland General Assembly on July 11th, authorized the addition of 18 acres that lay to the east of the edge of Town and between the west bank of the Jones Falls, including the then named \\"Harrison's Marsh\\" of Thomas Harrison, later memorialized by the naming of Harrison Street in the vicinity, which existed until the 1980s, going north-south between Frederick Street and the stream. First of many future annexations and growth of the Town/City's jurisdiction into the surrounding Baltimore County, prompted by the earlier merger with Jones's Town two years before on the eastern bank of The Falls. Nicholas Ruxton Gay does the surveying and in turn Bridge Street and the wooden bridge spanning Jones Falls uniting Old Baltimore Town with its eastern neighbor of Jones Town is renamed for him. Over the following two centuries, several bridges are built for Gay Street over the Falls until it is diverted into underground conduits in 1913-1914. It is extended several miles through various future neighborhoods of East Baltimore to the northeast edge of the 1818 old city limits at Boundary Avenue (later renamed East North Avenue) and changes over to Belair Road (later designated U.S. Route 1 in the 1920s), leading to the county seat town of Bel Air in Harford County. ** Town's first attempt to deal with the flimsy wooden structures of the era and constant threat of conflagration was in July, with provisions regarding fire prevention was added to the Act enlarging the town boundaries. Housekeepers were to be subject to a ten shilling fine if they do not \\"keep a ladder high enough to extend to the top of the roof of such house or if their chimneys blaze out\\" was another order of the town commissioners and that if a fire does break out, for all to grab a bucket and come running. At night, two men were to lead the way, one carrying a torch and the other blowing a fog horn. ** Seven ships have called at the growing Port of Baltimore this year, with fifteen arriving the following year (1748), all bound for London. * 1749 ‚Äì First recorded fire in Baltimore Town on March 16, at the home of Greenbury Dorsey, at an unrecorded location. Unfortunately, one man, four children and \\"one colored girl\\" were burned to death. 1750s‚Äì1790s * 1750 ‚Äì First German Reformed Church organized. Second oldest Protestant congregation in town. Invites Rev. John Christian Faber to become their pastor in 1756 and begin building a structure just north of Old St. Paul's Anglican Church (Church of England) on Forest (North Charles) Street, with some Evangelical Lutherans from Germany worshipping with them. Congregation later moves to Front Street at East Baltimore Street by Jones Falls east bank, but structure damaged by flood before completion ‚Äì help to finish building given by ministers of other local churches ‚Äì Anglican, Presbyterian and Lutheran. Later landmark building surmounted by tall steeple and prominent \\"town clock\\". This First German Reformed congregation later relocates in 1928 to York Road (Maryland Route 45) n Rodgers Forge/Stoneleigh/Anneslie (in northern suburbs) and merges with more prosperous daughter church ‚Äì St. Stephen's, becoming known as First and St. Stephen's in the Evangelical and Reformed Church ‚Äì later the United Church of Christ national denomination after its 1957 merger. ** Additional 25 acres of land added to the Town, north and east of the former Jones' Town, east of the Jones Falls. ** Beginning of a several years-long controversy with the Town Commissioners ordering on February 6, that citizens provide themselves with ladders high enough to reach the tops of their roofs before the next month of March. By the following year when seeing not all residents were sufficiently supplied because of living in rented quarters, the board ordered the clerk to place advertisements applying the requirement to landlords also. * 1751 ‚Äì Subscription and lottery attempt fails to build public market house for Baltimore Town. But successful twelve years later by 1763 at northwest corner of Long Street (later Market, then Baltimore Street) and Bridge Street (later Gay Street). Replaced by later Centre (\\"Marsh\\") Market in 1782 at Market (East Baltimore) Street and Market Place/Harrison Street by west bank of Jones Falls, and supplemented by other markets in western precincts (Lexington Market) and eastern precincts (Broadway Market in Fells Point) by 1784. ** Further sanitary regulations promulgated by the town commissioners: \\"Whereas several persons permit stinking fish, dead creatures or carrion to lie on their Lotts or in the Streets near their doors which are very offensive Nuisances and contrary to Act of Assembly, the Commissioners therefore Order the Clerk to put up advertisements to inform such Persons that they are to remove them ...\\" * 1752 ‚Äì First Census taken of Baltimore Town lists 30 names of settlers, first census of surrounding Baltimore County enumerates free whites ‚Äì 11,345, white servants and convicts ‚Äì 1,501, black and mulatto slaves ‚àí 4,143, free blacks and mulattos ‚Äì 204. ** First historic illustration drawing of the new Town by John Moale (1731‚Äì1798, son of man who had objected to original laying out town site on upper Middle Branch/Ridgley's Cove of Patapsco River), showing approximately 25 houses ‚Äì four of brick, one brick church, two taverns (Payne's and Kaminsky's ‚Äì on corner of future Grant and Mercer Streets alleys in the block bounded by modern German/Redwood, Light, Water and South Calvert Streets, endures as wooden frame structure with \\"Dutch\\" hipped roof, tavern later raised higher on stone foundation which becomes ground/first floor until photographed and razed in 1870), one brewery (Barnetz Brothers), one tobacco inspection warehouse, one wharf, a barber shop and an insurance office. The country-like view, with its few buildings and rolling hills and forests of topography was taken looking north from the overlook on rugged cliffside heights (called \\"John Smith Hill\\" since 1608 and later named Federal Hill after 1788 and surrounding neighborhood by early 1800s), to the south of \\"The Basin\\" (later called the \\"Inner Harbor\\"). Baltimore in 1752. Engraved in 1851 by William Strickland, from then contemporary sketch by John Moale [jr.], (1731‚Äì1798) ** School first organized by Mr. James Gardner at South and Second (later Water) Streets along harbor north shoreline. * 1753 ‚Äì Influential citizens John Stevenson, Richard Chase, John Moale, William and Nicholas Rogers, John Ridgely, Nicholas Ruxton Gay, William Lux (son of Darby Lux I) and Brian Philpot manage lottery to raise money for building additional public wharf. * 1754 ‚Äì Mount Clare Mansion begins construction on what is originally called \\"Georgia Plantation\\" estate, north of Gwynns Falls stream, northwest of \\"Ridgeley's Cove\\" on Ferry Branch (later known as Middle Branch) of Patapsco River and southwest of growing Baltimore Town laid out in 1729-1730, along the Georgetown Road (later called Columbia Road, then as Washington Boulevard, also future U.S. Route 1 running along East Coast from Maine to Florida by the 1920s). Near future city neighborhood of Pigtown (and Washington Village), restored and gentrified community of \\"Ridgely's Delight\\" and in future surrounding Carroll Park in southwest Baltimore which is purchased by City in 1890 as its third major city park along with the mansion house and restored as one of the first historic sites preserved in the early 20th century. Mansion construction of Georgian architectural style built about 1760 by John Henry Carroll, brother of Charles Carroll (barrister) (1723‚Äì1783), and cousin of Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737‚Äì1832), who is most famous as an American patriot as later Maryland delegate to Second Continental Congress, last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, and honorary layer of \\"First Stone\\" for the new Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1828. Later occupied by Charles Carroll, Barrister. * 1755 ‚Äì After occasionally worshipping with Reformed Protestant Germans in Baltimore Town, Lutherans from Germany establish separate Evangelical Lutheran congregation and begin meeting in various homes of members. Later moves in 1758/1762? to Bridge Street (later known as North Gay Street) west of Jones Falls, near future East Saratoga Street with small brick church constructed with bell tower. Later moves one block south on Bridge Street down to corner with New Church Street (later after Revolution known as East Lexington Street) and becomes known as \\"Zion Church of the City of Baltimore\\" or also as Old Zion Lutheran Church. After fire damage, building rebuilt without front bell tower in Georgian/Federal style in 1807‚Äì08, designed and built by parish members George Rohrback and Johann Mekenheimer. * German Reformed congregation invites Rev.

The new immigrants settle around South Forest (Charles), and west of King George's (Lombard) Streets, near old \\"Uhler's Run\\" (stream), southwest of the Town and west of \\"The Basin\\" harbor (modern Inner Harbor). The area becomes known in the late 18th Century and early 19th Century as \\"Frenchtown\\". Additional influx of pioneer frontier colonial settlers from Appalachian Mountains of western Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, driven or forced back east by attacks from Indians and French military. * 1761 ‚Äì After occasionally joining German Lutherans and Reformed (Protestants) in services established earlier, Presbyterians (Scottish) and Reformed English Protestants (many \\"Scots-Irish\\" from Great Britain and Ireland) began worshiping in local houses around \\"The Basin\\" harbor. They constructed a log church two years later for their congregation at East Lane (later East Fayette) and Bridge (later North Gay) Streets, which was followed in 1765, by a more substantial brick church several blocks west at the northwest corner of East Fayette and North (later renamed Guilford Avenue) Streets. First minister called for this First Presbyterian Church of Baltimore is the Rev. Dr. Patrick Allison (1740‚Äì1802), a most influential man, both in his church and denomination and in the educational, cultural and civic affairs of the town for forty years. Rev. Allison is also instrumental in organizing the regional Presbytery of Baltimore, later in 1786, and a larger national General Assembly of Presbyterians, along with participating in joint endeavors with the later Roman Catholic bishop and Anglican priest, with forming several schools, attempting establishment of a college, various lectures and literary societies and the organization of a subscription/membership community library for the educated elite. * 1763 ‚Äì Fells Point established further east along the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River, west of small peninsula near the inlet formed by \\"Harford Run\\", a stream channeled between two parallel lanes of old Canal Street, and later under modern, paved-over Central Avenue as it reaches the main Patapsco River's Northwest Branch. The new waterfront port town, east of Baltimore Town and quickly becomes a major shipbuilding area with its deeper channel and pier berths, extending along eastern northern shore of Patapsco to confluence with \\"Harris Creek\\" (now under the modern-day industrial and residential community of Canton), site of later 18th Century shipbuilding yards including David Stoddart's where the U.S.F. Constellation is built, second ship of the \\"Original Six Frigates\\" of the newly re-organized U.S. Navy in 1797. ** \\"The Mechanical Company\\" organized as first volunteer fire fighting company in town and a \\"Baltimore Fire Engine and Wharf Lottery\\" is proposed on July 16 to be held to provide additional funds to complete the construction of the new market house, buy two engines and purchase leather buckets with the winning drawing held on Dec. 26th. Six years later, a new revolutionary invention, a hand fire engine is discovered on board a Dutch ship anchored in the harbor, which the Company buys for 99 pounds sterling (=$264) and named it \\"The Dutchman\\", enabling Baltimoreans to boast that they had a fire engine ten years before Boston and thirty years before Paris. Mechanical Company of volunteer firemen, later forms a local militia unit and develops into a social and political club which endures 250 years later. The Mechanical Fire Company is followed for the next several decades by several other fire-fighting companies to approximately 17 by unification in 1858. ** First public market house for the town of two stories height erected with 3,000 English pounds raised by lottery. Town Commissioners William Lyon, Nicholas Gay, John Moale, and Archibald Buchanan lease land on July 16 from Thomas Harrison at eight pounds per year at northwest corner of Long Street, (soon to be renamed ‚Äì Market Street ‚Äì later renamed again as East Baltimore Street) at intersection with Bridge (later North Gay) Street on the eastern edge of Harrison's Marsh by the western bank of the Jones Falls, (later known as the \\"Centre Market\\" or occasionally as \\"Marsh Market\\" ‚Äì named for the nearby swamp to the south and west along the west bank of the Falls owned by Harrison). Market built with second floor for entertainment, cultural and educational events and indoor mass public assemblies. Lottery stages to build market house, buy two fire engines and a parcel of leather buckets and enlarge the public wharf. The scheme is to sell 3,000 tickets at 20 shillings each, with \\"winners\\" of 1,062 tickets to draw prizes amounting to 2,480 pounds, leaving a net gain for the public improvements of 510 pounds. Near-by Harrison Street, later to the south as \\"Market Place\\" and its central horse fountain were later sites of subsequent market houses in 1851 and 1907 lasting to 1984. Centre Market House is also the location on the second and third floors of the 1851 landmark structure for the \\"Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts\\" until the \\"Great Baltimore Fire\\" of 1904, then M.I.'s College of Art and Design rebuilt 1907 on top floors in the northern market building of three parallel structures until the early 1980s when razed for Baltimore \\"Metro\\" subway \\"Shot Tower/Market Place\\" station. Currently the \\"Port Discovery\\" children's museum in the old \\"Fish Market\\", middle market building of three reconstructed. * 1765 ‚Äì British Parliament's passage of the \\"Stamp Act\\" led to protests against the first direct tax levied on the American colonies by Great Britain and provoked mass assemblies and growing unrest throughout the Thirteen Colonies and at the public center of the Town at the Baltimore County/Town Courthouse in the Square on Calvert Street, between New Church Street (East Lexington) and Fish Lane (later East Fayette Street), overlooking the cliff to the Jones Falls loop. ** Another 35 acres of territory annexed to Baltimore Town, now west of \\"The Basin\\" (now Inner Harbor) and southwest and south of Town. * 1767 ‚Äì Campaign waged in the colonial General Assembly of the Province of Maryland by merchants and residents of emerging main town in Baltimore County for Baltimore Town to become the new county seat. 109 years after establishment of a large tract of northeastern Maryland as Baltimore County (1659), an Act passed the middle of the following year on June 25 moving seat and courthouse, with appointed/elected judges, sheriff and deputies, bailiff, jail, alms house along with a town crier from \\"Old Joppa\\" at the mouth of the Great Gunpowder River. New courthouse & adjacent buildings built in the port town in a square the following year (1768) at north end of North Calvert Street and between Fish Lane (later East Fayette) and New Church Street (East Lexington) on town's northern fence about 100 feet above waterfront (about 30 to 40 feet above modern pavement level) near cliff overlooking southwestward loop of Jones Fall. Whipping post, pillory and stocks also erected in Square (later Battle Monument Square after 1815‚Äì1822, with erection of new second courthouse to the westward side and replaced by new soldiers monument for War of 1812 and new 1801 jail further out along east bank of Jones Falls, north of present East Madison Street). Controversy and political battles continue throughout County between northern and southern regions, between Baltimore Town with old county seat at Joppa, Maryland residents result. * 1768 ‚Äì Baltimore County/Town Courthouse construction began in square along Calvert Street between Fish Lane (later East Fayette Street) and New Church Lane (later East Lexington Street) of Colonial style architecture with red brick and white wood cupola surmounted by weather vane (first of three courthouses near same site) on northern edge of town overlooking cliffs of southwestward loop of Jones Falls to the east at a cost of 900 pounds sterling raised by townfolk. * 1769 ‚Äì Evangelical Lutherans at Old Zion Lutheran Church at North Gay and East Lexington Streets, begin German language instruction in school. * 1770 ‚Äì Large substantial Henry Fite House built of brick with three and half stories at southwest corner of South Sharp (to the north was future North Liberty Street ‚Äì after the Revolution) and Market (later West Baltimore) Streets on western edge of Town.

This is the oldest ancestor of a string of later merged newspapers which after reorganization in 1799 eventually became by 1936 under newspaper syndicate mogul William Randolph Hearst, became the Baltimore News-Post published (Monday-Saturday) and continuation of the Baltimore American (published on Sunday only), and then combined by publisher son William Randolph Hearst, Jr. as The News American in 1964. Closed in 1986 by the Hearst Company making the City a \\"one- newspaper town\\" with the continued publication of The Sun, since 1837. ** Baltimore Town (which had already absorbed nearby village across Jones Falls, of Jones Town a few years earlier) now merges with Fells Point of 80 acres to form combined town government and council. ** General Assembly of Maryland establishes first Alms House and adjoining Work House for Baltimore County and Town's poor, indigent and disabled on land purchased from William Lux for 350 pounds northwest of town in square bounded by Howard, Eutaw, Biddle and Garden Streets with trustees appointed: Charles Ridgely, William Lux, John Moale, William Smith, Samuel Purviance of the Town, and Andrew Buchanan and Harry Dorsey Gough from the County. Alms House later relocated east of the city and becomes the ancestor of the later Bayview Asylum, then evolves into a general municipal medical facility renamed the Baltimore City Hospitals by the 1920s. Set up by city to semi-independent status with temporary name of Francis Scott Key Medical Center then transferred to the Johns Hopkins Hospital medical system ‚Äì now the modern Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center on Eastern Avenue, (Md.

British fleet from New York feints going past at Baltimore and sails up Chesapeake Bay going northeast to land at Head of Elk in Cecil County. Baltimore Town serves as \\"temporary American capital\\" until two months later in February 1777. \\"Old Congress Hall\\" later becomes residence and office for New England merchant and financier, George Peabody,(1795‚Äì1869), after he arrives in City in 1816 to spend twenty years here beginning mercantile business, going on to New York City and London, to become one of the richest men in the world at that time, endowing several Baltimore and Massachusetts institutions with his fortune. \\"Fite House\\"/\\"Congress Hall\\" lasts until destroyed in Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904. * 1777 ‚Äì Town postmistress, newspaper publisher and local printer Mary Katharine Goddard, (1738‚Äì1816), who has succeeded to posts after travels of brother editor/publisher/printer William Goddard, (1740‚Äì1817), publishes at her office at 250 Market Street (now East Baltimore Street) near South Street in January for the first time, a broadside poster of the full text of the Declaration of Independence with not only just text of the reasons for declaring independence as in previous editions and newspaper articles by others, but also for first time, lists all the names of the signers/delegates representing the thirteen now independent states of the independence resolution passed July 2 by the Congress.

She studied Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Wolfson College at the University of Cambridge and graduated with first class honours in 2013. In 2017, she obtained a PhD for a thesis entitled Shi øi opposition and authoritarian transition in contemporary Bahrain: the shifting political participation of a marginalised majority at the University of Melbourne in 2017. She is currently Melbourne Early Career Academic Fellow and Lecturer in Islamic Studies at the Asia Institute of the University of Melbourne.  Detention in Iran  The intelligence arm of the islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps arrested her in September 2018 at Tehran Airport as she was leaving the country after attending a conference. She was flagged as ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù by a fellow academic and by a subject she interviewed for her research. She was subsequently tried and sentenced to ten years in prison for espionage.

Although it is no longer a residential bishopric, it has been a titular bishopric in the Roman Catholic Church since the Middle Ages. According to the Latin martyrologies, the sibling saints Mary, Martha and Lycarion were martyred at Tanis.Hippolyte Delehaye, Les martyrs d'√âgypte (Soci√©t√© des Bollandistes, 1923), pp. 67, 86.

Tanis declined in importance relative to its seaport of Tinnis. In the fifth century, many of the environs of Tanis had been lost to the sea. After the Arab conquest of Egypt, the Islamic geographers still considered it one of the most fertile places in Egypt with a pleasant climate. The city was ultimately abandoned, the inhabitants even moving their dead to Tinnis, which itself was abandoned in 1192.E. A. Wallis Budge, The Nile: Notes For Travellers In Egypt, 4th ed. (T. Cook, 1895), p. 135. Tanis was a suffragan diocese of the metropolitan province of Pelusium, which corresponded to the Roman province of Augustamnica Prima.Sim√©on Vailh√©, \\"Tanis\\", in The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 14. (Robert Appleton Company, 1912). In 1220, however, the Catholic bishop James of Vitry on the Fifth Crusade recorded that Tanis was a diocese in the metropolitan province of Damietta.Malcolm Barber and Keith Bate (eds.), Letters from the East: Crusaders, Pilgrims and Settlers in the 12th‚Äì13th centuries (Ashgate, 2013), p. 121. At the time of the Council of Nicaea in 325, the bishop of Tanis was a Melitian named Eudaemon. He is mentioned in letters of Bishop Melitius of Lycopolis and Patriarch Athanasius of Alexandria. In a letter written fourteen years later in 339, Athanasius indicates that the reigning bishop was a certain Theodore, who had succeeded Elias. In 362, the bishop was Hermion (Hermaeon). At the Council of Ephesus of 449Richard Price and Michael Gaddis (eds.), The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, 3 vols. (Liverpool University Press, 2005), vol. 1, p. 146. and the Council of Chalcedon of 451, the attending bishop of Tanis was Apollonius.The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, vol. 1, p. 126. A Miaphysite, he spoke up in defence of EutychesThe Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, vol. 1, p. 289. and against Eusebius of Dorylaeum and Flavian of Constantinople at Ephesus.The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, vol. 1, pp. 355‚Äì56. He was signatory to the acts of Ephesus that were overturned at Chalcedon.The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, vol. 1, p. 362. At Chalcedon he was one of the thirteen Egyptian bishops (out of twenty) who presented a petition defending their orthodoxy to the emperors Marcian and Valentinian III. It was read out before the council during the fourth session.The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon, vol. 2, pp. 147‚Äì149. By 458 the bishop of Tanis was a certain Paul. A further eight bishops of the Coptic Orthodox Church are known by name down to the end of the eleventh century, according to the 18th-century historian Michel Le Quien: Mark, Isaac (fl. 831), Demetrius, Mennas, Simon (fl. 1047), Michael (fl. 1049) and Samuel (fl. 1086).Michel Le Quien, Oriens Christianus in quatuor patriarchatus digestus (Paris, 1740), pp. 535‚Äì538. In 870, according to the first-hand account of the Frankish pilgrim Bernard, there were still many Christians in Tanis and they were burning with excessive hospitality. In 1051, Bishop Michael wrote a continuation of the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria covering the patriarchs from Michael III to Shenoute II. His was perhaps the last section to have been written originally in Coptic.Samuel Moawad, \\"Coptic Historiography\\", in Gawdat Gabra (ed.), Coptic Civilization: Two Thousand Years of Christianity in Egypt (American University in Cairo Press, 2014), p. 13.

It contains newly recorded versions of American Finnish industrial folk music songs. Background The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), an anarchistic trade union in the United States and Canada, had a strong singing tradition, and many of its American Finnish communities also had songs in Finnish. These songs had all but been forgotten, when musicologist Saijaleena Rantanen found three Finnish language IWW songbooks in the Immigration History and Research Center archive in Minneapolis and at the Lakehead University archive in Thunder Bay, Canada. Of these three books, only one had a known copy in Finland, whereas of the two others, only individual pages had remained. The songs had last been heard possibly a hundred years previously at the American Finn halls. The songbooks only contained the words of the songs, no sheet music. Finding the melodies took some deduction and detective work. It was easy to connect the song Solidaarisuutta aina to an English song called Solidarity Forever, but the melody of the song Langenneen laulun (‚Äòthe song of the fallen woman‚Äô) was more difficult to find. In the end, Rantanen found the sheet music of this song for the piano at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.. The authors of many of the texts are unknown, as the authors would have been likely to have been faced with discrimination at their work places. The IWW grew in popularity in the 1910s. The Finns called the members of this union with the word ‚Äútuplajuulaiset‚Äù (‚Äòdouble U folks‚Äô). Finns constituted the biggest ethnic segment of this union and they were also the most active members. The circulation of their magazine, the Industrialisti was 10,000 copies. Many of the IWW members knew little or no English, so it was natural for the union to produce songs in the Finnish language. The melodies of these songs were in many cases familiar to the Finns, and it was easy for them to learn the new words to them. The melodies came from here and there, e.g. from Oskar Merikanto, and the Swedish American Joe Hill, whose real name was Joel H√§gglund. One melody was taken from the song The Battle Hymn of the Republic, and others were taken from the theater and from folk music. Rantanen told of her finds to music producer and connoisseur of working class folk music Timo ‚ÄúTipi‚Äù Tuovinen, and together they continued the detective work. Some four decades earlier, in the late 1970s, Tuovinen had collected anti-church American Finnish music, and he was planning to release a record of it, but the bankruptcy of Love Records put and end to those plans. In the 1980s, the Finnish record companies were not interested in such themes. The next thing to happen was that Tuovinen suggested to the rap artist Paleface that they should put together a band that would play the Finnish IWW songs. Paleface had earlier performed songs by Hiski Salomaa and Joe Hill, it did not take much persuasion to get him on the band wagon. The third member to join the group was Ossi Peura, and now they had a core of a band that could sing harmonies. After this accordionist Harri Kuusij√§rvi and drummer Anssi Nyk√§nen joined the band. Tuovinen and Peura arranged the songs, with their previous expertise of the music genres of the times, but the use of imagination also played a part, as it had done with the American Finns of the time. The name Laulava unioni (‚ÄòThe Singing Union‚Äô) was chosen for the band, as that is what the IWW was also called in America. On the songs of the record The music for the song Pontevat mahat was composed by Oskar Merikanto, and the original is the provincial song of Lapland and North Ostrobothnia. Also the music in Hoopon laulu (‚ÄòThe Hobo Song‚Äô) was by Merikanto, the original being called Tula tuulan tuli tuli tei!Tie vapauteen, inlay card of the CD. The melody for Siisp√§ laulakaa (‚ÄòSing, therefore‚Äô) was taken from the song ‚ÄúMy Old Kentucky Home‚Äù, whereas that of S√§√§lik√§√§ herroja (‚ÄòHave mercy on the fine gentlemen‚Äô) is from an old Methodist hymn. Also the melody for Karvajalka is from a hymn called Sunlight, Sunlight. In Kirkkopotpuri (‚ÄòChurch Potpourri‚Äô) the melodies of a German youth song and the Swedish birthday song Ja m√• han leva are combined. The band had to exercise some artistic freedom, as the W folks‚Äô songs often had a great many verses, even up to 40 of them, and it is not possible to perform such songs in their entirety today. Many of the songs are in major scale, which gives them a joyous feeling, and included are also some rowdy ditties making fun of this or that.

He was an openly faithless elector in the 2016 election when he refused to cast his vote in the Electoral College (Texas) for Donald Trump for President and Mike Pence for Vice-President.  Early life  Suprun was born in Richmond, Virginia. Suprun is an alumnus of George Mason University where he majored in economics. He served as both a volunteer and paid firefighter/paramedic from 1992 until today. Suprun also taught for The George Washington University and US Secret Service. Suprun has published dozens of articles on fire and EMS response.  Faithless Elector  A Republican elector from Texas in the 2016 United States presidential election, Suprun announced in a December 5, 2016 New York Times oped he was withholding his Electoral College votes for Donald Trump for President and Mike Pence for Vice-President. Suprun ultimately cast ballots for Governor John Kasich of Ohio and Carly Fiorina of California for president and vice- president respectively. His decision was not without controversy. Suprun was attacked on a number of fronts for his decision to not vote for the Trump- Pence ticket whom he was pledged. He and his family received multiple death threats. Several Trump supporters and donors started a campaign against Suprun accusing him of plagiarism at a North Texas school, later found to be incorrect after the school issued a statement contradicting the news report, and not being a responder to the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. This report was based on a LinkedIn account that did not include his service in multiple volunteer capacities including Dale City Volunteer Fire Department. The department issued a statement stating Suprun was a member and there were multiple accounts of both Suprun on site during the response and Dale City responding. Suprun did state he had voted for Senator Ted Cruz in the Texas primary in an attempt to stop Donald Trump. Suprun was also closely tied as a Rubio supporter having attended multiple Rubio events in Texas and also being seen in New Hampshire where his son asked Senator Rubio about how to address the national debt. Citation Needed  Political career  He was a delegate to multiple state Republican conventions in both Texas and Virginia. He ran unsuccessfully for the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District Board of Directors after serving as a Special Assistant to both Republican Governors George Allen and Jim Gilmore. Democrats attempted to recruit him to run for Congress in North Texas against Pete Sessions and later Van Taylor, but he ultimately declined to file seeing party activists unwilling to support an independent centrist styled politician. He did file as a Precinct Chair for the Dallas Democratic Party, running unopposed in the 2020 election. Suprun ran in the special election for the 27th Congressional District. The race took place on June 30, 2018. He received 51 votes out of over 36,000 cast.  Professional  Suprun is a certified flight paramedic and former firefighter. He continues to both be a first responder and teach fire and EMS courses. Though it was alleged there was no evidence Suprun responded to the Pentagon attack after his Electoral College decision, there are multiple sources supporting his presence as a responder. Additionally, he responded to Washington area anthrax \\"white powder\\" calls and helped put together school shooting response plans during the Washington area sniper fears. He was an Adjunct Instructor in Emergency Medicine at The George Washington University where he taught EMT, EMT ‚Äì Intermediate, and EMT ‚Äì Paramedic courses. It was here that he was part of a group who helped develop the EMS system for Oman. He later served on the Emergency Medical Services for Children National Resource Center Advisory Council and became its Chairman.  Community  Suprun has been active in the community since he was a teenager. While still attending high school he was appointed to the Fairfax Area Commission on Aging. He also served on the Fairfax County (VA) Environmental Quality Advisory, Fairfax County (VA) Human Services Council, Prince William County (VA) Library Board of Trustees, Rappahannock Area (VA) Community Services Board, and Virginia Volunteer Firefighters‚Äô and Rescue Squad Workers Service Award Program Board of Trustees.

Route and its construction  The Sumner Heights and Hazelwood Valley Railroad and Vicinity. It was situated in the town of Hyde Park, from Boston, on the line of the Boston and Providence Railroad. It was projected and built by George E. Mansfield as an experiment, and completed August 1875. It claimed to have been the narrowest gauge railroad in the world with a gauge of only between the rails.J.W. und J.S. Moulton: New Series, American Views: Sumner Heights and Hazelwood Valley Railroad and Vicinity. The line started from the summit of a small hill just back of the Hazelwood station, on the Providence Railroad, and after winding round the hill by sharp curves, comes down through Mr. Mansfield's back yard, and shot by an apparently very dangerous curve obliquely across a street, closely shaving a street corner, where it ran over a small bridge, and then across another street to the side near the railroad, and thence for a short distance parallel with the latter.Howard Fleming: Narrow gauge railways in America. A sketch of their rise, progress and success: valuable statistics as to grades, curves, weight of rail, locomotives, cars, etc. Page 38. Its length was nearly . It had one long bridge, two level road crossings,one reverse curve as well as a switch, turnout and branch. The longest straight line on the Road was . The maximum grade was 612 feet to the mile (116 ‚Ä∞). The average grade was 280 feet to the mile (53 ‚Ä∞). The sharpest curves had radii of . The curve on the bridge had a radius of radius, with grade of 317 feet to the mile (60 ‚Ä∞). The ties or sleepers were composed of narrow strips of thick board about long, upon which were nailed (with small finish nails) rails made of soft wood, about square and apart. On these were nailed narrow strips of thin hoop iron, to complete the whole affair.  Rolling stock and its operation  One of the cars used on this road was a platform, about wide and long, and the diameter of the wheels was . The weight of the cars was , carrying more than six times their own weight, with speed of , the fastest time made was 45 seconds, including starting and stopping. It would seem, at first sight, that the whole affair was a mere boy‚Äôs plaything, and a dangerous one at that; but a test of its capacity undeceived the proprietor of such hasty judgment. It would appear, to begin with, that the wheels of the car, with their small flanges, would be sure to jump the track at every curve, but by a peculiarity in the way of connecting them with the car (an invention of Mr. Mansfield) they follow the track in every wind and curve as surely as if they were much larger in diameter and had a corresponding depth of flange. Four heavy men could ride in the car, which descended by gravitation, and was under complete brake control. Those who have ridden upon it were surprised at the absence of oscillation.  Aftermath  George Mansfield subsequently promoted the two foot gauge. He persuaded the citizens of Billerica in eastern Massachusetts of the economies of a two-foot line, and became general manager of the Billerica and Bedford Railroad when it was chartered in 1876 and built beginning in May 1877. George Mansfield was obsessed with narrow gauge and reducing what he called \\"oscillation,\\" a phenomenon which is colloquially called harmonic rock or rock and roll. He did this by placing rail joints parallel to one another. A few years later Mansfield lifted the rails and moved them and the rolling stock to Maine, where it became the Sandy River Railroad and later merged into the Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad. Mansfield's influence caused the construction of nearly a dozen 2-foot gauge railroads in the state of Maine.

It is the fourth-highest point in the Thiassi Range. Sessel is situated northwest of Pemberton, and northwest of Mount Sampson, which is its nearest higher peak. An unnamed icefield rests on the northern side of the peak, and the Boomerang Glacier lies at the base of the south slopes. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Lillooet and Hurley Rivers. The mountain's descriptive name was submitted by mountaineer Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada for its similar shape to a sessel, the German word for \\"armchair\\". The name was officially adopted January 23, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1974 by John Clarke. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Sessel Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Sessel.

However the actress later left the project after she had creative differences with the film's producer, Sudhakar Raju. The film began production in October 1996 and took over a year to complete. Hindi actress Tabu and model Nivedita Jain were cast in key roles, with the latter subsequently making her debut in Tamil films. The film was named after a popular song from Arjun's previous film, Jai Hind (1994), which had a similar patriotic theme. The film was shot extensively in foreign locations, with scenes filmed in locations in Hong Kong and Switzerland, which the team had to settle for after their visas for Canada were rejected. Further scenes were also shot in Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh, with art director Thotta Tharani constructing sets for the film. Production was delayed as a result of the FEFSI strike of 1997. Soundtrack The soundtrack features 6 songs composed by Vidyasagar. Release The film was initially scheduled to release in November 1997 coinciding with the Diwali season, but was subsequently put on hold for several months. The film was later released in August 1998, with the title card of the film including a tribute to the film's lead actress Nivedita Jain, who died before the film's release.

Professional career Besputin turned professional in 2015 and compiled a record of 13‚Äì0 before getting an opportunity to fight for a world title against fellow Russian boxer Radzhab Butaev. In the fight Besputin would go on to win via unanimous decision to capture the WBA (Regular) and EBP welterweight titles. In January 2020 it was reported that Besputin had failed a post-fight drug test for the bout with Butaev, testing positive for the performance enhancing drug Ligandrol. Upon hearing the news, Butaev said, \\"Ahead of the fight my team insisted on VADA testing while he and his team were denying it all along, and even after I agreed to pay for both sides, including his costs, he was very reluctant. After finally enrolling he attempted to ignore the requests from VADA for two weeks for his whereabouts to be tested.\\" Besputin elected to have a secondary 'B sample' tested, which also came back positive for the same substance in June.

Career Born Mary Thalassa Alford Cruso in Kensington, London in 1909 to Henry and Mildred Cruso, she was raised mostly in Surry. Her parents were devoted hobby gardeners and passed on a keen interest in gardening and working outdoors to their daughter. She decided to study archaeology after finishing secondary school. Cruso attended the London School of Economics and finished a qualification in anthropology in 1931. Cruso then began working at the Museum of London where she became Assistant to Director Mortimer Wheeler in the costume collection. She gave lectures in 1933 and 1934 on the evolution of costumes. She led the excavation of an Iron Age hill fort on Bredon Hill, Worcestershire. In the summer of 1934 she was sent to Ireland to attend a dig there where Cruso met American archaeologist Hugh O'Neill Hencken. They married in 1935 and Cruso assisted him on the last year of the Harvard Irish Mission before returning to the United States with him. They lived in Boston where they had three daughters. During a visit to the UK, Cruso came up with the idea of a gardening show, Making Things Grow, which ran on PBS from 1966 - 1969. Cruso also made regular appearances on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, and followed that with a household show called Making Things Work. Cruso also wrote multiple books, as well as a column for the Boston Globe for 22 years. She also wrote for Country Journal, McCall's and Horticulture.

It has smooth white to greyish bark, glossy green, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between five and eleven, white flowers and hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus phoenix is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white to light grey bark that is shed in thin strips and plates. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull, light green to bluish leaves that are slightly paler on the lower side, egg-shaped to more or less round, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of shiny green on both sides, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between five and eleven on a thin, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are club-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum long and wide. Flowering occurs from late spring to early summer the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical capsule about long and wide with the valves level with the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus phoenix was first formally described in 2013 by Kevin Rule and Susan G. Forrester in the journal Muelleria from material collected near Brumby Point. The specific epithet (phoenix) \\"commemorates the serendipitous discovery of a small amount of the seed of this rare new plant following the apparently all-consuming fire of 2013.\\" Like the fabled Phoenix of Greek mythology, this species arose from the flames.

Historically, beavers have been trapped and hunted for their meat, fur and castoreum, to the point of near extinction.  Disappearance from Europe  The Eurasian beaver was hunted and trapped to the point of near extinction. Fossil evidence shows that the Eurasian beaver lived from Western Europe to the Chinese-Mongolian border. By the 12th century, only about 1,200 Eurasian beavers were left in this area, and they were extirpated from seven European countries.South, Andy, et al. ‚ÄúSimulating the Proposed Reintroduction of the European Beaver ( Castor Fiber ) to Scotland.‚Äù Biological Conservation, vol. 93, no. 1, 2000, pp. 103‚Äì116., doi:10.1016/s0006-3207(99)00072-5.

These successes resulted in Eurasian beavers listed as being of least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list due to its fast recovery in Europe. Initial reintroduction populations show a time lag between the rate of population growth and the resource growth rates. This is seen in an initial population growth followed by decrease in populations to settle into the amount of resources available to the beaver populations.Hartman, Goran. ‚ÄúLong-Term Population Development of a Reintroduced Beaver (Castor Fiber) Population in Sweden.‚Äù Conservation Biology, vol. 8, no. 3, 1994, pp. 713‚Äì717., doi:10.1046/j.1523-1739.1994.08030713.x.  Incomplete list of successful reintroductions  1922-1939 - Sweden: About 80 beavers were reintroduced to 19 different sites over a 20-year span with an estimated 130,000 individuals present in 2014 1966-1982 - Bavaria: From extinction, reintroduction has increased to pupation to an estimated 6,000 individuals.

They have since then spread to the waters around the Danube inside the city as well. Today (2020), an estimated 230 beavers live in the Vienna region outside the national park proper. 1988 - Romania: 21 beavers were successfully reintroduced in 1998 along the Olt River, spreading to other rivers in Covasna county 1999 - Denmark and Northern Zealand: 18 beavers were released at Klosterheden in West Jutland. Since then, other beavers have been released at Arres√∏ in North Zealand. 2003 - Spain: 2003, beavers were reintroduced to the Ebro in Spain, with plans for further reintroductions to The Guadalquivir, Guadiana, and Tajo (Tagus) river systems 2009-2014 - Scotland: 11 beavers were released in 2009 and four beavers were released in 2014 in the Knapdale forest and 56 beavers were found at the River Tay, becoming its own study https://www.nature.scot/sites/default/files/2017-11/Tayside%20Beaver%20Study%20Group%20-%20%20Final%20Report%202015.pdf 2019 - East Anglia: A pair of beavers was reintroduced to North Essex as part of a pioneering natural flood management scheme for East Anglia  Beaver effects on habitat   Effect on hydrology  Beavers have been reported to increase water levels, groundwater and surface water storage. Deep canals are created to connect ponds and allow for easy transportation of materials, and can be a significant way of storing groundwater in dry climates.‚ÄúLeave It to Beavers.‚Äù PBS, Public Broadcasting Service, 29 July 2019, www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/leave-it-to-beavers-leave-it-to-beavers/8836/. Beavers dam streams less than 10m wide to create ‚Äúbeaver ponds,‚Äù which increase open- water and wetland habitat allowing for more aquatic animal species to thrive, nesting space for birds and bats, yet do not influence major rivers or waterways.Runyon, Luke. ‚ÄúThe Bountiful Benefits Of Bringing Back The Beavers.‚Äù NPR, NPR, 24 June 2018, www.npr.org/2018/06/24/620402681/the-bountiful- benefits-of-bringing-back-the-beavers. Sediment storage and energy-dissipation impacts from dams is used as pollutant traps, improving water quality and control flooding.Kemp, Paul S, et al. ‚ÄúQualitative and Quantitative Effects of Reintroduced Beavers on Stream Fish.‚Äù Fish and Fisheries, vol. 13, no. 2, 2011, pp. 158‚Äì181., doi:10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00421.x. Additionally, deep ponds and canals allow for water storage in areas susceptible to drought. On the other hand, beaver dams help control flooding and sediment degradation from storms, providing environmental support structures that could be costly. Furthermore, increased surface water increases evaporation, contributing to increased fog.Rosell, Frank, et al. ‚ÄúEcological Impact of Beavers Castor Fiber and Castor Canadensis and Their Ability to Modify Ecosystems.‚Äù Mammal Review, vol. 35, no. 3-4, 2005, pp. 248‚Äì276., doi:10.1111/j.1365-2907.2005.00067.x. Increased surface water, and decreased shade-producing vegetation indicate beavers influence on local temperature regimes, both in the water and air. Some found that damming of feeder streams to main rivers decreased the amount of cold water, and data showed an overall increase in water temperatures after dam creation.  Effect on vegetation  Changes in plant diversity, height, and abundance was measured, and the results are overall positive. As herbivores, beavers used shrubs and trees with trunk diameters of 3‚Äì8 cm to feed on the bark, twigs and leaves. Selective grazing over a 9-year period led to a threefold increase in plant richness in one area studied, a surprise to many researchers.Law, Alan, et al. ‚ÄúMedium vs. Short-Term Effects of Herbivory by Eurasian Beaver on Aquatic Vegetation.‚Äù Aquatic Botany, vol. 116, 2014, pp. 27‚Äì34., doi:10.1016/j.aquabot.2014.01.004. Significant reduction in plant height in both emergent and mat habitats was a drawback, however, studies show that beavers and Aspen (a species of concern for overgrazing) can thrive in the same landscape.‚ÄúParrott, L & MacKenzie, N. (eds.) 2009. Aspen in Scotland: biodiversity and management. Highland Aspen Group. Furthermore, the flooding of areas may cause over saturation to the point that some plants or trees die, however this increases coarse woody debris (CWD) found in the areas, attracting wood insects and other species. Certain trees were also reported to have migrated to areas that were drier and a more suitable habitat, thus showing that beavers can help diversify plant species in varying areas. Additionally, ponds and increased waterways have increased growth of both aquatic and non-aquatic plants.  Effect on animal species  It was found that the presence of beavers increased numbers in aquatic invertebrates, insects, amphibians, birds and bats. Dams create places for insects to lay eggs, such as dragonflies. Coarse woody debris (CWD) from beaver food caches, dams, lodges, and drowned trees increases deadwood insects and provide nesting holes for waterfowl. Observations of otters recolonizing areas that have become more suitable for them following beaver colonization. Increase in woodland animals like elk and moose have also been observed, including interactions between moose and winter beaver food caches. Furthermore, beavers can affect the development and physiology of amphibians, it has been reported that larvae of wood frog Rana sylvatica resounded rapidly to changes in their environment induced by beavers. The richness and abundance of reptiles in old beaver ponds were significantly higher compared with new beaver ponds and un- impounded streams. Ponds create nursing ground for fish, increased fish habitat and habitat complexity, however there is concern of beaver's impact on migratory fish patterns. Sediment storage increases clear water, increases some fish species, while energy dissipation allows some fish species to thrive better and favors lentic (still-water) species. Deeper beaver ponds provide important overwintering habitat, reduce ice cover, and stabilizes temperature regimes. On the other hand, there have been numerous studies of beaver dams along rivers and their effect on migrating fish, such as Atlantic salmon species. While abandoned beaver sites allow salmon to swim upstream when water breaks through the dams, the reduced water energy can provide an easy way for salmon to swim upstream to old beaver ponds. Total blockage of small streams is reported to deter some salmon species from using beaver streams; however, there are reports of migration to bigger streams that are not influenced by beavers. Additionally, increased temperature regimes in ponds and streams can have adverse effects on salmon populations that are living in areas already at the top of their temperature regime, causing negative affects on the species habitat.  Beavers as flagship species  When first consideration reintroducing beavers into certain ecosystems, successful trials have started by raising community awareness and support. Some ways that support and awareness was created was through different community outreach and educational resources. It is reported that those that did not have community support, did not have successful beaver reintroduction.Gaywood, M. 2001. A trial re- introduction of the European beaver Castor fiber to Scotland. Czech A &Schwab;, G (eds): The European Beaver in a new millennium. As a flagship species, beavers raise awareness and resources for wide-scale riparian and woodland restoration programs by stimulating conservation awareness. Holding public forums and community events to show the community how beavers will help with their environment is important and can educate people about other environmental concerns, such as decreased Aspen forests or other riparian forest issues. Furthermore, they increase ecotourism. Many areas around Europe that have reintroduced beavers have reported increased tourism, whether it is tours specific to seeing beavers, or the animals that the beavers have attracted such as birds or bats.  Criticism  Some worries that people have about the reintroduction of beavers is their impact on agricultural areas, in which it was reported that some beaver dams did affect flooding of farm lands, decreasing crop yields. In order to fix this, beaver experts suggest relocating beaver dams, using water sounds to trick beavers into building the dam at different places, or using pipes in dams to help control water levels. These finding were also suggested for instances when beavers created dams blocking man-made structures such as culverts. In one instance, poles were placed 10 feet in front of a culvert, changing the place of the water flow sound, in which the beavers build the dam at the poles, allowing for runoff to go through the culvert. Furthermore, some farmers have reported beavers burrowing in their fields, leading to damage to machinery such as tractor and damage to crops.≈ªurowski, Wirgiliusz. ‚ÄúBuilding Activity of Beavers.‚Äù Acta Theriologica, vol. 37, 1992, pp. 403‚Äì411., doi:10.4098/at.arch.92-41. Governments have addressed this issue by voluntarily compensating the farmers for these damages. Additionally, if the beavers are proving to be pests, there are management practices in place to relocate the beaver population to areas where they would be less disruptive. There are poorly founded concerns by some anglers, particularly in the United Kingdom, that beavers will compete with them for fish, as author C.S. Lewis depicted within The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-cs-lewis-gave-beavers-a- bad-press-x3506s22t These concerns have no standing as beaver eat vegetation and wood, and do not consume fish.

It is the third-highest point in the Thiassi Range. Mount Thiassi is situated northwest of Pemberton, and south-southwest of Mount Vayu, which is its nearest higher peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from unnamed glaciers on its slopes drain into tributaries of the Lillooet, Bridge, and Hurley Rivers. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1965 by Dick Culbert and Alice Purdey. The mountain's name was submitted by this first ascent party to commemorate Thiassi, the god of storms according to Norse mythology. The name was officially adopted June 22, 1967, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Thiassi is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Thiassi.

A native of Fenghua, Zhejiang, Hu Hua was born in December 1921. He began working alongside the Communist Party of China to oppose Japanese forces in 1937, shortly after the Second Sino-Japanese War had started. Hu was assigned to the Eighth Route Army in 1938, and was active in Wuhan and Changsha. Hu formally joined the Communist Party of China in February 1939, by which time he had relocated to northern Shanxi. Hu began his teaching and research career in April 1940, at the North China United University. Throughout the 1940s, Hu taught at several educational institutions in North China. In 1948, the Central Committee convened a group of academics led by Hu, and reporting to Wu Yuzhang. The group was charged with gathering materials to teach the history of the Communist Party of China. After 1949, Hu joined the faculty of the People's University of China. While teaching there, Hu wrote The History of China's New Democratic Revolution in 1950, and Lectures on the History of the Chinese Revolution in 1959. The two books were regarded as standard texts for students of CPC history up to the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution itself, Hu worked for two years in a rural labor camp. Upon regaining favor, Hu became an adviser to the Museum of the Chinese Revolution with the help of Zhou Enlai. With the fall of the Gang of Four, Hu returned to lecturing and was deputy director of the CPC Central Committee's History Materials Research Institute. In this position, Hu co-drafted the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of our Party since the Founding of the People's Republic of China.

Research  In 1995 Boury-Esnault and Jean Vacelet discovered the first species of carnivorous sponges, of the Chondrocladia genus, during an exploration of a shallow cave in the Mediterranean. Caves can recapitulate the environment of the deep sea-bed due to the darkness and lack of nutrient, permitting the study of deep-sea-like regions in shallow areas of water. Carnivorous sponges, lacking the normal filter feeding apparatus, had been previously discovered during deep-sea trawls and presumed to be damaged since they did not have a known feeding mechanism. The discovery of members of the family in shallow water meant that they could be experimentally tested, which is when Boury-Esnault and Vacelet observed feeding on small crustaceans. Later they also reported on a member of the genus which used both carnivory and methanotrophy to survive in deep-sea expeditions of the Barbados trench. Boury-Esnault and Vacelet also found hexactinellid (glass) sponges, another deep-sea species, in these shallow cave waters, permitting detailed study for the first time. She led a collaboration with Oceana and the University of Victoria which found new glass sponges in the Mediterranean Sea, and in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1997 Boury-Esnault and Klaus Rutzler published a 'Thesaurus of Sponge Morphology' with the Smithsonian Institution. In 2012 Boury-Esnault was involved in a study capturing the number and diversity of sponges in seas all around the world.

Andrews; August 6, 1845 ‚Äì January 11, 1921) was an American poet, author, and musical composer. When only twelve years old, she began to write in verse. She devoted much time to literature, art and music, in each of which she excelled. Early life and education Emma Caroline Huntington was born in Hallowell, Maine, August 6, 1845. She was the daughter of Samuel W. Huntington, whose ancestors came from Norwich, England, to Massachusetts in 1633. The Huntington family in the United States, to which her father belonged, was first represented in New England by the widow Margaret Huntington, who came from England with her children (her husband having died on the voyage) in 1633, as certified by the church records of Roxbury, Massachusetts. This family counted among its members many distinguished men: one was a signer of the Declaration of Independence; another, one of General George Washington's staff; and in later generations, some of them were well known as artists, writers, lawyers, and divines. Her mother was Sally Mayo. Nason's maternal grandfather was a direct descendant of Rev. John Mayo, the Puritan divine, who was one of the founders of the town of Barnstable, Cape Cod, and the first pastor of the Second Church in Boston. Nason was also descended in several lines from Mayflower Pilgrims and other ancestors who bore their part in early colonial history. Nason's early days were passed in Hallowed Academy, where she distinguished herself as a student, excelling in mathematics and the languages. In 1865, she was graduated from the collegiate course of the Maine Wesleyan Seminary (now Kents Hill School), in Kents Hill, Maine, that institution being then the only one in New England which offered a regular college course for women. Career For the first two years following graduation, she taught French and mathematics. In 1870, she married Charles H. Nason, a businessman of Augusta, Maine, and they resided in that city. She began at an early age to write verses. For several years she wrote under the pen name of \\"John G. Andrews\\". Her first published writings appeared in the Portland Transcript, and consisted of short stories, translations from the German, and verses. In 1875, she gave the commencement poem before the literary societies of her Alma Mater, and on March 9, 1880, she read an original poem at the dedication of the building, which was the gift of the citizens of Hallowell to its old and honored institution, the Hallowell Social Library. The poem, with the oration delivered at the same time, was published in a souvenir volume. Her first poem published under her own name was \\"The Tower,\\" which appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, May, 1874, and won ready recognition. Since then, she was a frequent contributor to The Independent, The Churchman, and The Commonwealth. Her writing focused chiefly for some years with songs of child life, which appeared at intervals in such magazines as St. Nicholas, Wide Awake, and Our Little Ones. In 1888, these were collected in a volume called White Sails. These verses were familiar in school-rooms throughout the country. One in particular, \\"The Bravest Boy in Town,\\" tells an incident of the American Civil War, and was a favorite in the U.S. \\"The Mission Tea Party\\" gives a pathetic incident in the siege of Lucknow. \\"The Bishop's Visit,\\" \\"A Little Girl Lost,\\" \\"Unter den Linden,\\" \\"Saint Olga's Bell,\\" and the \\"Battle Song\\" were widely copied and used as recitations. Before the publication of her volume, White Sails, she was chosen one of ten poets whose ballads appeared in a volume entitled, Children's Ballads from History and Folk Lore. Nason wrote a series of articles on \\"Ancient Art for Young People.\\" She also wrote many household articles, as well as short stories and translations from the German. Her verses entitled \\"Body and Soul,\\" which appeared in The Century Magazine for July, 1892, were ranked among the best poems published in the United States at that time. The verses \\"Body and Soul\\" and \\"Two Faces\\" were pronounced \\"two of the most remarkable poems published in this country in recent years.\\" The former was selected by Mr. Warner for his World's Best Literature and \\"A Child's Question\\" was chosen by Mr. Stedman for his American Anthology. Nason did much work for the literary clubs of Maine, having prepared papers on \\"The Folk-lore of Russia,\\" \\"The Abenaki Indians,\\" \\"The Early Balladists and Troubadours of France,\\" and a course of lectures on the \\"Genius and Love-life of the German Poets.\\" She was an enthusiastic student of German literature, and published a number of magazine articles on the German poets. At Augusta's centennial celebration in 1897 she delivered a poem entitled \\"Ancient Koussinoc,\\" into which was woven much of the historical and legendary lore of the valley of the Kennebec. Nason was a musical composer, and was active in the musical circles of Augusta. She was also interested in drawing and painting. Her studies in oil had much merit, and she sketched effectively in charcoal from nature. Personal life Nason was a member of the Society of the Mayflower Descendants and of the Order of the Descendants of Colonial Governors. She served as Regent of the Koussinoc Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Augusta and Vice-Regent of the Maine State Council, D. A. R. The Nason's had one son, Arthur Huntington Nason. She died January 11, 1921, in Augusta, and was buried at Hallowell Village Cemetery in Hallowell, Maine.

It is a set of modest bungalows and cottages built primarily during the 1920s and 1930s by local builders, using common building materials and designs which happen to achieve a kind of unity. The street was developed by J. D. Caples, Sr. (1860-1934) in 1922 along a creek and a natural ravine. Low areas were filled by dirt excavated in the construction of the NRHP-listed City National Bank, and sewers and water pipes were installed by manual labor. Caples paved the street and planted trees. Caples himself built five or six of the homes; his son-in-law B.D. Sumner built three; only one is known to be designed by an architect, being the one at #33 designed by Birmingham architect George P. Turner. It includes one or more Craftsman bungalows, as well as mission/Spanish revival and English Cottage styles.

Life   Personal life  In 2014 Singh came across the term 'asexual' and immediately identified with it, and more specifically as gray asexual.  Career  Singh is a medical doctor by qualification and has worked as a public health professional in the fields of maternal, child, and reproductive health in India. In 2014 Singh found that there was no present communities online for Indians who identify as asexual. As a result of this she founded the self/non funded group 'Indian Aces' on Facebook, gaining a community of 3000+ members as time passed. In 2017 Singh launched the friend-finding service 'Platonicity', a google form initially ran through Facebook like Indian Aces, with a goal to one day become a mobile app. The purpose was to have a platform that matches people looking for a non- sexual relationship. It was inspired by frequent messages online by those who needed help with finding relationships, and others whose family were forcing them to get married. It surveyed a large range of factors from an individuals gradient of sexuality to their political stances. Due to the rapid increase of interest towards the form, with over 300 entries from multiple countries in two days, it was shut down to create a method that can accommodate more people. Since then she has hosted 'offline meetups' under the same name of Platonicity across Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai, helping with speed dating and building communities. These communities help those who identify as asexual know that they are not alone. When it comes to payment, she runs it under a model where people pay only per their capabilities to pay. In the same year, Singh's research study on asexuality was selected and presented at the World Association of Sexual Health Congress held in Prague. The findings of this study were then published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. As of 2019, Singh is continuing to run sexuality workshops, speed dating events, as well as group counseling sessions, raising awareness for and helping asexual communities. After extensive research she has developed the \\"Comprehensive sexuality model‚Äù. This model segregates sexuality into eight central components that forms ones sexual identity. Another of her future goals is to bring these workshops into medical colleges, to bring her subjects to the eyes of more doctors.

The economy relies mostly on the service sector (59.8% in 2017), with smaller percentages in industry (30.6% in 2017) and agriculture (9.6% in 2017). The Philippines has remained generally unsusceptible to global economic shocks. This is because of less exposure to problematic international securities, lower export dependence, stable domestic consumption, large remittances from overseas Filipinos, and a quickly growing service industry. Economic growth has been positive and stable, averaging 6.3% between 2010 and 2018 and 4.5% between 2000 and 2009. Additionally, the country is expected to become an upper-middle country in the near future, as its per capita income of $3,660 USD is just below the minimum bound of $3,896 USD.  History of the World Bank in the Philippines   Overview  After becoming one of the members of the IBRD in 1945, the Philippines became a member of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960. Two years later, the International Finance Committee (IFC) established the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines to help spur extensive private investment. By 1994, the Philippines became a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). From 2015 to 2018, the Philippines and the World Bank engaged in the Country Partnership Strategy to create better jobs, increase shared prosperity, and eradicate extreme poverty.  Notable Projects  Roughly half of World Bank projects in the Philippines have centered around rural infrastructure, private sector infrastructure, climate change, and civic engagement. The Binga Power Project in 1957 marked the first World Bank Project in the Philippines. The project helped satisfy demand for electricity on the island of Luzon by providing four 25 MW generators, a rock filled dam that stores a reservoir, a 90 meter wide spillway that handles flood water, an underground powerhouse with surge chambers, and a pressure tunnel to deal with water flow. In 1966, the World Bank/IBRD committed $25 million for the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines Project 2, which provided loans to stimulate productive private enterprises. The Magat River Multipurpose Project in 1978 was the most expensive project of the 1970s at $150 million and provided a dam, tunnels, and reservoir resettlement. After continued development throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, the Philippines suffered a setback in 2013 when Typhoon Haiyan struck. The World Bank stepped in and contributed $500 million for recovery efforts. In line with its history of attempting to reduce poverty, the Philippines most recently accepting a $300 million loan for the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, a conditional cash transfer program.  Effects and Controversy  In the 21st century, World Bank intervention in the Philippines has improved social and living conditions. The Philippine Rural Development Project of 2015 raised rural incomes, increased agricultural productivity, and improved market access in rural areas. The effects go beyond rural infrastructure. From an educational perspective, the Learning, Equity, and Accountability Program Support (LEAPS) benefitted 4.4 million students and recorded improvements in the reading and math scores of students in Grades 2 and 3. World Bank intervention in the Philippines has also been met with controversy. The World Bank has been criticized by the Committee for the Abolition of Illegitimate Debt for its role in funding the regime of Ferdinand Marcos. Structural adjustment loans given to the Philippines mostly ended up in the hands of the Marcos administration instead of being used to fund export-driven industrialization, with the corruption fueling a banking crisis that discouraged foreign private investors from investing in the Philippines.  Future  Economic growth in 2020 and 2021 is forecasted to shrink to 6.1% and 6.2% (from 6.5% in both years), respectively, due to a slowdown in public investment and the current China‚ÄìUnited States trade war. Additionally, the Philippines and the World Bank have set goals for the Philippines by 2040. By that time, the Philippines wants to be free from poverty and sustain a prosperous middle class. In order to do so, the World Bank estimates that income per capita must triple by way of having its economy grow at an average annual rate of 6.5%. In order to reach and maintain this level of growth, the World Bank recommends that the Philippines improves market competition via reforms in regulation, simplifies regulations for trade, and reduces labor market costs and barriers.

Her research focuses primarily on paleoecology and paleoclimatology. She completed a BS degree in Geology at Syracuse University, and then went on to do an MS at the University of Florida-Gainesville, and a Ph.D. at Harvard University under the guidance of Stephen J. Gould. She worked at the University of Michigan 1997 - 2000, before being hired as a visiting assistant professor at Syracuse University later in 2000. She was promoted to full professor in 2012. She was involved in two seminal papers on large-scale diversity patterns in the Phanerozoic, in which the authors showed that it was very important to correct for the \\"completeness\\" of the fossil record, and showed that the increase in taxonomic diversity across the past 540 million years is not as dramatic as had been suggested by Jack Sepkoski and others. She has also published several important studies that involve inferring past changes in global climate, especially in the Cenozoic. Much of Ivany's research revolves around the study of fossil molluscs, including their taxonomy and analyses of stable isotope data. In one recent study, she and her co-authors demonstrated a positive relationship between marine mollusc longevity and latitude. As of November 2019, Ivany's publications had been cited more than 3600 times in the scientific literature. A third major focus of her research involved quantifying a pattern of long intervals of assemblage similarity through time, punctuated by an abrupt shift in assemblage composition. This was referred to as \\"coordinated stasis.\\" Coordinated stasis was sometimes thought of as a community-level analogue of Gould & Eldridge's Punctuated Equilibria. Although there were apparently substantial environmental changes during a 5.5Ma interval of \\"stasis\\" during the Devonian, which is consistent with some biotically driven community stability, Ivany and others caution against conceptually framing coordinated stasis as punctuated equilibra writ large. In April 2019, Ivany was presented with an Excellence in Graduate Education Faculty Recognition Award in celebration of her outstanding mentorship of graduate students.

In Day's 2008 eulogy, her daughter Dr. Brook Hersey writes, \\"I think her Midwestern roots are an important element of who she was. She was direct, and down to earth, and always maintained an understated skepticism towards material excess, cultural elitism, towards any kind of snobbery, really.\\" Barbara was president of her high school's math club and had a natural talent for complex word games. After graduating college, Barbara worked and live in New Jersey, and she met cartoonist Charles Addams in late 1942 traveling on the train from Westfield. After she took time off work to attend his mother's funeral, Charles got serious about Barbara and married her four months later; Barbara was 23, Charles was 30. Contrary to popular belief, Barbara was not the inspiration for the Morticia Addams character in Addams' comic strip. In October of 2016, H. Kevin Miserocchi, executive director of the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation contacted the Vanderbilt Cup Races website (after a post on Charles Addams' love of racing and vintage cars) to set the record straight. \\"Charlie created the character who became known as Morticia in 1933, many years before he married Barbara or either of his two other wives, all of whom had that look.\\" In a now famous LIFE Magazine spread, Charles poses around town with Barbara-- the most prolific photo being that of Charles supposedly sketching her for another Morticia comic. This photo was staged. After 8 years of marriage, Barbara and Charles divorced after alleged womanizing and Charles' dislike of small children, though in the years following, Addams spoke fondly of her. Wanting to distance herself from the Morticia comparisons, Barbara cut her hair into a page-boy style. In 1958, Barbara married writer and journalist John Richard Hersey,John Hersey, Author of 'Hiroshima,' Is Dead at 78 one of the first practitioners of New Journalism and author of Hiroshima. She remained with Hersey until his death in 1993, and together they had one daughter, Brook Hersey. Barbara passed away at her Massachusetts home on August 20th, 2007; she was 88 years old. She is survived by her daughter, her three step children, and her granddaughter.

Maudling said in a December 1971 press conference that the British government could not eliminate the Provisional Irish Republican Army's terrorist attacks but only reduce them to an \\"acceptable level\\". Critics maintained that any violence was unacceptable. Nevertheless, the concept influenced the British government's strategy in dealing with Northern Irish terrorism, and continues to be used in discussions of ongoing political violence in Northern Ireland. __NOTOC__ Origin In a 15 December 1971 news conference, British Home Secretary Reginald Maudling commented on the escalation of violence as the Northern Ireland conflict was beginning. Maudling said, \\"I don't think one can speak of defeating the IRA [Provisional Irish Republican Army], of eliminating them completely, but it is the design of the security forces to reduce their level of violence to something like an acceptable level.\\" It was the first time that the British government acknowledged that it did not have the power to eliminate Irish republican terrorism. According to historian Charles Townshend, this was \\"wholly unprecedented in public rhetoric\\". At the time, Maudling's remark was widely regarded as a gaffe. His remarks were criticized in the Northern Ireland Parliament, with Ian Paisley saying that no level of violence was acceptable. Maudling was subsequently boycotted by Northern Irish opposition parties. Nevertheless, the idea of \\"acceptable level of violence\\" was \\"half accepted, half rejected\\", according to Townshend, who notes: \\"If terrorism cannot be eliminated, it must perforce at some level be tolerated‚Äîand it can be.\\" The mindset influenced the British government's strategy for dealing with Northern Irish terrorism: to reduce the violence to the point that most people were not impacted as they went about their daily lives. According to Brewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase & Fable, the idea of an acceptable level of violence amounted to \\"implicit toleration of death and destruction\\", even of terrorist attacks in Great Britain. Later uses Unionist politicians subsequently developed their own interpretation, which was that there was an acceptable level of Ulster loyalist terrorism to counter the IRA. American journalist P. J. O'Rourke suggests that in Northern Ireland, \\"acceptable level of violence\\" is similar to the air-quality index in American cities. He describes a week of \\"acceptable\\" violence in 1988, which included shootings, bombs, Molotov cocktails, and multiple paramilitary punishment attacks. According to Colin Knox, defining what is an \\"acceptable level of violence\\" in post-ceasefire Northern Ireland, and what constitutes a violation of the ceasefire, \\"has caused considerable political controversy\\". Knox writes that ultimately the governments decides what is an acceptable level of violence by choosing to ignore the ongoing paramilitary punishment attacks. Knox disagrees, writing that \\"[m]utilations, torture, beatings and exiling\\" must not be considered acceptable. According to a 2009 The Spectator article, although \\"no one is quite so indelicate as to employ the infamous phrase\\", the spirit of Maudling's remarks continues to be reflected in British policy. A 2018 article in The Irish Times suggested that the 158 people killed since the Good Friday Agreement were considered acceptable losses‚Äîalthough \\"no one wishes to use the term 'acceptable level of violence'\\"‚Äîbecause they come from working-class neighbourhoods. Also in 2018, an editorial in the Belfast Telegraph argued that the violence was no longer at an acceptable level due to expectations having been recalibrated since the agreement. In a 2010 speech at Oxford, Hugh Orde, recently chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, discussed the threat of the dissident Irish republican campaign. Orde said that \\"To borrow a phrase from the past, we may be at an 'acceptable level of violence'‚Äîalbeit at a far lower level than when the phrase was first coined\\" because dissident republicans were unlikely to respond to negotiation. Democratic Unionist Party MLA Jimmy Spratt called Orde's comments \\"outrageous\\" and an insult to those killed by dissident republicans. A Belfast Telegraph editorial described it as an unacceptable gaffe which \\"give[s] succour to terrorists\\" and argued that \\"for the vast majority of people there is no acceptable level of violence\\". American political scientist Robert Goodin suggests that the idea of an acceptable risk is key to managing public risk perceptions of terrorism, which tends to be exaggerated. He notes that a 1978 survey found that 60 per cent of Americans considered the threat of terrorism \\"very serious\\" compared to 30 per cent of British people, even though there had been no terrorist deaths that year in the United States but 88 of them in the United Kingdom. According to Goodin, the perceived threat of terrorism can be more harmful than the actual level of terrorism, provided that the individual is not directly impacted by terror attacks.

History The technique for crafting wooden toys dates back to the 19th century, when several villages along the traveling path to the religious pilgrimage site Marija Bistrica began carving wood to make trinkets and toys. Local wood such as maple, willow, beech, and lime were used to carve into various shapes using special tools to achieve precise cuts. After the men created the toys, the women would hand paint unique designs and motifs using bright colors of red, yellow, and blue.

A slightly weaker version of this inequality was originally proven and published by Helmut Pl√ºnnecke (1970). Imre Ruzsa (1989) later published a simpler proof of the current, more general, version of the inequality. The inequality forms a crucial step in the proof of Freiman's theorem. Statement The following sumset notation is standard in additive combinatorics. For subsets A and B of an abelian group and a natural number k, the following are defined: * A+B=\\\\\\\\{a+b:a\\\\in A,b\\\\in B\\\\\\\\} * A-B=\\\\\\\\{a-b:a\\\\in A,b\\\\in B\\\\\\\\} * kA=\\\\underbrace{A+A+\\\\cdots+A}_{k\\\\text{ times}} The set A + B is known as the sumset of A and B. Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality The most commonly cited version of the statement of the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality is the following. This is often used when A = B, in which case the constant K = 2A/A is known as the doubling constant of A. In this case, the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality states that sumsets formed from a set with small doubling constant must also be small. Pl√ºnnecke's inequality The version of this inequality that was originally proven by Pl√ºnnecke (1970) is slightly weaker. Proof Ruzsa triangle inequality The Ruzsa triangle inequality is an important tool which is used to generalize Pl√ºnnecke's inequality to the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality. Its statement is: Proof of Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality The following simple proof of the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality is due to Petridis (2014). Lemma: Let A and B be finite subsets of an abelian group G. If X\\\\subseteq A is a nonempty subset that minimizes the value of K'=X+B/X, then for all finite subsets C\\\\subset G, :X+B+C\\\\le K'X+C. Proof: This is demonstrated by induction on the size of C. For the base case of C=1, note that S+C is simply a translation of S for any S\\\\subseteq G, so :X+B+C=X+B=K'X=K'X+C. For the inductive step, assume the inequality holds for all C\\\\subseteq G with C\\\\le n for some positive integer n. Let C be a subset of G with C=n+1, and let C=C'\\\\sqcup\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\} for some \\\\gamma\\\\in C. (In particular, the inequality holds for C'.) Finally, let Z=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in X: x+B+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq X+B+C'\\\\\\\\}. The definition of Z implies that Z+B+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq X+B+C'. Thus, by the definition of these sets, :X+B+C=(X+B+C')\\\\cup((X+B+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\})\\\\backslash(Z+B+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\})). Hence, considering the sizes of the sets, :\\\\begin{align}X+B+C&\\\\leX+B+C'+(X+B+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\})\\\\backslash(Z+B+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\})\\\\\\\\\\\\&=X+B+C'+X+B+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}-Z+B+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\\\\\&=X+B+C'+X+B-Z+B.\\\\end{align} The definition of Z implies that Z\\\\subseteq X\\\\subseteq A, so by the definition of X, Z+B\\\\ge K'Z. Thus, applying the inductive hypothesis on C' and using the definition of X, :\\\\begin{align}X+B+C&\\\\leX+B+C'+X+B-Z+B\\\\\\\\\\\\&\\\\le K'X+C'+X+B-Z+B\\\\\\\\\\\\&\\\\le K'X+C'+K'X-Z+B\\\\\\\\\\\\&\\\\le K'X+C'+K'X-K'Z\\\\\\\\\\\\&=K'(X+C'+X-Z).\\\\end{align} To bound the right side of this inequality, let W=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in X:x+\\\\gamma\\\\in X+C'\\\\\\\\}. Suppose y\\\\in X+C' and y\\\\in X+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}, then there exists x\\\\in X such that x+\\\\gamma=y\\\\in X+C'. Thus, by definition, x\\\\in W, so y\\\\in W+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}. Hence, the sets X+C' and (X+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\})\\\\backslash(W+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}) are disjoint. The definitions of W and C' thus imply that :X+C=(X+C')\\\\sqcup((X+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\})\\\\backslash(W+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\})). Again by definition, W\\\\subseteq Z, so W\\\\leZ. Hence, :\\\\begin{align}X+C&=X+C'+(X+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\})\\\\backslash(W+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\})\\\\\\\\\\\\&=X+C'+X+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}-W+\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\\\\\&=X+C'+X-W\\\\\\\\\\\\&\\\\geX+C'+X-Z.\\\\end{align} Putting the above two inequalities together gives :X+B+C\\\\le K'(X+C'+X-Z)\\\\le K'X+C. This completes the proof of the lemma. To prove the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality, take X and K' as in the statement of the lemma. It is first necessary to show that :X+nB\\\\le K^nX. This can be proved by induction. For the base case, the definitions of K and K' imply that K'\\\\le K. Thus, the definition of X implies that X+B\\\\le KX. For inductive step, suppose this is true for n=j. Applying the lemma with C=jB and the inductive hypothesis gives :X+(j+1)B\\\\le K'X+jB\\\\le KX+jB\\\\le K^{j+1}X. This completes the induction. Finally, the Ruzsa triangle inequality gives :mB-nB\\\\le\\\\frac{X+mBX+nB}{X}\\\\le\\\\frac{K^mXK^nX}{X}=K^{m+n}X. Because X\\\\subseteq A, it must be the case that X\\\\le A. Therefore, :mB- nB\\\\le K^{m+n}A. This completes the proof of the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality. Pl√ºnnecke graphs Both Pl√ºnnecke's proof of Pl√ºnnecke's inequality and Ruzsa's original proof of the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality use the method of Pl√ºnnecke graphs. Pl√ºnnecke graphs are a way to capture the additive structure of the sets A, A+B, A+2B, \\\\dots in a graph theoretic manner. First important to defining Pl√ºnnecke graphs is the notion of a commutative graph. Definition. A directed graph G is called semicommutative if, whenever there exist distinct x, y, z_1, z_2, \\\\dots, z_k such that (x, y) and (y, z_i) are edges in G for each i, then there also exist distinct y_1, y_2, \\\\dots, y_k so that (x, y_i) and (y_i, z_i) are edges in G for each i. G is called commutative if it is semicommutative and the graph formed by reversing all its edges is also semicommutative. Now a Pl√ºnnecke graph is defined as follows. Definition. A layered graph is a (directed) graph G whose vertex set can be partitioned V_0 \\\\cup V_1 \\\\cup \\\\dots \\\\cup V_m so that all edges in G are from V_i to V_{i+1}, for some i. A Pl√ºnnecke graph is a layered graph which is commutative. The relevant example of a Pl√ºnnecke graph is the following, showing how the structure of the sets A, A+B, A+2B, \\\\dots, A + mB is a case of that of a Pl√ºnnecke graph. Example. Let A, B be subsets of an abelian group. Then, let G be the layered graph so that each layer V_j is a copy of A + jB, so that V_0 = A, V_1 = A + B, ..., V_m = A + mB. Create the edge (x, y) (where x \\\\in V_i and y \\\\in V_{i+1}) whenever there exists b \\\\in B such that y = x + b. (In particular, if x \\\\in V_i, then x + b \\\\in V_{i+1} by definition, so every vertex has outdegree equal to the size of B.) Then G is a Pl√ºnnecke graph. For example, to check that G is semicommutative, if (x, y) and (y, z_i) are edges in G for each i, then y - x, z_i - y \\\\in B. Then, let y_i = x + z_i - y, so that y_i - x = z_i - y \\\\in B and z_i - y_i = y - x \\\\in B. Thus, G is semicommutative. It can be similarly checked that the graph formed by reversing all edges of G is also semicommutative, so G is a Pl√ºnnecke graph. In a Pl√ºnnecke graph, the image of a set X \\\\subseteq V_0 in V_j, written \\\\text{im}(X, V_j), is defined to be the set of vertices in V_j which can be reached by a path starting from some vertex in X. In particular, in the aforementioned example, \\\\text{im}(X, V_j) is just X + jB. The magnification ratio between V_0 and V_j, denoted \\\\mu_j(G), is then defined as the minimum factor by which the image of a set must exceed the size of the original set. Formally, :\\\\mu_j(G) = \\\\min_{X \\\\subseteq V_0, X eq \\\\emptyset} \\\\frac{\\\\text{im}(X, V_j)}{X}. Pl√ºnnecke's theorem is the following statement about Pl√ºnnecke graphs. The proof of Pl√ºnnecke's theorem involves a technique known as the \\"tensor product trick\\", in addition to an application of Menger's theorem. The Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality is a fairly direct consequence of Pl√ºnnecke's theorem and the Ruzsa triangle inequality. Applying Pl√ºnnecke's theorem to the graph given in the example, at j = m and j = 1, yields that if A + B / A = K, then there exists X \\\\subseteq A so that X + mB / X \\\\le K^m. Applying this result once again with X instead of A, there exists X' \\\\subseteq X so that X' + nB / X' \\\\le K^m. Then, by Ruzsa's triangle inequality (on -X', mB, nB), :mB - nB \\\\le X' + mBX' + nBX' \\\\le K^{m+n}X \\\\le K^{m+n}X, thus proving the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality.

Miller Jr. (born April 21, 1951) is a Democratic politician who currently serves as a Hillsborough County Commissioner, representing the 3rd District since 2010. Prior to serving on the County Commission, Miller served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1992 to 2000, and in the Florida Senate from 2000 to 2006, and unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2006. History Miller was born in Tampa in 1951, and briefly attended Bethune- Cookman College before dropping out to serve in the United States Air Force from 1971 to 1974. He later attended the University of South Florida, where he served as the President of the Student Governmenet Association, as the student representative on the Florida Board of Regents, and as President of the Black Student Union. Miller began working for the Tampa Electric Company in 1977 before retiring with a disability in 1987. Miller was appointed to the Tampa- Hillsborough County Cable TV Board in 1981, serving until 1991. In 1982, Miller ran for the Florida House of Representatives from the 63rd District, which included most of downtown Tampa. He ultimately placed last in the Democratic primary, receiving 9% of the vote to Jim Hargrett's 34%, Warren Dawson's 31%, Bob Lester's 13%, and George Butler's 13%. Miller was subsequently appointed to the Hillsborough City-County Planning Commission in 1987, and unsuccessfully ran for the Tampa City Council for an at-large seat in 1988. He started a government relations firm and briefly worked for the Tampa Urban League as its Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer before he was laid off, at which point he began working as a recruiter for Time Customer Service. Tampa City Council In 1991, following the indictment and suspension of City Councilman Perry Harvey, the only African-American member of the Council, Miller announced that he would run to succeed him in the 5th District, a heavily black district that included most of East Tampa. In the nonpartisan primary, he faced a number of candidates, most notably journalist Nadine Smith, pastor James D. Sykes, caseworker Pete Edwards, and businessman Roy Robinson. Miller based his campaign on providing affordable housing to the district's residents, arguing that when people own their own houses, it produces \\"vibrant, productive neighborhoods\\" that get more people involved in city government. The American Family Association, which was seeking to repeal the city's sexual orientation anti-discrimination ordinance, sent out fliers attacking Miller for supporting the ordinance. Miller strongly argued against repealing the ordinance, noting, \\"By my being a black man, I can't discriminate against someone because of their race, sex, sexual preference or national origin. Because I know what it is like to be discriminated against.\\" Ultimately, Miller narrowly secured a spot in the runoff election, beating Sykes 21‚Äì18% for second place, while Smith placed first with 27% of the vote. In the runoff election against Smith, several of Miller's former rivals endorsed him, as did the St. Petersburg Times, which praised him for having \\"presented a vision of Tampa as a city of thriving neighborhoods and provided specific suggestions to accomplish that goal.\\" Despite Smith's lead over Miller in the initial election, he overwhelmingly defeated her in the runoff, winning 58‚Äì42%, largely because of his strong performance in the district's black precincts. However, Miller only ended up serving for about two months on the City Council. When suspended Councilman Perry Harvey was acquitted by a jury of embezzlement charges, he was statutorily entitled to resume his office. Accordingly, after only 56 days on the Council, Miller left office. Having quit his job as a recruiter, Miller was unemployed and, despite being a former elected official, was forced to bartend at parties to pay his bills. Florida House of Representatives In 1992, State Representative Jim Hargrett, who had represented the 63rd District in the legislature, announced that he would run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election in the renumbered 59th District, which contained most of the territory he had previously represented. Miller announced that he would run to succeed Hargrett, and he won the Democratic primary unopposed. In the general election, he faced Nancy Vildibill, the Republican nominee. Miller campaigned on his support for increasing government spending on public education and healthcare, closing tax loopholes utilized by the wealthy and corporations, growth management, and campaign finance reform. The St. Petersburg Times endorsed Miller over Vildibill, praising him for his diverse life experiences and his \\"clearer grasp on the issues in his district.\\" Ultimately, owing to the district's strong Democratic lean, Miller won his first term in a landslide, receiving 72% of the vote to Vildibill's 28%. Miller was re-elected entirely unopposed in 1994 and 1996, and was selected as the Democratic Whip for the 1996‚Äì1998 session, serving under Minority Leader Buzz Ritchie. In summer of 1998, Willie Logan, who had been selected as the Democratic caucus as its Speaker-designate in the event that it won a majority in the 1998 elections, was ousted and replaced by Anne Mackenzie. Following an outcry from black lawmakers, Mackenzie abruptly announced that she wouldn't seek re- election, which necessitated another election for the party's leader for the 1998‚Äì2000 session. Miller announced his candidacy, and was opposed by Josephus Eggelletion and Al Lawson. After Miller appeared to secure the requisite number of votes, Eggelletion withdrew from the contest, but Lawson continued running, arguing that Miller \\"has some problems with the Black Caucus members\\" and was being \\"used\\" by the party's white legislators to gloss over the party's racial problems. Ultimately, however, Miller ended up defeating Lawson, winning 34 votes to Lawson's 18. Miller won re-election in 1998 unopposed, but was unable to serve as Speaker following the elections, in which Democrats, already in the minority, lost seven additional seats. Florida Senate In 2000, State Senator Jim Hargrett was unable to run for re-election due to term limits, and Miller ran to succeed him in the 21st District, which included heavily black neighborhoods in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Bradenton. He faced former State Education Commissioner Doug Jamerson, who had previously represented St. Petersburg in the State House, in the Democratic primary. Miller, who raised significantly more than Jamerson and represented more of the district than Jamerson did in the House, was widely seen as the frontrunner for the seat, which Jamerson acknowledged. The race between Miller and Jamerson remained relatively civil, with each of them emphasizing their experience though Jamerson attacked Miller for not working to prevent the privatization of Tampa General Hospital, and Miller noted that Jamerson \\"had some high profile positions and wasn't able to keep it up.\\" The two candidates split newspaper endorsements, with the Sarasota Herald-Tribune and the Times endorsing Jamerson while the Tampa Tribune endorsed Miller. On Election Day, Miller won 74% of the vote in Hillsborough County, Jamerson won 86% of the vote in Pinellas County, and the two came to a draw in Manatee County. However, because the Hillsborough portions of the district were more sizable than the other two counties combined, Miller was able to prevail over Jamerson, 54‚Äì46%. In the general election, Miller faced Republican nominee Rudy Bradley, a fellow State Representative who had been elected to a safely Democratic House district in St. Petersburg as a Democrat before switching parties in 1999. Miller focused his campaign on economic development and health care, while criticizing Bradley for his party switch. However, despite Bradley's prodigious fundraising, he was at a severe disadvantage in the heavily Democratic district. In the end, Miller won his first term in the Senate in a landslide, beating Bradley 70‚Äì26%, with independent candidate Kim Coljohn winning 4% of the vote. Following the 2000 census and the redistricting that followed, Miller was unopposed for re-election in the 18th District, which included most of the territory he had previously represented. Miller was selected by the Senate Democratic caucus to serve as Minority Leader for the 2004‚Äì2006 legislative session. He served alongside House Minority Leader Chris Smith, which was the first time in state history that black lawmakers simultaneously held leadership posts in both chambers. 2006 congressional campaign When Congressman Jim Davis opted to run for Governor in 2006 rather than seek re-election, Miller ran to succeed him in the 11th District, which included most of the territory he had represented in the State Senate. Miller faced Hillsborough County Commissioner Kathy Castor, the daughter of longtime politician Betty Castor, in the Democratic primary. He entered the race with endorsements from his female Democratic colleagues in the State Senate, while Castor won the endorsement of EMILY's List. An early poll showed Castor leading Miller by nearly twenty points, and Castor raised more than twice what Miller did as the campaign continued. Both the St. Petersburg Times and the Tampa Tribune endorsed Castor over Miller. The Times praised Miller's \\"experience and leadership qualities,\\" but endorsing Castor \\"for her rounded experience and consistent record in pushing the right issues for the growing region.\\" The Tribune similarly praised Miller for his \\"smart ideas on all the key issues\\" and for his legislative accomplishments, but concluded that Castor was the better choice because of her energy, determination, and leadership potential in Congress. Castor ended up defeating Miller by a wide margin, winning 54% of the vote to his 34%, with the remaining 16% going to other candidates. Hillsborough County Commission In 2010, Miller made a return to elected office by challenging County Commissioner Kevin White, who represented the 3rd District, for re-election in the Democratic primary. Miller, along with Hillsborough County Children's Board member Valerie Goddard, opted to challenge White due to his ethical issues‚Äîhe had been found guilty in a civil case of sexually harassing his former aide. Miller didn't draw attention to White's ethical troubles, instead emphasizing his own legislative accomplishments and arguing that the district's needs had gone unmet during White's tenure. The Times and Tribune split their endorsements. The Times endorsed Miller, arguing that his \\"big edge in political experience\\" and tenure as an \\"effective lawmaker who knew how to work with the opposing party to help his constituents\\" would serve the district well, while the Tribune endorsed Goddard, concluding that while Miller was more experienced, \\"he brings little passion or urgency to the campaign\\" and \\"he has had his time.\\" Miller ended up winning the primary by a wide margin, receiving 51% of the vote while Goddard won 29% and White placed third with 20%. In the general election, he faced only write-in opposition and won his first term on the County Commission with 96% of the vote. He was re- elected in 2014 and 2018 without opposition. Miller, who was prevented from running for another term on the County Commission in 2020 due to term limits, initially announced that he would run to succeed Hillsborough County Clerk Pat Collier Frank. Though he was endorsed by Frank in 2019, he dropped out of the race a few months later, citing his desire to spend time with his family and his severe arthritis, along with other health problems.

The name comes from the hexagonal outer shape of the antenna. It may also sometimes be known as a W-antenna, referring to the shape of the driver. The design looks something like an upturned umbrella. The antenna design resembles a modified Yagi-Uda antenna. It consists of a W-shaped dipole and a reflector. As with the Moxon antenna, the design omits the directors found in a Yagi-Uda. Its antenna gain is between 5dBi and 6dBi, the forward/reverse attenuation is up to 20dB. The hexbeam consists of six arms of non-conductive materials such as fiberglass or plastic pipes, and insulated metallic wire is used to form the elements. In the original design, there were two W-shaped elements. This antenna was first introduced by Mike Traffie, N1HXA, in 1996. Steve Hunt, G3TXQ, did an exploration of this design because of conflicting accounts from users and home builders regarding antenna gain, bandwidth, and forward/reverse gain. Hunt published his improvements in December 2007 in the online magazine AntennaX, in an article titled Broadband Hexbeam. In his modified design, Hunt changed the dimensions and shape of the antenna elements, resulting in an antenna which retained the W-shaped driver, but with a reflector that has more of a semicircular shape. Radio amateurs can build the Hexbeam as a multi-band antenna to cover different frequency ranges. Popular combinations cover 20m, 15m and 10m (3 band) and 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m and 10m (5-band) ham radio bands. Hexbeams can also be built for the 40m and 30m bands. The antenna elements for the lowest frequency band are located at the exterior of the antenna. When constructing multi-band hexbeams, the vertical spacing of each element is critical, because the elements of a multi-band hexbeam mutually influence each other and if the elements are not parallel, parameters of the antenna may change undesirably.

The family severed ties with Hannah when she married a French Christian. Lauferty herself came from a mixed parentage, having a Jewish father and a Roman Catholic mother. A 1930 newspaper article reported, however, \\"Miss Lauferty has again become an integral part of the Jewish people, inasmuch as she is the wife of James Wolfe, noted basso of the Metropolitan Opera Company.\\" She and Wolfe married in October 1924. Career Prompted by newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Lauferty became a journalist when she was 19, working as a reporter for the New York Evening Journal. Much of her writing for newspapers was in the form of advice-to-the-lovelorn columns. She wrote the Beatrice Fairfax columns after Marie Manning, the originator, stopped writing them. Lauferty began writing for radio in the 1930s. Her work in that medium included creating the soap opera Big Sister (1936) and writing scripts for it; and she wrote for Your Family and Mine (1938). She also acted on two radio series and was mistress of ceremonies on You and Your Happiness. Lauferty's work was also published in magazines, including Collier's, Cosmopolitan, Liberty, and Redbook.

On her first voyage she cruised as a privateer, engaged in two actions, one of which resulted in taking a merchantman that she had to abandon. Her owners next sent her out as a letter of marque. During this voyage the British captured Bona. Career 1st cruise: Captain John Dameron commissioned Bona as a privateer on 18 July 1812. In August Dameron twice had to deal with insubordination amongst his crew. On 28 November the Baltimore privateer (fourteen 12 and 18-pounder carronades, two 9-pounder guns, and 130 men) was in company with Bona when they encountered the Falmouth mail packet Townshend, M'Coy, master, about seven leagues west of Barbados. After an engagement of an hour and a half, Townshend struck. She had her master killed, three men dangerously wounded, three severely wounded, and her captain and six men slightly wounded. The Americans gave Townshend up. She returned to Falmouth, arriving there on 2 February 1813.London Chronicle 6 February 1813, Vol.113, p.128. Townshend had 28 crew and passengers. Before she surrendered she threw here mails overboard but they were inadequately weighted and so floated where Bona could retrieve them. The Americans ransomed Townshend for $6,000. On 28 November, Bona, of seven guns and 90 men, captured , Oberry, master, to windward of Barbados. Roe was sailing from Liverpool to Madeira. An American account stated that when Bona fired on Roe Bonas pivot gun burst. Dameron then put 29 officers and men into boats and they boarded Roe. There was some fighting but negligible casualties before Roe struck. Dameron sighted two strange sails coming up so he left the prize crew on Roe and sailed away in an attempt to draw the approaching vessels after him. The British recaptured Roe and sent her into Barbados. Roe sailed from Barbados for Martinique on 30 December.Lloyd's List (LL) 5 February 1813, ‚Ññ4743. 2nd cruise: Captain John Dameron commissioned Bona as a letter of marque on 7 January 1813.

Brownell (born 1948) is an American politician who served as the 39th Mayor of Burlington, Vermont. Brownell is currently the last Republican to have served as mayor of Burlington. Early life In 1948, Brownell was born in New York City to Lincoln and Mary Hester Brownell and during his childhood he traveled between Long Island, New York and Saigon, Vietnam. In 1969, he married Christina Bratton in Maryland. In 1970, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in sociology and in 1978, graduated from the University of Vermont with a master's in finance. In 1978, he moved his family to Burlington after serving six years in the air force. Career Early politics In 1983, school commissioner Diane Gallagher was nominated by the Republican Party for Ward 6's alderman seat after one term leaving the seat open and Brownell was given the Republican nomination for the commission seat without opposition and later defeated independent Hans J. Puck with 1,188 votes to 863 votes. In 1988, he served as a delegate to the Vermont Republican Party's state convention. In September 1989, Alderman David J. Thelander resigned from office in order for a special election to be held and after being given the Republican nomination by unanimity by the city committee Brownell easily defeated Greg Guma with 635 votes to 282 votes. He easily won election to a term in his own right on March 6, 1990, when he easily defeated Green party candidate Bea Bookchin with 764 votes to 258 votes. During his tenure he served on the finance committee and in November he and Paul Sunderland voted against a resolution that suspended city advertisement in The Burlington Free Press. In 1992, he faced no opposition for reelection. Mayoral On January 9, 1993, he stated that the Republican city committee would either choose him or city chairman Bob Minkewicz and on January 14, announced that he would be running for the mayoral office. On January 20, the Republican party gave him the nomination, but he was seen as the underdog due to Clavelle having raised almost twice as much money than Brownell although he was able to get the Burlington police union's endorsement, which had given its endorsement to Progressives since 1983. On March 3, he defeated Clavelle with 5,410 votes to 4,686 votes and only carried two of the city's six wards. Clavelle stated that he lost due to the controversy over his proposal to have the city pay for healthcare benefits for domestic partners of city workers which was passed. Former Republican Mayor Robert K. Bing congratulated him on his victory while Representative Bernie Sanders, who served as mayor from 1981 to 1989, stated that he was not disappointed by Clavelle defeat. Following his inauguration as mayor he made multiple lobbying trips to Montpelier to support a bill that would give money to Burlington and Newport to buy waterfront land. He also decreased the city's budget by $1 million, but that would later be undone by the cost of development on recently purchased land along Lake Champlain. On January 8, 1995, he announced his intention to run for reelection. He was outraised by Clavelle, who was attempting a comeback, again, and lost the police union endorsement to Clavelle. He was narrowly defeated by Clavelle by 4,933 votes to 4,728 votes with Democratic Paul Lafayette taking 1,735 votes. None of the three candidates received 50% of the vote. Later career In 1998, he ran for one of Chittenden County's six senate seats and placed fourth out of twelve candidates. He ran for reelection in 1998 and placed fourth again out of fourteen candidates. During the 2000 Republican Party presidential primaries he endorsed Senator John McCain.

Biography She graduated with a double AB degree in Ecology and Conservation from Vassar College, and then studied Systems Ecology under Howard T. Odum at the University of Florida, Gainesville for her MS degree. She completed her Ph.D. under the supervision of Simon Levin at Cornell University in 1994. A broadly trained ecologist, she has spent most of her career inferring water chemistry and fish ecology from careful examination of fish otoliths. Otoliths are small calcified structures that help fish to hear and balance, and they make excellent subjects for sclerochronology. Most recently, her studies have focused on the looming problem of the deoxygenation of the oceans as a result of global climate change. In addition to her studies of otoliths, early in her career, Limburg contributed to a now seminal study led by Robert Costanza that was one of the first to attempt to place a value on worldwide ecosystem services that still continues to be frequently invoked in discussions of conservation biology. In a later paper lead by Limburg, she and her coauthors argued that economic decisions need to be made in light of an understanding of ecosystem dynamics, including the potential for nonlinearity. Building upon the conceptual foundation of their earlier publications, in 2010 Limburg, Costanza, and Ida Kubiszewski edited the inaugural edition of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Ecological Economics Reviews.

It is the fourth-highest summit in the Hozameen Range, and highest point of the Manson Ridge subrange. It is situated southeast of Hope, and north-northeast of Silvertip Mountain, its nearest higher peak. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. The mountain was known as Beaver Mountain as early as 1930 before being named for Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet, and being officially adopted October 6, 1936, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the mountain was made August 12, 1924, by Fred Perry, Herbert Selwood, Leslie Ford, and T.L. Thacker. Geology Mount Outram is related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Fred Beckey describes Mount Outram as having \\"the finest assortment of arctic flora in the northern Cascades.\\" Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W.

As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Outram.

Early life and education Olive Constance Purser was born on 15 July 1886 to Alfred and Ellen Purser. Purser was the youngest of four. She had two sisters and a brother. Her father was a Chief Inspector of National Schools. Within a few years of her birth the family had moved to Rathmines in Dublin where they remained. The family were dedicated to education. Her aunt was Sarah Purser and her uncle was Louis Claude Purser while her two older sisters, Elinor and Luisa became teachers while her brother John, in 1911, was a master's student and Assistant to the Professor of Engineering in Birmingham University. Purser was one of the first women to be admitted to Trinity College Dublin entering in the Michaelmas term of 1904. Within 2 years of the ban on women being lifted, she had become the first woman to be made a scholar under the TCD system on 11 June 1906. She won it for classics. At the time she achieved this, women were still not permitted to remain in the college after 6pm in the evening, to cross the Front Square without a chaperone or to dining with the male students or staff. Purser was a member of the Elizabethan Society started by her fellow student Marion Johnston. Two years after she completed her degree in TCD, Purser become a temporary lecturer at the University, taking over for Edward Dowden. In 1921 the Crewe report (The position of the Classics in the Educational System of the United Kingdom) lists her as Dean of the Women Students when she reports on the education of women and girls. Purser worked with her uncle Louis Purser on the Shanganagh dig. At some point after 1911 Purser went on to gain her doctorate. She later wrote a book on the women of Trinity. Purser died on 12 April 1973.

His campaigns, some independent observers, and some media sources have said that the mainstream media in the United States is biased against Bernie Sanders. Others say that coverage is unbiased or biased in his favor. The allegations of bias primarily concern the coverage of his presidential campaigns. A study of the 2016 election found that the amount of media coverage of Sanders during 2015 exceeded his standing in the polls, and was strongly correlated with his polling performance over the course of the whole campaign. On average, research shows that Sanders received substantially less media coverage than Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, but that the tone of his coverage was more favorable than that of any other candidate. During the 2016 election, the media provided substantially more coverage of the Republican primary than the Democratic primary, and Republican candidate Donald Trump dominated media coverage. During the 2020 Democratic primary, Sanders, his campaign and his supporters criticized the media as biased again. Sanders suggested that The Washington Post gave him unfair coverage because Sanders had encouraged taxing The Washington Post- owner Jeff Bezos's main company, Amazon, more heavily. The executive editor of the Washington Post rejected Sanders's suggestion, describing it as a \\"conspiracy theory\\".  Background Writing in 2005, Sanders identified corporate media coverage of political issues as a subject on which he felt he needed to take a position. Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primary to Hillary Clinton. After the election, he released a campaign book which devoted a chapter to media issues. He wrote that while national media did not cover his visits to poverty-stricken areas of the country, local media did. He also raised issue with the consequences of corporations like General Electric, Comcast, and Disney owning media conglomerates for media coverage of issues like taxation and trans-national trade agreements.  Academic analyses  A 2018 book by political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck found that the amount of news coverage Sanders received exceeded his share in the national polls in 2015. Throughout the campaign as a whole, their analysis showed that his \\"media coverage and polling numbers were strongly correlated.\\" They write that \\"Sanders's appeal, like Trump's, depended on extensive and often positive media coverage.\\" Furthermore, \\"media coverage brought Sanders to a wider audience and helped spur his long climb in the polls by conveying the familiar tale of the surprisingly successful underdog. Meanwhile, Clinton received more negative media coverage.\\" Thomas Patterson of the Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy wrote a report in June 2016 analyzing the media coverage of candidates in the 2016 presidential primaries. During 2015, the Democratic race received less than half as much news coverage as the Republican race did. The Sanders campaign was \\"largely ignored in the early months\\" and \\"until the pre-primary debates\\", but that once he did begin to get coverage in 2015, it was \\"overwhelmingly positive in tone\\". However, the study contended that the increase in coverage did not happen \\"at a rate close to what he needed to compensate for the early part of the year.\\" In her 2018 book The Unprecedented 2016 Presidential Election, Rachel Bitecofer wrote that the Democratic primary was effectively over in terms of delegate count by mid-March 2016, but that the media promoted the narrative that the contest between Sanders and Clinton was \\"heating up\\" at that time. Bitecofer found that Trump received more media coverage than Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders combined during a time when those were the only primary candidates left in the race. In her book A Rhetoric of Divisive Partisanship: The 2016 American Presidential Campaign Discourse of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, Colleen Elizabeth Kelly said that Sanders and Clinton got a share of news coverage that was similar to their eventual primary results, until the stage of the campaign when Clinton pulled ahead in the primary. Sanders received the most favorable coverage of any primary candidate. Kelly writes that Sanders was both right and wrong to complain about media bias, citing the Shorenstein Center report on the media's outsized coverage of the Republican primary, but noting that Sanders' coverage was the most favorable of any candidate. Early in the primary, John Sides found that the volume of media coverage of Sanders was consistent with his polling and that the press he was getting was more favorable than Clinton's. Jonathan Stray, a computational journalism researcher at the Columbia Journalism School, wrote for Nieman Lab in January 2016 that \\"at least online\\" Sanders got coverage proportionate to his standing in polls. A 2019 study by Northeastern University's School of Journalism found that Sanders initially received the most positive coverage of any major candidate in the 2020 primary and later the third and then fourth most favorable of eight candidates.  2016 primary campaign  Sanders at a town meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, July 2015 In August 2015, Elizabeth Jensen, the public editor for NPR, responded to an influx of emails to NPR regarding a Morning Edition segment. Jensen said that she does not \\"find that NPR has been slighting\\" Sanders' campaign and added, \\"In the last two days alone, NPR has covered the Democrats' climate change stances and reactions to the Republican debate and Sanders has been well in the mix.\\" In the following month, Margaret Sullivan, public editor of The New York Times, wrote that she had received many complaints from readers about purported bias against Sanders. She responded that The New York Times had given roughly the same amount of articles dedicated to Sanders as they did to similarly-polling Republican candidates (barring Donald Trump), while conceding that some of the articles written were \\"fluff\\" and \\"regrettably dismissive\\". Later in the month, The Washington Post wrote that \\"Sanders has not faced the kind of media scrutiny, let alone attacks from opponents, that leading candidates eventually experience.\\" In January 2016, Claire Malone from FiveThirtyEight rejected notions that Sanders was the subject of a \\"media blackout\\", saying he received 30 percent of coverage in the Democratic primary at that time. That same month, The Guardian reported that Sanders aides had accused David Brock, a Clinton ally, of mudslinging, after Brock spoke to the press about one of Sanders' campaign ads, suggesting that \\"it seems black lives don't matter to Bernie Sanders.\\" Despite this characterization, the ad \\"elicited very positive responses when it was shown to a representative sample of Americans.\\" Asked by Jay Newton-Small of Time in February if he was \\"fighting an asymmetrical war against [Sanders],\\" Brock commented that \\"we do opposition research, but we haven't leveled any false accusations against Senator Sanders and we won't.\\" Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) wrote that between 10:20 p.m. Sunday, March 6, to 3:54 p.m. Monday, March 7, a period of about 16 hours, that The Washington Post ran 16 negative articles on Sanders. In their analysis, FAIR selected a period following a debate in Flint, Michigan, where Salons Amanda Marcotte characterized Sanders as performing poorly. Dara Lind and Libby Nelson, writing for Vox Media, said they believed Sanders made a good impression and appealed to the largely black audience attending the debate. Of the 16 articles examined by FAIR, two were opinion articles; one was a story originating from the Associated Press; and 12 were blogs stories in which the writers are required to include \\"commentary and analysis\\". FAIR's criteria for identifying an article as negative or positive was viewed as \\"overly broad\\" by the Post. According to researcher Thomas Patterson, the Republican/Democratic primary coverage split from March 15 to May 3 was 64‚Äì36 and the Clinton/Sanders media coverage split was 61‚Äì39. Patterson ascribes this difference to \\"the influence of 'electability' on reporting,\\" rather than on polling numbers. This period was the first time in the campaign that Clinton's press was marginally positive and Sanders's press was slightly negative. In Rolling Stone, Matt Taibbi criticized The New York Times for retroactively making online changes to a March 15, 2016 article about Sanders's legislative accomplishments over the past 25 years. In addition to rewording the title, several paragraphs were added. In 2019, Margaret Sullivan, public editor at The New York Times, characterized the changes as \\"stealth editing\\" and added that \\"the changes to this story were so substantive that a reader who saw the piece when it first went up might come away with a very different sense of Sanders' legislative accomplishments than one who saw it hours later.\\" In April 2016, NPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik responded to criticisms of bias against Sanders saying that Sanders had appeared three times on NPR whereas Clinton had only done so once, that media outlets saw a Sanders win as a \\"long shot\\" early in the campaign, and that by April 2016, she appeared very likely to win the nomination. The same month, Ezra Klein and Matthew Yglesias of Vox wrote the media was biased in favor of Sanders because Clinton's lead was becoming increasingly insurmountable, yet the media had a vested commercial interest in exaggerating how close the race was.  2020 primary campaign  2019 According to a March 2019 analysis by Northeastern University's School of Journalism, Sanders received the most positive coverage of any major candidate in the 2020 Democratic primary. An updated analysis in April after more candidates had entered the field placed him third out of eight candidates; a further update for June to September 2019 found that Sanders's positive coverage ranked fourth out of eight major candidates. In April 2019, Sanders wrote to the board of the Center for American Progress in response to a video produced by their former media outlet ThinkProgress. The video mocked him for becoming a millionaire after writing a book about his 2016 election run. The article based on the video was later emended to remove references about Sanders' physical appearance. The following month, Politico published a feature article on Sanders's income which described him as \\"rich\\" and \\"cheap\\". Politico was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League. In August 2019, Sanders said that The Washington Post did not \\"write particularly good articles\\" about him and suggested that it was because he frequently mentioned that Amazon, The Washington Post's parent company, did not pay taxes. Marty Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, responded, \\"Contrary to the conspiracy theory the senator seems to favor, Jeff Bezos allows our newsroom to operate with full independence, as our reporters and editors can attest.\\" In November 2019, Emma Specter at Vogue doubted that there was a conspiracy against Sanders. She also listed several examples of limited coverage of his policy proposals and interpreted lack of coverage of Sanders on certain issues and events as being \\"only somewhat surprising\\". In a December 2019 opinion column for The New York Times, David Leonhardt agreed with Politico co-founder John F. Harris about the media having a centrist bias. Leonardt argued that this hurt Sanders and Warren, particularly in questions posed to both about the issue of a wealth tax. In the same month, In These Times analyzed coverage of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary by MSNBC between August and September 2019. They said that \\"MSNBC talked about Biden twice as often as Warren and three times as often as Sanders\\", and that Sanders was the candidate spoken of negatively the most frequently of the three.\\" 2020 The CNN-sponsored debate between Democratic candidates on January 14, 2020, was the subject of criticism over perceived bias against Sanders, especially concerning moderator Abby Phillip's handling of a he-said, she-said controversy between Sanders and fellow Senator and candidate Elizabeth Warren. Journalism think-tank Poynter Institute called Phillip's treatment of Sanders \\"stunning in its ineptness and stunning in its unprofessionalism\\". In February 2020 media appearances and interviews, against a backdrop of Sanders' ascendance in the polls, campaign consultant James Carville expressed his displeasure at the prospect of Sanders being nominated, branded Sanders as a \\"communist\\", pejoratively labeled Sanders' base of support as a \\"cult\\" and warned of the \\"end of days\\", if Sanders were to win the Democratic nomination. MSNBC came under particular scrutiny during the first three primary-season state votes due to historical references made by two of their hosts. Chris Matthews compared Sanders to George McGovern in terms of electability on February 3 and criticized Sanders for adopting the \\"democratic socialist\\" label on February 7. His February 7 remarks stated that a stronger influence by Sanders and other left-wing politicians who were active during the Cold War could have resulted in \\"executions in Central Park\\". The following week, Chuck Todd criticized the rhetoric of Sanders supporters by quoting a conservative article which compared them to brown shirts in the Nazi regime. Commenting on the 2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses, Matthews invoked \\"the fall of France\\" to the Nazis in 1940 as a metaphor for Sanders' apparent victory in the state. His analogy was criticized by the Sanders campaign and other commentators, who noted that members of Sanders' family had been murdered in the Holocaust. Matthews later issued an on-air apology to Sanders and his supporters. Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The following month, Vice News released the documentary Bernie Blackout directed by Pat McGee. Although largely focused on interviews with campaign staff, the film also attempted to draw parallels between the media's treatment of Sanders supporters and opponents of the Iraq War.

The film had its world premiere on October 5, 2018 at the Sitges Film Festival and was released in the United States and Russia in 2019 on Shudder and Planeta Inform, respectively.  Synopsis  The film follows a group of reality show ghost hunters, Sam and Javier, who have chosen to investigate Mexico's most haunted house in hopes of securing better ratings for their failing show Deadtectives. They are accompanied by Sam's wife and the show's producer Kate and Sam's awkward brother Lloyd. While Sam and Javier give off the impression that they truly believe and have experienced the paranormal, none of the events shown thus far in their series were actually real and were all the result of their special effects person Bob, who is also accompanying them on the trip. Lloyd is the only one in the group who actually believes that ghosts are real. Once inside the home Bob sets up various special effects, however the team soon discovers that the home is truly haunted, particularly after an angry spirit kills Javier, the only Spanish speaking member of the team. Attempts to leave the home are unsuccessful and the remaining team members find that they are truly trapped. Now dead, Javier discovers that aside from himself, the home is only haunted by four Spanish-speaking ghosts: a mother, her two children, and her tyrannical husband, who is insistent on keeping his family from moving on and is now intent on murdering the rest of the home's living inhabitants. Javier witnesses the murder of Bob and sees him pass into a brilliant white light, something he himself had experienced when he died but chose not to walk into. Attempts to communicate with his teammates are initially unsuccessful until one of Lloyd's inventions gives them the ability to see Javier, at which point they use various other apparatus to communicate and plan on how to beat the ghost husband. Their attempts are initially unsuccessful until the wife chooses to finally fight back against her husband, which allows them to gain the upper hand and destroy his spirit. Now finally free from the oppressive spirit, the mother and her children walk into a brilliant white light that has appeared for them. Before walking into it himself Javier takes the opportunity to say goodbye to his team, but takes so long that the light fades away without him. Now stuck in the land of the living, Javier, Sam, Kate, and Lloyd decide to take on real hauntings in other locations in order to find the truth and bring peace to suffering spirits.

It was proven by Imre Ruzsa (1996), and is so named for its resemblance to the triangle inequality. It is an important lemma in the proof of the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality.  Statement  If A and B are subsets of an abelian group, then the sumset notation A+B is used to denote \\\\\\\\{a+b:a\\\\in A,b\\\\in B\\\\\\\\}. Similarly, A-B denotes \\\\\\\\{a-b:a\\\\in A,b\\\\in B\\\\\\\\}. Then, the Ruzsa triangle inequality states the following. An alternate formulation involves the notion of the Ruzsa distance. Definition. If A and B are finite subsets of an abelian group, then the Ruzsa distance between these two sets, denoted d(A, B), is defined to be :d(A, B) = \\\\log \\\\frac{A-B}{\\\\sqrt{AB}}. Then, the Ruzsa triangle inequality has the following equivalent formulation: This formulation resembles the triangle inequality for a metric space; however, the Ruzsa distance does not define a metric space since d(A, A) is not always zero. Proof To prove the statement, it suffices to construct an injection from the set A\\\\times(B-C) to the set (A-B)\\\\times(A-C). Define a function \\\\phi as follows. For each x\\\\in B-C choose a b(x)\\\\in B and a c(x)\\\\in C such that x=b(x)-c(x). By the definition of B-C, this can always be done. Let \\\\phi:A\\\\times(B-C)\\\\rightarrow(A-B)\\\\times(A-C) be the function that sends (a,x) to (a-b(x),a-c(x)). For every point \\\\phi(a,x)=(y,z) in the set is (A-B)\\\\times(A-C), it must be the case that x=z-y and a=y+b(x). Hence, \\\\phi maps every point in A\\\\times(B-C) to a distinct point in (A-B)\\\\times(A-C) and is thus an injection. In particular, there must be at least as many points in (A-B)\\\\times(A-C) as in A\\\\times(B-C). Therefore, :AB-C=A\\\\times(B-C)\\\\le(A-B)\\\\times(A-C)=A-BA-C, completing the proof. Variants of the Ruzsa triangle inequality The Ruzsa sum triangle inequality is a corollary of the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality (which is in turn proved using the ordinary Ruzsa triangle inequality). Proof. The proof uses the following lemma from the proof of the Pl√ºnnecke-Ruzsa inequality. Lemma. Let A and B be finite subsets of an abelian group G. If X\\\\subseteq A is a nonempty subset that minimizes the value of K'=X+B/X, then for all finite subsets C\\\\subset G, :X+B+C\\\\le K'X+C. If A is the empty set, then the left side of the inequality becomes 0, so the inequality is true. Otherwise, let X be a subset of A that minimizes K'=X+B/X. Let K=A+B/A. The definition of X implies that K'\\\\le K. Because X\\\\subset A, applying the above lemma gives :B+C\\\\leX+B+C\\\\le K'X+C\\\\le K'A+C\\\\le KA+C=\\\\frac{A+BA+C}{A}. Rearranging gives the Ruzsa sum triangle inequality. By replacing B and C in the Ruzsa triangle inequality and the Ruzsa sum triangle inequality with -B and -C as needed, a more general result can be obtained: If A, B, and C are finite subsets of an abelian group then :AB\\\\pm C\\\\leA\\\\pm BA\\\\pm C, where all eight possible configurations of signs hold. These results are also sometimes known collectively as the Ruzsa triangle inequalities.

Early life  Esther Kazue Takei was born in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Shigehisa \\"Harry\\" Takei and Ninoe Takei. She was raised in Venice Beach, where her Japanese-born parents ran concession stands along the pier. At age 6, she was chosen to be a \\"mascot\\" for the Japanese team at the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles.  World War II  As a teenager, a senior at Venice High School, she was incarcerated with her family at Granada War Relocation Center in Granada, Colorado, from 1942 to 1944. \\"I thought, well, I guess, as a good American citizen, we have to do what the government wants us to do,\\" she recalled many years later. She worked as a dental assistant in the internment camp, and drew a weekly cartoon, \\"Ama-Chan\\", for the camp newspaper, the Granada Pioneer. She also briefly worked as a live-in servant for a family in Boulder, Colorado. In 1944, she was allowed to return to California and enroll in Pasadena Junior College, as a \\"test case\\" for Japanese-American resettlement after the war. During her time as a student, she lived with the family of Hugh Anderson, a Quaker accountant in Altadena. Her enrollment was greeted with threats and harassment from anti-Japanese nativists in the area; sympathetic students and others volunteered to walk with her on campus, for her safety. The War Relocation Authority's director, Dillon S. Myer, stood by the decision to allow Takei's enrollment. \\"Her ultimately successful resettlement helped pave the way for the mass return of Japanese Americans to the West Coast beginning in January 1945,\\" noted one profile. Takei left college without graduating, to help her parents re-establish themselves in Los Angeles; in 2008 Pasadena City College presented her with an honorary degree.  After the war  Nishio worked as a secretary. Her parents moved to Japan in 1958. She testified before the 1981 Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. In 1999 she gave an oral history interview to the Japanese American National Museum. She was named California Woman of the Year in 2012. That year, she spoke on a panel at the first Fred Korematsu Day event in Pasadena. Esther Takei married a fellow Japanese-American internee, Shigeto Nishio, in 1947; they had a son, John. She died in 2019, aged 94 years, in Pasadena, California. There is a box of her papers, including letters, photographs, and her 1944 identification badge, at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles.

Early life and education  Takeuchi was born Shigeyo Ide on August 31, 1881 in what is now Kawakami, Nagano. She was the oldest daughter of a local politician. As a child, she briefly attended elementary school, but stopped to take care of her siblings. After contracting alopecia, she went to a hospital in Tokyo, where she was inspired to become a physician by two female physicians who worked there. She studied under Yoshioka Yayoi, and graduated from the Tokyo Women's Medical University in 1908. She was a member of the university's first graduating class. She married Kohei Takeuchi in 1916.  Career  Takeuchi opened a private practice in Shinjuku in 1919. She also became active in the Japanese women's suffrage movement, and was a member of the Japanese Women's Suffrage League with Ichikawa Fusae. In 1933 she earned a doctorate from Tokyo Imperial University. In 1946 she was elected to the House of Representatives as a member of the Liberal Party. She was one of the first women to be elected to the Diet, and led the Female Diet Members' club. She focused on issues related to health care, but also advocated for eugenics. Takeuchi was purged from office later that year and did not reenter politics. Takeuchi died on December 15, 1975.

She was born May al-Khoury Saadeh () in Beirut, Lebanon in 1927, to Habib al-Khoury Saadeh () and his wife Marie Saab al-Khoury Saadeh (). She married Ibrahim Sursock in 1942. They had three daughters, Amal, Jumana, and Linda. By 1950, they had separated, and she had married Carlos Arida. She was elected president of the Lebanese Water Skiing Federation from 1953 to 1961. In 1955, Lebanese president Camille Chamoun initiated the founding of the Baalbeck International Festival to foster international appreciation of Lebanese arts, and Arida was tasked with organizing the music and ballet components. She became the president of the festival in 1973. The Lebanese Civil War, beginning in 1975, disrupted the festival, though Arida said that the committee continued to meet and \\"never slowed its activities... even in times of war\\" (\\"n‚Äôa jamais frein√© ses activit√©s... m√™me en p√©riode de guerre\\"). The war ended in 1990, and in 1997 the festival was revived. Arida received a number of international honors for her patronage of the arts and international exchange, including the Gold Medal of Lebanese Merit in 1976, Knight of France's Legion of Honour in 1978, Commander of Lebanon's National Order of the Cedar in 2000, Commander of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity in 2005, and Commander of Spain's Order of Isabella the Catholic in 2009. In 2013, she was the subject of a biography written in French by Nabil el-Azan, titled May Arida: Le r√™ve de Baalbeck (\\"The Dream of Baalbeck\\").

History The club was formed in 1927 as the Granite Club by the Athletic Association of Kitchener and Waterloo (AAKW), which was briefly called the Kitchener Curling Club. The club played on a five-sheet rink at 69 Agnes Street in Kitchener. The AAKW had been formed by members of the clubs located at the corners of Erb and Regina streets in Waterloo and Gaukel Street in Kitchener (previously Berlin). Curling had been played at those clubs since the 1880s. The club adopted the name \\"Granite Club\\" to appeal to more than just curling. Artificial ice was added in 1928. In 1928, the Kitchener Tennis Club built five courts next to the club, and in 1931 the K-W Badminton Club added an addition. From 1941 to 1948 the K-W Skating Club also called the Granite home, until moving to the Waterloo Memorial Arena. Also in 1948, a Ladies section was added to the club. On May 8, 1955 a fire caused by careless children destroyed half the building, gutting the badminton club and some of the curling facilities. Damages totalled at $200,000. The club rebuilt and remained on Agnes Street until moving to its present location Waterloo in 2003. The badminton club remained on Agnes Street. The current Waterloo Park site of the Granite Club previously housed the K-W Skating Club before it relocated to RIM Park. Called the \\"Rink in the Park\\", the Granite Club officially opened the building to the public on September 30, 2003, in time for the annual curling season. The club has hosted the 1980 World Junior Curling Championships, the 1969 and 1975 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship and the 2004 M&M; Meat Shops Skins Game. The club also hosts the annual KW Fall Classic World Curling Tour event.

It stars Ravi Teja in the titular role along with Payal Rajput, Nabha Natesh, Tanya Hope, Bobby Simha, Sunil, and Vennela Kishore. The music is composed by S. Thaman with cinematography by Karthik Ghattamaneni and editing by Shravan Katikaneni. The film follows a dead man discovered to be frozen in the mountains of Ladakh. Once brought back to life using advanced technology by doctors at the Re-Live lab, he attempts to find out his identity and the people responsible for killing him. Disco Raja was released theatrically on 24 January 2020, receiving mixed reviews from critics. Despite praise for Teja's performance and Thaman's music, the film became a commercial failure. Due to the disappointing box office performance, Teja decided not to experiment with his roles in the future, and plans for a sequel were also canceled.  Plot  A brutally attacked man left for dead in the mountain ranges of Ladakh is found frozen by an expedition team. He is taken to the Re-Live lab where Dr. Shishir introduces a technology that can revive dead people to Dr. Parineeti and her colleague Phalguni. Following the experiment, the subject wakes up but with no memory of his past. On the other hand, his girlfriend Nabha explains to a loan officer that he, Vasu, handled multiple professions from day to night, during which she fell for him. While searching for his stepbrother Kaushik who snatched the family's money, Vasu found him but never returned. She also reveals that Vasu's family members are actually orphans who came to live together. Back to the lab, Vasu escapes using Parineeti's card but is recaptured after he faints due to being exposed to heavy lighting. Parineeti then explains that he was killed by someone and revived by the doctors. However, Parineeti is adamant on making Vasu revive his memories, and retrieves a commodity found with his corpse, giving it to Phalguni for servicing. In an attempt to gain attention of those who remember him, Vasu thrashes a minister, and the video goes viral following his arrest. An aged gangster named Burma Sethu is surprised to find him alive and sends his men to pick him from the police station with the help of Laalu Sastry's group. The goons group take away Vasu, his brother, and the doctors. Circumstances force Phalguni to throw out Vasu's package given by Parineeti, and Vasu picks up the package to find a music player and headphones. Listening to the music, his memories are revived. He fights off the henchmen, revealing himself to be Disco Raj; this information also reaches to Sethu by Laalu Sastry. Shishir explains that Raj's actual age is 70 as he was frozen for 35 years; he is possibly not Vasu. Raj takes Phalguni along with him on a quest to rediscover his identity. In the hospital, an injured Shishir explains to Sethu about Raj's revival. Raj visits the Madras Bar founded by him, where a friend explains how Raj used to be a music-loving gangster at loggerheads with Sethu, a rival gangster whose refusal to collaborate sparked a gang war. Both parties killed each other's members, but Raj succeeded in getting Sethu arrested for life. Raj also fell for a deaf and mute girl named Helen who initially declined but eventually reciprocated. When she got pregnant before marriage, Raj married her, faked his own death and left behind his gang. However, Sethu was freed from prison and vengefully killed Raj's gang members. Raj and Helen were also attacked in Ladakh, but Raj managed to send Helen away in a truck before himself getting killed. On the other hand, a police officer who has rescued Vasu and told him about Raj, his father, tells him to murder him for killing Helen. Arriving at the spot, Raj and Phalguni are attacked by Vasu, who questions Raj about Helen's murder. Raj denies killing her and gets into a fight with Sethu. A stabbed Sethu reveals he did not get Raj killed in Ladakh and he came after him to avenge his wife's murder. Raj denies killing her and realizing the truth, shoots the police officer who had not just brainwashed Vasu but also sent goons to kill Vasu's family. Seeing the photo of the officer's dead corpse, the goons retreat. Raj and Phalguni discover that a man named Anthony Das gave the cop orders to kill them, and along with Vasu, hold Anthony's men on gunpoint, before Anthony, revealed to be Raj's gang member Uttar Kumar (Sunil), shoots Raj. He reveals that he killed Sethu's wife and got the latter to kill Raj's gang. He even faked his own death and was one of the men who stabbed Raj in Ladakh. However, Raj, Vasu, and Phalguni together fight off and kill the goons. Raj kills Anthony and himself succumbs to the injuries. Returning to Delhi, Vasu pays his family's loan with the help of Kaushik and reconciles with Nabha. At the end, Raj is brought back to life once again by the doctors, while Sethu and Anthony are also recovering in the lab.

It is located in front of the Shibuya Station Hachik≈ç exit and stops vehicles in all directions to allow pedestrians to inundate the entire intersection. The statue of Hachik≈ç, between the station and the intersection, is a common meeting place and almost always crowded. Three large TV screens mounted on nearby buildings overlook the crossing, as well as many advertising signs. The Starbucks store overlooking the crossing is also one of the busiest in the world. Its heavy traffic and inundation of advertising have led to it being compared to the Times Square intersection in New York City and Piccadilly Circus intersection in London. Shibuya Crossing is the world‚Äôs busiest pedestrian crossing, with as many as 2,500 people crossing at a time. Tokyo- based architecture professor Julian Worrall has said Shibuya Crossing is \\"a great example of what Tokyo does best when it's not trying.\\" Shibuya Crossing is often featured in movies and television shows which take place in Tokyo, such as Lost in Translation, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, and Resident Evil: Afterlife and Retribution, as well as on domestic and international news broadcasts. The iconic video screen featured in the above movies, in particular Lost in Translation with its 'walking dinosaur' scene, was taken down for a period of time and replaced with static advertising, although it resumed operation in July 2013. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall (who spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist) depicted the area in his large artwork 'Shibuya', exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in London 2013., Scramble Crossing is a major location in the video game The World Ends With You, which is set entirely in the neighbourhood of Shibuya.

The group is a coalition of around 12 different Mai-Mai groups in and around South Kivu province. It was announced on June 30, 2017, symbolically Congolese Independence Day. The coalition is led primarily by William Yakutumba, a veteran Mai-Mai commander who has been involved in rebellion against the government since 2007. Several other notable commanders play an important role in the coalition, notably Sheh Assani, the leader of Mai-Mai Malaika. The group has vowed to fight for the removal of Congolese President Joseph Kabila and his successor, F√©lix Tshisekedi. As of 2019, the coalition has also engaged in heavy clashes with the Banyamulenge-led Ngumino and Twiganeho militias.  Formation  Logo of the CNPSC. While the official announcement of the coalition came in 2017, the idea of the CNPSC had been existent since around 2013. The coalition actually began to form in early 2017, with Yakutumba contacting Mai-Mai leaders around South Kivu. Yakutumba was aided by ex-FARDC General Shabani Sikatenda, who worked to arm Mai-Mai groups and convince them to join up with Yakutumba. Sikatenda was an important factor in the creation of the Mai-Mai Malaika group, as he provided them weapons. Yakutumba additionally brought in commanders which he had fallen out with or had split from his group. These included R√©union Warusasa and Ebu Ela Kitungano. Yakutumba also contacted commanders north of Fizi Territory, the area which his group and most of the CNPSC are based, and is also reported to have entered into an alliance with a Batwa commander in Tanganyika Province.  Timeline  thumbrightThe area of operation of the Mai-Mai groups of the CNPSC, in January 2019: 1\\\\. Mai-Mai Yakutumba 2\\\\. Mai-Mai Echilo 3\\\\. Mai-Mai R√©union 4\\\\. Mai-Mai R√©n√© 5\\\\. Mai-Mai Ngalyabatu 6\\\\. Mai-Mai Bishambuke 7\\\\. Mai-Mai Mulumba 8\\\\. Mai-Mai Sheh Assani/Malaika 9\\\\. Mai-Mai Napata The announcement of the group came on June 30, 2017, with their first attack being on the hydroelectric dam of Force Bendera, a FARDC position. Through this, the coalition was able to acquire a significant amount of supplies and weapons. In the next few days, the CNPSC would attack FARDC positions in major mining sectors, most notably Misisi. Following these attacks, the FARDC was able to beat the coalition back. According to the United Nations, this fighting had displaced 80,000 people. On September 27, the coalition attacked the town of Mboko, in which troops from Yakutumba's militia as well as those of Ren√© Itongwa, R√©union, and Ngarukiye participated. The CNPSC beat back the FARDC and captured the town. The same day, the CNPSC marched on the city of Uvira, in which CNPSC troops and Yakutumba's naval wing took part in a battle against the FARDC. The port and outskirts of the town were captured by the group before they were beat back by forces of MONUSCO. On October 2, CNPSC rebels ambushed the FARDC and reportedly killed 92. The FARDC launched a counteroffensive in December. This prompted the CNPSC to attempt to assassinate General Philemon Yav, the overall commander of the counteroffensive, this attack failed, and caused the FARDC to launch an all out attack against the rebels. The FARDC counteroffensive caused significant losses towards the coalition, and forced Yakutumba's troops to temporarily relocate from his base in the Ubwari Peninsula to areas controlled by Mai-Mai Malaika. Yakutumba's naval commander, Ekanda, surrendered on January 30, 2018 to authorities, causing a significant officer loss to the group. Following the counteroffensive, the CNPSC began to lay low and wait for the pressure of the national army to die down. CNPSC activity began again in the summer of 2018, with rebel forces attacking the Namoya mining site on June 24, making off with weapons and supplies. On September 15, the CNPSC attacked the FARDC in Kilembwe, and captured the town. The FARDC responded with a counteroffensive and retook Kilembwe. On December 2, the CNPSC attacked Mboko again and recaptured it. They were pushed out several days later, however. In January of 2019, CNPSC commander Ebu Ela surrendered to the FARDC, but many of his troops joined Yakutumba's militia, which had relocated itself back to its original bases. CNPSC activity had died down throughout much of the first half of 2019, but activity emerged as the coalition entered into conflict with the Ngumino and Twiganeho groups. On July 26, Mai-Mai Malaika kidnapped workers of the Banro mining corporation. Clashes erupted in late 2019 between the CNPSC and Banyamulenge militia groups, particularly around Minembwe. On October 14, the CNPSC launched an attack against the FARDC in Minembwe center, which they had captured that same day. On October 17, the FARDC claimed to have recaptured Minembwe center from the CNPSC, and to have pushed the militia back 40 kilometers. On October 30, the CNPSC attacked the FARDC at Kabeya and killed two FARDC soldiers. Fighting since then has continued, mainly between the CNPSC and Banyamulenge groups in the area.

This was one of the earliest fashion schools and played a role in the development of American fashion by educating over 28,000 students in 68 years of operation.  History  Traphagen School of Fashion was founded in 1923 by Ethel Traphagen Leigh (1883‚Äì1963) with a focus on the foundational concepts of the American design movement. Traphagen School encouraged student experimentation with materials and construction techniques. One of the educational tenants of the Traphagen School of Fashion was a \\"design-by-adaptation\\" method, which included historical research. The school had a large collection of books and historic fashion plates, which was a source of inspiration for student work. The \\"design-by-adaptation\\" method often resulted in the appropriation of fashion in different cultures, including Native American and African American fashion. The semi- quarterly alumni magazine was called Fashion Digest, highlighting industry partnerships, honors and work by alumni. In March 2019, the Museum at Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) hosted a survey exhibition of the school, The Traphagen School: Fostering American Fashion.

He toured Europe. An exhibition catalogue with an introduction by Le Corbusier was produced for his 1929 show in Paris. The Smithsonian has a collection of his color illustrations.https://siris- libraries.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!908936!0  Biography  Kalifala Sidib√© was born in Kankan, French Sudan, in 1900. He had a wife and three children. Without ever being exposed to art, Sidib√© taught himself to paint, using jute sacks and dye from the cotton factory where he worked. He claimed to have been driven to paint by \\"the Devil\\", and was ejected from his tribe for painting. Sidib√© was said to have been discovered by Henri Hirsch, a banker working in French West Africa. Hirsch wrote to politician and publicist Georges Huisman, including photos of Sidib√© and the artwork. Huisman wrote of Sidib√©'s process: > \\"When he commences painting, he hunches down outside his hut at a rickety > table put together with rough planks. An old calendar serves as a drawing > board and surface. He puts the board under the canvas and makes paints > always starting from the left. Sidib√© composes his large canvases in > sections without ever making a sketch or under drawing.\\" Sidib√©'s work was first shown in a group exhibition at the Galerie Georges Bernheim in Paris in October 1929. Though only four pieces sold, Sidib√© received positive feedback. The press focused largely on Sidib√© as an \\"authentic\\" black painter whose style was developed independent of European influence. Sidib√© then exhibited forty-two paintings at Gummensons Konsthall in Stockholm and twenty paintings at the Neue Gallerie in Vienna in 1930, as well as thirty paintings at Galerie Alfred Flechtheim in Berlin in 1931, one year after his death. Modernist architect Le Corbusier saw Sidib√©'s work as neither modern nor traditional. In a note that appeared in the catalogues of both the Gummensons Konsthall and Galerie Alfred Flechtheim exhibitions, he traced the style to Asian influence, writing: > \\"This Negro gives me the impression [of] belonging to some race, which > through Arabia, seems to have been in contact with Persians and Hindus. I > even believe that in the olden days India belonged to the Negro. This > painter is loaded with Asian characteristics, expressed partly through the > tone of his poetry, partly through his style as a painter.\\" Some critics dismissed Sidib√©'s artistry, with one reviewer describing the exhibition of his work in Europe as \\"a war cry from a savage in the middle of an elegant and eloquent discussion\\". Others saw his style as a show of \\"innocence\\" from an African uninfluenced by Western values. Sidib√© died in 1930. His death was mentioned in Beaux-Arts in December 1930. Because he signed his name in Arabic, many of his works are lost.

Chan admitted to Hong Kong authorities that he killed his girlfriend in a hotel room in Taipei, stole her belongings, left her body in the bushes, and flew back to Hong Kong. As the murder happened in Taiwan where they had no jurisdiction, the authorities in Hong Kong could not charge Chan with murder, and could only sentence him on money laundering charges resulting from the killing. Chan could not be extradited to Taiwan either since there is no extradition treaty between Hong Kong and Taiwan. In February 2019, the Hong Kong government cited this case as the rationale for a proposed amendment to the ordinances regarding extradition to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the chief executive, to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty. While the proposed amendment would allow Hong Kong to extradite Chan to Taiwan, concerns over the inclusion of mainland China in the amendment led to the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. As such, the murder case is often cited by the media for ultimately sparking the months-long unrest. Murder in Taiwan According to court documents, the victim Poon Hiu-wing and the accused suspect Chan Tong-kai met in July 2017 while working part-time for the same company. They began an intimate relationship a month later, and by the end of the same year Poon became pregnant. Chan arranged a trip to Taiwan for the two of them in February 2018, paying for the plane tickets and accommodation. Poon told her mother on 8 February that she would be going to Taiwan with a friend until 17 February, but did not divulge the identity of the person accompanying her. On 16 February 2018, the night before the couple were to fly back to Hong Kong, they went to one of Taipei's night markets and bought a pink suitcase there. After they returned to their room in the Purple Garden Hotel in Datong District, they quarrelled over how to pack their belongings into the suitcase they just bought. The quarrel ended with the two making up and having sex, and Poon messaged her mother at 1:21 am of 17 February through WhatsApp that she would be back in Hong Kong later that night. Around 2 am, the two got into another argument, during which Poon revealed the baby she was carrying in her womb was conceived with a former boyfriend, and showed Chan a video of her having sex with another man. Chan reacted with rage and smashed her head against the wall of the hotel room and started strangling her from behind with his hands. They struggled on the floor for around 10 minutes until Poon was dead. Chan then folded her body into the suitcase, packed her belongings, and went to bed. On the morning of 17 February, Chan disposed of Poon's belongings at garbage bins around the hotel‚Äîthough keeping her ATM card, her digital camera, and her iPhone‚Äîand dragged the suitcase (with the body inside) into the Taipei Metro. After a 40-minute ride, he got off at Zhuwei station and dumped the body in the thickets off the trail along the Tamsui River. He tossed the suitcase elsewhere and withdrew NT$20,000 from Poon's account using her password with the intention of doing more shopping in Taiwan. However, he changed his mind and boarded the plane back to Hong Kong that night. Over the next two days, Chan took money from Poon's account three more times, totalling HK$19,200, to pay his credit card bills. Investigation and trial Poon's parents reported her as missing to Hong Kong police on 5 March. They also discovered a copy of Chan's departure and arrival cards for Taiwan identifying the hotel Chan and Poon stayed in. Armed with this information, Poon's father flew to Taipei to file a missing person report and seek help from Purple Garden Hotel. The hotel relayed surveillance footage to the Taipei city police, which showed both Poon and Chan entering the hotel on 16 February but only Chan leaving the next morning, dragging the pink suitcase behind him. Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau contacted counterparts in Hong Kong, who summoned Chan for questioning. Under caution, Chan confessed to killing his girlfriend and revealed where he disposed of the body, upon which the Hong Kong police placed him under arrest on 13 March. On the same day, Taiwanese authorities found Poon's decomposing body after a three-hour search. Even with Chan's confession, the Hong Kong police could not prosecute him on murder or manslaughter since they did not have jurisdiction over crimes committed outside the city under the territorial principle. Instead, Chan was charged with theft and handling stolen goods. The charges were later amended to four counts of money laundering, since the money he withdrew from Poon's account were proceeds of an indictable offence. Chan pled guilty to all four counts, and he was sentenced to 29 months in prison, to be released on 23 October 2019. Separately, authorities in Taiwan sought to lay charges of murder and illegal disposal of a human body on Chan Tong-kai. The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office asked the Hong Kong government for mutual legal assistance three times in the span of six months from mid to late 2018 but received no response. In December 2018, prosecutors in Taipei issued a warrant for Chan, but since Hong Kong and Taiwan had no mutual legal assistance treaty in place, they had to go through political channels to seek assistance from the Hong Kong government to help bring the accused to stand trial in a Taiwanese court. Extradition controversy Organisers estimated nearly two million protesters took to the streets calling for the full withdrawal of the extradition bill on 16 June. Complicating the case was the political situation between Hong Kong and Taiwan, who do not share an extradition treaty. Hong Kong, as a special administrative region of China, could not establish its own treaty with Taiwan since China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and does not recognise the island's government. Hong Kong also did not have any extradition agreements with mainland China as a safeguard between the different legal systems of China and Hong Kong, a former British colony that operates on its own laws derived from English law. This safeguard prevents Hong Kong from handing over accused persons to any part of China, which from China's (and thus Hong Kong's) point of view includes Taiwan. To close this \\"legal loophole\\", the Hong Kong government in February 2019 proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance () and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance () to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the chief executive, to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty. Citing the Chan Tong-kai case in particular, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam mentioned receiving 5 letters from Poon Hiu-wing's parents addressed to her personally seeking justice for their daughter: \\"If you have read these letters from Mr. and Mrs. Poon, you would also feel that we must try to help them.\\" Lam sought to fast-track the proposal with a 20-day public review, described as \\"unusually short\\", and bypass regular legislative processes, explaining that \\"if we act too carefully, and slowly consult society or issue consultation papers, then I am afraid we would not be able to help with this special case.\\" The amendment, which would allow Chan Tong-kai to be brought to Taiwan, would also allow extradition to mainland China. This was of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the Communist Party, thereby eroding the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to sunset the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect. Taipei reacted to the proposed bill with cynicism, with Chiu Chui-cheng, deputy minister of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, questioning whether Hong Kong government's legislation was \\"politically motivated\\" using the homicide case as an \\"excuse\\". The Taiwanese government also stated it would not enter into any extradition agreement with Hong Kong that defined Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China. It opposed the proposed bill on grounds that Taiwanese citizens would be at greater risk of being extradited to Mainland China. Local opposition to the bill grew steadily in Hong Kong. On 9 June, protesters estimated to number from hundreds of thousands to more than a million marched in the streets and called for the bill to be withdrawn and for Chief Executive Carrie Lam to step down. Even with such a showing, the government announced that it would press forward with the second reading of the bill on 12 June.\\"Hong Kong leader presses on with extradition bill, with a few changes\\" .

Time. Retrieved 17 July 2019. Subsequent protests expanded their goals to include demands for investigations on allegations of police brutality and electoral reform, spread to different districts throughout the city, and are still ongoing. On 15 June, Lam announced she would suspend the proposed bill. Ongoing protests called for a complete withdrawal of the bill. On 4 September, after 13 weeks of protests, Lam officially promised to withdraw the bill upon the resumption of the legislative session from its summer recess. On 23 October Secretary for Security John Lee announced the government's formal withdrawal of the bill, coincidentally on the same day as Chan Tong-kai's release from prison. Proposed surrender to Taiwanese authorities Chan Tong-kai (centre) being released from the Pik Uk Correctional Institution on 23 October 2019, accompanied by Reverend Peter Douglas Koon (right) The decision to withdraw the extradition bill leaves Hong Kong authorities few options to send Chan to Taiwan to stand trial. On 18 October, days before Chan was to be released, the Hong Kong government released a statement reiterating that they have no jurisdiction over Chan's alleged crimes in Taiwan, and they have no grounds to extend his sentence, implying that Chan could walk free after his release. On the other hand, the statement said Chan expressed willingness to surrender himself to Taiwanese authorities, and has asked the Hong Kong government to help make the proper arrangements. Taiwan initially refused this arrangement, citing the need to have a judicial assistance agreement with Hong Kong so it can obtain key documents relating to the case. In addition, the Taiwanese government under the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed scepticism at Chan's willingness to surrender, suspecting it to be a Chinese ploy to dilute Taiwan's claim to self-rule by denying it a formal channel to negotiate with Hong Kong. It is suspected that Taiwanese president Tsai Ing- wen, who had long supported the protesters in Hong Kong against the extradition bill, was sensitive to issues relating to sovereignty as the 2020 Taiwan presidential elections drew close. The DPP's response drew fire from the opposition Kuomintang, who accused the Tsai administration for politicising a judicial issue. Hong Kong's authorities dismissed Taiwan's scepticism as \\"nonsense\\". One day before Chan's release, Taiwan reversed its position and offered to take him back, but insisted that he be escorted by Taiwanese officials sent to Hong Kong. This solution would imply more judicial autonomy for Taipei, but the Hong Kong rejected the offer, emphasising Taiwanese officials have no law enforcement power in Hong Kong. On the day of his release on 23 October, Chan apologised to Poon Hui-wing's family and the Hong Kong society in general, obliquely referring to the unrest that he ultimately caused in the city, and asked for forgiveness. Reverend Canon Peter Douglas Koon had purchased tickets to accompany Chan to fly to Taiwan on the day of his release, but they were unable to board the flight due to the timing of his release. As the case became a sensitive political issue, Reverend Koon expressed that Chan would delay his surrender to Taiwan until the presidential elections are over. In the meantime, Taiwan's criminal police department have set up an ad hoc group to handle Chan's case in general, and created a special \\"single window\\" mechanism to process Chan's visa application, his expected arrival, and other related arrangements. With Taiwan closing its borders to non-residents due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chan remains in Hong Kong under police protection he requested.

She was a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Biography  The youngest of five children, Potashin was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. Her parents were Jewish immigrant parents from Eastern Europe. She graduated from Harbord Street Collegiate Institute (now Harbord Collegiate Institute). In 1943, she earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in psychology from the University of Toronto. Potashin continued her graduate studies in psychology at the University of Toronto, earning a master's degree in 1944 and a Ph.D. in 1951. Potashin joined the psychology faculty at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1952, where she would remain until her retirement in 1986. At UBC, Potashin focused mainly on teaching, about which she was passionate. Potashin died in Vancouver on September 15, 2013, two days after her 92nd birthday.  Research  Potashin conducted a number of studies during her graduate studies that were influential in her field of sociometry, a method for measuring and describing social groups. In her master's research (later published in the journal Sociometry), Potashin compared the characteristics of students at a school who were identified as friends, versus those who were not friends. Her results demonstrated that children with close friendships tended to be generally accepted by their classmates, whereas those without friends experienced less acceptance. In the sociometric measure, children without friends tended to identify popular members of their class as their friends (who did not reciprocate their nomination). Potashin also identified two different patterns of social groups: closed cliques (where every member of a group identified every other member as a friend), comprising the most highly accepted members of the class; and a \\"wider spreading\\" type that consisted of students with average levels of peer acceptance, each of whom had friends that they did not necessarily share with their other friends. Potashin also piloted an experimental method for comparing the interactions between friends and between non-friends. In this study, she observed children in conversation (on a specific topic selected by the experimenter), and compared various factors in their discussions, such as the overall length of the discussion and differences between partners' participation in the discussion. Compared to non-friends, friends spoke more freely (requiring less prompting from the experimenter) and for longer periods of time. In 1947 (12 years after the \\"birthdate\\" of sociometry, as described by Jacob L. Moreno), Potashin co- authored, with Mary Louise Northway and Esther Frankel, a monograph reviewing the sociometric research conducted over the previous decade at the University of Toronto.

It was held at various venues across the city during its tenure, including Leeds Polytechnic, the Ace of Clubs, the Continental Club and Brannigan's. In Karl and Beverley Spracklen's book The Evolution of Goth Culture it was described as the space \\"where gothic rock was born in the form it is now\\". The club was foundational in the emergence of the goth subculture and led to other high profile clubs in the scene, such as the Batcave. It was frequented by members of many influential post-punk and gothic rock groups such as the Sisters of Mercy, Gang of Four, The March Violets, New Model Army and Southern Death Cult. History The original members of The Sisters of Mercy met and had their first performance at the F Club in 1980. Concert promoter John Keenan set up the first F Club night in an available commonroom in Leeds Polytechnic in 1977. At the time, club membership cost ¬£1. While here, it hosted performances by acts such as The Slits, XTC, Slaughter & the Dogs and The Psychedelic Furs. However by the end of the summer it was forced to relocate to the Ace of Clubs in Woodhouse. While here, the night was host to groups such as Joy Division, Siouxsie and The Banshees, the Mekons and Gang of Four. In 1978, it moved once again to the Continental Club in Chapeltown, where it hosted the Cure. During this period, performances were less frequent due Eddy Morrison's white power skinheads bringing performances by many non-nationalist groups to a halt. This led to frequent altercations between the attendees of the club and the far-right. Eventually, it relocated to the basement of Brannigan's underneath Leeds railway station, where it changed its name to Fan Club, due to a Levellers leaflet claiming the \\"F\\" stood for \\"fascist\\". It was here that Andrew Eldritch and Gary Marx, who would go on to be the founding lineup of The Sisters of Mercy first met. In 1981, The March Violets played their first performance at the venue, followed by the Sisters of Mercy's first performance. Bands such as Soft Cell, New Model Army, The Danse Society, Skeletal Family and Southern Death Cult also formed at the club during this period. On the third and fourth of October 2007, the New Roscoe hosted thirtieth anniversary performance for the club. On 18 August 2018, the Brudenell Social Club hosted forty-first anniversary reunion show for the former members of the club.

It was first performed at Teatro San Cassiano in Venice for the carnival in 1706. It was possibly one of the earliest operas written on the subject of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, and the first in Italian. Performance history The original cast was Nicol√≤ Grimaldi (Ambleto), Maria Domenica Pini (Veremonda), Lorenzo Santorini (Fengone), Maria Maddalena Bonavia (Gerilda), Vittoria Costa (Ildegarde), Pasqualino Betti (Valdemaro) and Domenico Fontani (Siffrido). The opera was performed in Italian at the Haymarket Theatre, London in 1712. A bilingual libretto produced by Jacob Tonson was published at the same time, and a collection of songs from the opera later in the year. Shakespeare‚Äôs Hamlet Zeno and Pariati did not claim to have used Shakespeare‚Äôs work as their source, and the libretto they created tells a story somewhat different to the English drama. Their stated source is the 13th-century Gesta Danorum, which Shakespeare had used for Hamlet. The central idea of the prince feigning madness to exact revenge is retained. However the theme of incest does not appear in Gasparini‚Äôs work, and the ghost of Ambleto‚Äôs father likewise does not appear. The prince does not stab the king to death as he does in Shakespeare‚Äôs play, but makes him captive and sentences him to death.

Religion has been claimed to be \\"the source of some of the most remarkable political mobilizations of our times\\".  Religious political doctrines  Various political doctrines have been directly influenced or inspired by religions. Various strands of Political Islam exist, with most of them falling under the umbrella term of Islamism. Graham Fuller has argued for a broader notion of Islamism as a form of identity politics, involving \\"support for [Muslim] identity, authenticity, broader regionalism, revivalism, [and] revitalization of the community.\\"Fuller, Graham E., The Future of Political Islam, Palgrave MacMillan, (2003), p. 21 This may often take a socially conservative or reactionary from, as in wahhabism and salafism. Ideologies espousing Islamic modernism include Islamic socialism and Post- Islamism. Christian political movements range from Christian socialism, Christian communism, and Christian anarchism the left, to Christian democracy on the centre, to the Christian right. Beyond universalist ideologies, religions have also been involved in nationalist politics. Hindu nationalism exists in the Hindutva movement. Religious Zionism seeks to create a religious Jewish state. The Khalistan movement aims to create a homeland for Sikhs. An extreme form of religious political action is religious terrorism. Islamic terrorism has been evident in the actions of the Islamic State, Boko Haram, Taliban and Al-Qaeda, all paraticioners of jihadism. Christian terrorism has been connected to anti-abortion violence and white supremacy, for example in the Christian Identity movement. Saffron terror describes terrorism connected Hinduism. There has also been cases of Jewish religious terrorism, such as the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, as well as of Sikh terrorism, such as the bombing of Air India Flight 182.  Religious political issues  Religious political issues may involve, but are not limited to, those concerning freedom of religion, applications of religious law, and the right to religious education.  Religion and the state  States have adopted various attitudes towards religions, ranging from theocracy to state atheism. A theocracy is \\"government by divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided\\". Modern day recognised theocracies include the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Holy See, while the Taleban and Islamic State are insurgencies attempting to create such polities. Historical examples include the Islamic Caliphates and the Papal States. Map of states with official religions. A more modest form of religious state activity is having an official state religion. Unlike a theocracy, this maintains the superiority of the state over the religious authorities. Over 20% (a total of 43) of the countries in the world have a state religion, most of them (27) being Muslim countries. There are also 13 officially Buddhist countries such as Bhutan, while state churches are present in 27 countries. In contrast to religious states, secular states recognise no religion. This is often called the principle of the separation of church and state. A more extreme version, La√Øcit√©, is practiced in France and in Turkey, which prohibits all religious expressions in many public contexts. Some states are explicitly atheistic, usually those which were produced by revolution, such as various socialist states or the French First Republic. There have also been cases of states creating their own religions, such as imperial cults or the Cult of Reason.  Debates about religion in politics  There have been arguments for and against a role for religion in politics. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has argued that \\"faith and state should be kept separate\\" as \\"the most sinister and oppressive states in the world are those that use God to control the minds and actions of their populations\\", such as Iran and Saudi Arabia. To this, Dawn Foster has responded that \\"when religion is fully unmoored from politics it becomes all the more insular and more open to abuse\\".

His compositions included several operas, numerous romances, sacred music, and a sonata for harp. He taught singing at the Conservatoire de Paris and was the ma√Ætre de chapelle to the courts of Louis Bonaparte in Holland and Louis XVIII in France. From 1812 to 1815 he was also the singing master and stage director of the Paris Op√©ra. Plantade was born in Pontoise and died in Paris at the age of 75. His elder son, Charles-Fran√ßois Plantade, was also a composer. Life and career Plantade was born in Pontoise, a suburb of Paris. According to his obituary in Le M√©nestrel, he came from a noble family whose origins were in Languedoc. Plantade began his musical training in singing and the cello at the age of eight when he entered the school for pages in the Musique du roi, the King's personal troupe of musicians. He went on to study singing and composition with Honor√© Langl√©, piano with Nicolas-Joseph H√ºllmandel, and the harp with Francesco Petrini. On completing his studies Plantade became a singing teacher and began publishing collections of romances which brought him to the attention of a wider public. One of those songs, \\"Te bien aimer √¥ ma ch√®re Z√©lie\\", had an extraordinary success in its day. According to F√©tis it sold more than 20,000 copies following its publication in 1791 and remained popular for many years. His early success led to his appointment as singing master at Henriette Campan's newly established school for girls at Saint-Germain-en- Laye. The first of Plantade's ten operas, Les deux S≈ìurs, premiered in 1792 at the Th√©√¢tre Feydeau. He would continue composing throughout his career in parallel with his duties as a professor of singing and ma√Ætre de chapelle to the courts of Louis Bonaparte in Holland and Louis XVIII and Charles X in France. Plantade taught singing at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1799 to 1807, 1815 to 1816, and 1818 to 1828. Amongst his students there were the future opera singers Laure Cinti-Damoreau, Louise Dabadie, and Augustine Albert. One of his singing pupils at Henriette Campan's school had been Hortense de Beauharnais. When her husband, Louis Bonaparte, became the King of Holland in 1807, he was appointed ma√Ætre de chapelle to the Dutch court and served in that position until the king's abdication in 1810. From 1812 to 1815 he served as the singing master and stage director of the Paris Op√©ra, and in 1816 he succeeded Persuis as ma√Ætre de chapelle to Louis XVIII. During his time as ma√Ætre de chapelle at the French court, Plantade largely dedicated himself to composing sacred music, producing masses performed at Saint-Denis and a Te Deum and Salve Regina performed in the Reims Cathedral for the coronation of Charles X in May 1825. He retired definitively from the Conservatoire in 1828 and with the July Revolution of 1830 lost all his royal positions. He retired to Batignolles where his last years were marred by financial difficulties and a grave illness which lasted three years and led to his death in Paris at the age of 75. Plantade's funeral, attended by many of his former pupils and artists of the Paris Op√©ra, was held at Notre-Dame-de- Lorette in Paris followed by interment in P√®re-Lachaise cemetery. Plantade and his wife Marguerite Louise Bataille had two sons, the elder of whom was Charles-Fran√ßois Plantade (1787‚Äì1870), a composer and founding member of the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire. Compositions Cover of Plantade's Trois Nouveaux Nocturnes. The words are by his son Charles- Fran√ßois Plantade. Published c. 1820, the work is dedicated to their friend Louis-Emmanuel Jadin. Vocal music Plantade published multiple pieces of secular vocal music‚Äîtwenty collections of romances for solo voice and three collections of nocturnes for two voices. He also composed Sc√®ne lyrique imit√©e d'Ossian, a cantata based on the Ossian poems, which was performed at the Paris Op√©ra in 1814 to mark the restoration of Louis XVIII as King of France. The king was so pleased by the work that he awarded Plantade the L√©gion d'honneur in January 1815. Plantade's sacred music included five masses, a Te Deum and Salve Regina, several motets and a Requiem performed in 1823 to mark the 30th anniversary of Marie-Antoinette's death. The Requiem was recorded in 2016 by Herv√© Niquet and the ensemble Le Concert Spirituel. Niquet described the work as \\"brimming over with emotion‚Ä¶ but also one of ineffable gentleness, unspeakable brutality and respectful sweetness, which left us speechless after the final chords.\\" Operas *Les deux S≈ìurs (opera in 1 act), libretto by ; premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, 22 May 1792 *Les souliers mordor√©s (opera in 2 acts), libretto by Alexandre de Ferri√®re; premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, 18 May 1793 *Au plus brave la plus belle (opera in 1 act, m√™l√©√© de chants), libretto by Louis Philipon de La Madelaine; premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre des Amis de la Patrie, 5 October 1794 *Palma ou Le voyage en Gr√®ce (opera in 2 acts), libretto by Pierre-√âdouard L√©montey, premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, 22 August 1797 *Romagnesi (opera in 1 act), libretto by Pierre-√âdouard Lemontey; premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, 3 September 1799 *Zo√© ou La pauvre petite (opera in 1 act, m√™l√©√© de chants), libretto by Jean-Nicolas Bouilly; premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, 3 July 1800 *Le roman (opera in 1 act), libretto by √âtienne Gosse; premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, 12 November 1800 *Lisez Plutarque (opera in 1 act), libretto by ; premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre Montansier, October 1800 *Bayard √† la fert√© ou Le si√®ge de M√©zi√®res (opera in 1 act), libretto by Marc-Antoine Madeleine D√©saugiers and Michel-Joseph Gentil de Chavagnac; premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, 3 October 1811 *Le mari de circonstance (opera in 1 act), libretto by Eug√®ne de Planard; premiered Paris, Th√©√¢tre Feydeau, 18 March 1813 *Blanche de Castille (opera in 1 act), with Fran√ßois-Antoine Habeneck, libretto by Pierre-Ange Vieillard; composed for the Paris Op√©ra but never performed Students Plantade's students at the Conservatoire de Paris included: *Augustine Albert *Laure Cinti-Damoreau *Louise Dabadie *Marie-Julie Halligner *Jean-Fran√ßois Hennekindt *Constance Jawureck *Jean-√âtienne-Auguste Massol References External links *Scores by Charles-Henri Plantade on the International Music Score Library Project * Category:1764 births Category:1839 deaths Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:French opera composers Category:Academics of the Conservatoire de Paris Category:People from Pontoise Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Category:Chevaliers of the L√©gion d'honneur ","title":"Charles-Henri Plantade"},{"id":"62473772","text":"Operation Guava is the code name for a long-term British Security Service (MI5) operation.

Name The book sources and government reports all refer to the case as \\"Operation Guava\\". Some contemporaneous (2010‚Äì2012) news reports refer to a \\"Christmas plot\\" or \\"London Stock Exchange bombing.\\" Other press reports (2012‚Äì2019) use the \\"Operation Guava\\" moniker. Plot Aside from bombing of the London Stock Exchange, the plotters planned the establishment of a jihadist training camp in Azad Kashmir on land owned by one of the suspects, Usman Khan. The plotters were monitored by covert listening device and found to be engaged in Holocaust denial by claiming that fewer than 100,000 Jews died in the Holocaust. Other targets included: the U.S. Embassy in London, two rabbis each from a separate synagogue, the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, and Boris Johnson; the plotters had procured their addresses. All the conspirators envisioned returning experienced, together with future recruits, from their Kashmiri training camp to execute terror attacks in the UK The conspirators further recce'd several additional targets, including the Big Ben, the London Eye, and Westminster Abbey.\\"The gang had carried out surveillance of other possible targets including Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and the London Eye\\" https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/30/named-pictured-london-bridge-attacker- convicted-terrorist-11244497/ The terrorist network was composed of individuals from Birmingham, Cardiff, East London, and Stoke-on-Trent. The main focus of the East London group was to attack targets in the UK The most active was the Stoke group, which had as primary goal to set up the terrorist camp to be disguised as a madrassa, though bombing pubs in Stoke was also discussed. The Stoke cell was described by the prosecution as having \\"well developed\\" field craft, and being concerned about being arrested on account of the other groups' naivet√©. The Stoke group's sophistication disturbed authorities the most. Convictions The conspirators were arrested in December 2010; all nine network members pled guilty and eight were convicted of engaging in preparation for acts of terrorism. Three of the nine (Mohammad Shahjahan, Nazam Hussein, and Usman Khan), all from Stoke, were given indefinite prison terms, on account of being considered \\"more dangerous than the others\\". Nonetheless, an appellate judge determined that this characterisation was \\"unfair\\" and their sentences were reduced to between 16 and 17 years' prison each. Mohammad Shahjahan had previously been featured in a 2010 documentary produced by the BBC about people called Mohammed, on which he was presented as a former Muslims4UK member. Usman Khan later on went on to take part in a Cambridge University rehabilitation programme where he was considered a \\"poster boy for Britain's anti-radicalisation strategy\\" and later yet perpetrated the 2019 London Bridge stabbing, when he injured three women (one fatally) and two men (one fatally). The 'lynchpin' of the plot was Mohammed Chowdury, also spelled Chowdhury.

The carol is about the Nativity of Jesus. It is not known when \\"The Sinner's Redemption\\" was first created, though it was mentioned as having been sung in the 1630s in a broadside newspaper and was regularly reprinted by them.  Background  Professor Peter Davidson of Oxford University claimed that the carol was written by Anna Alcox in the 1650s, but her name was not attributed to it as she was from a family of Catholic recusants; she was also six years old at the time of writing and was under the age of legal responsibility. The oldest written copy of the carol was found in 1709 under the title \\"The Sinner's Redemption, The Nativity of our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ, With His Life on Earth, and Precious Death on the Cross\\", in an undated collection by Thomas Deloney. In 1861, in his \\"A Garland of Christmas Carols\\", John Camden Hotten called it \\"this rude old carol\\" and stated it was a favourite of the peasantry. He also noted the regular reprints by broadsides. Contents The 1709 copy of the carol has 28 verses, but the last 12 would often be omitted. The word \\"mirth\\" used in the carol was intended to represent Christian religious joy in celebrating the birth of Jesus rather than \\"boisterous merriment\\". \\"The Sinner's Redemption\\" was also viewed to have inspired the Irish \\"Wexford Carol\\", as five of the six verses of the latter carol were based on \\"The Sinner's Redemption\\".

Her mother always supported her in her aspirations. However, after finishing her secondary education, Tamayo could not attend the Superior Police School since women were not yet admitted to the institution, so she opted for her second passion, technology, and entered the National Polytechnic School as a systems engineering major. Police career Two years later, Tamayo left the program after the National Police began to admit women, receiving 700 applicants, of which 32 were selected. She was part of the first women's class in 1983. After graduating, she and her companions were assigned to research units with more administrative positions, in areas such as migration, where she spent four years. After this she moved to Urban Service in the Immediate Assistance Posts (PAI). Tamayo has held positions in the National Traffic Directorate, National Education Directorate, and General Personnel Directorate, among others. She aspired to be part of the Intelligence and Rescue Group (GIR), but was unable to as it did not admit women. Throughout her police career she has received 20 decorations for effective work.

Biography Born in Cirebon, Tan was the eldest son of Ong Hwie Nio and Tan Tjin Kie, Majoor-titulair der Chinezen, the head administrator of the Chinese community of Cirebon (1852‚Äì1919). Through his father, Tan was a grandson, great-grandson and great-great-grandson of previous Kapiteins der Chinezen of his hometown of Cirebon. Their family was deeply embedded in the Chinese officership, which consisted of the ranks of Majoor, Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen, and was an arm of the colonial civil bureaucracy through which the Dutch governed their Chinese subjects in the Indies. Tan had a brother, Tan Gin Han, and a sister, Tan Ho Lie Nio. He was a native Malay speaker, like most Peranakan Chinese, but his writings show that his education gave him both some familiarity with the Chinese Classics and fluency ‚Äì at least in writing ‚Äì in Dutch. He also had a keen interest in Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism and theosophy. In 1897, at the tender age of 17, Tan Gin Ho was raised to the post of Luitenant der Chinezen, serving under his father. From 1907 until 1909, Luitenant Tan Gin Ho was on leave from active duty, and was temporarily replaced by his brother-in-law, Luitenant Kwee Tjong In. Tan resigned from his post for good in 1913. In 1914, Tan‚Äôs brother, Tan Gin Han, bought a Fiat Landaulet Torpedo, a luxurious six-meter car, from the car importer firm Verweij en Lugard‚Äôs Automobiel Maatschappij. Supposedly the most expensive car in Java at the time, this acquisition triggered an interest in car ownership in Tan‚Äôs extended family, including their cousins, the Kwee family of Ciledug. Soon after his father, the Majoor-titulair, died in 1919, Luitenant Tan Gin Ho wrote a highly popular commemorative book, Peringetan dari Wafatnja Majoor Tan Tjin Kie (Batavia, 1919). This, Tan‚Äôs best-known work, details the days leading to his father‚Äôs death, the funeral arrangements and ceremonies, as well as the messages of condolences and visiting dignitaries. It is illustrated with photographs from the private family collection, showing the lavish world of the Tan family of Cirebon in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. A newspaper article from 1919 put the estimated total costs of the late Majoor‚Äôs funeral and mausoleum at 580,000 guilders ‚Äì in today‚Äôs currency (2019), a multimillion-US dollar sum. Tan‚Äôs book proved a kind of eulogy to his family‚Äôs status as the preeminent and oldest dynasty of the Cabang Atas in the Residency of Cirebon. The Great War (1914‚Äì1918) and the subsequent sugar crisis had a ruinous impact on their finances. The colonial government, moreover, imposed a massive, war profit tax of one million guilders on the family. In 1922, Luitenant Tan Gin Ho and his brother, Tan Gin Han, filed a bankruptcy petition, and were forced to sell Loewoenggadjah ‚Äì one of Java‚Äôs largest, Chinese-owned sugar mills that had been founded in 1828 by their great-grandfather, Kapitein Tan Kim Lim. In 1931, the Luitenant and his brother were declared bankrupt. Luitenant Tan Gin Ho's first published work was a re-adaptation of a European hagiographic work on Napoleon, Emperor of the French. For the rest of the 1930s and early 1940s, he authored, translated and readapted books on literature, history, religion and astrology. The former Luitenant died in Cirebon in 1941.

Goldman (March 27, 1856 ‚Äì January 25, 1922), also known as Billy Goldman, was an American commercial photographer based in Reading, Pennsylvania. A freemason and pillar of the community, Goldman photographed the citizens of Reading but also secretly assembled a collection of photographs of the prostitutes of Sallie Shearer's brothel, which was near his studio. His brothel photographs were apparently known only to Goldman and his subjects and, as far as is known, were not sold or published during his lifetime. They were mounted in albums where they remained until the early 21st century when they were acquired by Robert Flynn Johnson, a historian of photography, who published them in 2018. They have been described as offering insights into the costume and interior decoration of the period as well as the social conditions of working-class women for some of whom prostitution was seen as preferable to poorly-paid factory or shop work where they often faced demands for sex from their superiors.\\"Preface\\" by Ruth Rosen in Johnson, pp. 13-22 (pp. 18‚Äì19).

At the same time as photographing the respectable citizens of Reading, Goldman also secretly assembled a collection of mostly nude and semi-nude photographs of the prostitutes at Sallie Shearer's brothel on the corner of North 8th and Walnut streets in Reading, only a ten-minute walk from his studio on Penn Street.Johnson, pp. 37-38. There were at least two other brothels on Walnut street: Flo Wilson's at 1021 and Effie Brownwell's at 1021 1/2. Reading was a fast-expanding city in the late 19th century, its growth spurred by the arrival of the railway that brought workers and businessmen in and with a hierarchy of places where sex could be purchased. At the bottom end were the streetwalkers who congregated at the railway station or saloons and transacted business wherever they could, and at the top were the higher class \\"parlor houses\\" like Shearer's for those who could afford them; so-called because men were entertained in the parlour on arrival while they chose from the women of the house.Johnson, pp. 33-34. Brothels were euphemistically known as \\"resorts\\" or \\"ranches\\" by the press and the women who worked in them as \\"inmates.\\"\\"Midnight Raid on a \\"Ranche\\" \\" Reading Times, October 8, 1883, p. 1.

The finest velvet carpets cover the floors, beautiful mirrors adorn the walls and the rooms are beautifully decorated.\\"Johnson, pp. 32-33. Goldman's collection, which has been compared to that of E. J. Bellocq in New Orleans, was found by Robert Flynn Johnson around 2010 in the stock of a postcard dealer at a fair in Concord, California. He initially bought only two photographs before visiting the dealer at her home in the Sierra Foothills and gradually purchasing the rest of the collection. The dealer told him that the photographs had been bought by her late husband at a gun show in Cincinnati, Ohio, and had originally been mounted in albums from which they had been removed. Johnson was able to place and approximately date the photographs because one showed a woman reading a copy of the Reading Eagle dated August 14, 1892. Others showed women inspecting the photographs in the original albums.Johnson, pp. 25-26. After research in Reading and consulting local historians, Johnson was able to identify Goldman as the photographer. As well as many nude and semi-nude images of Shearer's employees, the collection also includes images of the women carrying out daily activities, a set of nudes of a man in athletic and action poses who is described as a customer,Johnson, pp. 38, 88-91. three images of a black woman,Johnson, pp. 64-65. a pregnant woman,Johnson, p. 82. and a nude photograph of Goldman that may be a self-portrait.Johnson, pp. 24 & 35.

With one exception, the women are all white, there being separate houses employing black women such as Harry Weaver's \\"Mahogany Hall\\" at 729 North Twelfth.\\"Bawdy Houses Raided: Arrests Made by the Police in an Effort to Lessen the Number of Resorts\\", August 19, 1898, Reading Times, p. 1. Retrieved from newspapers.com January 13, 2020. While some of the pictures appear to have been taken at Shearer's house, others include props, sets, and costumes characteristic of a professional photographic studio such as the set of images showing a crescent moon and others in which women are shown draped like Greek goddesses or praying. Johnson searched archives in Pennsylvania and found no evidence that the images were distributed, nor does he believe that they were used as a catalogue for male customers as the high turnover of women in an establishment like Shearer's made that impractical. It is notable throughout how relaxed the women are in front of the camera, indicating that they were in the presence of someone they trusted, although some hide their faces. The images have been described as offering insights into fashion and interior decoration towards the end of the nineteenth century. Dennita Sewell has commented on the elaborate variety of undergarments on show such as stockings, petticoats, and corsets, the removal of which was part of a striptease performed for the camera and the customer but which, while typical of those worn by respectable middle-class women of the period, were far more expensive than working-class women could normally afford.\\"Layers of Seduction\\" by Dennita Sewell in Johnson, pp. 47-48. The photographs also suggest that Goldman was aware of contemporary social debates such as in the image of a nude, and possibly pregnant, woman resting her hand on John Cowan's book The Science of a New Life (1869), in which Cowan argued that women should have control over their own fertility and equal rights to men.Cowan, John. (1869) The Science of a New Life. New York: Fowler & Wells. pp. 380-381.

When complete, they are about across.Lerner and Kossak, 48‚Äì50; V&A.; They may also be called \\"ring stones\\" or \\"ring-stones\\" Their purpose, and any practical function, remains unclear and \\"enigmatic\\". They may have a specific religious purpose, or a more general one promoting fertility, or been used to make jewellery by pressing metal foil over the designs.Lerner and Kossak, 48 (quoted); Bennett (2019), 99; V&A; About 70 have been found,Bennett (2017) many only as fragments, with a 2014 find in Thailand the first from outside the Indian subcontinent; it is assumed this was imported from India.Bennett (2019), 95; Bennett (2017) Ringstones were first noticed by Alexander Cunningham, who published one in the late 19th century. By the time of S.P. Gupta's survey of 1980, at least 32 ringstones and 36 discstones were recorded; the numbers have continued to rise.Bennett (2019), 95 Decoration The designs vary, but all examples are finely carved, despite their small size. A number of components appear in a variety of variations. Typically the innermost zone, which runs down the sloping sides of the hole, has four standing female figures, usually nude \\"with fully exposed genitalia\\" and heels together, but with jewellery and elaborate hairstyles, with trees in between them.Lerner and Kossak, 48; Bennett (2019), 96 (quoted) These may be called \\"goddesses\\", or \\"mother goddesses\\", and the trees, apparently of various species, may be described as the tree of life, but these interpretations are not universally accepted.Lerner and Kossak, 48; V&A; Bennett (2019), 96; Siudmak; Both the first two have decided that the hairstyles are wigs. The example in the Cleveland Museum of Art, where the three pairs of female figures have wide skirts, then has a cable or rope pattern border, then a zone of animals in profile, with their feet on the inside. After another rope border there is a circle of \\"cross-and-reel\\" motifs, then a final rope border before a plain and smooth outer zone. This is more elaborate than most examples, which are often similar, but without the animal zone.Lerner and Kossak, 48 The example found in Thailand has an animal zone but no \\"cross-and-reel\\" one,Bennett (2017) whereas those in the V&A; and British Museum each have two of them, but no animals. In one example the animals are \\"lizards or crocodiles\\".Siudmak A somewhat similar ivory disc with a hole only has the standing figures in its single zone. It is dated to the 2nd century BCE.Ball File:Clevelandart 1977.36 (cropped).jpgComplete example in the Cleveland Museum of Art (detail above) File:MauryanRingstone.JPGGoddesses and plants, British Museum.British Museum page File:MET 264860.jpgMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York, with \\"Goddesses and Palm Trees\\".Lerner and Kossak, 49, no. 3 Purpose Discstone, 1st century BCE, Metropolitan Museum of Art.Lerner and Kossak, 50‚Äì51, no. 7 Various purposes and uses for ringstones have been proposed, but without any gaining general acceptance. One suggestion is that they were matrices for moulding by beating thin sheets of metal, probably gold foil, as jewellery, which has always been important in Indian culture, but has very few survivals from ancient times.Bennett (2019), 83‚Äì87, 99 Though not liked by some scholars,Lerner and Kossak, 48; V&A; this theory may have gained some ground with the 2014 find in Thailand, which was found near fragments of thin gold foil, one of which had an animal pattern very similar to that on the ringstone.Bennett (2019), 99; Bennett (2017) It is agreed that the ringstones themselves are too heavy to have been worn, although this had been suggested by Ananda Coomaraswamy. They may have been objects for use in meditation,Lerner and Kossak, 48; Bennett (2017) or it has been suggested they were used as a \\"physical contraceptive device\\",Bennett (2017) (no details given as to how this might work) or somehow connected with fertility.Lerner and Kossak, 48; V&A; Some examples have brief and informal inscriptions on the blank bottom, which have mostly not yet yielded their meaning.Bennett (2019), 104-105 Geographical range Apart from the recent Thai find, the findspots range (like Mauryan territory) across north India, from Taxila in the Punjab (now Pakistan) in the north-west to Patna, Bihar in the east; most have been found in urban centres on the Grand Trunk Road, such as these.Bennett (2019), 95; V&A; Bennett (2017) As they are easily portable, and have very consistent characteristics, they may all have been made in a single centre, for which Pataliputra (now Patna), the capital of the successive Mauryan and Sunga empires, is one obvious candidate.V&A; Discstones The ringstone seems to have developed into the discstone, which is similar in shape, but with a flat top with a plain circular space in the middle, rather than an actual hole. They are also in stone, but not quite as precisely carved, with mostly plant- based decoration that is not divided in narrow circular zones in the same way. The example illustrated has relatively simple decoration, with narrow tendril- like elements. Discstones are usually dated to the 1st century BCE.Lerner and Kossak, 50‚Äì52 A discstone was recently found in Myanmar.Bennett (2019), 99 Collections The largest collection of ringstones is in the Patna Museum,Bennett (2017), 95 and other large Indian museums have examples. Several major museums outside India have examples, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art (3), Cleveland Museum of Art, British Museum (2), Berlin State Museums, Victoria and Albert Museum in London (the only example with a provenance, from Taxila), and LACMA.Bennett (2019), 96‚Äì98, 100‚Äì101 (with photos) A number are in private collections, and at least three have been on the art market in the 2010s.Bennett (2019), 101 (all with John Siudmak) Notes References *\\"Ball\\", \\"Unidentified Artist, Northeast Indian (Sunga Dynasty)\\", David Owsley Museum of Art Collection, Ball State University (Ivory ring) *Bennett, Anna (2017), \\"Sunga ringstone found in Thailand\\"; photos of lecture slides *Bennett, Anna (2019), \\"Suvarnabhumi, \\"Land of Gold\\"\\", in Suvarnabhumi, the Golden Land, 2019, GISDA, PDF *Lerner, Martin and Kossak, Steven, The Lotus Transcendent: Indian and Southeast Asian Art from the Samuel Eilenberg Collection, 1991, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), , 9780870996139, google books *Siudmak, John, Catalogue No. 5, \\"Indian and Himalayan Sculpture\\", 2016, Calalogue No. 2, *\\"V&A;\\": \\"Ring stone\\" in collection Further reading *Gupta, S.P., The Roots of Indian Art: Detailed Study of the Formative Period of Indian Art & Architecture ‚Äì 3rd & 2nd Century BC, 1980 (includes a survey of all examples then known) *Irwin, J., \\"Late Mauryan or early Sunga ring-stones\\", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, April 1951, pp.1‚Äì3 Category:Mauryan art Category:Shunga Empire Category:Indian sculpture Category:Hardstone carving ","title":"Ringstone"},{"id":"62474119","text":"Coelopina is a genus of kelp flies in the family Coelopidae.

It is a small, erect shrub, with softly pointed, green diamond shaped leaves, and white tubular flowers that form a dense spherical group. Epacris corymbiflora is endemic to Australia‚Äôs island state of Tasmania and found in heath and coastal vegetation communities.  Description  Small shrub that grows to a height of 10-40cm, with spreading branches. Leaves lie close to the stem and are diamond shaped, green above and below, with a few relatively parallel veins. Flowers are narrow, white and tubular, with brown, shining bracts and sepals. Flowers are in corymbs on short stalks and form a dense spherical group. Fruits are small capsules. Epacris corymbiflora grows well in containers or pots due to its‚Äô excellent capacity as a dwarf species. The seed of some strains exhibits a dormancy stage that is reportedly overcome by storage in a dark place for 3-6 months. If using the bog method, seed should be spread over the surface of the propagation mixture. If such medium is kept constantly moist, germination should occur within 10-20 weeks.  Taxonomy and naming  Epacris corymbiflora, is in the heath family, Ericaceae and Australian subfamily, Epacridoideae. Epacris stems from the Greek terms ‚Äòepi‚Äô meaning upon, and ‚Äòakros‚Äô meaning the top. Corymbiflora comes from the term ‚Äòcorymb‚Äô, which describes flower clusters that have proportionally longer lower stalks, forming flowers of a flat or slightly convex head. The origin of ‚Äòcorymb‚Äô around the early 18th century, is either French, from the word corymbe; or Latin, from corymbus, which stemmed from the Greek word korumbos, meaning ‚Äòcluster‚Äô. Epacris corymbiflora was known from at least 1860.Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, Erebus (Ship), Sir James Clark Ross, Flora Tasmaniae (Reeve Brothers, 1860) p261.  Distribution and habitat  Found in heath and coastal vegetation communities. The habitat of Epacris corymbiflora includes wet peaty heaths, near the west and south west coasts, particularly the Rasselas Valley. Requires moist, light to medium soils, rich in organic matter and prefers dappled shade. This species can tolerate exposed and windy conditions, with high moisture levels. It is also able to withstand clay or peaty soils, of poor drainage and quality.

Examples of invasive tests include biopsy, excision, cryotherapy, and endoscopy.  Invasive versus non-invasive tests  The major difference between invasive and non-invasive tests is that invasive tests are done by cutting or entering a body part using medical instruments, whereas non-invasive tests do not require breaking the skin or entering the body. Non-invasive tests include deep palpation, x-rays, and checking blood pressure. Examples * Cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure that allows physicians to examine the heart of a patient. During this procedure, a physician measures the pressure inside the heart, evaluates arteries delivering blood to the heart, and observes how well the heart is pumping. * Balloon angioplasty is an invasive test that helps to treat any blockage present in the coronary arteries. A catheter with a small balloon is inserted into the blocked artery and dilated to open the artery that supplies the heart muscle with blood. * An atherectomy is an invasive procedure performed for removing atherosclerosis from blood vessels within the body. The narrowed arteries are widened by inserting a catheter carrying a device such as a rotating drill or a cutter into the artery. * Placement of a coronary stent (a cylinder of wire mesh that is placed in a previously blocked artery to ensure that it stays open) is an invasive medical procedure. It is usually placed by a catheter (tube).  Equipment  Scalpels are used in some common invasive procedures. There are various types of equipment used for performing invasive procedures, with each instrument's shape and size depending on what body part needs surgery. Some instruments are hand-held tools and are made of carbon steel, aluminum, or titanium which are used by skilled physicians to perform surgical tasks. Commonly used medical equipment includes scalpels, forceps, scissors, clamps, and retractors. Some surgical procedures require a specific set of equipment. For example, in some orthopedic surgery cases, bone saws, files, mallets, and drills are required.  Medical application of invasive tests  Invasive tests have numerous applications in the field of dentistry, prenatal testing, cancer diagnosis, neurology, cosmetic surgery, etc. because they provide opportunities for doctors to diagnose and treat different kinds of diseases.  Safety of patient during an invasive procedure  In order to perform an invasive test or surgery it is important that the procedure, as with any medical procedure, should be performed in a sterile environment, such as a well-equipped operating room or intensive care unit. Careful attention must be given to the timing of procedures. Early diagnosis will result in more effective treatment and will save both the patient and the hospital time and money. Careful monitoring of the patient is necessary such as checking their heart rate and blood pressure as well as their mental status before and after the procedure.  Drawbacks  There are many drawbacks of invasive procedures, which include increased patient discomfort, increased wound care, and longer healing periods. Use of invasive diagnostic techniques in the case of pregnant mothers increases the chances of abortion and mental stress.Cheston B. Cunha, Burke A.

The regiment is part of the Italian army's army aviation and operationally assigned to the Army Aviation Brigade.  History   Formation  During the 1975 Army reform the army reorganized its aviation units and for the first time created aviation units above battalion level. On 1 February 1976 the 1st Army Light Aviation Grouping \\"Antares\\" was raised at Viterbo Airport to take command of the aviation units based there. After its activation the grouping was structured as follows: * 30px 1st Army Light Aviation Grouping \\"Antares\\", at Viterbo Airport ** 11th Medium Transport Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Ercole\\" *** Command and Services Squadron *** 111th Medium Transport Helicopters Squadron (CH-47C Chinook helicopters) *** 112th Medium Transport Helicopters Squadron (CH-47C Chinook helicopters) ** 12th Medium Transport Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Gru\\" (formed 12 October 1977) *** Command and Services Squadron *** 121st Medium Transport Helicopters Squadron (CH-47C Chinook helicopters) *** 122nd Medium Transport Helicopters Squadron (CH-47C Chinook helicopters) ** 51st Multirole Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Leone\\" *** Command and Services Squadron *** 511th Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 512th Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 513th Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 514th Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters)  Naming  Since the 1975 army reform Italian army aviation units are named for celestial objects: groupings, and later regiments, are numbered with a single digit and named for stars in the 88 modern constellationss. Accordingly an army aviation regiment's coat of arms highlights the name-giving star within its constellation. Squadron groups were numbered with two digits and named for constellations, or planets of the Solar System. The 1st Army Light Aviation Grouping was named for Antares the brightest star in the Scorpius () constellation. When the army raised army aviation support regiments in 1996 they were named in relation to the regiment they supported, and therefore the 1st Antares' support regiment was named 4th Army Aviation Support Regiment \\"Scorpione\\". With the decree 173 from 14 March 1977 the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone granted the grouping a newly created war flag, which has since been awarded one Military Order of Italy for the regiment's service with the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, one Military Order of Italy for the regiment's international operations between 1991 and 2016, one Silver Medal of Army Valour for the regiment's service after the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, and one Silver Cross of Army Merit for the regiment's service with the United Nations Operation in Somalia I and the United Nations Operation in Somalia II.  Events  1st Army Aviation Regiment \\"Antares\\" CH-47F Chinook helicopter in the Dolomites On 25 June 1979 the grouping activated the ITALAIR Squadron in Naqoura in Lebanon as asset of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. On 1 September 1981 the 12th Medium Transport Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Gru\\" was disbanded and its personnel and equipment integrated into the 11th Medium Transport Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Ercole\\". On 6 October 1991 the grouping was renamed regiment without changing size or composition. On 29 November 1993 the regiment activated the Liaison and Light Transport Planes Squadron (ACTL Squadron) with Do 228-212 planes. On 1 October 1999 a major reorganization of the regiment occurred: the 28th Squadrons Group \\"Tucano\\" moved from Rome Urbe Airport to Viterbo Airport and received the ACTL Squadron from the Antares regiment. On the same day the 28th Tucano also received the Army Aviation Center's Liaison and Regional Transport Planes Squadron (ACTR Squadron) with P180E Avanti II planes and the ITALAIR Squadron transferred to the Army Aviation Command. On 1 September 2001 the 26th Squadrons Group \\"Giove\\" at Pisa Air Base left the Paratroopers Brigade \\"Folgore\\" and joined the Antares regiment. The same year the regiment entered the Air Cavalry Grouping, which on 1 March 2006 became the Army Aviation Brigade. On 4 November 2002 the 26th Squadrons Group \\"Giove\\" was disbanded in Pisa and its name transferred to the new 26th Special Operations Helicopter Unit \\"Giove\\" (26th REOS) at Viterbo airport.

Z3 supports arithmetic, fixed- size bit-vectors, extensional arrays, datatypes, uninterpreted functions, and quantifiers. Its main applications are extended static checking, test case generation, and predicate abstraction. In 2015, it received the Programming Languages Software Award from ACM SIGPLAN.Microsoft Z3 Theorem Prover Wins Award In 2018, Z3 received the Test of Time Award from the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS).ETAPS 2018 Test of Time Award Microsoft researchers Nikolaj Bj√∏rner and Leonardo de Moura received the 2019 Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Reasoning in recognition of their work in advancing theorem proving with Z3.The inner magic behind the Z3 theorem prover - Microsoft ResearchHerbrand Award Z3 was open sourced in the beginning of 2015. The source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on GitHub. The solver can be built using Visual Studio, a Makefile or using CMake and runs on Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, and macOS. It has bindings for various programming languages including C, C++, Java, Haskell, OCaml, Python, WebAssembly, and .NET/Mono. The default input format is SMTLIB2. Examples Propositional and predicate logic In this example propositional logic assertions are checked using functions to represent the propositions a and b. The following Z3 script checks to see if ¬¨(a ‚àß b ) ‚â° (¬¨ a ‚à® ¬¨ b): (declare-fun a () Bool) (declare-fun b () Bool) (assert (not (= (not (and a b)) (or (not a)(not b))))) (check-sat) Result: unsat Note that the script asserts the negation of the proposition of interest. The unsat result means that the negated proposition is not satisfiable, thus proving the desired result (De Morgan's laws). Solving equations The following script solves the two given equations, finding suitable values for the variables a and b: (declare-const a Int) (declare-const b Int) (assert (= (+ a b) 20)) (assert (= (+ a (* 2 b)) 10)) (check-sat) (get-model) Result: sat (model (define-fun b () Int -10) (define-fun a () Int 30) ) See also * Formal verification * Alt-Ergo References Further reading * * Dennis Yurichev - SAT/SMT by Example - With many examples using Z3Py.

Life  Seidler-Winkler was born in Berlin as the son of a musician and already made his musical appearance in his youth. He received his first training at the Stern Conservatory at the piano with Ernst Jedliczka.Biographie und Beispielaufnahmen beim Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music (CHARM) by King‚Äôs College London, retrieved 1 December 2019. He sang in the choir of the Berliner Dom. At the age of ten he also played the violin and was considered a gifted pianist; four years later he conducted in a small theatre in Berlin. As the artistic recording director of the German Edison company, he became acquainted with and mastered the possibilities of sound recording as early as the 1890s. He was then able to contribute his experience to the newly founded Deutsche Grammophon label. From 1903 to 1923 he was their artistic director and responsible for a large number of sound recordings. He directed recordings of the opera ensembles of Berlin, Dresden, Munich and Vienna and organized the necessary recording facilities and rooms. The acoustic recording technique used in the first years of recording was associated with many technical problems and limitations. Bruno Seidler-Winkler's arrangements, however, were already extraordinarily effective in achieving the desired effect for the individual composers. He was one of the first house conductors to lead the Deutsche Grammophon Orchestra. Thus, in 1908, the first complete recording of the opera Carmen by Georges Bizet was made under his direction (with Ema Destinov√° in the leading role) and in 1923, when he left Deutsche Grammophon, the first complete recordingPekka Gronow, Ilpo Saunio: An international history of the recording industry, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1999, , online by books.google.com, retrieved on 1 December 2019. of the 9th Symphony by Beethoven.

When exploring different complete denture occlusal schemes, it is more useful to define occlusion as the relative movement of one object to another viz the dynamic relationship between mandible to the maxillae during function. Bilateral balanced occlusion and non-balanced occlusion are two separate entities that make up complete denture occlusion. Bilateral balanced occlusion is observed when simultaneous contacts achieved in both centric and eccentric positions. Non-balanced occlusion is seen when teeth do not occlude in simultaneous contacts. Both concepts will be explored in greater detail in the following article.  Historical background  Historically, complete denture occlusion adopted a balanced occlusal scheme (i.e. balanced articulation: 'the bilateral simultaneous occlusal contact of the anterior and posterior teeth in excursive movements' synonyms bilateral balanced occlusion. Indeed, the bilateral balanced occlusion (BBO) scheme was adopted for reconstruction of dentate patients by both the gnathology school working on the West Coast of America and the Pankey-Mann Schuyler group working on the East Coast of the United States of America observed that using a balanced occlusion in dentate patients was suboptimal, in that this was associated this with restoration failure and cheek biting. There has been a gradual erosion for this approach for both dentate and edentulous patients. Generally, complete denture occlusion should be influenced by patient satisfaction following a paternalistic shift in the provision of dental care. Besford et al. suggests that provision that complete denture anterior disclusion should be driven by patient's aesthetic preferences incorporating an overjet. He describes that there should be a shift from a standardized visual aesthetic and instead the appearance of the complete denture should enable patients to 'regain their own personal imperfect dental identity', disregarding any occlusal scheme. Notably, studies have found that canine guidance occlusion (CGO) has superior patient preference compared to Bilateral Balanced Occlusion (BBO). Lemos et al. (2018) compared BBO to other occlusal schemes such as CGO and lingualized occlusion (LO). In this systematic review, they evaluated 18 studies with the aim of establishing which of the different occlusal schemes achieved higher patient satisfaction and masticatory performance. The results showed favourable outcomes from LO (five articles) for both these parameters. There was no significant difference between 'BBO and other schemes in terms of patient satisfaction and quality of life' in the remaining 13 articles. A possible explanation for this might be that LO penetrates the bolus better than BBO. From the patient's point of view, occlusal schemes are inconsequential compared to receiving the prosthesis.  Balanced occlusal schemes  These can be categorized accordingly: # Bilateral balanced occlusion; # Lingualized occlusion; # Frush's linear occlusion; # Pleasure occlusion; # Other schemes  Bilateral balanced occlusion  Gysi's geometrical concept underpinned bilateral occlusion schemes for both edentulous and dentate patients. Bizarrely, the theory was based on scratch- marks created using a simulated sharks' teeth model recorded on an opposing plaster cast. Gysi utilised a simulated shark's teeth model to illustrate bilateral occlusal schemes in both edentulous and dentate patients. From the above observation, 33¬∞ 'cuspal formed' teeth were introduced such that the cuspal inclination would be parallel with the condylar angle in the sagittal/horizontal plane when set-up mid-way between the condyle and incisors. The aim of this scheme was to achieve cuspal contact in excursive movements such that this would improve the stability of the prostheses in lateral excursions and direct forces towards the alveolar ridges. Lingualized occlusion Lingualized occlusion is defined as a form of denture occlusion that articulates the maxillary lingual cusps with the mandibular occlusal surfaces in centric, working, and non-working mandibular positions. The concept of lingualized occlusion was again influenced by Gysi, when he designed a crossbite posterior teeth model concept. He observed that more than half of edentulous patients at the University of Zurich had a posterior crossbite following normal physiological residual ridge resorption. In addition, a lingualised occlusion overcame the difficulties of setting up teeth in the prosthetic laboratory according to a bilateral balanced occlusion. It is asserted, based on little evidence that this scheme should be adopted for patients with compromised alveolar bone. Frush's linear concept 'Linear occlusal concept' was introduced by Frush in 1967. In this, the mesiodistal ridge of the lower posterior teeth contacted the upper posterior teeth with flat occlusal surface in order to achieve balanced occlusion. He relied on the intraoral corrections to obtain balanced occlusion. Again, his main goal was to eliminate deflective occlusal contacts and therefore increase stability of the prostheses.Bilateral Balanced Occlusion in Full Denture: a. Lateral View; b. Frontal View; c. Postero- Anterior View Pleasure concept Dr. Max Pleasure introduced the 'Pleasure curve' where he used a reverse Curve of Monson in the premolar area therefore generating a 'lever' balance effect. This concept arose from observations of tooth wear in both human and primate dentitions. The first molars are flat in the horizontal plane and the second molars follow the Curve of Monson. Similarly, the first premolar teeth are shaped such that they have a reverse curve of Monson. The aim is the same as with all balanced occlusal schemes. Sears concept Non-anatomical teeth are set up according to curved occlusal plane both antero-posterior and laterally. Hanau's Quint No discussion of bilateral balanced occlusion cannot acknowledge the fundamental contribution of Rudolph L. Hanau in 1925 when he presented a discussion paper entitled, \\"Articulation: Defined, analysed, and formulated. Of note, Hanau was not a dentist, but rather an engineer. He believed articulation of artificial teeth was related to nine factors: * Horizontal condylar inclination. * Compensating curve. * Protrusive incisal guidance. * Plane of orientation. * Buccolingual inclination of tooth axes. * Sagittal condylar pathway. * Sagittal incisal guidance. * Tooth alignment. * Relative cusp height. He embraced the above nine factors to achieve balanced occlusion using a staggering 44 statements. Subsequently, these were reduced to five factors (refer to the formula below) that make up the Classic Hanau's quint. The only shortcoming of the original diagram of the Hanau's quint is that Hanau suggested that the condylar guidance can be adjusted, and this created confusion for the others working in the field. There is a consensus that Hanau's contribution was central to evolution of the laws of articulation in order to achieve BBO. Thielemann subsequently simplified Hanau's quint as illustrated to the following formula in order to achieve balanced articulation: [K √ó I]/[OP √ó C √ó OK] K = Condyle guidance, I = Incisal guidance, C = Cusp height inclinations, OP = Inclination of the occlusal plane, OK = Curvature of the occlusal surfaces.  Trapozzano concept Trapozzano then developed the triad of occlusion after carefully analysing Hanau's 5 factors of occlusion. He eliminated the plane of orientation and compensating curves from the Hanau's five main factors. The reason for this was because of the high variability of this plane within the available ridge space. Trapozzano also stated that there is no need for compensating curves as an alteration in the cuspal angles will result in balanced occlusion.  Boucher concept Then Boucher refined this further by arguing that three fixed factors are required to establish a balanced occlusion and are as following: * The orientation of the occlusal plane, incisal guidance, and condylar guidance. * The angulation of the cusp is of greater importance than the height of the cusp. * The compensating curve enables an increase in the e effective height of the cusps without changing the form of the teeth.  The Lott scheme Clearly, when considering the sagittal plane only, increasing the condylar angle and the overbite, results in increased separation of the posterior units. Therefore, in order to achieve a balanced occlusion, the compensating curves must be greater.  The Bernard Levin occlusal scheme In this scheme, the Lott concept is refined by recording 1) the condylar angle, the simplest method being positional records, 2) and the incisal angle, by incorporating aesthetic and phonetic requirements. Then, the most important tool to achieve bilateral balanced occlusion is the use of compensating curves. Use of monoplane of low cusp angled teeth are advised.  French concept In this bilateral balanced occlusal scheme, the posterior teeth are set up at different angles in the coronal plane; 5¬∞ for the first premolar teeth, 10¬∞ for second premolar teeth, and 15¬∞ angle for both the first and second molar teeth. In addition, the occlusal surfaces of mandibular posterior teeth are reduced in a buccal lingual dimension with the aim of improving stability of, particularly the lower prosthesis. Regardless which of the above occlusal schemes are adopted, it is difficult to achieve bilateral balanced occlusion in the prosthetic laboratory. Notwithstanding this, this aspiration of bilateral balanced occlusion is easier to achieve if the 'Buccal Upper Lingual Lower (BU-LL) and Mesial Upper -Distal Lower (MU-DL)' rules are adopted for adjusting cusps. When such are taken to the extreme, the resulting occlusal schemes are essentially the lingulized occlusal scheme, or the Frush linear occlusion. All the concepts discuss the inclination of the condyle and the teeth in one orientation, predominantly in the sagittal direction. Establishing balanced occlusion bilaterally is difficult because any change in the angulation of the teeth or the curve in buccolingual direction will affect the anteroposterior angulation, hence the difficulty in establishing the balance occlusion inside the patient's mouth. There are many variables that may influence the outcome of balanced occlusion. One major variable that these concepts did not consider is the patient's neuromuscular adaptation for their new denture. Another point worthy of note is that the angle of the condyle in medial direction which also affects the direction of force. It is easy to establish the balanced occlusion on an articulator, but other variables come into play the moment the denture is inside the patient's mouth and this further affects the outcome of treatment. The assumption that articulator movement is similar to mandibular movement formed the basis of balanced occlusion schemes. Gysi's geometric theories of non-functional movement formed the basis of modern concepts of balanced occlusion. The studies illustrate the geometric variety of rotation centre about its asymmetrical location. To achieve this result, he relays a symmetrical fixed rotation on the articulator assuming that this can be used and ideal for complex anatomical situations. Using this concept, the patient can be trained to open their mandible without movement in the condylar path, demonstrated by McCollum and this movement point located in the condyle, called hinge axis. On the other hand, Dr Feinstein and Kurth could not find a definite hinge axis point and settled on a 2 mm area of nonmovement in the condylar region. The right and left condyle have distinct size, shape and angulation. Therefore, the value of hinge axis to determine or help in establishing balanced occlusion could be questioned. To remove occlusal interferences, Schuyler, introduced the BU-LL and MU-DL rule. This included reduction of the buccal cusp in the upper teeth and the lingual cusp of lower teeth in the frontal plane. Additionally, on the sagittal plane reductions are made on the mesial cusp for upper teeth and distal cusp of the lower teeth. Schuler developed this rule on an articulator whose movement is converse to the natural mandibular movement. One of the key factors in establishing the balanced occlusion is the assumption that condylar guidance of the patient is constant or fixed. The path of the condyle is determined by the temporal bone and that cannot be changed. However, records can be altered on the articulator or when transferring occlusal records from the patient's mouth to the articulator. Subsequently, it is difficult to state that condylar guidance is constant, and this may affect the statement that it is the only fixed factor in establishing balanced occlusion. In conclusion, an ideal occlusion is set by various groups based on a hypothetical assumption. While, questioning this concept may be ignorant, criticizing this technique does not mean it does not work on a clinical level. Other studies show that there is another occlusion scheme that can be considered in place of the balanced occlusion.  Non- balanced occlusal schemes   Introduction  Non-Balanced Occlusion in Full Denture: a. Lateral View; b. Frontal View; c. Postero-anterior View Mammals have undergone extensive changes in terms of their occlusion over time. A factor which influenced this change was diet. Dietary adjustment from an abrasive to soft diet has made a major difference in function, enabling the human dentition to not work as hard as it was before. As people grow older, they lose their natural dentition due to physiological changes. As a result of this, a full denture is required to restore their masticatory function. Patients and dentists both have a mutualistic, indispensable role in the construction of a fully functional denture, which include elements such as adequate retention, stability, extensions and aesthetic appearance. Apart from the balanced occlusion schemes as described above, other approaches for obtaining functional occlusion in complete dentures have been proposed. The concept of \\"Non-Balanced Occlusion\\" was based on the difficulty of achieving this, not only in the prosthetics laboratory, but for patients with displaceable mucosae. Then there is the much-quoted truism first cited by Boucher \\"Enter Bolus, Exit Balance\\"; whenever the patient masticates food on their working side, it negates the balance on the opposing side. As a result, the Non-Balanced occlusion concept was conceived as an alternative to the balanced occlusion scheme.  Cuspid protected occlusion in complete dentures Canine guidance occlusion/mutually protected/ cuspid protection is a concept that was introduced by Nagao in 1919. It is defined as the contact of maxillary cuspids with the lower cuspids or premolars on all eccentric movements. Support of the Cuspid Protected Occlusion (CPO) was made by early studies that showed predominance of innate CPO in mammals. They also argued that the canine tooth possessed enhanced proprioception, thereby 'protecting' unfavourable forces on other teeth in the dentition. There are parallels between Bilateral Balanced Occlusion (BBO) and canine guided occlusion in complete dentures in that there are simultaneous contacts in centric occlusion. The two concepts of occlusion in complete dentures differ during eccentric movements. Arguments for canine guided occlusion in complete dentures have been gaining momentum because of its ease of fabrication and better patient preference. There has been a presumption that canine guided occlusion in complete dentures promotes denture instability by introducing interferences during function. However, it has been shown that CPO has better patient preference for dental aesthetics compared with bilateral balanced occlusion. Also, it has been argued that CPO reduces destructive lateral forces on the alveolar bone by promoting vertical chewing. As stated above, it has been reported that fabrication of dentures using cuspid protection occlusal scheme both realizable and less time consuming compared to constructing dentures with bilateral balanced occlusion.  Monoplane Occlusion (Neutro-centric)  This occlusal scheme was first described by Dr. M. M. DeVan in 1951. Monoplane occlusion involves having non-anatomic denture teeth with a 0Àö incisal guidance angle, arranged on a flat occlusal plane. As a consequence, when patients with monoplane occlusion occlude anteriorly, an interocclusal gap appears posteriorly. This is termed the 'Christensen phenomenon' and forms the basis for categorising monoplane occlusion as non- balanced. Monoplane occlusion correspondingly requires having anterior teeth with no vertical overlap thus resulting in suboptimal dental aesthetics. However, some studies have suggested that a monoplane occlusion can result in reduced masticatory ability. DeVan rejected the concept of BBO because in function, the stability of the denture is lost. He therefore suggested that function can most satisfactorily be achieved by a neurocentric scheme adopting the following five factors: # Position: the artificial teeth should be placed in a central position in relation to the ridge. He argued that tongue function is paramount in achieving denture stabilisation; # Proportion: By reducing the bucco-lingual dimension by 40%; # Pitch: Compensating curves should not be employed, and the denture plane should be parallel to the denture base; # Form: The use of cuspless teeth; #Number of teeth: The number of denture teeth should be reduced from 8 to 6 posterior teeth. Monoplane occlusion correspondingly requires having anterior teeth with no vertical overlap thus resulting in suboptimal dental aesthetics. However, some studies have suggested that a monoplane occlusion can result in reduced masticatory ability. DeVan argued that this occlusal scheme resulted in preservation of the alveolar bone.

It also exercises the powers related to e-administration. The department was created in April 2009 to assume the civil servant management powers from the Secretariat of State for Public Administration, as well as the e-administration responsibilities. The head of the SEFP is the Secretary of State, a non-Cabinet member appointed by the Monarch with the advice of the Minister for Territorial Policy. The SEFP is integrated by four major departments, the General Secretariat for Digital Administration, the Directorate-General for the Civil Service, the Directorate-General for Public Governance and the Conflicts of Interests Office; and a minor department, the Strategic Planning Office. The SEFP has a budget of 1.91 billion euros, which represents the 86% of the Ministry's budget.  History  The SEFP was created in the government reform of April 2009, which integrated the responsibilities on civil servants in the Ministry of the Presidency, which formerly had the Ministry of Public Administrations through its Secretariat of State for Public Administration. The SEFP was integrated by the secretary of state and the directors-general for the Civil Service, for the Promotion of Electronic Administration, and of Administrative Organization Procedures. In October 2010, the Ministry of Territorial Policy and Public Administration is recovered and it re-assumes the powers on the civil service by assuming the Secretariat of State. This dependency hardly lasts a year because at the end of 2011 the change of government causes the abolishment of the ministry and the secretariat of state that is integrated into the Ministry of Finance and its powers are transferred to the Secretariat of State for Public Administrations. The 2016 government reform recovers once again the Secretariat of State for the Civil Service and it increases its powers by adding to its structure the Directorate-General for Public Governance, the Conflicts of Interests Office and the General Secretariat for Digital Administration. In June 2018, the Ministry of Territorial Policy is recovered and it assumes the Secretariat of State.

The regiment is part of the Italian army's army aviation and operationally assigned to the Army Aviation Brigade.  History   Formation  During the 1975 Army reform the army reorganized its aviation units and for the first time created aviation units above battalion level. On 20 January 1976 the 4th Army Light Aviation Grouping \\"Altair\\" was raised at Bolzano Airport to take command of the eight aviation units of the 4th Alpine Army Corps. After its activation the grouping merged the eight aviation units it controlled into three battalion-sized squadron groups. By 1 June 1976 the grouping was structured as follows: * 30px 4th Army Light Aviation Grouping \\"Altair\\", at Bolzano Airport ** 24th Light Airplanes and Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Orione\\", at Bolzano Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 241st Light Airplanes Squadron (SM.1019A planes) *** 440th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) ** 44th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Fenice\\", at Belluno Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 441st Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) *** 442nd Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron, detached to Venaria Reale Airport (AB 206 helicopters) ** 54th Multirole Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Cefeo\\", at Bolzano Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 541st Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 542nd Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 543rd Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 544th Multirole Helicopters Squadron, detached to Belluno Airport (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 545th Multirole Helicopters Squadron, detached to Aosta-Pollein Heliport (AB 204B/205 helicopters)  Naming  Since the 1975 army reform Italian army aviation units are named for celestial objects: groupings, and later regiments, are numbered with a single digit and named for stars in the 88 modern constellationss. Accordingly an army aviation regiment's coat of arms highlights the name-giving star within its constellation. Squadron groups were numbered with two digits and named for constellations, or planets of the Solar System. The 4th Army Light Aviation Grouping was named for Altair the brightest star in the Aquila constellation. When the army raised army aviation support regiments in 1996 they were named in relation to the regiment they supported, and therefore the 4th Altair's support regiment was named 3rd Army Aviation Support Regiment \\"Aquila\\". With the decree 173 from 14 March 1977 the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone granted the grouping a newly created war flag, which has since been awarded five Silver Medals of Civil Valour, one Silver Cross of Army Merit, and one Bronze Medal of Red Cross Merit.  Events  On 1 September 1985 the grouping raised the 34th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Toro\\" at Venaria Reale Airport. The new group took command of the 442nd Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron and 545th Multirole Helicopters Squadron. On the same date the 544th Multirole Helicopters Squadron passed from the 54th Multirole Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Cefeo\\" to the 44th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Fenice\\". On 1 October 1989 the 241st Light Airplanes Squadron was disbanded and the 440th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron transferred from the 24th Light Airplanes and Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Orione\\" to the 54th \\"Cefeo\\". On the same date the 24th Light Airplanes and Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Orione\\" was reorganized as 24th Command and Support Group. On 1 September 1991 the 545th Multirole Helicopters Squadron moved from Pollein Heliport to Venaria Reale Airport. On 6 October 1991 the grouping was renamed regiment without changing size or composition and its structure was now as follows: * 30px 4th Army Light Aviation Regiment \\"Altair\\", at Bolzano Airport ** 24th Command and Support Group *** Command and Services Squadron ** 34th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Toro\\", at Venaria Reale Airport *** 442nd Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) *** 545th Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) ** 44th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Fenice\\", at Belluno Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 441st Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) *** 544th Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) ** 54th Multirole Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Cefeo\\", at Bolzano Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 440th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) *** 541st Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 542nd Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 543rd Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) On 31 December 1993 the 24th Command and Support Group was disbanded. On 5 July 1996 the 44th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Fenice\\" changed its name to 48th Attack Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Pavone\\" and was ceded by the 4th Altair to the newly raised 7th Attack Helicopters Regiment \\"Vega\\".

He was the main exponent of the fighting-oriented style known as capoeira carioca. Biography Early life and training Some sources name his second surname as Ferreira, but the rest of his life is well documented.Many Things at Once: An Introduction to Capoeira He was one of the eight children of Brazilian military officer and politician Jos√© Moreira, who descended from Francisco Manoel da Silva.Sinhozinho e Capoeira Carioca An avid athlete, Agenor trained formally in boxing, savate, Greco-Roman wrestling and arm wrestling since his childhood,Cr√¥nica da capoeira (GEM). O ‚ÄòChausson/Savate‚Äô influenciou a capoeira? and also learned capoeira in the docks of Santos. However, when his family moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1908, he switched the local style of capoeira carioca, an aggressive, violent variation strongly associated to policemen and gangsters alike. Moreira eventually became a master of the art, receiving the name of Mestre Sinhozinho (Sinhozinho meaning \\"Little Mister\\"). He had his first national exposure as a fighter in 1917, when he accepted wrestling champion Jo√£o Baldi's challenge to avoid being taken down for five minutes. Sinhozinho passed the challenge with shocking ease, lasting an impressive total of 40 minutes against the champion, though the money prize was revealed to be non-existent because the promoter did not expect the challenge to be passed. Carioca school Like his contemporaneous Mestre Bimba, Sinhozinho opened a school in 1930 to teach capoeira to wealthy middle class citizens. However, his carioca school was not based on a single terrain, as Sinhozinho taught in several sport clubs and terrains borrowed from his benefactors, usually around the rich neighborhood of Ipanema beach. Also, unlike most capoeira mestres, Sinhozinho favored combat effectivity over artistic expression, ditching entirely the art's music and rituals and mixed it liberally with other fighting styles. It has been proposed Mestre Bimba decided to emphasize the most traditional aspects of capoeira as an answer to pragmatic, combative variations like those taught by Sinhozinho and Anibal \\"Zuma\\" Burlamaqui. Nevertheless, he is credited with having maintained the practice of capoeira in Rio de Janeiro. He was also a hand-to-hand instructor of the Pol√≠cia Especial created by President of Brazil Get√∫lio Vargas. Moreira approached capoeira in a scientific way, tailoring his training methods individually for every apprentice. He would even build his own training gear and tools to drill the art's movements, and subjected his students to heavy weight training. He modified the traditional ginga, making it more similar to boxing footwork, and also introduced techniques from wrestling and judo, especially through his partnership with judo teacher Augusto Cordeiro. Sinhozinho also cultivated the psychological aspect of self- defense, instructing his students to laugh at their aggressors before fighting in order to infuriate them and dissipate their own fear. Finally, capoeira carioca also taught the use of weapons like the sardinha or santo christo (razors) and the petropolis (canes, sometimes tricked), and among its few traditions it preserved an ancient combat game similar to batuque named roda de pernada where capoeristas would exchange leg blows. Sinhozinho was known himself as an excellent athlete and fighter. Aside from his mentioned challenge with Jo√£o Baldi, he was reportedly unbeaten in arm wrestling, and he often showed his trainees how to lift heavy weights by doing it himself at his advanced age. There's also an anecdote about how, upon witnessing a donkey being run over and left agonizing on Arpoador street, Moreira put the animal out of his misery with a single move. However, as he never created a standardized way of teaching, his fighting style died with his own passing in 1960. Sinhozinho ended up being more influential as a physical education teacher whose training methods many Brazilian athletes benefitted of. Among the students of his method there were future judo champion Rudolf de Otero Hermanny, wrestlers Reinaldo Lima and Paulo Paiva, athletes Paulo Amaral and Paulo Azeredo, musician Antonio Carlos Jobim and future Olympic Committee president Sylvio de Magalh√£es Padilha. Challenge on the Regional school In February 1949, Sinhozinho launched a challenge to the rival capoeira regional school led by Mestre Bimba, who was touring Sao Paulo. Bimba and his students had been forced to work only exhibition matches and were eager for real fighting (pra valer), so they quickly accepted to travel to Rio de Janeiro to answer the challenge. A two-day fighting event was hosted by the Federa√ß√£o Metropolitana de Pugilismo in the Est√°dio Carioca, including also a team a catch wrestlers who had similarly challenged the regional academy. Two bouts were fought between the two capoeira schools. In the first match on April 2, Sinhozinho's apprentice Luiz \\"Cirandinha\\" Pereira Aguiar fought Bimba's student Jurandir, knocking him out in the first round with a body kick. Jurandir claimed it to be a low blow, but as witnesses and the ring doctor stated otherwise, the result was kept. In the second on April 7, 17 years old carioca fighter Rudolf Hermanny defeated regional Fernando Rodrigues Perez out in two minutes, dominating the bout and eventually injuring Perez's arm with a kick. It's said Bimba was so impressed that he learned some movements he saw in the fight to absorb them into his own style. Challenge on the Gracie family In 1953, Sinhozinho next challenged the Gracie family, inviting them to send two of their Brazilian jiu-jitsu representatives to a vale tudo charity event in the Vasco de Gama stadium on March 17. His own carioca fighters would be again Hermanny and Cirandinha, coached by his usual judo consultant Augusto Cordeiro, while the Gracies sent Guanair Gial Gomes and Carlson Gracie. The first match pitted Hermanny against the gi-clad Gomes, who was significantly heavier and had a wrestling background. The Gracie fighter dominated the first minutes, taking dominant position on the ground and executing ground and pound, but Hermanny escaped to his feet. However, when Gomes removed his gi jacket and took him down again, the carioca started defending actively from his guard with punches, hammerfists and heel kicks to the back, capitalizing on his superior conditioning to wear Gomes down. After one hour and 10 minutes, with Gomes heavily battered and a fresher Hermanny looking to finish him off on the feet, the former's cornerman Carlos Gracie called for the match to be stopped and ruled a draw. Although Hermanny wanted to continue, the judges eventually conceded. The audience loudly chanted for Hermanny through the affair. The second bout had Cirandinha fight Carlson Gracie, featuring almost the opposite narrative. Dominating the early moments, the stronger Cirandinha punished Carlson standing with a variety of strikes and kicks, followed by a hard hip throw and a heavy hook that almost finished Gracie. However, Carlson managed to survive the beating, and gradually took over the fight with hit-and-run strikes over Cirandinha, who had become fatigued noticeably quickly. The jiu-jitsu fighter pulled guard and achieved dominant position, from which he landed punches and elbow strikes and looked for an armlock. Although Cirandinha did not concede the hold, his corner threw the towel due to his damage and sapped resistance, declaring Carlson the winner to the crowd's cheers. Praising the fights, the press considered the event to be a highlight for both schools. Newspaper O Popular called both winners \\"impressive\\" (\\"Rudolf Hermanny e Carlson Gracie -- Impressionantes!\\"), while magazine O Cruzeiro proclaimed, \\"brave men's blood soaked a concrete square in the Vasco estadium\\" (\\"O Sangue dos Valentes Ensopou a Quadra de Cimento do Est√°dio do Vasco\\"). Late career and death In June 1953, Sinhozinho's school was challenged by Artur Em√≠dio de Oliveira, Capoerista Regional from Bahia and a popular vale tudo fighter himself. Due to the ideological clash between Em√≠dio's traditional capoeira and Sinhozhinho's utilitarian version, a bout between Em√≠dio and usual carioca fighter Hermanny was slated to be fought on June 29 in the Pal√°cio de Aluminio. It was disputed under Burlamaqui's capoeira rules, only including a modification that allowed groundwork, and it featured Carlos and H√©lio Gracie as spectators. Hermanny controlled the first round, landing roundhouse kicks and palm strikes while defending with a boxing guard, but Emidio crouched down and attempted rasteiras and kicks from the ground. At the second, however, after punishing further Em√≠dio with kicks, Hermanny landed his own rasteira and timed a stomp on Em√≠dio's face while the latter was getting up, which proved decisive. The carioca fighter then finished the Bahiano with a throw and more stomps, driving the referee to stop the match. Sinhozinho died in 1962. His cultural legacy was obscure, but he has been considered in modern times the mainstay of capoeira in Rio de Janeiro.

Piaohao (Traditional Chinese: Á•®Ëôü, literally \\"draft banks\\"), also known as piaozhuang (Á•®Ëéä), huihao (ÂåØËôü), or huiduizhuang (ÂåØÂÖåËéä), in Mandarin Chinese, or Shanxi banks (Â±±Ë•øÁ•®Ëôü) or Shansi banks in English, were a type of bank that existed in China during the Qing dynasty until approximately 1952. The piaohao were started by merchants from the province of Shanxi who were often originally engaged in other businesses before they entered finance. The piaohao were mostly active in northern China while the qianzhuang were mostly active in the south. The piaohao continued to be the dominant financial institutions of China until 1900 when more modern commercial banks started being created by both the imperial and provincial governments, and the qianzhuang benefitted more from their close ties with foreign banks operating in Chinese treaty ports. During their heyday the piaohao had over 400 branches operating across the territory of the Qing dynasty and branches in other countries like Japan, Korea, Russia, India, and Singapore. After 1912 practically all piaohao either closed or were transformed into more modern types of banks. They continued to exist during both the early Republic of China and the People's Republic of China until they were all finally nationalised alongside the qianzhuang and the rest of the Chinese financial industry in 1952.  Structure and business strategies  All piaohao were organised as single proprietaries or partnerships, where the owners carried unlimited liability. They concentrated on interprovincial remittances, and later on conducting government services. From the time of the Taiping Rebellion, when transportation routes between the capital and the provinces were cut off, piaohao began involvement with the delivery of government tax revenue. Piaohao grew by taking on a role in advancing funds and arranging foreign loans for provincial governments, issuing notes, and running regional treasuries.R. O. Hall, Chapters and Documents on Chinese National Banking (Shanghai: Shangwu yinshuguan, 1917), p. 3. The business model of the piaohao gave very little protection to the capital of the shareholders, furthermore the piaohao imposed a highly centralised management structure, and a tenure- and performance based incentive structure which was used to discipline distant employees in faraway branches. The history of the dominant houses in the Shanxi banking shows that it were merchant families who originally began engaging in the monetary business, and they did this often without giving up their original trade. The Shanxi merchants conducted themselves with the trade in Chinese tea and would travel north through Siberia to cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, it is suspected that the Shanxi merchants had observed how Western banking works there and attempted to emulate it, but the piaohao remained quite unique. Most piaohao were founded based on a joint investment, or hehuo (Âêà‰ºô). Only a small number of piaohao only had a single investor. The shares held by managers carried non-binding votes that were cast exclusively in management meetings, meanwhile the shares of the shareholders (or owners) carried votes which were cast only on Grand Assessment Days, these days were generally held after each fiscal cycle (this was typically 3 or 4 years) and allowed the shareholders to fire or retain managers and reallocate their shares. The shares that were inherited through death or retirement were made into a special non-voting class of shares with an expiration date that were only paid out divided, this was done to motivate long-term thinking and to keep the heirs of shareholders outside of the decision‚Äêmaking process. A major difference between the piaohao and the qianzhuang was the fact that the qianzhuang banking companies grew out of the money-changing businesses known as the qianpu and would engage in business typical of banks such as providing loans, savings accounts with interest, and so forth, while the piaohao would primarily facilitate the sending of remittances, that is, the sending of money, across the Chinese realm.Lloyd Eastman, Family, Fields, and Ancestors: Constancy and Change in China's Social and Economic History, 1550-1949, Oxford University Press (1988), pages 112-114. Furthermore qianzhuang tended to be very locally run operations and were typically run only by a single family, or a close set of associates, in contrast the piaohao maintained branch offices across China, this allowed money to be paid into one branch office and withdrawn from another branch office - essentially \\"sent\\" - without there to be any actual physical silver sycees or strings of copper-alloy cash coins having to be arduously transported, under heavy guard, across great distances bringing many risks with them. The height of the capital stock of the piaohao ranged from about 20,000 tael of silver to as much as 500,000 taels of silver, yet because most of the piaohao reserved an amount of capital protected, known as huben (Ë≠∑Êú¨) or beiben (ÂÄçÊú¨), the operative capital of the banks was much less. The bank reserves were kept in the head office, known as the zonghao (Á∏ΩËôü), this we also the place where the household of the bank owner was registered. The piaohao tended to have branches, kitten as fenhao (ÂàÜËôü) in every large Chinese city. This made the remittance of money easily possible between the head office and all of its branch offices. The piaohao had branches throughout China, but the core area of operation was northern China. Every three or four years, an account known as the jiezhang (ÁµêË≥¨) was provided to the shareholders of the piaohao, and dividends were then distributed among them. The most common form of \\"shares\\" was money (ÈäÄËÇ°), but some shareholders would guarantee their \\"shares\\" with their office and their expected salary in a system that was known as a \\"person-based share\\", in Mandarin Chinese this was called rengu (‰∫∫ËÇ°) or dingshengu (È†ÇË∫´ËÇ°). The piaohao operated in daily business mainly with monetary remittances. The remittance fee, known as huifei (ÂåØË≤ª) or huishui (ÂåØÊ∞¥), depended on the distance of the transaction, the urgency, and the quality of the silver that was paid to the remitting bank. The remittance fee that was to be paid by the remitter was known as liqian (ÂäõÈå¢). It was either 2 taels (ÈõôÂäõ) per 100 taels of silver that was being remitted, or only 1 tael (ÂñÆÂäõ). Local differences in the value of silver ingots could be used by the piaohao for profits by arbitrage business, this was known as yaping case (Â£ìÂπ≥Êì¶Ëâ≤). Another important part of the piaohao business model was the assaying of silver and the production of silver ingots (Á¥ãÈäÄ), these silver ingots are commonly known in English as \\"sycees\\". Because the piaohao shareholders shared unlimited liabilities, when these changing market forces materialised, many of the shareholders of the piaohao bankrupt, while some shareholders would turn to investments elsewhere and abandoned the piaohao model altogether. The piaohao had a system of shares known as dual class shares, these let the owners vote only on insiders' retention and compensation every 3 or 4 years. The shares of the insiders had the dividend plus votes in meetings advising the general manager of the piaohao on their work such as lending or other business decisions, and were swapped upon the death or retirement of the holder for a ‚Öì inheritable non-voting equity class, dead shares, with a fixed expiry date. These shares were augmented by contracts that would allow the enslavement of insiders' wives and their children, as well as their relative's servants as hostages, these governance mechanisms prevented insider fraud and propelled the piaohao to gain an empire-wide dominance over the Chinese financial sector. Due to this system the piaohao had remained fraud-free during their entire existence. An assortment of rules prevented abuses of power by branch insiders such as self-dealing, them having side interests which could become a conflict of interest, or even engaging in any other business interests. Neither were insiders allowed to lend their savings to anyone. Branch employees were also not granted any leave with the notable exception being the funerals of their parents, furthermore branch employees were forbidden from taking their family members with them or marrying while on duty. Severe restrictions were also placed on communication as branch employees were only allowed to write a single letter home each month, but the letter was to be reviewed by the head office of the piaohao in Shanxi before it was forwarded to the family of the branch employee. During the height of the piaohao, the years 1880 to 1900, their paid out dividends averaged 12,000 tael (or 18,000 Spanish dollars) per fiscal cycle. These dividends were huge fortunes for China at the time, comparatively, a county administrator, or zhixian, would earn an annual salary of 45 taels of silver (or $67.50 in Spanish dollars). During this time the province of Shanxi's best and brightest men were well advised to forsake the Confucian civil service for careers in the banking sector because of this. Unlike shares, securities did not expire, they passed to heirs of its owners, and paid interest rather than dividends. These policies may well have sharpened incentives to help the banks succeed, but it also showed that the voting rules employed by the piaohao could change overtime.  History   Early history  Rishengchang, the first draft bank in China. The piaohao were an early Chinese banking institution were known as \\"Shanxi banks\\" by foreigners because they were owned primarily by Shanxi merchants. The exact origins of the piaohao remain unclear, and money- order services, or remittance banks, may or may not have existed in one form or another, at least in some regions of China, as early as the Ming dynasty period. The piaohao were, despite China's long economic history, the first institutions to offer a full range of banking services. Shanxi became a banking centre during this era, the arising of a banking centre in a remote northern inland Chinese province is akin to the United States' financial centre being in the remote Fargo, North Dakota, rather than in Manhattan. The first (documented) \\"piaohao\\" Rishengchang originated from Xiyuecheng Dye Company Pingyao in central Shanxi.Huang Jianhui, Shanxi piaohao shi (Taiyuan: Shanxi jingji chubanshe, 1992), pp. 36-39. The Rishengchang was founded in 1823 by Li Daquan, the owner of the Xiyucheng, a dyed goods company that would purchase raw materials in the province of Sichuan and ran stores in the cities of Beijing, Shenyang, Tianjin, and others. Lei Lutai, possibly a Tianjin (or Beijing) manager of this company, observed expensive shipments of silver often would pass each other, going in opposite directions for vast distances, this inspired Lei to see a business opportunity. Lei suggested to his boss, Li Daquan, around the year 1823 that this presented an opportunity to replacie expensive private security, wagons, and pack animals with a clearing house for the interregional transfer of money, the settlement of accounts, deposit accounts, loans, and currency exchange services. The Rishengchang was capitalised with 300,000 taels of silver (or about 450,000 dollars) by Li Daquan, it is possible that Lei Lutai had added 20,000 taels of silver. Lei was the first general manager of the Rishengchang, with Mao Hongsui and Cheng Dapei as the bank's assistant managers. After a few years Mao Hongsui ran into some disagreements with Lei Lutai over business strategy and within a couple of years Mao had organised 5 more banks. In turn, the managers of these banks also started leaving and had also created their own banks. Between the years 1823 to the early 1840s, the piaohao would experience rapid growth by providing bank drafts as a service for traveling Chinese merchants. These bank drafts could be obtained if a merchant would deposit money in cash at a local branch office, the draft was then ripped in half and one half was given to the seller as an IOU and the other to the branch of the bank of the seller. After the buyer would confirm the receipt of the goods, the seller could then claim the missing half of the bank draft that was issued to join at his branch office and effect the transfer of monetary funds into his account there. To deal with the transfer of large amounts of cash from one branch to another, the company introduced drafts, cashable in the company's many branches around China. Although this new method was originally designed for business transactions within the Xiyuecheng Company, it became so popular that in 1823 the owner gave up the dye business altogether and reorganised the company as a special remittance firm, Rishengchang Piaohao. In the next thirty years, eleven piaohao were established in Shanxi province, including Pingyao and neighboring counties of Qi County, Taigu, and Yuci. By the end of the nineteenth century, thirty-two piaohao with 475 branches were in business covering most of China, and the central Shanxi region became the de facto financial centres of Qing China.Shanxi Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, ed., Shanxi piaohao shiliao (Â±±Ë•øÁ•®Âè∑Âè≤Êñô) (Taiyuan: Shanxi jingji chubanshe, 1992), pp. 36-39. During stable times the piaohao were based on Confucianist hierarchical structures and imperial edicts, usually disputes were not brought to any formal courts and the act of taking someone to court wasn't only ineffective but it was considered shameful in traditional Chinese culture. The insider laws of the piaohao were based on Confucian traditions and the laws themselves can be described as \\"a game of ritual formalism\\". Because the descendants of merchants (a class which includes bankers) were not allowed to take any civil service examinations for 3 generations the majority of the Chinese magistrates came from other classes of the four occupations, mostly from the land owning classes. Because the merchant class couldn't rely on the magistrates for fair justice they had to create their own system of enforcing contracts, this system included a general manager chosen by the shareholders, these general managers usually had a team of vice presidents that were tasked to supervise the clerks and other bank employees. During their early years, the piaohao would pay depositors interests of 0.2% to 0.3% per month and lent out money at an interest rate of 0.6% to 0.7% per month. The biggest clients of the piaohao were merchants and various wealthy individuals, especially the nobility with whom the piaohao had rather connections. The piaohao would also record loans made from one party to another. The society of the Qing dynasty was one where the general population tended to have a mistrust of outsiders, usually people only trusted their direct family members or people with whom they had established ties that were longstanding. In this society large business enterprises that were run by professionals were largely disfavoured. Despite these societal factors, Chinese merchant guilds, which were monopolistic in nature, had found a way to circumvent these issues by vouching for traveling merchants that were paying members. Some Chinese merchant guilds would accept members from many regions of China, the Shanxi Dyed Goods Guild, of which the Rishengchang was a member, was restricted to families that originated in Pingyao county, Shanxi and these types of restrictions would later also be adopted to other piaohao for their hiring practices. Many piaohao would only hire people from the province of Shanxi while other piaohao would completely restrict their hiring to only a single county. For their hiring practices the piaohao would check an applicant's family background for 3 generations, this was because families rarely moved in China to distant places and old neighbours intimately knew each others' families as well as each others' family histories. The background check and guarantor from the applicant's native county ensured both the loyalty and total honesty of the employees that were hired by the piaohao; but this system also protected them. If a dispute arose between the employee and the piaohao, the guarantor undertook negotiations with the piaohao to make sure that the manager was not impugned unjustly. The decision to completely limit the fulfillment of staff only with people from the same region or whose ancestral roots lay in the same region proved to be a rather powerful governance mechanism. The dividend paid out to the managers was allocated to their blood relatives back in the Shanxi province, which meant that social and economic status of their families depended on their performance, and any malfeasance from these managers would endanger not just their families‚Äô economic and social status back home, but also their freedom and lives. A potential employee with clean background would present a personal guarantee letter from an eminent personage in his native county for the bank.  Rise of the piaohao  From the 17th century onwards China experienced a growing business of interregional trade which required a more elaborated system of credit, exchange, and remittance than that which was already in place. This demand was behind the early success of the piaohao as interregional banks. Paramount to this development were local banks in the districts of Pingyao, Qixian, and Taigu all in the province of Shanxi. Because the credit business was overwhelmingly controlled by the merchant-banks from the province of Shanxi, they were also commonly known as Shanxi piaohao (Â±±Ë•øÁ•®Ëôü), which is how they came to be known as the Shansi Banks to foreigners. Shanxi merchants were so much related to the financial business that they received nicknames like kedui (ÂÖãÂÖå, \\"changers\\") or keqian (ÂÖãÈå¢, \\"moneylenders\\"). The piaohao helped promote interregional trade in China. The most important of the three banking groups or sanbang (‰∏âÂπ´) in Shanxi were the Pingyao-based Rishengchang Bank (Êó•ÂçáÊòåÁ•®Ëéä), the Pingyao-based Five United Weizi Banks (ËîöÂ≠ó‰∫îËÅØËôü), the Qixian-based Heshengyuan Bank (ÂêàÁõõÂÖÉËôü), a bank based on the Chinese tea trade, or the Taigu-based Zhichengxin Bank (ÂøóË™†‰ø°Ëôü), who were former silk traders. The members of the Pingyao-based Five United Weizi Banks include: * Weitaihou (ËîöÊ≥∞Âéö); * Weifenghou (ËîöË±êÂéö); * Weishengzhang (ËîöÁõõÈï∑);Liu Jianmin (ÂäâÂª∫Ê∞ë), Wang Xuenong (ÁéãÈõ™Ëæ≤), ed. (2001), Zhongguo Shanxi minjian piaotie (‰∏≠ÂúãÂ±±Ë•øÊ∞ëÈñìÁ•®Â∏ñ) (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju), page 186. (in Mandarin Chinese). * Xintaihou (Êñ∞Ê≥∞Âéö, and * Tianchengheng (Â§©Êàê‰∫®), a company that was formerly operating in the silk business before it became a bank. The piaohao acquired a vast network of customers throughout China by establishing a widespread network of branch offices to provide their services in more places, furthermore the piaohao were responsible for inventing various types of draft, and creating more pricing remittance fees on a diverse range of factors. The piaohao would oftentimes only hire people from the province of Shanxi, or only from a single county, for example the Rishengchang only hired people from Pinyao. This was because in traditional culture outsiders were frowned upon and many people often only preferred to deal with only their direct family or people from the same area as them. During the heydays of the piaohao there were a total of 32 independent banks in operation, with over 400 branch offices spread throughout China and also some piaohao had branch offices abroad in the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Kobe, and Yokohama, the cities of Incheon, Korea, Moscow, Russia, Calcutta, British India, or the British colony of Singapore.Albert M. Craig, The Heritage of Chinese Civilization, Third Edition, Prentice Hall (2011), pages 101-103. The Beijing branch of the Rishengchang had a large plate (Á´ñÂåæ) above its main entrance with the text Huitong Tianxia (ÂåØÈÄöÂ§©‰∏ã, \\"Financial exchange all over the world\\"), for many years. In Qing China both the feudal nobility and the government bureaucrats were de facto above the law. These classes had the ability to confiscate the wealth of the general population, including the Chinese merchants, with impunity, furthermore because the nobles and government bureaucrats could manipulate the Chinese legal system into their favour there were no chances for the wronged parties to redress these confiscations. As the piaohao grew to become more prominent in the Chinese financial market, they presented a more attractive target for such predation by those in power. Consequently, the piaohao, like other Shanxi merchants, sought to ingratiate themselves with important government officials to avoid such a fate occurring to them. In order to gain more favourable relationships with the government of the Qing dynasty the piaohao would directly finance its expenditures. The piaohao also handled \\"donations\\" given to the Qing dynasty that bought honorary titles and they invested in future mandarins by lending funds to them for their travels to the capital city of Beijing where they have to take the Confucian civil service examinations. The Beijing branches of many piaohao would heavily entertain the Chinese government officials and feudal nobles. This policy would provide returns in several ways to the piaohao, as it not only attracted deposits of wealth from courted Chinese government officials and feudal nobles, but also entire budgets of ministries, the ministries often paid no interest in order for the piaohao to keep the good graces of the government.  Role of the piaohao during the First Opium War  While the 19th century was a disastrous time period for the Qing dynasty, the piaohao managed to turn each and every disaster that China faced into a profitable and lucrative business opportunity for them. The Treaty of Nanking stipulated that the government of the Qing dynasty had to pay the United Kingdom a sum of 21.000.000 Spanish dollars in war indemnities. To raise this amount of money, the government of the Qing dynasty dynasty had issued an order to each Chinese provincial government to transfer a levy of silver to British agents that were stationed in the assigned treaty ports and enclaves. However, this proved to be a predicament for inland provincial governments as they were unable to transport huge amounts of silver securely from the Chinese interior to the faraway treaty ports. General manager of the Rishengchang, Lei Lutai, saw an opportunity in this crisis. Lei instructed branch managers of the Rishengchang that were situated in the inland provinces of China to offer their Chinese provincial governments bank drafts to transfer the silver to the designated treaty port cities before the deadline with the British was met. In preparation for this move, Lei had ordered the move of large amounts od silver to the port branch offices of the Rishengchang, so when the provincial government representatives would arrive, sufficient quantities of silver would await them there. This plan had proved to work flawlessly for both the Chinese provincial governments and the Rishengchang and they had averted an impending disaster.  During the Taiping Rebellion  The most important customers of the piaohao were the Chinese merchants who were conducting in interregional trade, known as bangji maoyi (Âü†ÈöõË≤øÊòì), this changed following the large Taiping Rebellion that had affected Chinese society and its government immensely. The piaohao began to become trusted by the government to take over various tasks such as the remittance of funds, which were known as huijie (ÂåØËß£), to other Chinese provinces in a process known as xiekuan (ÂçîÊ¨æ) or xiexiang (ÂçîÈ§â), or by providing services such as the advanced payment for imperial troops known as xiangyin (È§âÈäÄ) or junxiang (ËªçÈ§â), or by providing the funds for the infrastructure of the local Chinese governments, these funds were known as the xinjin (Ëñ™Èáë). The Taiping Rebellion had a major impact on the ability of the government of the Qing dynasty to collect taxes, the loss of many of its southern provinces to rebel forces deprived the Qing of millions of taxpayers and it also cut Beijing off from remaining provinces and their resources in Southwest China. In order to help transfer funds and government revenues through rebel territory, the government of the Qing dynasty sought the help of the piaohao, the piaohao again used bank drafts for these monetary transfers. Thereafter, the military budget (junxiang), poll tax (dingliang), sale tax (lijin), and provincial indemnity levies (gesheng ding'e tanpai waizhai) all moved about the territory held by the Qing through interest‚Äêfree accounts at the piaohao, which lent at 7 li to 8 li. The piaohao also received many other beneficial business deals from the Chinese government during the Taiping Rebellion, the piaohao offered the deposit of funds, which were known as cunkuan (Â≠òÊ¨æ), and credits, which were known as fangkuan (ÊîæÊ¨æ), to the local government, which were then called the guankuan (ÂÆòÊ¨æ), state officials, or private persons. The reputation of the piaohao during this era was very high and they greatly profited from this reputation. A huge number of people confided them their money and savings, this was done in spite of the low interest rates given by the piaohao, these low percentages were in contrast to the very high interest rates that they placed on credits. Credits were also given to smaller banks in southeast China that were known as the qianzhuang, pawnshops, that were known as the diandang (ÂÖ∏Áï∂), and the great merchant houses of China. Finally the piaohao took over the office selling business the purchase, or juan guan (ÊçêÂÆò), of Qing dynasty brevet titles (Èäú) or they advanced money for the purchase of a vacancy, known as mou que (Ë¨ÄÁº∫). At the height of the Taiping rebellion the business of transacting funds and revenue became even more dangerous for the Chinese government. In order to overcome these new difficulties the existing piaohao were greatly expanded to accommodate this demand. The principal function of the piaohao under normal circumstances was that to send currency to more distant places in payment for traded goods and services.Vissering G (1914) On Chinese currency: preliminary remarks on the monetary and banking reform in China, vol 2. De Bussy, Amsterdam. For this service the remittance banks charged a fee which ranged from 2% to 6%. During the usual course of business, these banks also held Qing Chinese government funds for disbursement. As the piaohao were strongly represented in the north of China, the Chinese government saw it as only natural that these banks would be chosen to disburse the Hubu Guanpiao tael notes through their services.Pomeranz K (1993) The making of a hinterland: state, society and economy in inland North China, 1853‚Äì1937. University of California Press, Berkeley. The piaohao were often active in the assigned treaty ports cultivating the business of both Chinese merchants and foreigner traders alike. The piaohao tended to be very competitive in their nature and cooperated extensively with other branches of banking corporations within their own sphere, they would often send crucial banking-related news to member banks by carrier pigeon. Prior to the introduction of the railroad to China, the Chinese economy relied heavily on piaohao to finance inter-city commerce. In Northern China the preferred method of land transportation was the camel due to the fact that these animals could cope with the conditions of Northern China while many other animals couldn't, and the piaohao employed camels in the north for transportation. The piaohao and other Chinese banking companies were essential in connecting the various monetary systems that circulated in China at the time by facilitating interregional trade and commerce, providing credit for merchants, and cooperating in times of crisis. It was customary for example for the Shanghai banks to make advances to junk owners who were engaged in the trade of carrying tribute rice to the north, holding their vessels as collateral. These junks after having unloaded their rice in the port, would return with shipments of oil, peas, bean cakes, and other products for trade. The piaohao benefitted greatly from the \\"great contribution campaign\\", or the dajuan (Â§ßÊçê). The \\"great contribution campaign\\" was instigated by the government of the Qing dynasty to cover their military expenses to continue fighting the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. During the \\"great contribution campaign\\" the Chinese government managed to advance 2,600,000 taels of silver for the purchasing of offices.  Role of the piaohao during the Second Opium War  Following the foreign victory during the Second Opium War, the Qing retaliated by torturing and killing British envoys, this act added an additional 8.000.000 taels of silver to the war debt of the Qing dynasty to the Western powers and the Qing was forced to legalise both Christianity and opium as well as opening more of its ports to foreign traders where extrateritorial rights were granted to foreign enclaves. The piaohao were once again tasked with the transfer of funds via bank drafts by the inland provincial governments.  Modernisation of China and the role of the piaohao  By the 19th century, the piaohao had become quite well-established and widespread, handling as much as half of all banking activity in the Qing Empire, this would last until the establishment of an official modern postal service in the 1890s which took over the role of the piaohao as a remittance service. The piaohao were crucial players in the modernisation of China during the end of the 19th century. The piaohao gave credit for investing in industrialisation and infrastructure such as the construction of factories and railways across China. In fact Ulrich Theobald from the website Chinaknowledge.de argues that many of these improvements would not have been possible without financial aid from the piaohao. The Shanghai piaohao offered the subscription, or rengou (Ë™çË≥º), of bonds like the Zhaoxin share from the year 1898, which was also known as the Zhaoxin gupiao (Êò≠‰ø°ËÇ°Á•®), or the bonds issued to finance the Boxer Indemnity, which were known as the gengzi beikuan (Â∫öÂ≠êË≥†Ê¨æ). They also issued shares themselves which did, as that of the Dadetong Bank (Â§ßÂæ∑ÈÄöÁ•®Ëôü), which yielded enormous profits for the banks. The shares were valued at 850 taels of silver in the year 1889, later their shares stood at 3,150 taels of silver in the year 1896, 4,024 taels in silver in the year 1990, and at 17,000 taels of silver in the year 1908. During the latter half of the 19th century, a group of southern Chinese banks known as the nanbang piaohao (ÂçóÂπ´Á•®Ëôü), which were usually called yinhao (ÈäÄËôü) was created by local traders and merchants in the southern province of Zhejiang. These were, for instance, the Yuanfengrun Bank (Ê∫êË±êÊΩ§Á•®Ëôü) or the Yishanyuan Bank (Áæ©ÂñÑÊ∫êÁ•®Ëôü). The piaohao would find China's social and business environment became more unpredictable as it was expanding, this coincided with the managers of the piaohao reaching the zenith of their competence and the highly centralised structure of the piaohao organisations would begin to show lower returns on investment. These high financial leverages paired with a narrowed profits margin would also indicate the hidden risks that the piaohao faced. During this time period the qianzhuang banks became more important in the Chinese financial sector, as they had close connections to the foreign banking companies that began investing in China, particularly in the treaty port city of Shanghai. Despite the rise of the qianzhuang, the financial power of the piaohao would still allow them a superior position during this era, as many of the smaller qianzhuang would often borrow money from them. In 1875, 24 piaohao founded the common office, the Shanghai Banking Association, or the Shanghai huiye gongsuo (‰∏äÊµ∑ÂåØÊ•≠ÂÖ¨ÊâÄ). The piaohao were, furthermore, backed by the government of the Qing dynasty, the officialdom, wealthy merchants and merchant families, and the landowner class. Contact between the piaohao and foreign banks or foreign merchants at this time was rather indirect, and passed only through the mediation of the local qianzhuang. During the Boxer Rebellion the piaohao directly financed the Qing court as it fled from Beijing to Xi'an in 1900 following the occupation of the former by foreign powers. Around the year 1900 the heyday of the piaohao was over, even if they still had operating capital of more than 200 million taels of silver. The qianzhuang had gradually taken over the fields of business where the piaohao also operated. In addition to that, each province of the Qing dynasty had founded a government bank, which were known as the guanyin qianhao (ÂÆòÈäÄÈå¢Ëôü), and the central government of the Qing dynasty, too, had created national banks such as the Commercial Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of the Ministry of Revenue (which was later renamed to the Ta-Ching Government Bank). During the Xinhai Revolution it became very common for the branch offices of the piaohao to be subject to looting which caused immense financial losses, furthermore the chaos caused many bad loans to not be repaid and many people started withdrawing their deposits. During this era Chinese commercial banks and foreign banks started to poach the staff of the piaohao when they started to penetrate the Chinese remittance market.  After the Xinhai Revolution  After the year 1912 practically all piaohao closed or were transformed into more modern types of commercial banks. Following the Xinhai revolution rule of law collapsed causing many provinces to declare their secession from the new republic making China merely into a geographic region rather than a political ones. The piaohao were forced to either liquidate themselves voluntarily or fall into bankruptcy. Various factors were responsible for the ultimate fall of the piaohao following the fall of the Qing dynasty. Foreign banking and financial companies that were operating in treaty ports and foreign enclaves benefited from relative rule of law and legal innovations of the Western world such as limited liability. Rival commercial Chinese banks gained similar flexibility under a 1901 German Civil Code, and other Chinese commercial banks also took root in the foreign enclaves despite legal discrimination that they were facing there. Modern technologies like railroads and telegraph lines let all such entrants establish account clearing operations that would rival the clearing houses already established by the piaohao at a lower cost. The rival banks, both foreign and Chinese, could charge less money for loans than the piaohao while paying higher interest rates. The main income of the piaohao, namely interest‚Äêfree deposits to the government of the Qing dynasty and intergovernmental transfers between different departments and provinces, disappeared overnight as there was no longer a Chinese government. The only institutional change brought to the Chinese financial system by the late Qing dynasty, the standardisation of currency, had completely ended the domestic money exchange business in which the piaohao were operating. As more chaos affected China, the borrowers of the piaohao defaulted. As they lacked any collateral, this was because their reputation had always been enough to get a lain, and because the shareholders were completely unprotected due to their unlimited liability, the capital shareholders and the managers of the piaohao, due to the indemnification clauses which were present in their employment contracts, had to face the full losses causing many fortunes to be lost in the chaos. Following the takeover of Mainland China by the Communist Party during the Chinese civil war and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1952, the Communists started introducing many Soviet-style reforms, but while many of the reforms affecting the ancien r√©gime banks, including the piaohao, superficially resembled the reforms of the Soviet Union, the Chinese Communists would adopt a strategy which they dubbed \\"cultural positioning\\". This model would utilise traditional Chinese cultural influences in the process of implementing radical Socialist changes. During this transitional period the piaohao of China would maintain their strong traditional identity, but as piaohao were severely influenced by the political changes that affected them, many piaohao adopted a strategy of political compliance for their continued existence. The Communist Party saw the piaohao in a very antagonistic light, this was for a myriad of reasons strongly related to their Confucian nature. The leaders of the Communist Party of China viewed the qianzhuang as being a part of the hated bourgeoisie and claimed that private banks were anti-progressive, nationalistic, reactionary against the Socialist revolution, and that they were very politically unreliable. The Communist Party hoped to transform the financial sector of China to serve the proletariat instead of the bourgeoisie. In reality, the political ambiguity of the private Chinese financial sector were likely an obstacle in the eyes of those who wished to transform the Mainland Chinese economy into a state- controlled planned economy. But during the initial phase of the People's Republic of China the continued existence of the independent private banks was tolerated. During the year 1950 the private banks of Hankou steadily experienced a recovery, the recovery of the private financial sector was crucial for the economy of Hankou following the devastating hyperinflation that affected Mainland China during the aftermath of World War II and the retreat of the Nationalist Chinese government to Taiwan. The financial authority of Wuhan introduced more regulations and policies affecting the local private banks including the only piaohao in the city. The new Wuhan financial authority placed all banks, including qianzhuang, piaohao (Shanxi banks), and commercial banks, into a single category. The local government of Wuhan attempted to negotiate mandatory deposit reserve ratios for banks, valorise credit markets, and release tighter remittance restrictions on all banks to stimulate the ravaged economy. By the end of the year 1950 the Wuhan financial authority would place all qianzhuang and the sole remaining piaohao of Wuhan, most of which were located in former Hankou, into 3 bank unions, the banks were allowed to negotiate which union they would join. 7 qianzhuang would form the first banking union, 5 Zhe-Bang qianzhuang and 1 piaohao formed the second banking union, and 5 qianzhuang formed the third banking union.  Banknotes issued by piaohao  A banknote issued by a piaohao in the year Guangxu 16 (1890). During the late Ming dynasty period, Chinese people already widely used letters of exchange or money orders known as huipiao (ÂåØÁ•® or ÊúÉÁ•®) as a means of remittance (ÂåØÂÖå, hu√¨du√¨ or Êí•ÂÖå, b≈çdu√¨). By the 19th century paper money had been long abandoned in China and various types of commodity currencies such as silver sycees denominated in taels had become the standard currency for large transactions. The tael had regionally varying weights dependent on which city it was being traded in, for example the Guangzhou tael was 37.5 grams of silver, the Shanghai tael was 33.9 grams of silver, and the Customs tael was 37.8 grams of silver. The conversion rates between common tael types were well‚Äêknown among Chinese traders and merchants, and local units would take precedent unless a particular weight or purity was specified. The Spanish dollar (or \\"piece of eight\\"), which was a common currency in coastal China, contained 25.56 grams of pure silver, this made 1 Chinese tael roughly 1.5 Spanish dollars. The monthly interest rates was usually 2-3 li for deposits and 6-7 li for loans. Monthly interest rates were calculated based on permillage (‚Ä∞) while annual interest were based on percentages (%). There exists the possibility that the papers issued by the piaohao were discounted when traded, but there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. Some piaohao issued their own paper bills, which were known as duitie (ÂÖåÂ∏ñ), qitie (ÊúüÂ∏ñ), qiantie (Èå¢Â∏ñ), and yinpiao (ÈäÄÁ•®), with different functions (many of these banknotes represented letters of exchange). These banknotes were seen as \\"making good for the missing of a kind of paper money or paper currency in the monetary system of the (early) Qing dynasty period\\", as well as for the failed Da-Qing Baochao and Hubu Guanpiao banknotes issued during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor. The piaohao traded in currencies and conducted themselves in currency exchange, at the time there were twenty different forms of bulk silver currency circulating in China at the time, each of these currencies had a different weight and percentage of silver purity. The piaohao issued two types of draft bills, one was for \\"ordinary customers\\" and the other for \\"longstanding customers\\", the bills issued for \\"ordinary customers\\" tells the branch office to use a specific type of unit without informing the customer, while the bills for the \\"longstanding customers\\" explicitly defines which unit is being used.  Differences between qianzhuang and piaohao   Hankou  In an attempt to see why the qianzhuang succeeded in Hankou while the piaohao (or \\"Shanxi banks\\") failed Yun Liu attempted to compare them and tried to see why one type of bank slowly disappeared while the other would continue to thrive in the same city, by comparing information available on both of them from the archives of Hankou. Both the qianzhuang and the piaohao expanded their businesses at the same time. During their history, neither the Hankou qianzhuang nor the Hankou piaohao chose to Westernise their business models and practices, and despite being managed very similarly to each other, the Hankou piaohao would struggle following the fall of the Qing dynasty, while the Hankou qianzhuang would continue to strive. When modern banks started entering the Hankou scene both the Hankou qianzhuang and the Hankou piaohao would maintain their small business and staff sizes. According to Yun Liu some modern scholars claim that the reason that the piaohao disappeared is because they resisted adopting modern corporate structures and that they remained deliberately ignorant of how modern financial businesses operated. This narrative was stated by the manager of a Hankou piaohao who, in a report to his piaohao's head office in Pingyao, Shanxi, where he insisted on the incorporation of a new bank to be better equipped to compete. His plans included an elaborate scheme of staff duties, how the ownership should work, and its corporate bylaws. But this proposal was disregarded by the higher ups. Both the Hankou qianzhuang and the Hankou piaohao would continue to claim infinite liability, without actualising an incorporated form, in reality this caused their business traditions to hold a resisting effect to any adoption of fiscal reforms. Yun Liu also argues that it would be futile to argue that either the qianzhuang or the piaohao system would be more Confucian-featured, thus would either be more privileged or deprived in business because of this style assumingly. Following the Wuchang Uprising which occurred in the city of Wuchang, right next to Hankou, the number of Hankou piaohao decreased in a very short amount of time, during the Qing dynasty in the year 1881 the city of Hankou counted a total of 33 piaohao, while only 31 years later immediately following the proclamation of the Republic of China in 1912 the number of piaohao only counted 5. However, in the year 1923 the number of Hankou piaohao would increase to 9. In 1931 the number of Hankou qianzhuang was at 150 compared to only 7 Hankou piaohao. Only two years later, in 1933, the number of active Hankou piaohao had been reduced to 2, by 1949 when the People's Republic of China under the Communist Party of China was established only a single piaohao remained in all of Hankou. In his paper, Yun Liu concluded that the reason why Hankou piaohao were more prone to (permanent) closure was because they were more vulnerable to any changes in the political landscape due to their higher levels of exposure to political risks. While for politicians the qianzhuang would often serve as their liaisons to the \\"locals\\", this might explain the failure of the Hankou piaohao being plausibly caused by its credit risk hidden in its uncollateralized loans, or a combination of various accidents over the years.  Jade parachutes and pensions  The piaohao had created a rather complicated system for pensions and welfare to help incentivise people to work harder for the shareholders. This pension scheme consisted of three separate funds was either referred to as a gong ji jin (literally \\"Pension account\\") or a Caishen Zhang (literally \\"God of Wealth account\\"). The first fund was a type of bad state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêworld insurance. The capital shareholders and expertise shareholders would negotiate a fraction of earnings that would have to be retained to be placed into this fund. The money saved into this fund was used for the scenario when an \\"act of God\\" harmed the bank's earnings during this fiscal year. The second fund was used to pay interest to the capital shareholders of the piaohao, and this fund also contained their deposits, this was because capital shareholders were free to reinvest any fraction of their dividends into the company if they so wished. Drawing this fund down would require the approval of the capital shareholders. This fund provided a capital base for financing the development of the piaohao as well as its expansion. The third of these funds was used to pay divided to both dead and retired shareholders as well their heirs, these payments always had fixed terms and were paid until the shares expired. For example, a General Manager who formerly had a single expertise share would receive one \\"dead share\\" with an expiration date after 8 years and a lesser insider with only 1 expertise share would receive a \\"dead share\\" which expired only after 7 years. Insiders with fractional expertise shares were granted identical fractions of a \\"dead share\\", but these \\"dead shares\\" would expire sooner for smaller fractions. For example \\"dead shares\\" arising an eighth or a ninth of an expertise share were typically terminated after only 6 years, while those from 0.6 or 0.7 of an expertise share terminate after 5 years, and so on getting shorter for smaller fractions. This system gave retiring managers of a piaohao or one of its branch offices strong incentives to look to the long‚Äêrun profitability of the piaohao in general, and to choose and train those who would succeed them very well, for their incomes in retirement as well as the prosperity of their heirs would be dependent on the performance both the piaohao of their successors. According to some reports, the first general manager of the Rishengchang had nominated a candidate other than his own son as the next general manager, as this system disincentived nepotism in favour of a meritocracy.

The text was written by Friedrich Heinrich Ranke, based on music derived from two of Handel's oratorios. The song was published in 1826, assigned to the Entry into Jerusalem. The hymn is part of the German Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 13 and the 2013 Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 228, both four-part settings in the Advent section. The French hymn and its English translation Thine Be the Glory, Risen Conquering Son use the same tune.  History  Friedrich Heinrich Ranke wrote the text, based on music by George Frideric Handel, for a musical salon of Karl Georg von Raumer around 1820. He knew the music as \\"Seht, er kommt, mit Preis gekr√∂net\\", a chorus from Handel's oratorio Judas Maccabaeus. Handel had first composed it in 1747 for the oratorio Joshua, and added it to Judas Maccabaeus in a revised version in 1751, as See, the Conquering Hero Comes. In both works, the music reflects the triumphant entry of a victorious hero. The hymn was first published in Hamburg in 1726 in the collection Christliche, liebliche Lieder by Louise Reichardt, Raumer's sister-in-law, and assigned to the Entry into Jerusalem, which at the time had the same prescribed readings as the first Sunday of Advent. It entered collections for schools and became popular. The hymn is part of the German Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 13 and the 2013 Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 228, both four-part settings in the Advent section.  Music  Handel's original version, with English text, has a slightly different melody Handel's music is a chorus with short lines, sung in homophony. It is written in march rhythm and harmonic simplicity. In Handel's works, the first of three stanzas is scored for three voices, two sopranos and an alto, accompanied by two horns and organ. A second stanza with different text is written for two sopranos, two flutes and organ.

It was the first goth club in the world, opening in 1979 and eventually closing in 2005. Disc jockeys at the club, such as Marc Almond (a member of Soft Cell), DJ Mark M (previously of Tiffany's), Anni Hogan (a member of Marc and the Mambas) and Claire Shearsby (previously of the F Club), would play gothic rock and dark wave music. In 1985, the Clash played an impromptu gig at the venue while attending. Closure and legacy The club was foundational to the emergence of the goth subculture, by helping it differentiate itself from the conventions of punk. It influenced the opening of other influential goth clubs, namely the Batcave. There was a rivalry between it and the Bassment, another goth club that opened around the corner in the Merrion Centre a few years later. The Sisters of Mercy song Floorshow was inspired by the dances commonplace at the club. In an article for Dazed, it was stated that the \\"two steps forward, two steps back\\" style of dancing originated at the club, due to the pillar in the centre of its dancefloor. The club closed in 2005, claiming \\"redevelopment\\", the site is now a retail storage unit.

Biography John Sinclair, Master of Caithness was the eldest son of George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness and his wife Lady Elizabeth Graham, daughter of William Graham, 2nd Earl of Montrose. His father, George, Earl of Caithness had feuded with the Earl of Sutherland and the Murrays of Aberscross which had resulted in the Battle of Torran-Roy in 1570 where Caithness was defeated, but returned to besiege the Murrays at Dornoch where several of them were subsequently beheaded. John Sinclair, Master of Caithness was later imprisoned by his father for making peace with the Murrays. The Master of Caithness died at Castle Sinclair Girnigoe in 1576. Family In 1543, John Sinclair, Master of Caithness had obtained a charter from Mary, Queen of Scots by which the Earldom of Caithness became a male fee, to him and his male heirs. He married Jean Hepburn, daughter of Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell and had the following children: #George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness. #James Sinclair, 1st of Murkle. #John Sinclair, 1st of Greenland and Rattar. #Agnes Sinclair. #Henry Sinclair, a natural (illegitimate) son, who married Janet Sutherland and had a son, John, who is probably the ancestor of the Sinclairs of Lybster. Henry Sinclair accompanied George, Earl of Caithness in an expedition to Orkney, where, whilst besieging Kirkwall Castle, he died in bad health. #According to Henderson, a historian named Douglas gives the Master of Caithness another legitimate son named David, but that this is an error. However, Henderson does confirm that this David Sinclair was the laird of Stirkoke who descended from an illegitimate son of George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness and who was the father of George Sinclair who was killed in an expedition to Norway in 1612.Henderson, W.S (1884). pp. 5-6 and 103.

She undertook international recognised research on the palaeoecology of the Pennines and the ecology of Cladium mariscus.  Early life and education  Conway was born on 13 January 1910 in Didsbury, Manchester. Her father held the Chair of Latin at the University of Manchester. Margaret Mary Hall, her mother, studied Classics at Newnham College. Conway went to school in Manchester, before studying Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, with a Part II in botany. After completing her undergraduate degree, she was awarded the Yarrow Research Scholarship at Girton College from 1933‚Äì36. Her doctoral supervisor was Harry Godwin. She was awarded her PhD in 1937, with a dissertation entitled Studies in the autecology of Cladium mariscus R.Br. Her work was published in New Phytologist.  Scientific career  From 1936 to 1939, Conway was a Demonstrator and Assistant Lecture in Botany at Westfield College. From 1939 to 1941, during the Blitz, she was a volunteer ambulance driver in London. She then obtained a position in the Botany Department at the University of Sheffield, where she investigated the bogs on the nearby Hallam Moors. She spent a year abroad studying the bogs of central Minnesota with funding from the American Association of University Women. After two more years at Sheffield University, she obtained a position at the Nature Conservancy. In 1955, she was appointed director of Merlewood Research Station. Conway was described as one of plant ecology's \\"ablest and most clear-thinking workers.\\" She was noted as a teacher, and taught the leading ecologist Derek Ratcliffe. In 1982 she was elected as an Honorary Member of the British Ecological Society.  Later career  Conway left science in 1961, and became a Unitarian Church minister in Lancaster. She retired in 1973.

After finishing third on his only run as a juvenile in 2018 he developed into a top-class stayer in the following year, winning five races including the Geoffrey Freer Stakes, Prix Chaudenay and Prix Royal Oak. Background Technician is a grey colt (initially classified as chestnut) bred in Ireland by the County Wicklow-based Barronstown Stud. In September 2017 the yearling was consigned to the Goffs Orby Sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨40,000 by the bloodstock agent Dermot Farrington. The colt entered the ownership of David Caddy and was sent into training with Martyn Meade at the Manton Estate near Manton, Wiltshire. His sire Mastercraftsman, from whom he inherited his colour, was a top class performer whose wins included the Phoenix Stakes, National Stakes, Irish 2000 Guineas and St. James's Palace Stakes. As a breeding stallion, his other offspring include Kingston Hill, Alpha Centauri and The Grey Gatsby. Technician's dam Arosa showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from six attempts. Her dam Sharata was an unraced half-sister to Shahrastani. Racing career 2018: two-year-old season Technician's first race was a maiden over eight and a half furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse on 7 November in which he was ridden by Rob Hornby and started at odds of 6/1 in a thirteen-runner field. Racing on good to soft ground he recovered from a slow start to obtain a good racing position but was unable to accelerate in the closing stages and came home third behind Space Blues and Private Secretary beaten just over seven lengths by the winner. 2019: three-year-old season Spring On his first appearance as a three-year-old Technician was partnered by Oisin Murphy on 5 April when he started 11/8 favourite for a minor event over one and a half miles at Leicester Racecourse and recorded his first success as he went to the front soon after the start and drew away in the closing stages to come home three and a quarter lengths clear of the Mark Johnston-trained Themaxwecan with a gap of eight lengths back to the other four runners. After his win at Leicester the colt was purchased privately by the American syndicate Team Valor. On his first two starts for his new owners Technician ran in trial races for the Epsom Derby. On 26 April he was stepped up to Group 3 class to contest the Sandown Classic Trial and ran second to Bangkok, finishing strongly after being repeatedly denied a clear run in the last quarter mile. Twelve days later at Chester Racecourse he started joint-favourite for the Chester Vase but appeared unsuited by the sharply turning track and came home fifth, more than fourteen lengths by the winner Sir Dragonet. Summer Technician was sent to France on 13 June and started the 3.2/1 third choice in a five-runner field for the Listed Prix Ridgway over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. With Murphy in the saddle he led for most of the way and after being headed by the favourite Battle of Toro 200 metres from the finish he rallied to regain the advantage in the closing stages and won by a short neck. On 1 August at Goodwood Racecourse the colt made no impact in the Group 3 Gordon Stakes, coming home sixth of the nine runners behind Nayef Road. Sixteen days after his defeat at Goodwood, Technician was matched against older horses for the first time when he contested the Geoffrey Freer Stakes over thirteen and a half furlongs on soft ground at Newbury Racecourse and started the 10/1 outsider of the five contenders. Ridden by Hornby, Technician stayed on strongly in the last quarter mile, overtook the favourite Morando inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length. Martyn Meade's son and assistant trainer Freddie commented \\"He's been a funny horse. You have a short amount of time to work these horses out and he's only had six runs. A galloping track and a bit of juice in the ground, and he just keeps giving and giving. You need to ask him to give, he doesn‚Äôt give it to you without asking. He's good like that, which means hopefully he's got a bit of longevity\\". Autumn In the 243rd running of the St Leger Stakes on good to firm ground over 1 mile 6 furlongs on 14 September at Doncaster Racecourse Technician started at odds of 20/1 and never looked likely to win, finishing sixth of the eight runners behind Logician. On 5 October Technician was sent to France for a second time and went off at odds of 6.9/1 for the Group 2 Prix de Chaudenay over 3000 metres on very soft ground at Longchamp. The Prix de Lut√®ce winner Moonlight Spirit started favourite while the other eight contenders included Dashing Willoughby (Queen's Vase) and Nayef Road. After being restrained in the early stages by Pierre-Charles Boudot, who was riding the colt for the first time, Technician produced a sustained run in the straight to overtake the front-running Moonlight Spirit in the final 100 metres and win by three quarters of a length. After the race Freddie Mead said \\"Technician is a good horse but last time in the St Leger, the ground was too firm. Today, the ground made the difference. On a soft track, he was more relaxed and displayed his great acceleration.\\" Three weeks Boudot took the ride again when the colt returned to Longchamp for the Group 1 Prix Royal Oak over 3100 metres on heavy ground and started the 2.4/1 second favourite behind the five-year-old gelding Call The Wind (2018 Prix du Cadran). The other four runners were Holdthasigreen (winner of the race in 2018), Lah Ti Dar (runner- up in the 2018 St Leger), Way To Paris (Prix Maurice de Nieuil) and the Czech- trained outsider Iskanderhon. After racing in mid-division Technician made progress in the straight, took the lead from Holdthasigreen 200 metres out and held off the challenge of Call The Wind to win by one and a quarter lengths. Freddie Meade commented \\"He's a lovely stayer. We'll find out as we go along what he can do, but he's done enough as a three-year-old and he'll have a well-deserved rest. We'll make a plan through the winter and dream about what we can do from there.\\" Pedigree References Category:2016 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 3-o ","title":"Technician (horse)"},{"id":"62475860","text":"Georg Sch√ºnemann (13 March 1884 ‚Äì 2 January 1945) was a German musicologist.

Equivalent projections are widely used for thematic maps showing scenario distribution such as population, farmland distribution, forested areas, etc.  Applications  Equal area representation implies that a region of interest in a particular portion of the map will share the same proportion of area as in any other part of the map.

The delivery van corresponded to the then demand for inexpensive vehicles for small and express transports in the cities.  History  The market success of the tricycle cars Ph√§nomobil and Cyklonette also prompted the motorcycle manufacturer Deutschen Industriewerke AG to design a cheap alternative to the automobile or small van: In 1927 was the L-7 presented as flatbed and van variant was able for payload of a half metric ton. Also a mobile market booth version was offered. The engine technology was taken from D-Rad. At a price of 1790 Reichsmark, the pickup truck was affordable for many craft businesses and small businesses. In late 1920s the company faced increasing competition as more and more manufacturers launched wheel loaders; so the companies Z√ºndapp, Monos, Mandernach, Rollfix- Eilwagen and Goliath; 1928 appeared the successful ones first pace tricycles. Therefore, in 1930 the production of the L 7 was stopped.

The regiment is part of the Italian army's army aviation and operationally assigned to the Airmobile Brigade \\"Friuli\\".  History   Formation  During the 1975 Army reform the army reorganized its aviation units and for the first time created aviation units above battalion level. On 1 January 1976 the 5th Army Light Aviation Grouping \\"Rigel\\" was raised at Casarsa Airport to take command of the aviation units of the 5th Army Corps. After its activation the grouping merged the aviation units it controlled into two battalion-sized squadron groups. By 1 June 1976 the grouping was structured as follows: * 25px 5th Army Light Aviation Grouping \\"Rigel\\", at Casarsa Airport ** 25th Light Airplanes and Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Cigno\\", at Vittorio Veneto Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 251st Light Airplanes Squadron (SM.1019A planes) *** 425th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) ** 55th Multirole Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Dragone\\", at Casarsa Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 551st Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 552nd Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 553rd Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 554th Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters)  Naming  Since the 1975 army reform Italian army aviation units are named for celestial objects: groupings, and later regiments, are numbered with a single digit and named for stars in the 88 modern constellations. Accordingly, an army aviation regiment's coat of arms highlights the name-giving star within its constellation. Squadron groups were numbered with two digits and named for constellations, or planets of the Solar System. The 5th Army Light Aviation Grouping was named for Rigel the brightest star in the Orion constellation. When the army raised army aviation support regiments in 1996 they were named in relation to the regiment they supported, and therefore the 5th Rigel's support regiment was named 2nd Army Aviation Support Regiment \\"Orione\\". With the decree 173 from 14 March 1977 the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone granted the grouping a newly created war flag, which has since been awarded two Silver Medals of Army Valour, one for the regiment's service after the 1976 Friuli earthquake, and one for the regiment's service and sacrifice during the yearly stages of the Yugoslav Wars, when two helicopters of the regiment, detached to the European Community Monitor Mission, were attacked and one shot down near Podrute in Croatia by the Yugoslav Air Force, resulting in the death of four members of the regiment. The war flag is also decorated with a Silver Medal of Civil Valour for the regiment's mountain rescue service in the Julian Alps, and one Bronze Medal of Army Valour awarded to the then autonomous 49th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Capricorno\\" for its services after the 1976 Friuli earthquake.  Events  On 30 November 1985 the 25th Light Airplanes and Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Cigno\\" was disbanded at Vittorio Veneto Airport and its name transferred to the 48th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Pavone\\" of the Mechanized Division \\"Mantova\\", which was based at Campoformido Airport. The next day the 25th \\"Cigno\\" was renamed 25th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Cigno\\" and the 49th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Capricorno\\" of the Armored Division \\"Ariete\\" joined the Rigel grouping. On 6 October 1991 the grouping was renamed regiment without changing size or composition and its structure was now as follows: * 25px 5th Army Light Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\", at Casarsa Airport ** 25th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Cigno\\", at Campoformido Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 481st Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) *** 482nd Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) ** 49th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Capricorno\\", at Casarsa Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 491st Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) *** 492nd Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) ** 55th Multirole Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Dragone\\", at Casarsa Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 551st Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 552nd Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 553rd Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) *** 554th Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 204B/205 helicopters) On 7 January 1992 two helicopters of the regiment are attacked and one shot down by two Yugoslav Air Force MiG-21 fighter jets near Podrute in Croatia , resulting in the death of four members of the regiment and one French officer. In 1992 the regiment began the transition from AB 206 to A129D Mangusta helicopters. On 5 July 1996 the regiment left Casarsa Airport and moved its headquarters to Campoformido Airport. On the same day the 49th Attack Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Capricorno\\" was used to raise the 7th Attack Helicopters Regiment \\"Vega\\" at Casarsa Airport and the 55th Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Dragone\\" was ceded by the regiment to the Northwestern Military Region. On 1 October 1997 the regiment left the V Army Corps and joined the Army Aviation Inspectorate. On 1 September 1998 the regiment and the 25th Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Cigno\\", 48th Attack Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Pavone\\" (ceded by the 7th Attack Helicopters Regiment \\"Vega\\"), and 53rd Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Cassiopea\\" (ceded by the 3rd Army Aviation Regiment \\"Aldebaran\\") moved to the former Italian Air Force Miramare Air Base near Rimini. On 23 October of the same year the 5th Rigel and 7th Vega swapped flags and name. On 5 May 2000 the Rigel entered the Airmobile Brigade \\"Friuli\\". In 2008 the regiment began the transition from AB 204B/205 to NH90 helicopters.  Current Structure  5th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\" A129D Mangusta attack helicopters As of 2019 the 5th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\" consists of: * 30px 5th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\", at Casarsa Airport ** Headquarters Unit ** 27th Squadrons Group \\"Mercurio\\" *** 271st Combat Support Helicopters Squadron *** 272nd Combat Support Helicopters Squadron ** 49th Squadrons Group \\"Capricorno\\" *** 491st Attack Helicopters Squadron *** 492nd Attack Helicopters Squadron *** 493rd Attack Helicopters Squadron ** Support Squadrons Group \\"Lupo\\" *** Logistic Support Squadron *** Aircraft Maintenance Squadron  Equipment  The 27th Squadrons Group \\"Mercurio\\" is equipped with NH90 transport helicopters and the 49th Squadrons Group \\"Capricorno\\" with A129D Mangusta attack helicopters.

It was the first congregation founded by Voortrekkers after they left Cape Colony and the 25th oldest congregation in the NGK. The congregation‚Äôs membership, however, declined by around two- thirds, from 752 in 2000 to 256 in 2015.  Background  The Voortrekkers failed to recruit a pastor from Cape Colony, ultimately hiring Rev. Erasmus Smit, a missionary with the London Missionary Society, who was rejected by many worshipers due to his not having been ordained as such. In March 1837, he started the first baptismal register on the Modder River near Blesberg, which he termed the ‚ÄúBaptismal Register of the Reformed Church Traveling through South West Africa.‚Äù After a failed interview with another candidate on April 23, ‚ÄúGovernor‚Äù Piet Retief named Rev. Smit the ‚Äúfirst pastor for the itinerant congregation of the Reformed Church near Port Natal‚Äù on May 21, on the north shore of the Vet River. This allowed him to baptize children, confirm members, and bless marriages. During November, they crossed the Drakensberg, and therefore the following events in Rev. Smit‚Äôs diary took place on Natal soil. On December 3, he suggested four members for the church council. On the 10th, the first child was born to Afrikaners in the territory of Dingane kaSenzangakhona, the same day the council‚Äôs first meeting was held in the presence of the Governor as commissioner. In the last quarter of the ‚Äúmourning year,‚Äù October 28, 1838, the first communion service on the Great Trek was held. Living in large fortified camps to fend off Zulu Kingdom attacks, the Voortrekkers were able to attend Rev. Smit‚Äôs services in large numbers. On December 9, the Day of the Vow, Andries Pretorius and his league set out to war evoking the biblical tale of Gideon, defeating Dingane at the Battle of Blood River on the 16th. The Trek continued on to its final destination. On October 23, 1838, the Trekker council had already decided to ‚Äúsettle on the first suitable place for a town‚Äù and founded Pietermaritzburg (named after the leaders Retief and Gerrit Maritz) on Kolonie Farm, the estate of Retief‚Äôs son- in-law commandant Piet Greyling. There was already a significant population there by the time Rev. Smit‚Äôs group arrived on January 31, 1839. Zulu forces were still raiding the area, but Rev. Smit began setting out a place of worship. The first church inside the camp was quite primitive and was labelled in Susanna Smit‚Äôs diary as the ‚ÄúRietkerk‚Äù with a pulpit donated by two local benefactors. On May 13, 1839, Pretorius, now the Secretary of the Volksraad, wrote to the pastors of the Cape Town Reformed Church (NGK), Stellenbosch Reformed Church (NGK), Paarl Reformed Church (NGK), and the Wynberg Reformed Church that the congregation wanted to build a proper church building and needed a pastor. On June 15 of that year, advisor C.J. Brand replied that he was setting up a donor list ‚Äúfor contributions to the building of the temple which you have promised to the Lord‚Äù (from the words of the Vow). On April 28, 1840, construction began on what would later be called the Covenant Church or Voortrekker Church, home to what would also be known as the Voortrekker Congregation.  First pastor  The American missionary Daniel Lindley was finally appointed as pastor to the Voortrekkers on April 1, 1841. His remit stretched from Port Natal (now Durban) over the Drakensberg to Winburg and Potchefstroom. The Rev. Lindley repeatedly urged that a pastor from Holland be recruited so that he could return to the mission, and he seized his chance to resign when Rev. A.C. Stucki agreed to come to Natal. Since the Rev. Stucki unfortunately died at sea en route from Cape Town to Durban, leaving Rev. Jacob Ludwig D√∂hne of the Berlin Missionary Society to serve from March 1847 to 1849.  First Afrikaner pastor  The congregation‚Äôs first Afrikaner pastor, Rev. Hendrik Emmanuel Faure, arrived at the end of 1852, and within two years the council decided to build a new church. After failed attempts to purchase a portion of the market square, the congregation decided to build alongside the plot where the Covenant Church lay.  First church building in Natal  The first church building in the Voortrekker lands was built in Pietermaritzburg as a result of Sarel Cilliers‚Äôs victory at Blood River on December 16, 1838. That structure was, according to the 1949 report by the Pietermaritzburg council and Rev. C.W.I. Pistorius (1946-1948), not the first church but simply a placeholder until funds were raised to build the true Covenant Church. The makeshift place of worship was to be converted into a parsonage. However, after the British annexation of Natal Colony and the subsequent exodus of Voortrekkers from there, the conversion plan never came to fruition. The church council wanted to build it on 33 Longmarket Street (now Langalibalele St), which the Volksraad had originally set aside for the Covenant Church. While the congregation raised money and gathered building materials, they needed temporary worship space. At the time, Pietermaritzburg was nothing but a set of small hartebeest stables, one of which was used for the purpose. On May 13, 1839, Jacobus Burger, Johannes Stephanus Maritz, and Pretorius wrote the four pastors of Cape Colony (Revs. Abraham Faure, Tobias Johannes Herold, Gottlieb Wilhelm Anthonie van der Lingen, and Philip Eduard Faure) asking the latter to ‚Äúdraw up donor lists for the sake of the God of all Gods but for whose wondrous providence we would all have perished.‚Äù Some Voortrekkers could contribute, but most were destitute and had little to spare. Several English-speaking residents of Pietermaritzburg donated a pound each, but Burger, Maritz, and Pretorius‚Äôs May 13 letter also suggested that the Committee for Emigrants in Cape Colony could spare some of its funds. In Cape Town, C.J. Brand, editor of De Zuid-Afrikaan, appealed in its pages on October 29 to the ‚Äúowners of the mint of P.M. Burg‚Äù to donate alms to the church on behalf of those living far away. Construction began on 34 Longmarket Street at the end of April 1840 and progressed in fits and starts over the course of the year. The congregation was still quite poor, and the building committee had to request a loan from the Volksraad for the church fund on September 29. The Volksraad granted the loan, and so the building was finished a few months later and inaugurated in 1841. At first, worshipers needed to bring their own pews and chairs until the congregation could afford to purchase permanent ones. The Covenant Church, intended only as a temporary placeholder, remained in use until the second Voortrekker Church was completed in April 1861.  Covenant Church saved  After the new church opened, the Covenant Church first became a school, but it was sold by the congregation in 1874. Advisor Ernest George Jansen, later Governor-General of South Africa, saw it become a pharmacy and part of a smithy as a lawyer in the city in the early 20th century; on his way to church each Sunday, he became concerned as to the historic building‚Äôs state of neglect. The local NGK pastor, Rev. George Murray Pellissier (brother of Mrs. Mabel Jensen, Ernest‚Äôs wife), joined Jansen in advocating for the building‚Äôs preservation, founding a committee with Jansen as secretary in 1908. On December 16, 1912, a Voortrekker Museum was opened on the property, which would later be acquired by the city and remains active today under an expanded focus as the Msunduzi Museum. Until his death, Jansen was honorary chairman of the Museum Council, which timed its July meetings to match his winter stay in Natal so he could attend. The opening of the museum was only one of Jansen‚Äôs two main goals. In De Bode on July 1, 1914, he wrote an open letter to the Minister of Home Affairs, stating ‚ÄúI have the honor to inform you that steps are now being taken to implement the second part of the original plan, namely the erection of a monument in honor of Piet Retief, Gerrit Maritz, Piet Uys, and other Voortrekkers.‚Äù Although the government did not provide immediate financial support, the public did raise money specifically to build a statue of Retief. The driving force behind this was Mrs. Jansen, who unveiled Coert Steynberg‚Äôs statue in Pietermaritzburg on April 6, 1962 having paid off R10,000 of the interest.  Later developments  The second Voortrekker Church (the 1861 construction) was later demolished to make way for the Thanks Church. The cornerstone of the current building was laid on April 6, 1961, after a long struggle to secure plot 33, next to the Covenant Church yard. In a granite podium in the fa√ßade lies said cornerstone. Both church and monument, Paul Regent le Roux‚Äôs building itself symbolizes the events of December 16, 1838. The Vow is inscribed on the courtyard wall and surrounded by knobkerries and assegais in the Zulu horn formation. The skylight shining through the roof wall and the sharp spire symbolize the divine source from which the Voortrekkers believed their power came. The lampposts alongside the building represent the wagon lanterns at Blood River. The walls symbolize protective arms. On April 6, 1962, the Thanks Church was opened by J.F.T. Naud√©, followed by a service held by Rev. A.J. van der Merwe. The Retief statue, designed by Steynberg and weighing 363.3 kg, was unveiled the same day and featured him looking toward the ‚Äúpromised land.‚Äù The bricks in the pedestal come from where Retief first entered Natal after crossing the Drakensberg in 1837. The Rev. F.P. Myburgh opened the occasion with a Bible reading and a prayer, whence P.W.J. Groenewald gave a speech. After the choir sang, Mrs. Jansen unveiled the statue and gave her own speech. The congregation sold the Thanks Church to the Museum Council in 2008, when the services moved around 20 km from downtown to Merrivale in Howick, the center of a congregation acquired by the Pietermaritzburg one in 1999. The Afrikaner community in Pietermaritzburg drastically shrunk since around 1990, to the point that the two Afrikaans language high schools (Voortrekker High School and Gerrit Maritz) merged in January 1992, Gerrit Maritz‚Äôs campus being incorporated into the Durban University of Technology and Voortrekker gradually working in English instruction starting in 2009. By 2013, Voortrekker was fully bilingual, mandating 70 students a grade in two English classes, 40 white and 10 each Cape Coloured, Indian South African, and black. The NGK congregations merged as their membership declined. Merrivale and the Napierville Reformed Church were absorbed by the Pietermaritzburg West Reformed Church, which in turn joined the Pietermaritzburg North Reformed Church. Pietermaritzburg South and Hayfields merged on March 1, 2012, bringing the numbers from a peak of seven to three local congregations. The four remaining congregations had 2,251 combined confirmed members in 2011. As early as the 2001 census, Pietermaritzburg was found to have only 4.2% of its population of 223,519 speaking Afrikaans, though the population was 27.3% white or Cape Coloured. Pietermaritzburg‚Äôs confirmed membership in 2015 stood at 1,858 (2,251 in 2012), 24 fewer than that of Vredendal (1,882 from 1,909 in 2012) and 93 fewer than Robertson (1,951 from 1,952), but 531 fewer than Vredenburg (2,389 from 2,408), 210 fewer than Hartenbos (2,068 from 2,308), and 1,755 fewer than East London (3,613 from 4,900).

Founded in 1873, it currently competes in the Durham/Northumberland 1 division, the seventh tier of the English rugby union league system, where they have been long-standing members since relegation from North 2 East in 2006. They have played at The Grangefield Ground since 2015, after their move from Norton. The club were known in their earlier days for having an excellent young team. The introduction of professionalism into the game resulted in the club having a major downfall, though have recently recovered, and are currently respected for their constant pushes for promotion. With Scott Powell serving as director of football whereas Mark Skirving, Robert Green, Geoff Parling and Shaun McLaren are other members of the coaching staff, their most recent league finish was fifth out of fourteen participating teams in the 2019‚Äì20 season; the season was abandoned prior to the season's conclusion due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The club currently runs six senior teams, four academy teams, six junior teams and three women's teams. History The club was founded in 1873. During the late 1980s, Stockton were well known for having a fantastic young team; during this time, they gained three promotions within four seasons to the division now known as the North Premier. Stockton remained in that league for ten years and during the 1990s won the Durham County RFU Senior Cup five times in seven times, which included a run which saw Stockton win this competition for three consecutive seasons. Stockton won the North Division 2, now known as North 1 East, in the 1990‚Äì91 season. When that league was named North Division 1, Stockton finished as runners-up in the 1994‚Äì95 season, failing to win promotion. Following the introduction of professionalism to rugby union, Stockton suffered hugely: the club maintained amateur status whilst other clubs began to pay their players in bids to rise to the top (Stockton did not pursue this simply because they did not have the money to do so), this in turn led to many key players departing for brighter things. In 2001, Stockton were relegated to the North 2 East, where they remained for five seasons, before further relegation occurred. Following their devastating relegation, Stockton's youth system went on hiatus as a result of many volunteers concluding their free services. Stockton have since remained as regular members of Durham/Northumberland 1, having failed to gain promotion, though have always been strong contenders for promotion. The 2010s have been more exciting and promising times for Stockton: their league finishing positions have always been reasonable though it was there major ground move that was most notable. They moved to The Grangefield Ground, in a partnership with nearby Stockton Cricket Club and The Grangefield Academy school: the playing pitches and indoor changing room facility (which includes a state-of- the-art sports hall) are situated behind the school whereas the clubhouse and two junior rugby pitches are situated across the road at the cricket club. In October 2019, the club leased a 5-acre site with existing pitch drainage and changing facilities, providing 6 pitches and a floodlit training pitch. The changing rooms and newly-marked pitches were available for usage from 31 October onwards. This new site is located behind the existing pitches. In April 2020, Stockton appointed Scott Powell, Mark Skirving and Robert Green as the coaching staff ahead of the 2020‚Äì21 season. Further appointments followed, as Shaun McLaren ‚Äì a former first team player of the club and strength and conditioning coach for the Great Britain national rugby league team ‚Äì joined the team as well as a high-profile Geoff Parling ‚Äì a notable product of the club's youth system who went on to be capped by England during his professional playing career. Grounds and locations Stockton played outside of the traditional Stockton-on-Tees area for 67 years, playing their home games at Norton. In their later years, the club had a partnership with the Norton Sports Charity, where they worked together to improve the facilities and raise more funds for both the club and the charity. For years, the club had opted to make a return to the Stockton area, in a bid to raise the number of people from Stockton to play for the club, and to be a member of rugby clubs that play in their traditional home area where they originated. In 2015, Stockton departed Norton, relocating to The Grangefield Ground, a newly- constructed state-of-the-art sporting complex, located in Grangefield, Stockton-on-Tees. This move allowed Stockton to become more involved within the local community, as they entered into a partnership with Stockton Cricket Club and The Grangefield Academy. Currently, the ground includes six rugby union pitches (1 of which is valid to use for Gaelic football matches, though this has never occurred), an association football pitch, a training complex (which includes four changing rooms and a multi-purpose sports hall) and another changing room complex. Colours and crest The traditional club colours are red, white and blue: the playing shirt is red and white horizontal stripes, the shorts are navy blue whereas the socks are red and white striped. The club colours have varied numerously: some of the club's teams' kits have varied throughout the years (most youth teams' coaches previously decided on their own kit design until a recent club decision, like other clubs, was to have all teams kits identical though some with different sponsors). The away kit is either light blue with a red chest or navy and white stripes (very similar to the home kit). Of course, the away kit has always varied throughout the years with different colours and designs. The club badge contains a castle and anchor, similar to the Stockton Town Football Club badge, which presents the town's shipbuilding history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

The son of the cricketer Edward Wright and his wife Constant Hext, he was born in February 1886 at Georgetown in British Guiana. He was educated in England at the Britannia Royal Naval College, graduating into the Royal Navy as a sub-lieutenant in September 1905. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in June 1908. Wright later appeared in a single first-class cricket match for the Royal Navy against the British Army cricket team at Lord's in 1914. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed for 30 runs in the navy first-innings by Hervey Lawrence, while in their second-innings he made a half century, scoring 57 runs before being dismissed by Francis Wyatt. He served in the Royal Navy in the First World War, during which he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander in July 1916. Following the war, Wright was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in March 1920 for distinguished services in the Baltic with the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, with promotion to the rank of commander coming in December of the same year. Wright played minor counties cricket for Devon in 1921, making three appearances, before making a final appearance in 1923. He was placed on the retired list at his own request in May 1932, at which point he was granted the rank of captain. He was recalled to service shortly before the Second World War and was placed as the naval officer in charge of the Humber in August 1939, before being appointed as a maintenance captain in Liverpool. In April 1942, he was appointed to command the shore establishment . Wright died in November 1970 at Chudleigh, Devon.

George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness was the son of John Sinclair, Master of Berriedale and his wife Jean, daughter of Colin Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth. His paternal grandparents were William Sinclair, Lord Berriedale and Mary, daughter of Henry Sinclair, Lord Sinclair. William Sinclair, Lord Berriedale was in turn a son of George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness. George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness married Mary, daughter of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, but had no children. He died at Thurso Castle in 1676. The Earldom of Caithness being much in debt, he had desponed the estates and the title to his principal creditor, John Campbell of Glenorchy, who upon Sinclair's death was created Earl of Caithness by patent. This however was challenged by George Sinclair of Keiss, son of Francis Sinclair of Northfield, who in turn was a younger son of George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness. On 13 July 1680, Campbell of Glenorchy took a force of 800 men north to evict Sinclair of Keiss, who was waiting for him with 500 men near Wick. Inflamed with drink, the Sinclairs attacked the force of Campbells and were routed in what is known as the Battle of Altimarlach. Legend has it that so many Sinclairs were killed that the Campbells were able to cross the river without getting their feet wet. However, in 1681 the Privy Council of Scotland made a proclamation in favor of Sinclair of Keiss who became the 7th Earl of Caithness and Campbell of Glenorchy was created Earl of Breadalbane and Holland.

While the two-door facade is common in vernacular architecture, the purpose of the two doors is historically disputed; as the form is especially prevalent in German vernacular architecture, it may have been inspired by traditional German architecture, though it may have also functioned as a way to separate public and private spaces in a home.

Biography George Sinclair of Keiss was the son of Francis Sinclair of Northfield, who in turn was a younger son of George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness. His first cousin-once-removed was George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness (d. 1676) who was the son of John Sinclair, Master of Berriedale and his wife Jean, daughter of Colin Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth. The 6th Earl of Caithness's paternal grandparents were William Sinclair, Lord Berriedale and Mary, daughter of Henry Sinclair, Lord Sinclair. William Sinclair, Lord Berriedale was in turn the elder son of George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness. George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness married Mary, daughter of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, but had no children. He died at Thurso Castle in 1676. The Earldom of Caithness being much in debt, he had desponed the estates and the title to his principal creditor, John Campbell of Glenorchy, who upon Sinclair's death was created Earl of Caithness by patent. This however was challenged by George Sinclair of Keiss. On 13 July 1680, Campbell of Glenorchy took a force of 800 men north to evict Sinclair of Keiss, who was waiting for him with 500 men near Wick. Inflamed with drink, the Sinclairs attacked the force of Campbells and were routed in what is known as the Battle of Altimarlach. Legend has it that so many Sinclairs were killed that the Campbells were able to cross the river without getting their feet wet. However, in 1681 the Privy Council of Scotland made a proclamation in favor of Sinclair of Keiss who became the 7th Earl of Caithness and Campbell of Glenorchy was created Earl of Breadalbane and Holland. George Sinclair of Keiss, 7th Earl of Caithness died in 1698 without issue and this brought an end to the male heirs of the 5th Earl. The Earldom of Caithness then devolved upon the male heirs of James Sinclair, 1st of Murkle, who himself was a son of John Sinclair, Master of Caithness (d. 1576), who in turn was a son of George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness (d. 1582).Henderson, John W.S (1884). pp. 5-7.

Side jobs may be done out of necessity, when one's income from their main job is insufficient to support them, or simply out of a desire to earn more income. Working a side job can also, informally, be called moonlighting, usually when it is performed after normal working time. A side job can be a full-time job, part-time contract, or Freelance work, and a person can hold more than one side job. Side jobs gained in popularity in the U.S. due to wage stagnation and low wage growth that has not kept up with the rise in cost of living, with nearly a third of people with side jobs requiring them to pay expenses. Nearly half of all Americans report having a side job, including 43% of full-time workers. The most common reason workers take on side jobs is to obtain additional disposable income. In the United Kingdom, 60 percent of students and graduates reported having a side job, and 43 percent required it to pay renting expenses. Millennials are the most likely to have a side job, usually to have a financial \\"safety net\\", leading to them being considered the \\"side hustle generation\\". However, they are also common as a means to pay off student loans, as well as to leverage one's creativity in ways that would normally not be feasible in the typical workplace.

Excavations have found farro grains at prehistoric sites, including in a 12,000 year old Anatolian site. Furthermore, classical texts reference a grain called \\"zea\\" or \\"zeia.\\" Homer used the word Greek word zeidoron (Œ∂ŒµŒØŒ¥œâœÅŒøŒΩ), which comes from \\"zea,\\" to mean \\"life-giving\\" in the Iliad. He wrote that unripe zea were fed to horses in the Odyssey. Herodotus wrote that the ancient Egyptians preferred zea to wheat or barley in Histories. Dioscorides wrote that Greeks and Romans prepared krimnon, made from ground zea and wheat berries, to make poltos, a porridge-like drink. According to legend, Alexander the Great consumed zea bread to maintain his strength. The medieval harbor at Piraeus, which was named Zea Marina, was potentially named after the grain. Despite its probable popularity in ancient times, zea was most likely replaced by barley in the classical period. Eventually, durum and wheat became the predominant forms of bread. In Greece, there is an urban legend that zea bread was banned in the 1930s, so that the wheat market would not suffer. However, the reality may have been that wheat was easier to produce, so there was little incentive to be a zea farmer. For many years, zea bread was largely neglected. The closest version to zea food culture was farro in Italy. In recent years, there has been a revival of zea bread in Greece. While some zea farms existed since the twentieth century, most launched in the early twenty-first century. The majority of these farms use the Italian farro seed, known as \\"Dikokko Sitari\\" in Greek. However, some farms use the old grain from historic Greece. There are famous bakeries in Athens, which are known for their zea bread. In addition, Greek recipes sometimes call for zea flour as ingredients.

(1969). Electroplating and Related Processes. Chemical Publishing Co. . Early life Born in Pavia, he attended the Pharmacy School created by Count Karl Joseph von Firmian at the University of Pavia where he was a pupil of Giovanni Antonio Scopoli who urged him to practice the medical profession, which he did without neglecting his interests in chemistry. Brugnatelli graduated in medicine in 1784 with a thesis on the chemical analysis of gastric juices.'Essay of a chemical analysis of 'gastric sauces', Selected pamphlets on the sciences and on the arts 7 (1784), p. 289-302 He was also a pupil of Lazzaro Spallanzani. Academic career and discoveries The Aula Magna at the University of Pavia - Brugnatelli taught here from 1796 to 1818 He occasionally taught at the University of Pavia where he became the head of chemistry teaching in 1796. In 1813 he became its Rector. In 1798 Brugnatelli discovered the silver salt fulminic acid when he found that if silver was dissolved in nitric acid and the solution added to spirits of wine, a white, highly explosive powder was obtained. Decades later in 1860 this silver fulminate was used by the confectioner Tom Smith to give the 'snap' to his new novelty - the Christmas cracker. A personal friend of Alessandro Volta, Brugnatelli accompanied him to Paris in 1801 to illustrate the invention of the voltaic pile. In 1802 Brugnatelli successfully carried out the first gilding electroplating experimentsTreccani.it - \\"Luigi Valentino Brugnatelli\\" with the coating of carbon electrodes by a metallic film, finally refining the process in 1805 for which he used his colleague Volta's invention of five years earlier, the voltaic pile, to facilitate the first electrodeposition. He hypothesized that in the chemical pile there was also a transport of atoms, obtaining experimental evidence of this. He discovered the properties of coal cathodes as electrical conductors and succeeded in covering them with a metallic layer. He sensed the possible applications in the industrial field, sharing this procedure with a Pavese goldsmith, who used it. Brugnatelli's inventions were suppressed by the French Academy of Sciences and did not become used in general industry for the following thirty years. By 1839, scientists in Britain and Russia had independently devised metal-deposition processes similar to Brugnatelli's for the copper electroplating of printing press plates. He was the first to adopt and make known in Italy the new theories and the new nomenclature introduced in chemistry by Antoine Lavoisier. He tried to introduce new concepts and new terminology (for example, instead of \\"lifeless\\" nitrogen he first proposed \\"light generator\\" and then \\"putrid\\" septone), but while these innovations gained some recognition even abroad they were ultimately not accepted. In 1818, the year of his death, Brugnatelli was the first to prepare the compound alloxan, discovered by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich W√∂hler.Luigi Valentino Brugnatelli; also cited as: Luigi Gaspari Brugnatelli and Luigi Vincenzo Brugnatelli.See: * Gaspare Brugnatelli (1818) \\"Sopra i cangiamenti che avvengono nell' ossiurico (ac. urico) trattato coll' ossisettonoso (ac. nitroso)\\" (On the changes that occur in uric acid (uric acid) treated with nitric acid (nitric acid)), Giornale di Fisica, Chimica, Storia Naturale, Medicina, ed Arti, 2nd series, 1 : 117-129.

The species was first described in 1908 by Ephraim Porter Felt from a collection made in Aweme, Manitoba, Canada. The holotype, an adult male, is in the collection of the New York State Museum. Description The midge causes galls to form on the terminal buds of native roses (Rosa spp.) The galls are tightly packed leafy rosettes with a central cavity. Etymology The genus name 'Rabdophaga' is formed from two greek roots; rhabdos- meaning a rod or staffand -phaga meaning 'eater' In older references the genus name is spelled 'Rhabdophaga'. The specific name 'rosacea' refers to the genus of plants that are the hosts of the midge. Taxonomy As gall midges are one of the most diverse yet least known group of the true flies, a taxonomic revision of the world fauna of this group is in process . In 2014, it was proposed that Rhadophaga rosacea be placed in Dasineura, a broadly defined polyphyletic genus of gall midges, as Dasineura rosacea. Both Radophaga and Dasineura are within the Tribe Dasineurini, a group of plant feeders that share several physical similarities.

Early life Born in Fazenda das Lajes in Campina Grande, Gomes was expected to become a cowboy like his father, but he started a career in martial arts after meeting coach Tat√°. Along with his brothers Jos√© and Jaildo, Ivan trained in boxing and a few notions of \\"jiu-jitsu\\" (a name for judo in Brazil at the time). He trained formally in the latter art under Agatangelo Braga and his brother-in-law Osmar \\"Builson\\" Mouzinho de Oliveira, trainees of judoka Takeo Yano,A influ√™ncia de Sakujiro Yokoyama no Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and also learned under grappler Jos√© Mar√≠a Freire, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert from the George Gracie lineage. Gomes, who was a black belt under Braga at 21, also polished further his orthodox judo skills with Hayashi Kawamura in Recife and Masayoshi \\"Massaioshi\\" Saito in Bel√©m do Par√°. He started his vale tudo career shortly after. Vale tudo career Gomes gained popularity in the late 1950s, signing up with a televised show named Ringues Torres that covered the northeast of Brazil, and later moving to another show named Bolsa ao Vencedor. Gomes dominated the competition through the years, eventually leading to a high- profile match against Carlson Gracie from the notorious Gracie family in 1963. They fought on December 28 in Recife, in a fight in which Gomes supposedly had an advantage of almost 50 pounds. Gomes dominated Gracie, throwing him and taking him down multiple times and hitting ground and pound, while Carlson waited for him to get tired to build an offense. The match ended in a draw, although witnesses and specialized press were unanimous Gomes was the better man. After the fight, Carlson complained about the rules, driving Gomes to propose a rematch. The Gracie family promised to concede it if Gomes managed to defeat Juarez Ferreira in Rio de Janeiro, but although Gomes did so, knocking Ferreira out with kata guruma in less of a minute, the rematch was never granted. Instead, the Gracies offered Gomes to open an academy together with Carlson, with the condition Gomes would never challenge them again. In November 1965, due to the presence of Anton Geesink and several famous judoka in Brazil, the Gracies challenged them, claiming the superiority of Brazilian jiu-jitsu over judo and offering Gomes and Carlson to fight to prove it, but they were ignored. However, the partnership with the Gracies dissolved shortly after. His brother Jos√© described the situation as: \\"[Ivan] didn't learn anything there. Reality is, he taught them a whole lot. People often ask me if we learned from the Gracies. I always say, everything we know came from the Japanese. Geo Omori, Takeo Yano, the Ono brothers, etc. Carlos and H√©lio didn't invent a thing. The best Gracie out there was George, by a landslide. He left the Gracies to train mainly under Yano, and the Ono brothers. He was the true family champion.\\" In 1968, after handing the academy to his brother Jaildo, Gomes returned to Campina Grande and resumed his vale tudo career, meeting fighters like Waldemar Santana and Euclides Pereira. In 1974, he opened another school there to teach his style of BJJ. Professional wrestling career In December 1974, when Japanese professional wrestling promotion New Japan Pro Wrestling toured Brazil, Gomes publicly challenged its owner Antonio Inoki to a vale tudo fight. Inoki instead proposed Gomes to become a NJPW wrestler, and after the Brazilian became interested in the style of catch wrestling used by the Japanese troupe, he accepted the offer. Gomes traveled to Japan with them, training in wrestling under Inoki himself while teaching him and his wrestlers his own style in return.Prowrestling Album 2 - Antonio Inoki's Martial Arts World Finals, Baseball Magazine, October 1986 Gomes wrestled many opener matches against Yoshiaki Fujiwara, Don Arakawa and Daigoro Oshiho, always coming out on top. In 1976, during a new NJPW tour through Brazil, Gomes was slated to fight a special, high-level bout against Willem Ruska on August 7 at the Maracan√£ Stadium. Previous negotiations about the match's results and length were troublesome, and as a result, there was tension between the parts. During the bout, refereed by Mr. Takahashi, Gomes raked Ruska's eye with a stiff palm strike, which Ruska answered to by landing a punching combination, and the match became a shoot right after. The Brazilian, who enjoyed a 15kg weight advantage, dragged Ruska to the ground with a guillotine choke, but Ruska escaped and mounted him. After becoming entangled with the ring ropes, a bloody Gomes captured Ruska's back and tried a rear naked choke, to which Ruska grabbed the ropes to signal Takahashi to break action. The Brazilian refused to release Ruska, but the referee, upon observing most of his body was outside the ropes, called for countout in order to end the match at 9:03.Keisuke Shibusawa, Gracie Jiu Jitsu no Itsusashu, 1995, Nihon Sports There was controversy about whether the choke was effective.Ken Yanagisawa, 1976 Antonio Inoki, 2007, Bungeishunju The event's crowds believed Gomes had been wronged with the decision, and a riot almost broke out until Inoki came out and calmed them down. Still, repercussion in Brazil was negative, with viewers commenting Ruska should be considered the victor, even although some acknowledged he had started the affair with an illegal move. As a consequence, the Athletic Commission of Rio de Janeiro banned Takahashi and Ruska from all sport competitions.Shinji Ishii, Martial Arts Death Battle - The stormy story of the fools who wanted to be the strongest, Takarajimasha, 1994 The Japanese considered Ruska the winner, as Gomes had to be hospitalized and received nine stitches for damage suffered in the brawl while Ruska was in much better condition,Keishuke Shibusawa, Mat World Scandal, 2006 and it was reported Inoki secretly gifted Ruska a money bonus to compensate his ban from competing. A 90 seconds excerpt on the brawl was shown in NJPW's TV show, World Pro Wrestling.The Fierce!

The film stars Howard and Joshua Boone. The plot follows a teenager who has a summer romance with an older man. It premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2019. Premature was released in theaters and on video on demand on February 21, 2020, by IFC Films. The film received positive reviews from critics, and was assigned a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Premise IFC Films says in its official synopsis, \\"On a summer night in Harlem during her last months at home before starting college, seventeen-year-old poet Ayanna (Zora Howard) meets Isaiah (Joshua Boone), a charming music producer who has just moved to the city. It's not long before these two artistic souls are drawn together in a passionate summer romance. But as the highs of young love give way to jealousy, suspicion, and all-too-real consequences, Ayanna must confront the complexities of the adult world‚Äîwhether she is ready or not.\\" Cast * Zora Howard as Ayanna * Joshua Boone as Isaiah * Michelle Wilson * Alexis Marie Wint * Imani Lewis * Tashiana Washington Production Zora Howard co-wrote the film with director Rashaad Ernesto Green. Premature is his second feature film. The director of photography is Laura Valladao. Critical reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes assigned the film an approval rating of 92%, based on 50 reviews; the average rating is 7.73/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Premature transcends its familiar trappings with sharp dialogue and a strong sense of setting that further establish Rashaad Ernesto Green as a gifted filmmaker.\\" In a review for TheWrap, Candice Frederick stated, \\"The push and pull of Ayanna and Isaiah's relationship comes off naturally, thanks to Howard and Green's sensitive writing. That style carries over to Laura Valladao's equally raw cinematography, capturing the hot New York City summer from the almost dusty sidewalk pavements, to the fiery sunset over the park, and the intimacy of two vulnerable lovers in bed at night next to an open window.\\" Jon Frosch wrote of Howard's performance in a review for The Hollywood Reporter, \\"What keeps you invested is Howard, who makes her proud, steely character's every moment of vulnerability feel like a gift to both the audience and to Isaiah, who may not be worthy of her. It's a performance that builds gradually in power and radiance.\\" References External links * Category:2019 films Category:2010s coming-of-age drama films Category:2019 romantic drama films Category:African-American drama films Category:African-American romance films Category:American coming-of-age drama films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:Coming-of-age romance films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City ","title":"Premature (2019 film)"},{"id":"62477011","text":"The list of shipwrecks in September 1860 includes ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during September 1860. 1 September 2 September 3 September 4 September 5 September 6 September 7 September 8 September 9 September 10 September 11 September 12 September 13 September 14 September 15 September 16 September 17 September 18 September 19 September 20 September 21 September 22 September 23 September 24 September 25 September 26 September 27 September 28 September 29 September 30 September Unknown date References 1860-09 Category:Maritime incidents in September 1860 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in September 1860"},{"id":"62477014","text":"Habibur Rahman (died 2002) was a Bangladesh Nationalist Party politician and the Member of Parliament of Bogra-1.

She wrote under the pen name LAM Priestley. She was a member of the Women's Suffrage Society, the Belfast's Irish Women's Suffrage Society and the Women's Social and Political Union. She is buried at Bangor New Cemetery, Co Down, Northern Ireland, following several years of illness.  Personal life  Sources provide conflicting information about Elizabeth's birth and childhood. The 1901 census records her age as 31 and married to George McCracken, a Belfast solicitor, however, the 1911 census records her age as 37, and a journalist in the occupation column. The General Register Office Northern Ireland records state her age at death as 73. She had three sons; George Stavely (b 1901), Maurice Lee (b 1902) and James Priestley (b 1904). McCracken lived in later years between Seafield House, Bangor and Brae Lodge, Greyabbey, Co Down.  Writing  McCracken was a journalist and published author, writing under the name LAM Priestley. Her first book, Love Stories of Some Eminent Women was published by Henry J Davis, London in 1906. The American Child followed in 1913, The Feminine in Fiction, published by G Allen & Unwin, London in 1918 and Mme Sarah Grand and Women's Emancipation in 1933. The foreword of the Feminine in Fiction was written by Charlotte Despard. It is unclear the exact date of publication of First Causes. She wrote The Story of County Down as a souvenir for the first Ards TT road race which took place on 18 August 1928, in County Down; donating a thousand copies as a contribution to fundraising efforts for the maternity hospital. In addition, McCracken regularly wrote for the Vote and the Irish Citizen, the feminist newspaper.  Politics  McCracken was a prominent member of the Northern Ireland suffrage movement. She was a member of the Women's Suffrage Society, the Belfast's Irish Women's Suffrage Society and the Women's Social and Political Union. She was also involved in the White ribbon movement. In 1915, McCracken invited Sylvia Pankhurst to Belfast to speak at a suffrage meeting as part of a campaign to support equal pay for women doing war work. McCracken advocated for women's rights such as: wives should be financially independent, with all career routes being available to them; mothers should possess full rights of guardianship, and equal pay should be for all. She also wrote articles on domestic violence, arguing that by keeping men from imprisonment due to their role as breadwinners was literally an encouragement for men to continue abusing their wives. Many of these articles appeared in the Irish Citizen, calling for the legal profession to take domestic abuse and sexual assault of women in Ireland more seriously.

It was founded in the largely rebel-held Idlib Governorate in 2017 and is thought to be owned by the Salafi jihadist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. History The company was established in 2017, reportedly shortly after the foundation of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) which is believed to own the company. Watad had sourced petroleum from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria until early 2018, when Turkey launched a military operation which cut trade routes between the Autonomous Administration and HTS. Watad then began dealing with an unnamed Turkish company which sourced petroleum from Ukraine via the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. In January 2018, the company was granted a monopoly over the importation, processing and pricing of fuel in areas controlled by the Syrian Salvation Government. In January 2019, Watad began sending gas cylinders and petroleum to areas held by the Syrian government after fuel shortages were experienced. In November 2019, HTS arrested one of its commanders over a disagreement with Watad. The company demanded that locals selling oil work on behalf of Watad and trade exclusively in Watad products, and threatened to use force if compliance was not met. On 18 July 2020, suicide drones launched from government areas attacked Watad's fuel market in Sarmada. On 31 July, the market was hit by three Grad rockets, causing several fires to break out. In retaliation, opposition and jihadist groups shelled government forces.

To combat the increasing issue of water quality the city of Chicago implemented ideas and plans such as the Master Drainage Plan and Tunnel and Reservoir Plan. These were both historic steps in a positive and green direction. But, it wasn't until 2015 that Chicago began to treat sewage and storm water runoff, thus finally shedding its title as the last major city not to treat its sewage before being discharged into its waterways.  Master Drainage Plan  Switching the Chicago River's water flow According to Macaitis (1985), the initial main concern around water quality stemmed from the constant drainage of sewage into the Chicago River and then ultimately into Lake Michigan due to the village lacking a sophisticated form of drainage, instead relying almost solely on roadside ditches. Burrill (1904) goes more in depth stating that, Chicago inhabitants eventually took precautions to gather and utilize water from Lake Michigan by means of water intake valves that open up and ingest water from 4 miles way in 1840, however the contaminants were still able to reach the water supply. To deal with the issue of a potentially contaminated city water supply, the State of Illinois created a drainage commission for the Chicago area in 1852. The commission created the master drainage plan in 1856.The master drainage plan was centered around the fundamental aspect of raising the city by 3m and constructing new sewers that drained into the river and not the lake However once indoor plumbing was introduced to the world, the original sewer design, which was only designed to drain storm water runoff, took on a dual responsibility. It not only handled storm water, its original function, but also the sewage created from indoor plumbing. A combined sewage system can cause serious water pollution due to the fact that when wet weather occurs and runoff exceeds the maximum flow rate of the system, the excess runoff that the system can‚Äôt handle is discharged directly into a nearby body of water, whether it be a lake or a river. According to Rauch (1885) and Burrill (1904), In early as four years after the implementation of the master drainage plan, the sewage commissioners called for the deepening and overall enlargement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, going as far as to declare it as a, ‚Äúmeasure indispensable to the protection and health of the city‚Äù. The Canal had originally been created in 1848 with the purely commercial reasoning to function as a lock and pumping works for boats when the water was too low. Due to the ever expanding population and industrialization of Chicago, sewage and waste from domestic residents, slaughter-houses, and other sources continued to increase in volume and pour into the river. In 1863 an epidemic of Erysipelas broke out among the river, a direct consequence of the filth and pollution of the water. The epidemic of Erysipelas coupled with the outcry and call for a better canal by the sewage commissioners resulted in the modification of the Illinois and Michigan canal in 1865. The modification of the system changed the function of the canal so as to be able to utilize the pumps in an effort to cleanse the river. According to Macaitis, it specifically took water pumped in from the Chicago River and discharged it back onto a high point in the canal to ease and reduce the water pollution of Lake Michigan, our main supply of water. However, the canal was an inadequate solution to combat the growing problems to come. In 1885 an epidemic of waterborne disease arose and flourished due to the coupling of the ever increasing volume of waste as well as the sedimentation that occurred in the Illinois and Michigan canal in 1879, which reduced the original slow current to an even more reduced flow capacity. To directly combat the continuously increased volumes of polluted and reduce the amount of contaminated water the city of Chicago created the Chicago Sanitary District, which was constructed with the purpose of creating and maintaining a canal system that reverses the flow of the Chicago River and the Calumet River systems. In 1900 the main channel of the plan was finished and provided relief in the form of a new process for sewage and run-off. Switching the flow of the water in the river allowed the discharged sewage of the city population to flow in the opposite direction. Instead of allowing the Chicago River to directly drain the city‚Äôs sewage into Lake Michigan, the reversal of the channel allows for Lake Michigan to flow into the Chicago River. This was done so as to eliminate the contamination of the city‚Äôs drinking supply. Not only that, but also for the fact that it helps make the river cleaner since reversing the channel allows for Lake Michigan's water flow to help in the process of diluting and cleaning the sewage that‚Äôs discharged into the river. The entire canal system wasn't completed until the year 1922 but it was deemed that, ‚ÄúThe canal system dramatically altered Chicago‚Äôs natural drainage pattern for the better‚Äù. This canal system replaced the earlier constructed Illinois and Michigan canal, which by then had become unusable.  Tunnel and Reservoir Plan  COmbined Sewer System The change in the rivers water flow was estimated to provide enough treatment-by-dilution for up to a population of three million. However in 1908, it became clear to the Chicago Sanitary District that the city‚Äôs population was continuing to grow and that the population would soon exceed the treatment capacity that the canal offered. Although they recognized this fact, it was not until 1920 that the construction of the districts first sewage treatment plant began. The treatment plant and its interceptors were designed to treat sanitary and industrial waste, but only in dry weather conditions. This is an issue because once data was collected to analyze the exact volume of run-off and sewage discharged; it was found that, with Chicago‚Äôs annual rainfall of 84 cm, a mixture of run-off and sewage is discharged into the river about 100x‚Äôs a year. It was not until after the 1930s that combined sewer systems were replaced and banned for their better alternative, the separate sewer system. A separate sewer system encompasses two main lines to treat separately. One of the lines only treats run-off water, while the other is a separate sanitary system line designed to handle and only treat sewage. Heavy rainfall causes flooding through sewage backups and extremely heavy rainfall, or ‚Äúheavy heavy‚Äù rainfall, causes the water ways to back-up with sewage and back flow into Lake Michigan. The issue of water quality remained relatively untouched after that, until 1967. In 1967 a committee of experts was formed, whom represented state and local interests, to study the area‚Äôs pollution and flooding problems. Although, it was not until 1969 and having considered over 50 other alternative plans that the committee reached an agreement to form the Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP) as the solution to the areas combined sewage issue. According to the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (2019), TARP, also referred to as the ‚Äúdeep tunnel‚Äù plan, was designed to be a system of deep, large diameter tunnels and vast reservoirs that would work so as to reduce the flooding, improve the water quality in Chicago area waterways, and protect Lake Michigan from the pollution caused by sewage discharge and/or runoff. TARP functions so that when it rains the large system of tunnels captures and stores the combined runoff of storm water and sewage, that otherwise would be discharged into the Chicago area waterways. The stored water that TARP captures is then pumped into reclamation plants and cleaned before it is released back into the waterways. TARP has been recognized for its success and achievements towards ‚Äúdramatically‚Äù improving the water quality of the Chicago River, Calumet River, and other waterways. Although the plan was and is a success it is still incomplete. According to Macaitis, In 1975 the Clean Water Act was passed. The Clean Water Act allowed for the EPA to tackle the issue of water pollution and fund projects to improve water quality. However, this divided the Tunnel and Reservoir Plan into two phases. The regulations surrounding the Clean Water Act and the funding that can balloted using it only apply to pollution-control projects, and TARP is a flood control project as much as it is a pollution-control project. Thus, TARP was split into two phases. According to the MWRD, the first phase was paid for by the EPA, tackling the mostly the pollution aspect of the project, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers paid for the second phase, which had more of a focus on flood control. Phase once of TARP, which was not fully completed till recently in 2006, provides the ability to capture and hold 2.3 billion volume. Phase two is not scheduled to be completed till 2029, but when finished it will be able to increase the volume that TARP can hold to 18.5 billion volumes of liquid.  Finally Treating Water Before Discharged Into Public Waterways  According to Hawthrone (2011), after TARP‚Äôs creation and success, the city did little to improve water quality. The issue of water quality was back-seated until the Obama administration ordered for an ambitious cleanup of the Chicago River in 2011, later labeled as, ‚Äúa dramatic step toward improving an urban waterway treated for more than a century as little more than an industrialized sewage canal‚Äù. It was revealed and highlighted that Chicago was the last major U.S. city to skip the important step of disinfecting its sewage before discharging it back into public waterways. Until then the waterways had been exempt from the tougher policies of the Clean Water Act because Chicago officials assumed that people wouldn't want to go near the fetid channels. MWRD The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRDGC) had been the major obstacle, holding a steadfast opposition against the implementation of tougher water qualities. The MWRDGC‚Äôs official reasoning for their stance was that, ‚Äúit would be a waste of money‚Äù and ‚Äúmaking the river safe enough to swim would put children at an increased risk of drowning‚Äù. The main reason for their stance being summed up to the price and monetary cost of the project. The EPA, working with the support of the Obama administration, called for a plan to upgrade two of the Chicago areas biggest sewage-treatment plants so that they can disinfect the partially treated sewage and runoff that constantly flow into the Chicago waterways. According to CBS (2015) as well as study by Shively (2016), this order came at the right time because the plants weren't fully upgraded to handle their new functions until 2015; and Shivley's study, which analyzed the Chicago beach water quality from 2011-2013, revealed some concerning information. The study's goal was to analyze Chicago‚Äôs 9 beaches water to determine if the samples they collected exceeded the Recreation Water Quality Standard (RWQS) for E. Coli. The RWQS was established and put in place by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They found that out of the 2,059 water samples collected from the beaches, 285 of which were found to exceed the RWQS, for a total of 14% exceeding samples. I doubt these findings would be true for modern day, since, according to Dick Durbin, the opening of the two newly facilitated sewage treatments plants, in Skokie and Calumet, were designed to improve the overall water quality of the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). The two modified plants treat the city‚Äôs runoff and sewage before its discharged into waterways by using a chlorination/de- chlorination process, which allowed Chicago to take the historic step in no longer allowing for sewage and runoff to be discharged into CAWS untreated. Although the two updated sewage-treatment plants reduce the amount of pathogenic bacteria in the water, according to CBS, there has been no plan yet to provide the same care to the Stickney treatment plant. This is cause for concern because the Stickney treatment plant is the world's largest sewage- treatment plant and handles more wastewater than any other MWRDGC system's treatment plants.

He is a leader of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and provides the show's title character with the bounty that leads him to meet the Child. Greef serves as both an ally and adversary to the Mandalorian at different points in the first season. Greef Karga was created by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian. The character was originally planned only to appear in a handful of episodes, but Favreau and the writers liked the character so much that the part was expanded. Greef is portrayed by Carl Weathers, whom Favreau knew through the Directors Guild of America. Weathers accepted the part under the condition that he could direct future episodes of The Mandalorian in the second season. Elements of the character's background have deliberately been kept mysterious, though it was revealed in the first-season finale that he was previously a disgraced government official, and Weathers said his backstory will be further developed in the second season. Weathers performs his own stunts for The Mandalorian. He has described the role as \\"one of the greatest things that's happened in all of the years that I've been in entertainment\\". Greef has received generally positive feedback from fans and reviewers. Appearances Greef Karga is a leader of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, an organization that regulates the activities of bounty hunters, assigns bounties to specific individuals, and ensures its members follow the guild's rules. Little of Greef's backstory has been revealed as of the end of the first season, but in the first-season finale, it is revealed he was previously a government official with the title \\"magistrate\\" before losing the position in disgrace. Carl Weathers, the actor who portrays Greef, has said additional backstory details will be provided in the show's second season. Greef first appears in the series premiere, \\"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\\", where he operates out of a bar on the planet Nevarro. He is first seen when the Mandalorian collects payment from him for several bounties he collected. Greef then informs the Mandalorian about a lucrative job from a mysterious man known only as \\"The Client\\", who insists on meeting with the Mandalorian face to face. This job turns out to be a bounty against \\"The Child\\", a young alien of the same unnamed species as Yoda. Greef next appears in \\"Chapter 3: The Sin\\", during which he informs the Mandalorian to bring the captured Child directly to the Client. The Mandalorian does so, only to later rescue the Child back from the Client, who is an agent of the Galactic Empire. This is a violation of the Bounty Hunters' Guild code, so Greef organizes a group of bounty hunters to confront the Mandalorian and get the Child back. A massive gunfight ensues, in which most of Greef's bounty hunters are killed when the Mandalorian receives assistance from a group of fellow Mandalorian warriors. Greef himself escapes and confronts the Mandalorian at his ship, the Razor Crest, but the Mandalorian shoots him off his boarding ramp before flying away. Greef only survives because he had two ingots of Beskar, a rare steel which the Client provided as payment for the Child's bounty, inside his vest pocket where he was shot. The season's penultimate episode, \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\", opens with the Mandalorian receiving a message from Greef, who proposes that if the Mandalorian helps eliminate the Imperial presence on Nevarro, Greef will ensure the Bounty Hunters' Guild no longer seeks out the Mandalorian or the Child. The offer is a trap, and Greef plans to ambush and kill the Mandalorian and return the Child to the Client. Nevertheless, the Mandalorian accepts Greef's offer, bringing along with him Cara Dune, Kuiil, and IG-11 to assist in the mission. During their voyage, the party is attacked by pterodactyl-like creatures, and Greef receives a poisonous slash that would have been fatal, but the Child uses the Force to heal him. Greef is so moved that he has a change of heart and informs the others about the trap. They devise a new plan in which they leave the Child behind, bring the Mandalorian to the Imperials as if he is a prisoner, and then attempt to eliminate them. The plan goes wrong, resulting in the trio becoming pinned down inside a bar by Imperial officer Moff Gideon and his stormtroopers. At the start of the first-season finale \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\", the group engages in a brief gunfight with the stormtroopers after the IG-11 arrives with the Child to provide assistance. The group escapes the building via the sewer system, where they travel to a hidden Mandalorian convert and find most of the warriors there have already been killed by the Empire. The Mandalorian initially blames Greef for this, believing the Bounty Hunters' Guild responsible, until a fellow Mandalorian leader known as the Armorer persuades him otherwise. The group then flees on a droid-controlled floating barge on a river of lava. Greef is present when IG-11 sacrifices himself to eliminate a large number of stormtroopers to ensure the group's escape, and he survives an attack by Moff Gideon in a TIE fighter, which the Mandalorian repels. Afterward, Greef decides to stay behind on Nevarro and rebuild the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and he invites Cara Dune to work as his enforcer, which she appears to accept. The character will return for the second season of The Mandalorian. Characterization Greef Karga has a gruff personality, and a no-nonsense approach to business. He projects a calm and confident demeanor, and is motivated largely by financial profit, but is also fair in his dealings. He is loyal to his allies to some degree, but can also be duplicitous and shifting in his allegiances, as seen by the way in which he repeatedly switches between friend and adversary to the Mandalorian. Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair felt Greef simultaneously protected and manipulated the Mandalorian at times, and that Mandalorian did not fully trust him as a result. Weathers has described his character as \\"a combination of a used car salesman and a puppeteer\\". KGO-TV writers Janet Davies and Marsha Jordan described Greef as a \\"shadowy underworld figure\\". Weathers said the character has \\"something that you can't quite trust\\", but also said he is \\"definitely not amoral\\". Greef is a mysterious character, and Weathers has said it was a conscious decision by the writers to keep aspects of his history and motivations cryptic: \\"There's some real strong indications that give you some idea of who he is, but we never let on completely.\\" Greef has a very theatrical and sometimes over-the-top personality, enjoys action and the company of bounty hunters, over whom he exerts strict control through his leadership role in the Bounty Hunters' Guild. Although normally self-assured and confident, Greef does act cautiously and sometimes even fearfully in some situations, such as his interaction with the Client. Concept and creation Conception Greef Karga was created by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian. The character of Greef Karga was created by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian. He was originally planned to make a brief appearance in the series, but Favreau and the series writers found that they liked the character so much that they expanded his part and gave him a larger role. Greef Karga was first publicly unveiled during the Star Wars Celebration convention in Chicago on April 14, 2019, along with the character Cara Dune. The event also featured teaser footage featuring Greef, a still photo of the character, and included a panel discussion with Weathers and Gina Carano, the actress who portrays Cara, discussing their characters. A full finished scene of Greef offering a bounty to the Mandalorian was also screened. It was the first time Weathers had seen finalized footage from the show, after which he said: \\"How can you not react to that? It's beautiful hearing the fans react to it.\\" During the panel, Weathers said of his character: \\"He's kind of the head of this guild of bounty hunters. There seems to be a lot of kind of nefarious people.\\" Some publications misspelled Karga's named after the event, with Anthony Gramuglia of Comic Book Resources calling him \\"Greif Marda\\", and Variety writer Jordan Moreau misspelling the last name as \\"Carga\\". Further footage of the character was included in the first trailer of The Mandalorian. which debuted at the D23 convention on August 23, 2019. According to Adrienne Tyler of Screen Rant, some viewers mistook images of Greef Carga in the trailer for Lando Calrissian, a Star Wars character who dates back to the original Star Wars trilogy. On October 28, a character poster of The Mandalorian solely featuring Greef Karga was released. Portrayal Jon Favreau, who offered the part to Weathers, was a fan of the actor and had previously met Weathers through their mutual membership in the Directors Guild of America; Favreau began courting him for The Mandalorian early in the process of preparing for the series. Weathers said Favreau \\"did sort of a slow roll on me\\", describing the project to him and impressing the actor with his passion for the show. Weathers met with Favreau to discuss the Greef Karga character, with Favreau showing him concept art from the series, which Weathers described as \\"magnificent\\" and \\"some of the most beautiful artwork\\". He was also impressed with Dave Filoni, the executive director for The Mandalorian, saying of him and Favreau: \\"We're in really good hands.\\" Weathers agreed to accept the part if he could have the opportunity to direct future episodes of The Mandalorian if it was renewed for a second season, to which Favreau agreed. Although Weathers originally signed on for only a few episodes, the character was later expanded and the role grew larger than what he initially accepted. Favreau said: \\"We really did rope him in.\\" Upon first reading the part, Weathers said Greef Karga reminded him of film director, screenwriter, and actor John Huston, particularly his performance in the film Chinatown (1974). He felt there was a theatricality and \\"larger than life\\" quality to the character, and he deliberately performed some of his lines in a showy and melodramatic way as a result. Weathers' casting was first announced on December 12, 2018, though rumors had been had been discussed on the Making Star Wars podcast and other Internet sites two months prior to the formal announcement. Weathers called The Mandalorian one of the \\"most exciting projects\\" of his career, saying: \\"Being a part of this is one of the greatest things that‚Äôs happened in all of the years that I‚Äôve been in entertainment.\\" He said he was very impressed by the quality of writing in the scripts, and that he particularly enjoyed his character's shifting allegiances and unpredictable about-faces: \\"It's much more interesting to play someone who is not all of one thing, not one-dimensional. ... Certainly with Greef, you have to really keep your eye on him.\\" Weathers said he knew little about Greef Karga's backstory before playing the character, and that he did not want to know it because he felt the mystery helped him convey a sense of ambiguity. Regarding Greef's past history, Weathers said, \\"I didn't ask it. I didn't care. I didn't want to know.\\" However, he also added: \\"If I had to guess, he was going through some dark times. He was doing maybe some pretty dark stuff.\\" Weathers is slated to direct an episode of The Mandalorian in the second season. He will be the second cast member of The Mandalorian to also direct an episode, after IG-11 actor Taika Waititi. Filming There was a great deal of secrecy surrounding the filming of The Mandalorian, and Weathers was not allowed to divulge any details about the series. In the early months, he was not even allowed reveal that he was appearing in the show. He joked: \\"I had to cut my finger and sign in blood that I would say nothing about it.\\" The actor said his time filming The Mandalorian has been a positive experience, describing it as: \\"a liberating experience when you have so many smart, talented, collaborative, good-hearted, caring people around you on a daily basis\\". Weathers performed his own stunts for The Mandalorian. He said he has pushed for diversity in the casting of The Mandalorian, not only based upon race but also such factors as height, age, and physical appearance: \\"I want to see anything that we have experienced in the world to be in that universe, because they're disparate creatures coming from every part of the universe. So why wouldn't they be there?\\" After filming each episode, Weathers liked to watch footage and study what the director and actors brought to each individual scene. Weathers said he particularly enjoyed working with director Deborah Chow during filming of \\"Chapter 3: The Sin\\", because she had planned what she wanted to do for the episode very precisely and meticulously in advance. He said this took a lot of pressure off of him and the rest of the cast, giving them more freedom and helping ensure their own choices were in sync with hers. Weathers' action sequences in \\"Chapter 3: The Sin\\" took a particularly long time to film due of the many elements involved in the shootout scene. In Greef Karga's scenes with the Client, played by German film director Werner Herzog, Weathers deliberately made Greef less confident and commanding than normal in order to convey that the Client was a dangerous character. He was a great admirer of Herzog, referring to him as \\"maestro\\" on the set of The Mandalorian, and the two had extensive conversations with each other about Herzog's past films and his relationship with actor Klaus Kinski. Cultural impact Critical reception Greef Karga has received generally positive feedback from fans and reviewers. Screen Rant ranked him sixth on a list of the best characters from the first season of The Mandalorian, as well as on a separate list of the most interesting characters from the season. Vulture writer Keith Phipps praised the character, writing \\"Just the way he says 'Mando!' is a delight\\", a reference to the Mandalorian's nickname. Kevin Pantoja of Screen Rant complimented Weathers' performance, who he said is \\"always awesome\\". Fans particularly enjoyed Greef's line \\"Do the magic hand thing!\\", which he says to the Child in the season finale while trying to encourage him to use the Force against their enemies. Nobelle Borines of Epicstream called it his \\"most iconic line\\" of the season. After the first season concluded, Weathers thanks his fans via Twitter for their support for the show, writing: \\"Your enjoyment and appreciation for the work done by the creators, directors, cast and crew fills us all with pride. Until fall of 2020, 'Do the magic hand thing, baby'!\\" Greef Karga's costume was ranked tenth on a Screen Rant list of the ten best costumes in the first season of The Mandalorian. Merchandise A Funko Pop figurine of Greef Karga was announced on December 31, 2019.

An alien of the Ugnaught species, Kuiil is a former indentured servant of the Galactic Empire living in solitude when he encounters the show's title character and assists him in seeking and protecting a young alien known as \\"The Child\\". Kuiil is portrayed as wise, patient, and hard-working, with a high level of mechanical skills and a gruff but ultimately kind-hearted personality. The voice of Kuiil was performed by Nick Nolte, who completed his recordings for all the character's dialogue in a single afternoon. Kuiil's performance was done by Misty Rosas, who during filming wore an animatronic face mask created by Legacy Effects. Kuiil's face was brought to life through animatronics and puppetry, with its electronics and wires concealed in the backpack and pockets of Kuiil's costume. Three puppeteers controlled the mask's mouth and eyebrows off-camera as Rosas performed her scenes, attempting to match the character's facial movements to Nolte's vocal tracks. The process often proved challenging, particularly when the puppeteers missed signals made by Rosas during dimly-lit scenes. Kuiil's dynamic with the bounty hunter droid IG-11 reflects a parenting theme prevalent among multiple characters throughout the first season of The Mandalorian, and Kuiil's reprogramming of the droid from hunter to protector drew nature versus nurture discussions among reviewers. Kuiil has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike. He has been described as a fan favorite, with several reviews calling him the best character on the show, and his signature line \\"I have spoken\\" became one of the better-known and best-liked lines of dialogue from the series. Appearances Kuiil is an alien of the Ugnaught species. According to his backstory established in exposition dialogue on The Mandalorian, Kuiil was sold into indentured servitude to the Galactic Empire and spent many years working for them against his will prior to the events of the television series. At one point in the show, Kuiil says he worked in the gene farms of a cloning facility during his time with the Empire. He eventually worked hard enough to pay off his debt and earn his freedom, and then sought a reclusive home on a quiet world where he would no longer have to work for anyone else again. Kuiil appeared in three episodes in the first season of The Mandalorian, making his first appearance in the series debut episode \\"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\\", where he is shown living on a moisture farm on the planet Arvala-7, working as a vapor farmer. In that episode, Kuiil encounters the show's title character, a bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian, who is seeking to collect a bounty on an unnamed person being held on the planet. Kuiil assists the Mandalorian when he is attacked by creatures known as blurrgs. He welcomes the Mandalorian into his home, where Kuiil informs him that several other bounty hunters and mercenaries have passed through Arvala-7 in search of the Mandalorian's target. Kuiil offers to help the bounty hunter travel to the compound where the asset is being kept, with the hope that once the bounty has been collected, peace will once again be restored to Arvala-7. Kuiil teaches the Mandalorian how to ride one of the captured blurrgs so he can travel to the compound. Kuiil appears in the next episode, \\"Chapter 2: The Child, when the Mandalorian returns to him with the target he had been seeking: a young alien creature referred to as \\"The Child\\". Kuiil helps the Mandalorian avert a crisis with a group of alien scavengers called Jawas. After the Jawas steal necessary parts from the Mandalorian's ship, the Razor Crest, Kuiil helps arranges a trade meeting between them, which Kuiil assures the Mandalorian is the best way to regain the necessary parts to repair his ship. Kuiil helps foster a deal in which the Jawas will return the parts if the Mandalorian collects for them an egg from a dangerous nearby creature called a mudhorn, which the Mandalorian does. After collecting the parts, Kuiil spends several days helping the Mandalorian repair the Razor Crest. Afterward, the Mandalorian offers to share some of the reward he will receive for collecting the bounty on the Child, but Kuiil refuses. The Mandalorian also offers for Kuiil to accompany him off-planet and work for him, but Kuiil declines this request as well, preferring his peaceful life on Arvala-7, and wishing to never work for anyone else ever again due to his past with the Empire. Kuiil reappears in the show's penultimate episode, \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning, in which the Mandalorian returns to Arvala-7 with his ally Cara Dune. They seek Kuiil's help in protecting the Child during a mission on the planet Nevarro to eliminate an Imperial presence there. It is revealed that after the Mandalorian left Arvala-7, Kuiil found and rebuilt the bounty hunter droid IG-11, whom the Mandalorian had destroyed while rescuing the Child. After a lengthy process of retraining IG-11 to walk and operate again, Kuiil reprogrammed him to be a nurse droid and protector, rather than a hunter. Kuiil assigns IG-11 to protect the Child, and agrees to accompany the Mandalorian to help protect the Child from imperial slavery, under the condition that he bring along IG-11 and his blurrgs. On their way to the planet, Kuiil witnesses the Child use the Force to choke Cara after mistaking her for a threat. While the others in the party do not understand his power, Kuiil advises them about rumors he has heard about the Force. During their journey on Nevarro, Cara and the Mandalorian's party are attacked by a group of giant winged creatures, which they repel after losing several of the blurrgs. Later, experiencing a change of heart after the Child saves his life, the bounty hunter Greef Karga reveals the mission is an ambush, after which the Mandalorian is to be killed and the Child given over to the Imperials. Cara, the Mandalorian, and Greef instead devise a new plan: they will leave the Child behind, bring the Mandalorian to the Imperials as if he is a prisoner, and then eliminate them. At the Mandalorian's request, Kuiil agrees to take the Child back to the Razor Crest on his blurrg while the Mandalorian, Cara, and Greef attempt to eliminate the Imperials. When Imperial leader Moff Gideon later traps the Mandalorian and his party, the bounty hunter contacts Kuiil and urges him hurry back to the ship and lock it down for the Child's protection, but two Imperial Scout Troopers on speeder bikes intercept the message and rush to stop Kuiil. Kuiil rides his blurrg as fast as possible and nearly reaches the Razor Crest, but he is shot and killed by the troopers, who then take the Child. In the season finale \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\", Kuiil is not seen, but the Mandalorian returns to bury him, creating a makeshift tombstone with Kuiil's helmet resting atop a bed of rocks. Characterization Kuiil values the peace and tranquility he has established on Arvala-7, as shown by his willingness to assist the Mandalorian and other bounty hunters travel in finding the bounty they seek. He believes doing so will help maintain the peace, and that getting the asset off the planet will restore tranquility to Arvala-7. Kuiil's history of servitude to the Empire means he strongly values his freedom and independence, and he has no desire to work for anyone again other than himself, as demonstrated by his rejection of the Mandalorian's offer of employment. Kuill has worked hard to get away from his past and forge a new life for himself. Corey Plante of Inverse wrote: \\"There‚Äôs something admirable about Kuiil's values here. He's a humble, salt- of-the-earth character who doesn‚Äôt bother contemplating any sense of morality; he knows what he wants out of life, and every choice he makes furthers that end.\\" However, although Kuiil tries to avoid conflict at all costs, he does not hesitate to help those in need. He has a strong sense of honor, and believes in doing the right thing, as illustrated by his willingness to risk his safety and hard-won freedom to help the Child. The value he places on freedom due to his past experience factors into his determination to protect the Child from the Empire. Kuiil speaks directly and without hesitation, using few words and often cutting off any further argument or response by stating: \\"I have spoken.\\" Actress Misty Rosas, who delivered the performance of Kuiil, said she does not believe the line is meant to be arrogant or disrespectful, but rather speaks to Kuiil's philosophy on life: \\"He just simplifies everything in life, and is just like: 'I have spoken. You know, we're done talking about this. Don't complicate it, don't overthink it.'\\" Nevertheless, Kuiil's terse manner of speaking has resulted in reviewers describing him as both friendly, and grumpy, though he is ultimately kind-hearted beneath his sometimes rough exterior. as demonstrated by the compassion he shows for both IG-11 and the Child. Plante wrote: \\"He comes across as deeply rational and admirable, even if many people might mistake him for a bit of a jerk.\\" Kuiil is extremely hard-working, with a high level of mechanical skills, and craftsmanship. He is very resourceful, and highly proficient with technology, as demonstrated by his ability to repair IG-11 and the Razor Crest. Kuiil is very intelligent, offering wisdom and guidance to visitors on Arvala-7. He has lived a long time, and has seen and experienced many terrible things as a result of his past as an indentured servant, instilling a hardened world- weariness in him. Cautious, stoic, and patient, Kuiil presents a calm and composed temperament even in the face of the Mandalorian's occasional impatience. Kuiil is also a teacher, as he shows when he teaches the Mandalorian how to ride a blurrg, and teaches IG-11 how to walk and operate again following his reprogramming. This shows Kuiil's penchant for patience and affirmation, which Megan Crouse of Den of Geek writes is \\"the core of his character and part of what makes him so delightful\\". His patience is further demonstrated by his willingness to spend multiple days helping the Mandalorian repair his ship. Although the Mandalorian has trouble trusting anybody throughout the series, Kuiil earns his trust. Like all Ugnaughts, Kuiil has pink skin, white hair, upturned noses, and thick layers of jowls. He has a low, guttural voice that at times sounds like a raspy growl. Concept and creation Conception Kuiil was created as an original character for The Mandalorian, a live-action Star Wars television series that debuted on the Disney+ streaming service on November 12, 2019. Concept art was prepared for the character during pre-production, including an image by Christian Alzmann of Kuiil and the Mandalorian riding bluurgs alongside each other, and another by Jama Jurabaev of Kuiil and the Mandalorian at his moisture farm. Ugnaughts had first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) as workers on Cloud City, and reappeared in the sequel film Return of the Jedi (1983). They have also been featured on the television shows Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels, and Star Wars Resistance, as well as various Star Wars novels. The character of Kuiil was first publicly announced on October 28 with the release of a character poster of The Mandalorian solely featuring the character. The first footage of Kuiil was shown in a trailer for The Mandalorian released on November 6, 2019, less than a week before the show debuted. The trailer included a brief clip of Kuiil, as well as a small amount of dialogue from the forthcoming show, in which he said he has never met a Mandalorian before, but has heard stories about them. Portrayals Veteran actor Nick Nolte performed the voice of Kuiil. The voice of Kuiil was performed by veteran actor Nick Nolte. Nolte was seriously considered for the role of Han Solo in the original Star Wars (1977) film, losing out to Harrison Ford. In a 2011 interview, eight years before the release of The Mandalorian, Nolte said he would have been \\"kind of a goofy Star Wars guy\\" if he had been cast. Nolte completed his vocal performances for all of Kuiil's dialogue in The Mandalorian in a single afternoon session over the course of multiple hours. Although the news had leaked on the internet earlier, Nolte's casting was officially announced on November 30, 2018, though the character he would be portraying was not initially revealed. He was the third cast member publicly confirmed for the series, after Pedro Pascal and Gina Carano. Actress and stuntwoman Misty Rosas provided the physical performance for Kuiil, calling it \\"the most amazing job of my life\\". Rosas had a cold reading audition for the part in the summer of 2018, though she arranged via her agent to come in early and briefly review the script and familiarize herself with the material. Rosas, who was born with 65% hearing loss in her right ear, was having problems with her hearing at the time and had an appointment with an ear doctor just hours before the audition. She was nervous that these problems would negatively impact her audition and that she would be forced to read lips, which she fears would \\"[take her] out of the scene\\". Among the dialogue Rosas recited during her audition was Kuiil's signature line, \\"I have spoken\\", and she believed the producers studied her delivery of this line to gauge her understanding of the character. Rosas felt an immediate connection with the character based on her own life experiences, saying: \\"I know what it is to fight for your freedom.\\" Rosas also said she related to character's wise and thoughtful personality due to her regular practice of yoga. Costume Kuiil's face was brought to life through the use of animatronics and puppetry, with a head mask that was created by Legacy Effects, a shop of prosthetic makeup experts started by Stan Winston. The face itself was a foam latex mask that Rosas also wore for the part. The mouth and eyebrows were controlled by three puppeteers off-camera as Misty Rosas delivered her performances. The electronics from the face mask's animatronics were concealed inside a backpack Kuiil wears throughout the show, and concealed wires ran along the back of Rosas' neck from the backpack into the mask. The wires were spread apart to give Rosas the greatest possible freedom of motion. Batteries for the mask were concealed inside the pockets of Kuiil's costume. As a result of all the machinery, the mask was physically heavy and placed a great deal of pressure on Rosas' shoulder, neck, back, and core stability. However, Rosas said the weight of the costume ultimately aided her performance, since it helped her portray Kuiil's advanced age and slow walking speed. Kuiil's eyes are not part of the mask, and instead, Rosas' actual eyes with contacts are visible. Unlike some costumes Rosas has worn in past performances, she was able to see clearly while filming, but it was occasionally difficult to breathe because her mouth was far back within the mask. She occasionally needed to ask crew members to open the mouth of the mask for her between takes so she could breathe more freely. Some reviewers have noted that Kuiil's mask appears to have been designed to resemble Nick Nolte's face. Filming The performance of Kuiil was done by actress and stuntwoman Misty Rosas. Before scenes involving Kuiil were filmed, the cast and crew of The Mandalorian held private rehearsals with actress Misty Rosas in which she did not wear the costume. Jon Favreau, creator and showrunner of the series, attended these rehearsals, in which they would attempt to determine the rhythm and timing of each scene. Rosas called the rehearsals \\"the most nerve-wracking for me\\". Nick Nolte recorded dialogue for Kuiil before the character's live-action scenes were filmed, providing multiple takes with different performances and vocal inclinations for the crew to choose from. Rosas felt Nolte's voice work for Kuiil was \\"beautiful\\". The recordings would not be available until the mornings of filming, so Rosas prepared a great deal in advance for her scenes, studying the dialogue carefully, so that shooting would go as smoothly as possible. Once the dialogue was ready, Rosas and other members of the crew, including the episode's director, would listen to the various recordings, arrange the chosen recordings, and prepare to shoot the scenes. It was complicated and often difficult for the puppeteers to match Kuiil's facial movements to Nolte's vocal tracks during filming; Misty said of the process: \\"We were so proud and we wanted it so bad, so we really, really focused and worked really hard.\\" Scenes with large amount of dialogue from Kuiil were particularly difficult. Rosas and the puppeteers prepared extensively to ensure their efforts were coordinated, and during filming she would provide them a non-verbal signal to indicate when she was about to act out a line of dialogue so they could operate the mask. Occasionally the puppeteers would miss her signals, particularly during scenes that were dimly lit, and multiple takes were necessary as a result. Kuiil often holds the Child during his scenes in \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\", which is a puppet prop filled with animatronics. This made the Child relatively heavy, which occasionally proved challenging for Rosas, who also had to manage the weight of the animatronics in her own costume. One full day of filming the episode focused upon Kuiil riding the blurrg, a process Rosas described as \\"intense\\" due to the amount of time she spent on the fake creature and the speeds at which it was made to appear to run. The process was made further challenging because she was carrying the heavy animatronic Child prop throughout the scenes, and she occasionally needed breaks between takes. Rosas said: \\"My legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for dear life and holding the baby.\\" However, Rosas was able to place the weight of her animatronics-filled backpack on the saddle of the blurrg while filming the scenes, which helped relieve pressure on her shoulders, neck, and back. While the closing credits music for The Mandalorian is usually fairly upbeat, a slower and sadder composition was used for \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\" because the credits immediately followed Kuiil's death in the final scene. Themes The dynamic between Kuiil and IG-11 reflect a childrearing theme that is prevalent among multiple characters throughout the first season of The Mandalorian. The two have a relationship similar to that of a father and son, as demonstrated in the scene in which Kuiil teaches IG-11 how to operate and function after the droid is reprogrammed. This dynamic is similar to the one shared by the Mandalorian and the child throughout the season. The Kuiil and IG-11 scenes also demonstrate that the way in which the \\"child\\" character is raised makes a significant difference in whether the child becomes an asset or a threat to those around him. The droid was a dangerous assassin before Kuiil reprogrammed him, but thanks to the Ugnaught's parenting, he becomes a protector and helper instead. This, too, is similar to the relationship between the Mandalorian and the Child. For example, the scene in which the Child uses the Force to choke Cara Dune shows that the Child has the potential for evil if he is not properly guided by his \\"parent\\". Kuiil's reprogramming of IG-11 raises nature versus nurture themes in The Mandalorian. Even after IG-11 is reprogrammed, the Mandalorian does not believe he has truly changed, because he believes droids have an essential nature and that IG-11's nature remains murderous and untrustworthy. But in reprogramming IG-11, Kuiil nurtures him and helps him to change; Kuiil feels that in the process of learning how to function again, IG-11 gained a new personality. Kuiil insists to the Mandalorian: \\"Droids are not good or bad ‚Äî they are neutral reflections of those who program them.\\" Keith Phipps of Vulture wrote of IG-11 and the nature versus nurture theme: \\"He's not bad. He's just programmed that way, and with care and change he can do a lot of good in the world.\\" Additionally, Leo Holman of Comic Book Resources said the character of Kuiil raises questions about the Galactic Empire that have never before been considered in Star Wars. The fact that Kuiil had been an indentured servant for the Empire invites the question of whether this is a prevalent type of Imperial practice: \\"It makes you wonder, how many of the characters we see in the background working for the Empire in various other Star Wars movies and media, are there against their will working towards freedom?\\" Additionally, the fact that Kuiil ultimately pays off his debt and buys his freedom raises the further question about whether species enslaved by the Empire can eventually earn their freedom through hard work, a concept that had never been featured in any other Star Wars media before The Mandalorian. Cultural impact Critical reception Kuiil has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike. He has been described as a fan favorite, and several reviews have called him the best character on the show. His line \\"I have spoken\\" became one of the better-known and best-liked lines of dialogue from the series, and has been the subject of internet memes used by fans. Screen Rant Writer Kiki Evans called it one of the \\"most iconic phrases\\" from the series. Leo Holman of Comic Book Resources declared Kuiil The Mandalorians best character, writing: \\"At first glance, [Kuiil] seemed like a throwaway character, but with every line of dialogue the character spoke, he became more and more interesting and helped shine a light on parts of the Star Wars universe that have never been explored.\\" Charlie Ridgely of Comicbook.com described Kuiil as \\"one of the most memorable additions to the Star Wars canon in recent years\\". Space.com writer Scott Snowden called Kuiil one of the best characters on the show, describing him as quirky, interesting, and \\"beautifully portrayed\\", and particularly praising the level of detail and animatronic control in his facial expressions. Corey Plante of Inverse called Kuiil \\"the best and most under-appreciated character\\" on the show, and said that he felt the choice to make a member of a little-known Star Wars species such an important element of the show made the franchise feel larger and richer. He wrote: \\"Star Wars is better because Kuiil exists.\\" Mustafa Gatollari of Distractify called Kuiil one of the best parts of The Mandalorian, and praised the show for implementing the Ugnaught species, a previously minor element of Star Wars, in such an effective way. Q.V. Hough of Screen Rant described Kuiil's character arc as \\"heroic\\" and said the character is \\"bound to be remembered by fans as one of the season's best characters\\". Den of Geek writer Megan Crouse said that she felt the character was a wise old mentor trope, but that this worked well, in part due to Kuiil's likeable personality and the strong performances of Nolte and Rosas. Crouse wrote: \\"He's the Obi-Wan Kenobi, and, right now, that's okay.\\" Noah Howell of Niner Times called Kuiil his favorite character on ths show, saying his humble and unassuming nature \\"instantly made me fall in love with him\\". He compared the dynamic of Kuill and the Mandalorian to that of Luke Skywalker and Yoda in the original Star Wars trilogy. Ana Dumaraog felt Kuiil's death was unfortunate, but well-handled by the show. Forbes writer Erik Kain liked that Kuiil was not abandoned after his initial episodes and instead returned to play a major part in the final episodes of the season. Mike Hale of The New York Times said Nick Nolte provided a \\"nicely acerbic voice\\" for the character. Screen Rant ranked Kuiil seventh on its list of the best characters from the first season of The Mandalorian, and fifth on a separate list of the most interesting characters from the season. When Kuiil was killed in \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\", the episode ended on a shot of his unconscious body. Fans on the internet expressed hope that it would be revealed in the next episode that he had survived, or that IG-11 or another character would revive him, before his death was confirmed on-screen. Some fans have speculated that the Mandalorian may eventually give the Child the name Kuiil in memory of the Ugnaught. Merchandise A Funko Pop figurine of Kuiil was announced on December 31, 2019.

An extremely deadly and efficient bounty hunter droid, IG-11 initially attempts to capture and kill an alien known as the Child, but is stopped and destroyed by another bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian. IG-11 is later repaired by the Ugnaught alien Kuiil and reprogrammed as a nurse and protector of the Child, and an ally of the Mandalorian. The voice of IG-11 is performed by Taika Waititi, who was offered the part by The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau based on their mutual work in the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Waititi said he tried to create a voice that lacked human emotion while still maintaining some semblance of humanity, and described his performance as a cross between Siri and HAL 9000. IG-11 closely resembles another Star Wars bounty hunter named IG-88, so much so that fans and journalists initially mistook IG-11 for the other droid when the character was first unveiled. Although capable of great destruction, IG-11 also occasionally provides comedic moments in The Mandalorian, and Waititi felt the character had a childlike innocence and naivety. His transformation from bounty hunter to protector drew discussions about nature versus nurture and the sentience of droids in the Star Wars universe. IG-11 has been received positively by reviewers and has been described as a fan favorite, with some calling him one of the best droids in the franchise. Waititi was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance, making it his first Emmy nomination and the first nominee of the category for a live action series. Appearances IG-11 was in three episodes in the first season of The Mandalorian, making his first appearance in the series premiere episode \\"Chapter 1: The Mandalorian\\", which first aired on November 12, 2019. He is an IG-series assassin droid, a dangerous model which has largely been outlawed. In his first appearance, IG-11 is a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and attempts to capture an unidentified living being, which is also being sought by a fellow bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian, the show's protagonist. The Mandalorian has a distrust for all droids that stems from the fact that battle droids attacked his home planet and killed his parents during the Clone Wars when he was a child. This creates tension between himself and IG-11. Both the Mandalorian and IG-11 track the being to a compound on the planet Arvala-7, guarded by a large number of mercenaries of the Nikto alien species. While the Mandalorian is scouting the compound from afar, IG-11 simply walks up and demands they hand it over, resulting in a large gunfight, which The Mandalorian eventually joins. The two agree to team up and split the reward. They eventually eliminate the mercenaries and shoot their way into the compound, where they discover the asset, an alien of the same species as Yoda known as \\"the Child\\". IG-11 attempts to kill him, but the Mandalorian shoots IG-11 in the head and destroys him in order to protect the Child. IG-11 returns in the season's penultimate episode \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\", in which the Ugnaught alien Kuiil, an ally of the Mandalorian living on Arvala-7, repairs IG-11 and reprograms him to be a nurse droid. After Kuiil teaches IG-11 how to walk again, the droid takes on a more docile personality than before, serving meals and tea to guests and helping Kuiil feed his domesticated blurrg creatures. Kuiil set the droid's base function as \\"to nurse and protect\\". When the Mandalorian and his ally Cara Dune visit Kuiil seeking help with a mission on the planet Nevarro, they are surprised to find IG-11 alive and initially draw their weapons on him, until Kuiil assures them he will not harm them. Kuiil and IG-11 accompany the Mandalorian and Cara to Nevarro to help protect the Child during the mission. IG-11's new programming means he no longer wants to kill the Child and is instead committed to protecting it, though the Mandalorian still does not trust the droid. IG-11 made his final Mandalorian appearance in the first-season finale, \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\". At the start of the episode, after Imperial Scout Troopers have killed Kuiil and kidnapped the Child, IG-11 catches up with the troopers outside of a nearby town, incapacitates them, and reclaims the child. The droid then steals one of their speeder bikes and rides into the town, where he finds he Mandalorian, Cara, and the bounty hunter Greef Karga surrounded by stormtroopers being led by a man named Moff Gideon. IG-11 comes to their assistance, killing multiple stormtroopers while protecting the Child and helping the party retreat to a bunker. The Mandalorian is seriously injured and, still distrusting of droids, he assumes IG-11 is going to kill him, but instead the droid heals him with the use of bacta. IG-11 removes his helmet to treat serious injuries he sustained, marking the first time in the series that we see the Mandalorian's face; he initially objects, because his culture requires that no living thing see him without his helmet, to which IG-11 responds: \\"I am not a living thing.\\" The exchange ultimately wins IG-11 the trust of the Mandalorian. Later, after IG-11 helps the party escape from the bunker into the sewer system, they come across a Mandalorian armorer in the tunnels, who provides them an escape route aboard a droid-controlled floating barge on a river of lava. As the barge approaches the tunnel exit, the Mandalorian's scans reveal that a large number of Moff Gideon's stormtroopers are hiding at the tunnel gate in an ambush. IG-11 concludes there was no scenario in which the Child could be saved and IG-11 would survive, so he decided to sacrifice himself. He asked the Mandalorian for an assurance that the Child would be safe in his care, which would allow him to default to his secondary command so he could self-destruct. The Mandalorian refuses at first, insisting they still need IG-11, but eventually he reluctantly agreed. He is saddened at the loss of IG-11, to which the droid responds: \\"There's nothing to be sad about. I've never been alive.\\" IG-11 then walks through the river of lava, which causes him to start to melt down, but before doing so he reaches the stormtrooper squadron and detonates himself in the middle of them, killing them all in an explosion and ensuring safe passage for the others. Characterization IG-11 has a thin body made of an armored substrate, making it durable and able to withstand repeated assaults. He is an excellent and efficient fighter and an extremely accurate shot, capable of eliminating many enemies even when outnumbered. Taika Waititi, the actor who performs his voice, compared IG-11 to the Terminator, the murderous android character from the media franchise of the same name. IG-11 is also very fast, as illustrated by his ability to quickly catch up on foot to the two Imperial Scout Troopers who abduct the Child, even though they were riding on speeder bikes. When first introduced in The Mandalorian, IG-11 is a ruthless killer, willing to annihilate his victims, and is single-minded in his purpose to collect upon his bounties. Once reprogrammed by Kuiil, IG-11 is still capable of great destruction, but his instincts now are for servitude and protection of the child instead of killing. He remains direct, stoic, and by-the-book, but his personality becomes obedient and deferential, with IG-11 serving the characters meals and tea like a maid. However, he shows the same level of determination he had as a bounty hunter when he is learning, or relearning, everything following his reprogramming. IG-11 does not understand sarcasm or know how to lie. Waititi described him as having a childlike innocence and naivety, saying: \\"It's like a child with a gun.\\" IG-11 is often a comedic character, with his straightforward personality and monotonic line delivery providing what Kofi Outlaw of Comicbook.com called \\"unique off-beat droid humor\\". Waititi believed IG-11 became \\"a very lovable character\\" as the season progressed. Armaan Babu of Media Entertainment Arts WorldWide suggested there is a particular bond between IG-11 and Kuiil because they share similar histories: \\"Both IG-11 and Kuiil have violent pasts that they were sold and forced into against their will, who are now learning to live life on their own terms.\\" Conception IG-11 closely resembles the IG-88 (pictured), a bounty hunter droid featured in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), so much so that fans and journalists mistook the new character for IG-88 when he was first announced. IG-11 closely resembles a bounty hunter droid character of a similar model in the Star Wars franchise named IG-88, who made a brief appearance during one scene in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) as one of several bounty hunters with whom Darth Vader meets. IG-88 stands in one place during the scene and does not move, so IG-11 marked the first time this type of droid was seen moving and in action in a live-action production. The Mandalorian executive producer Dave Filoni said of IG-88: \\"People forget in Empire, you never even see him walk or take a step ‚Äì the prop was actually bolted to the floor. So just giving (IG-11) feet was something new and original.\\" The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau first revealed IG-11 on Christmas of 2018, via a photo on the social media network Instagram of the character standing in front of a green screen, without identifying him by name. The character was then featured prominently in posters, commercials, and other promotional materials in advance of the release of The Mandalorian. IG-11 immediately became a highly anticipated character among fans familiar with IG-88, and many fans and journalists mistook the character for the actual IG-88 due to their resemblance. In an Entertainment Weekly article that ran on April 14, 2019, Favreau clarified that the character was not IG-88, but rather an entirely new character named IG-11. Filoni said rather than simply reusing IG-88, he preferred establishing a new character without any defined backstory and contributing something new to the Star Wars universe. Filoni noted that IG-88 already had a well-established character history in the Star Wars expanded universe, which extends to novels, comic books, video games, and other mediums, even though most of his stories were no longer considered official canon following Disney's purchase of the franchise. Filoni also cited the success of Ahsoka Tano, a new character introduced in the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars and later featured in the show Star Wars Rebels, as further validating for introducing a new character in IG-11 rather than re-using an old one. Portrayal Taika Waititi (pictured) provided the voice of IG-11, and also directed the season finale episode that includes the character's final appearance. IG-11 was voiced by actor and director Taika Waititi. Favreau offered him the part, having become familiar with Waititi through their mutual work on films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Favreau directed Iron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2 (2010) and portrayed Happy Hogan in several Marvel films, while Waititi directed Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and played Korg in two Marvel films. Favreau was impressed by Waititi's creativity and energy, describing him as \\"a powerhouse right now, creatively\\". He was also impressed by Waititi's comedic background and abilities, as well as his passion for the Star Wars franchise: \\"He brings his style of humor to it, but he was also a fan. To me, that was the bottom line.\\" The casting was first announced by Favreau on March 21, 2019, when he posted a photo on Instagram of Waititi recording dialogue for the character. Waititi also directed the first- season finale, which included IG-11's final appearance in the series. Waititi said it was a challenge to come up with the voice for IG-11 because it had to lack human emotion and personality while still maintaining some semblance of humanity, which he described as a subtle and tricky balance. He described the voice somewhere between those of Siri, the virtual assistant of Apple Inc. products, and HAL 9000, the artificial intelligence character from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Waititi said he felt IG-11 had an \\"amazing arc\\", changing and evolving as the series progressed. Themes Kuiil's reprogramming of IG-11 raises nature versus nurture themes in The Mandalorian. Even after IG-11 is reprogrammed, the Mandalorian does not believe he has truly changed, because he believes droids have an essential nature and that IG-11's nature remains murderous and untrustworthy. But in reprogramming IG-11, Kuiil nurtures him and helps him to change; Kuiil feels that in the process of learning how to function again, IG-11 gained a new personality. Kuiil insists to the Mandalorian: \\"Droids are not good or bad ‚Äî they are neutral reflections of those who program them.\\" Keith Phipps of Vulture wrote of IG-11 and the nature versus nurture theme: \\"He's not bad. He's just programmed that way, and with care and change he can do a lot of good in the world.\\" The dynamic between Kuiil and IG-11 reflect a childrearing theme that is prevalent among multiple characters throughout the first season of The Mandalorian. The two have a relationship similar to that of a father and son, as demonstrated in the scene in which Kuiil teaches IG-11 how to operate and function after the droid is reprogrammed. This dynamic is similar to the one shared by the Mandalorian and the child throughout the season. The Kuiil and IG-11 scenes also demonstrate that the way in which the \\"child\\" character is raised makes a significant difference in whether the child becomes an asset or a threat to those around him. The droid was a dangerous assassin before Kuiil reprogrammed him, but thanks to the Ugnaught's parenting, he becomes a protector and helper instead. This, too, is similar to the relationship between the Mandalorian and the Child. For example, the scene in which the Child uses the Force to choke Cara Dune shows that the Child has the potential for evil if he is not properly guided by his \\"parent\\". Additionally, Phipps questions of whether IG-11's destructive behavior around the Child could ultimately be bad for his development, even though the violence is intended to protect him. Since the Child may be learning by observing, Phipps suggests his Force power could become very dangerous if he uses it for violence like IG-11 does: \\"That look of wonder in the Child's eyes as IG-11 kills and kills again is hilarious, but also a little chilling.\\" IG-11 also raises questions about the sentience of droids in the Star Wars universe. IG-11, like many droids in the franchise, appear to have a distinct personality and be almost fully sentient, but still accept full servitude to their biological masters and allies. Babu wrote: \\"Are the droids in the Star Wars universe all slaves, or is their free will merely an illusion borne of their programming, rendering the slavery question moot but bringing up a lot more? IG-11 seems like just the droid to explore that concept further.\\" Reception IG-11 has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike. Following the release of the season finale, a large number of fans took to social media outlets like Twitter to discuss and voice their appreciation for the character, with some calling him the best droid in the Star Wars franchise. Gina Carbone of CinemaBlend called IG-11 a \\"fan favorite\\", particularly praising his \\"amazing\\" final scene in the finale. Charles Ridgely of Comicbook.com called IG-11 \\"one of the most beloved characters in recent Star Wars history\\", as well as \\"the real MVP\\" of the season finale and possibly the entire series. He wrote: \\"If you've never been emotional about a droid before, IG-11 will certainly make it happen.\\" Some fans on Twitter said IG-11's sacrifice was more powerful than a scene in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in which C-3PO similarly puts himself in danger to help his friends. Umberto Gonzalez of TheWrap described the character as a scene stealer. Screen Rant placed IG-11 ranked sixth on list of the most interesting characters from the first season of The Mandalorian, and fourth on a separate list of the best characters introduced by the show. He also ranked sixth on a CinemaBlend list of the most iconic droids of the Star Wars franchise. Screen Rant writer Kevin Pantoja called IG-11 \\"awesome from the moment we meet it\\", and said Taika Waititi's vocal performance is a large part of the character's appeal. Keith Phipps of Vulture said of IG-11 in the series finale: \\"The title may still read The Mandalorian, but this episode really belongs to IG-11.\\" Armaan Babu called IG-11 \\" of the most interesting droids in the 'Star Wars' universe\\", describing his transformation from bounty hunter to protector a \\"surprisingly effective tale\\". Babu felt the story of IG-11 and Kuiil was strong enough that they warranted their own spin-off series. Likewise, Variety writer Will Thorne called IG-11's reprogramming and evolution surprising and unexpectedly moving: \\"Who knew we needed an emotional droid rehabilitation segment?\\" Taika Waititi has said of the character: \\"He really held up the entire season, didn't he? From episode one all the way through, he was the hero.\\" In a January 2020 interview with TheWrap, Waititi said he believed fans should start a petition to bring IG-11 back for the second season of The Mandalorian, though some journalists believed the suggestion was facetious. Merchandise A Funko Pop figurine of IG-11 was announced on December 31, 2019. An action figure of the character was released by Hot Toys, and Hasbro released a six-inch action figure of the character as part of the company's Star Wars: The Black Series toy line.

Portrayed by actress and former mixed martial artist Gina Carano, she is a former Rebel shock trooper turned mercenary who becomes an ally to the title character of the series. The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau created Cara Dune with Carano specifically in mind and did not audition any other actresses for the part. A highly trained and battle-hardened special forces warrior, Cara is skilled in the use of weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, and battle tactics, and has an intense hatred for the Galactic Empire. Carano described the character as a loner who is having trouble readjusting to society following her career as a soldier. Favreau sought to create a strong and independent character, but one different from Princess Leia or other powerful Star Wars female characters. Carano performed many of her own stunts on The Mandalorian. She credits Bryce Dallas Howard, who directed the first episode featuring Cara Dune, with helping Carano find how to best translate the character from the script to the screen. Cara has been received positively by reviews and fans, and has been described as a feminist role model, with some reviewers calling her unique even among the Star Wars franchise's female characters due to her physicality and combat skills. Appearances Cara Dune appeared in three episodes in the first season of The Mandalorian. In the first-season finale, it is revealed that Cara's full name is Carasynthia Dune, and her home world is Alderaan, the planet destroyed by the Death Star in the first Star Wars (1977) film. She is a former shock trooper with the Rebel Alliance, who fought against the Galactic Empire in the Galactic Civil War depicted in the original Star Wars trilogy, and helped establish the New Republic form of government following that conflict. In exposition from The Mandalorian, Cara reveals that most of her past work as a Rebel soldier involved eliminating Imperial warlords and other remnants of the Empire following the Battle of Endor, the decisive Rebel victory depicted in Return of the Jedi (1983). Her role as a shock trooper was to be dropped behind enemy lines with no support, and cause as much damage as possible (i.e. comparable to the US Navy SEALs or British SAS). The dialogue also establishes that she left the Alliance after her role shifted to a more political \\"peacekeeping\\" role, such as protecting delegates and suppressing riots, which Cara said was \\"not what I signed up for\\". After taking what she calls \\"early retirement\\" from her military position, she became a mercenary, and began drifting from planet to planet. She eventually became wanted for reasons not yet disclosed by the show, leading her to hide out on the forest planet Sorgan. Cara made her first appearance in \\"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\\", the fourth episode of The Mandalorian. On the planet Sorgan, she meets the show's title character, a bounty hunter known simply as the Mandalorian, and each wrongly believes the one was attempting to collect a bounty on each other. This results in the two briefly engaging in hand-to-hand combat during their first encounter, ending in a stalemate. They reconcile and ultimately join forces to defend a village against a ravaging band of raiders of the Klatooinian species. Cara and the Mandalorian help prepare defensive obstacles and protective positions throughout the village, as well as train the villagers for combat. Lacking sufficient weapons to take down the raiders' AT-ST, they develop a plan to use the environment of the village, digging ponds deep enough for the walker to collapse after stepping into them. These measures prove effective during the battle, but when the AT-ST fails to advance far enough to fall into the pond traps, Cara successfully lures it forward by leaping into the pond herself and attacking it at close range. When the walker moves forward to target her and becomes stuck, the Mandalorian destroys it with a thermal detonator. After the battle, Cara saves the life of the Child, a young alien creature under the Mandalorian's protection, when she finds and kills a bounty hunter just before it is about to execute the Child. As a result, the Mandalorian realizes he must take the Child away from Sorgan, and he invites Cara to come along with them, but she declines. Cara reappears in the episode \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\", when the Mandalorian recruits her for a mission to the planet Nevarro to eliminate an Imperial presence there. When he first finds her, she is participating in fights with challengers for money. Cara is initially reluctant to leave Sorgan, but when the Mandalorian explains that the targets are Imperials, she immediately agrees. While traveling to Nevarro on the Mandalorian's ship, she participates in a friendly arm wrestling match with him, but the Child mistakes her actions as aggressive and uses the Force to choke her, only stopping after the Mandalorian intervenes. During their journey, Cara and the Mandalorian's party are attacked by a group of pterodactyl-like creatures, which they repel after taking casualties. The bounty hunter Greef Karga is critically injured and Cara attempts to apply first aid, but the Child uses the Force to heal him. Later, Greef reveals the mission is an ambush, after which the Mandalorian is to be killed and the Child given over to the Imperials. Cara, the Mandalorian, and Greef instead devise a new plan: they will leave the Child behind, bring the Mandalorian to the Imperials as if he is a prisoner, and then eliminate them. The plan goes wrong, resulting in the trio becoming pinned down inside a cantina by Imperial officer Moff Gideon and his stormtroopers. At the start of the first-season finale \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\", the group engages in a brief gunfight with the stormtroopers after IG-11, the bounty hunter droid, arrives with the Child to provide assistance. The Mandalorian is badly injured during the fight, and Cara drags him back into the cantina to safety. The group escapes the building via the sewer system, and flee on a droid-controlled floating barge on a river of lava. Cara is present when IG-11 sacrifices himself to eliminate a large number of stormtroopers to ensure the group's escape, and she survives an attack by Moff Gideon in a TIE fighter, which the Mandalorian repels. Afterward, Cara decides to stay on Nevarro to help eliminate any remaining Imperial presence on the planet, and Greef invites her to work as his enforcer, which she appears to accept. The character will return for the second season of The Mandalorian. Characterization Cara Dune is a battle- hardened warrior, with a tough and aggressive personality, but also a kindness beneath her gruff exterior. Gina Carano, the actress and former mixed martial artist who plays the character, said Cara and the Mandalorian are similar in personality and background, and that the two understand each other and were able to form a bond as a result. A highly trained fighter, she is muscular, an extremely accurate shot, and has excellent hand-to-hand combat skills, as shown immediately in her fight with the Mandalorian when Cara is first introduced. She is one of the few in the show who is able to match the Mandalorian in direct combat. Olivia Luchini of PopSugar described Cara as a feminist role model, and called her unique even among the Star Wars franchise's strong female characters due to her physicality and combat skills. Carano called Cara as \\"a bit of a loner\\", who is having trouble reintegrating herself into society following her combat experience. The fact that she mistakes the Mandalorian for attempting to collect a bounty on her during their first meeting indicates she has done some unsavory things since leaving the military; Carano said of this: \\"I feel like she's always in trouble.\\" As a soldier, Cara enjoyed the adrenaline of war, and when that disappeared during peace time, she found herself disillusioned with her new role. Carano has said suggested Cara is questioning whether she agreed with everything that occurred during her military service, and that her experiences at war taken a psychological toll on her. When introduced in The Mandalorian, Cara kept to herself, did not easily trust others, and cared about little except her survival, keeping her skills sharp, and killing Imperials. However, she also has a strong sense of loyalty, as shown by her refusal to abandon the Mandalorian after he is seriously injured in the first-season finale. Cara has an intense hatred for the Empire, which is driven in large part by its role in the destruction of her home planet of Alderaan. Cara is not afraid to argue back against the Mandalorian or point out his faults, and she feels uncomfortable when asked to hold the Child, saying she does not \\"do the baby thing\\". The Angry Staff Officer, an anonymous Army National Guard officer who writes for Wired magazine, has called Cara one of the more tactically- proficient characters in Star Wars. He called Cara perhaps \\"the one person in the Star Wars universe to actually absorb some lessons learned\\" from her past combat engagements. The writer described the defensive measure the Mandalorian and Cara develop to protect the village in \\"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\\" as a \\"near- perfect defensive engagement\\", and praised Cara's efforts in luring the AT-ST into a vulnerable position, as well as the way she and the villagers quickly identified their priorities of work, such as establishing obstacles, building protective positions, and training the villagers to fight. In another example, he cited a scene in the first-season finale in which Cara assists an injured Mandalorian by dragging him into cover for assessment while providing covering fire. He said other Star Wars characters in this situation have simply tended to the victim in the middle of the firefight, a dangerous scenario, while Cara's method is safer method recommended by the United States Armed Forces. He wrote: \\"Cara Dune would receive a 'go' for all the performance measures for this U.S. Army medical task.\\" Concept and creation Conception Cara Dune was conceived by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian. The character of Cara Dune was conceived by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian. He sought to make a strong and independent character, but one different from Princess Leia or other powerful female characters previously featured in the franchise. Gina Carano said Favreau \\"wanted my character to be this new soldier of women, and he wanted her to have an impact\\". Favreau said it was the type of character he always wished to portray as an actor himself, describing her as \\"raising the stakes and raising hell\\". The writers checked with executive producer Dave Filoni, who had been involved in past Star Wars works, to make sure the Rebel shock trooper position was consistent with the past continuity of the franchise. False rumors had circulated on the Internet about what type of character Cara would be prior to any official announcements about her were made public. Cara Dune was first publicly unveiled during the Star Wars Celebration convention in Chicago on April 14, 2019, along with the character Greef Karga. The event also featured teaser footage with Cara, a still photo of the character, and included a panel discussion with Carano and Carl Weathers, the actor who portrays Greef, talking about their characters. Cara was subsequently featured prominently in posters, commercials, and marketing materials in advance of the release of The Mandalorian. On September 4, Entertainment Weekly unveiled an exclusive photo of Cara and the Mandalorian fighting together, and on October 28, a character poster of The Mandalorian solely featuring Cara Dune was released. Portrayal Carano's casting was first announced on December 12, 2018, though the news had been leaked on the Internet before the formal announcement. The production of The Mandalorian called for more secrecy than any other job of Carano's career. Prior to filming one of Cara's first scenes, Carano said Favreau told her that playing this character was going to change Carano's career trajectory, giving her more self-confidence as an actress providing her the opportunity to play stronger roles in the future. Carano said she had a strong positive emotional reaction to the conversation, and that it helped her play the role of Cara Dune more confidently, saying: \\"I feel like my whole life since I shot that has been a different world.\\" Carano credited Bryce Dallas Howard, who directed the first episode featuring Cara, with helping Carano determine how to best translate the character from the script to the screen during their work together in Cara's debut episode. For the premiere screening of The Mandalorian, Carano requested that her hairstyle be based upon that of Star Wars prequel trilogy character Padm√© Amidala. Maria Sandoval, the lead hairstylist on The Mandalorian, prepared the hairstyle for her. Costume Cara Dune's costume was designed by concept artist Brian Matyas and costume designer Joseph Porro. Gina Carano said she was impressed by the amount of detail the crew of The Mandalorian achieved in their costuming, saying of them: \\"These people are legit.\\" The costume is mostly black, with armor pieces on the chest and shoulders showing wear from battle damage, and Three lines with black and silver bars running across the sternum. The costume includes two thick belts, one black and one green, as well as holsters for blasters and knives, and a brace on the right knee. The costume also includes thick black gloves metal on the fingers and knuckles, as well as wrist armor and large black boots. The creation of Cara's costume began with a mold being made of Carano's body, a process she did not enjoy. The shoulders were built out and the waist cinched in, to create a distinctive hourglass- shaped silhouette for the character. The Mandalorian executive producer Kathleen Kennedy had stressed the importance of Cara having a distinctive silhouette because she felt all Star Wars characters should be recognizable from a great distance. Jon Favreau, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Dave Filoni provided input on the costume, with Howard in particular making suggestions about how to convey toughness without sacrificing femininity, while also ensuring Carano would be able to perform the athletic feats required of the character. Carano stressed the importance of this: \\"How do you put basically football padding on a busty curvy female? I didn't want to be a block. I didn‚Äôt want to just be this like big, buff refrigerator.\\" Cara's hairstyle was originally planned to be short, with one side completely buzzed, but Carano objected to this because she wanted to maintain the character's femininity. Maria Sandoval, who described Cara as her favorite character on the show, instead developed a shoulder-length hairstyle with rough edges. The hairstyle was partially inspired by that of director Deborah Chow, who had directed several The Mandalorian first-season episodes. Howard said while she and the producers of the series were discussing Cara's costume, they observed Chow directing and noticed the way her hair was gathered and stylized with braids, and elements of it were factored into Cara Dune's hairstyle. Cara was provided a blaster prop similar in appearance to the firearm used by Han Solo in the Star Wars films. The character also has a handful of tattoos, including a small Rebel Alliance insignia under the left eye, and a series of tattoos and bars around her that signify her as a veteran of the Rebellion, something that had been featured on characters on the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Carano said the Rebel insignia tattoo in particular has a deeper back story that will be revealed later in future seasons. The costume was on display at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California in August 2019. Filming Cara Dune's scenes were filmed in a studio in Manhattan Beach, California. Favreau and Filoni discussed elements of Cara's back story with Carano before filming to help inform her performance, and just before filming the introductory scene of Cara's debut episode, Favreau shared secrets about the character that would not be revealed until later in the series. Carano said having this information helped inform her performance and \\"added so much depth to what her life has been like\\". Carano said she enjoyed performing against lead actor Pedro Pascal, who plays the Mandalorian, and other masked characters in the show, and she said it was easy for her to do so because, in her everyday life, \\"I don't naturally see what somebody's physical appearance is. I instantly kind of feel who a person is.\\" As a result, she said she could often tell what faces Pascal was making or what emotions he was expressing beneath the mask, despite not seeing his face. Pascal said of working with her: \\"I couldn't feel in better hands than in the hands of Gina Carano.\\" Bryce Dallas Howard (pictured) has been credited with helping Gina Carano find how to best translate Cara Dune from the script to the screen. During filming of Cara's first episode, Bryce Dallas Howard Howard listened to Carano's thoughts and ideas during the filming process, watched replays with her after shooting scenes, and communicated with Carano as a fellow actress, since Howard herself is also an actress. Carano said of Howard: \\"She was very motherly and protective of our performances.\\" Howard also allowed Carano to have as many takes as she needed to get the performance right, which the actress said put her at ease. Howard enjoyed exploring the aggressive side of Cara's personality with Carano, particularly because Cara is different than the types of characters Howard usually plays as an actress herself. By directing Carano, Howard felt she was able to vicariously experience what it was like to be Cara. During Carano's first day of filming, she was required to ride the mechanical blurrg, a reptilian mounted creature that was so large she needed a ladder to climb atop it. Pascal was unavailable for many of her scenes on \\"Chapter 4: Sanctuary\\" because he was auditioning for another series, so Howard mostly worked with Pascal's body double. As a result, she called Carano \\"the face of the episode\\". The actress had a stomach flu when her scenes fighting the AT-ST were filmed, which along with two nights of rain in advance of the shoot made the scene very challenging. Her introductory scene in which the Mandalorian and Cara fight each other was originally written differently, but it was changed on the set by Favreau and Howard as the stunt team worked on choreography and previsualization. Carano said one of the changes was \\"we made it to where she got the jump on him.\\" Carano said the set of The Mandalorian is \\"not a green screen set\\", but rather is very realistic, even with the alien characters and other fantasy elements. She said this helps her performance and has been \\"an incredible blessing for my imagination\\". According to Carano, she passed out twice while filming the scene in \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\" when the Child uses the Force to choke her. On March 6, 2020, Carano posted an Instagram photo of herself in the Cara Dune costume on the set of The Mandalorian to mark the end of filming for the second season, writing: \\"I absolutely love this work and the people in it.\\" Stunts Carano collaborates and works closely with The Mandalorian stunt team, and she believes they \\"accepted me as one of their own\\", in part due to her mixed martial arts background. She said the stunt team \\"have been like brothers and sisters to me\\". Carano performed many of the stunts herself. For example, Carano herself drags a wounded comrade off a battlefield during one of her scenes, which surprised many of the bystanders on the set. Carano also outpaced Pascal's stunt double in one scene, and in another she sent a stunt performer flying across the set due to the force of one of her kicks. Carano believes her fighting scenes have been aided not only by her mixed martial arts skills, but also her training in ballet, jazz dancing, and tap dancing as a child. She said some fighters have trouble transitioning into acting because they want to appear tough and have trouble performing in scenes in which they lose fights or take hits, but Carano said her early arts training helped her avoid that. Cultural impact Critical reception Gina Carano has been received positively by reviews and fans. She said most of the feedback about the character she has heard and read online has been positive, adding: \\"I have so many people who are rooting for this strong female character.\\" Olivia Luchini of PopSugar called her a character \\"worthy of riotous applause\\", praising her strength, personality, combat skills, and body type. She said Cara serves as a role model particularly for female fans who consider themselves \\"a little rugged and audacious\\", writing: \\"She is a breath of fresh air for those who haven't been able to see themselves in the Star Wars universe quite yet.\\" Megan Crouse of Den of Geek called Cara one of the show's best characters, particularly praising the \\"great platonic chemistry\\" between her and the Mandalorian. Crouse said Carano fully inhabits the character that she elevates the script. Variety writer Will Thorne praised Cara Dune, complimenting her combat skills and \\"debonair charm\\", and compared her to the Marvel Comics character Gamora as performed by Zoe Saldana in the Guardians of the Galaxy films. Vanity Fair writer Joanna Robinson called the character a \\"prime showcase for Carano\\" and the first role to capitalize on her \\"real- life, distinct blend of inherent sweetness and physical toughness\\". Screen Rant writer Kevin Pantoja called Carano brings a \\"legitimate physical presence\\" to the role, and that Cara stands out in a franchise that already includes such strong female protagonists as Princess Leia and Rey. Erik Kain of Forbes called Cara a great character and said he wishes she was featured even more prominently in the series. She ranked fourth on a Screen Rant list of the most interesting characters from the first season of The Mandalorian, fifth on a separate list of the ten best characters from the show, and her costume was ranked third on a list of the ten best costumes in the first season. Several fans have produced artwork of the character and dressed as her in cosplay, and some have gotten the Rebel Alliance tattoo that Cara has under her eye. Anthony Gramuglia of Comic Book Resources wrote that some Star Wars fans were critical of the Cara Dune character because they perceived the presence of a strong female fighter as \\"forced diversity\\" and \\"wokeness\\". Gramuglia said these objections were misogynist and \\"patently ridiculous\\", and that other female Star Wars characters had received similar complaints, including Rey, Rose Tico, Jyn Erso, and Qi'ra. Gramuglia also wrote: \\"To them, Cara Dune's presence serves as a means to make men appear weaker by comparison, as she fights battles that most of the male characters aren't capable of undertaking themselves.\\" Merchandise Several toys of Cara Dune were first made available at a Star Wars product launch event called Triple Force Friday on October 4, 2019. Among them was a six-inch action figure by Hasbro as part of the company's Star Wars: The Black Series toy line, and Funko Pop figurine, and a Lego mini-figurine, as well as The Mandalorian t-shirts featuring the character.

The primary antagonist of the show, he leads a remnant of the fallen Galactic Empire and is attempting to capture the young alien creature known as \\"The Child\\", who is being protected by the title character of the series. Gideon is portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito. He was recruited for the part by The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau, who had previously worked with Esposito on several projects. Gideon is portrayed as a dangerous and fierce man who, \\"seems to know everything about everyone\\", and does not hesitate to kill anyone to get what he wants, including his own men. The character did not make his first appearance until the penultimate episode of the first season, but Esposito has said he will play a larger role in the second season. Esposito has rejected simple classifications of Gideon as a \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" character, noting that he is attempting to restore order to a lawless galaxy and could arguably be seen as a \\"savior\\". Gideon's all-black costume has been compared to that of Star Wars character Darth Vader, and reviewers have noted similarities in their personalities and behavior as well. Moff Gideon has been received positively by reviewers and fans. Esposito was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as Gideon. Appearances Backstory Moff Gideon is the primary antagonist of The Mandalorian. Few details of his backstory have yet been revealed. He was previously an operative in the Imperial Security Bureau, a covert intelligence arm and secret police for the Galactic Empire. Prior to the events of The Mandalorian, Gideon played a role in the Great Purge, an oppressive combat operation against a culture known as the Mandalorians, which resulted in many of them being killed and the survivors becoming scattered across the galaxy. Gideon knows information about the show's title character, otherwise known as \\"The Mandalorian\\", including his identity, due to his role in the Purge. The term \\"Moff\\" is a title for a high-ranking Imperial official who served as a governor of a specific sector of space for the Empire. Its first use dates back to the original Star Wars (1977) film, most notably with the character Grand Moff Tarkin, though the word \\"Moff\\" is not used in that film and the character is only identified by that title in the end credits. Gideon's life drastically changed after the fall of the Empire, and he became a warlord leading his own Imperial remnant. As the character Cara Dune states in the show, it was widely believed Moff Gideon had been executed for war crimes before the series began. In The Mandalorian, Gideon is attempting to capture a young alien creature known as \\"The Child\\", although the reason he wants him have not yet been revealed. Just prior to Gideon's first appearance on The Mandalorian, he dispatched his forces to eliminate the Mandalorian tribe on the planet Nevarro after they revealed their presence there during the episode \\"Chapter 3: The Sin\\". Season one Moff Gideon made his first appearance in \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\", the penultimate episode of the first season of The Mandalorian. He first appears when he contacts \\"The Client\\", an unnamed Imperial operative working to obtain the Child for Gideon. The Client is meeting with the bounty hunter Greef Karga and his associate Cara Dune at a cantina on the planet Nevarro. He is under the impression that Greef has brought the Child to him, along with the imprisoned Mandalorian, who had been trying to protect the Child from the Empire. In reality, the Child is not with them, and the meeting is a trap arranged by the Mandalorian and his allies to kill the Client and his stormtoopers. When Gideon contacts the Client during the meeting, the Client assures him he has the Child in his custody. Moff Gideon suggests that is not the case, then orders a squadron of his own stormtroopers to open fire on the cantina, killing the Client and his troops. Afterwards, the cantina is surrounded by stormtroopers and Death Troopers, and Moff Gideon lands his modified TIE Fighter outside the building and emerges, informing the trapped Mandalorian, Cara, and Greef that he wants the Child. Gideon returns in the season finale episode, \\"Chapter 8: Redemption\\", in which he speaks to the Mandalorian and his party from outside the cantina, demanding they turn the Child over to him. Gideon reveals he knows secret details about all of them, and refers to the Mandalorian by his real name, Din Djarin, marking the first time this name was revealed in the show. When the droid IG-11 arrives to assist the Mandalorian and his allies, a brief gunfight breaks out between them and the stormtroopers. During this fight, Gideon seriously injures and nearly kills the Mandalorian by shooting a power generator near him, causing an explosion. The Mandalorian and his party escape from the Imperials, but Gideon later encounters them elsewhere on the planet, where Gideon attacks them from above with his TIE fighter while they are on the ground. The Mandalorian uses his jetpack to fly after and attack Gideon's starfighter, connecting his grapple hook to the wing after briefly clinging to the top of the TIE Fighter in mid-air. He places an explosive charge on the ship and it explodes, causing the damaged TIE Fighter to crash in the distance, which allows the Mandalorian and his allies to escape. In the final scene of the episode and season, Gideon is shown to have survived the crash, and he extracts himself from the wreckage by cutting through the TIE Fighter's metal exterior with the Darksaber, a black-bladed lightsaber which is an ancient Mandalorian artifact. Season two Moff Gideon is slated to return for The Mandalorians second season, and Giancarlo Esposito, the actor who portrays Gideon, has said his character will play a larger role in the show. Characterization Moff Gideon is a dangerous and fierce man, who does not hesitate to harm or kill anyone to get what he wants. Though leading a remnant of the Galactic Empire, Gideon freely admits that he acts in his own self- interest, and in the first-season finale of The Mandalorian he explicitly states to the Mandalorian and his allies that they cannot trust him and he would gladly kill them all. Gideon does not hesitate to kill his own men when they fail him, or even for mere annoyances, like when they interrupt him. Sly, intimidating, and unforgiving, Gideon is extremely determined to achieve his goals, and is willing to sacrifice the lives of his men to get the Child. His motivation to get the Child appears personal, as he tells the Mandalorian: \\"it means more to me than you will ever know\\". Gideon is a strong military strategist, and despite the fall of the Empire still wields power, commanding a considerable number of Imperial forces, including people, equipment, and spaceships. Stephanie Dube Dwilson of Heavy.com noted that while many of the remnant Imperial stormtroopers featured throughout the first season had worn and dirty armor, the troopers under Gideon's command had new and pristine armor, reflecting Gideon's stature. Through his past association with the Imperial Security Bureau, Gideon had access to a great deal of classified intelligence, and as a result he is extremely knowledgeable about topics unknown to most other characters in the series. Giancarlo Esposito said the character \\"seems to know everything about everyone\\", as illustrated in the season finale, when he reveals he knows the names and biographical details of the Mandalorian, Cara Dune, and Greef Karga. Esposito has rejected simple classifications of Gideon as a \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" character, noting that he is attempting to restore stability to the galaxy following the fall of the Empire. Esposito felt Gideon becomes \\"sort of the guardian of the people\\" after the Empire's decline, and that in attempting to bring order to a lawless time, the character could be seen as a \\"savior\\". Esposito said of Moff Gideon: \\"Is he good? Is he bad? We don't know. We do know that the world needs someone to put it back together.\\" He felt this moral ambiguity was particularly applicable to the real world at the time in which the series was released, saying: \\"Leaders who exhibit kind of a faulty power because they still have ideas that they want to aggrandize themselves; we're in that world now.\\" Gideon has a vision for the future, and a strong personal sense of order, one of the driving principles of the Empire, which had a militaristic approach to policing the galaxy that Gideon also embraces. Several reviewers have suggested that Gideon may be actively attempting to emulate Darth Vader, one of the major characters from the Star Wars franchise who had been an agent of the Empire. Gideon's personality and behavior also bear similarities to Vader, including his tendency to execute underlings who disappoint him. Kevin Melrose of Comic Book Resources also noted that Gideon's TIE fighter crash near the end of the first-season finale is similar to Vader's final scene in the original Star Wars film, when his own TIE Advanced fighter is sent spiraling out of control into space. Concept and creation Portrayal Giancarlo Esposito was recruited for the part of Moff Gideon by The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau, with whom Esposito had previously worked on several projects. Moff Gideon is portrayed in The Mandalorian by Giancarlo Esposito. He was recruited for the part by series creator and showrunner Jon Favreau. Esposito and Favreau had previously worked together on several previous projects, starting with the pilot for the post-apocalyptic science fiction television series Revolution, which Favreau directed and in which Esposito starred. Favreau next directed Esposito in a commercial for the video game Destiny, which led to Favreau casting him in his film adaptation of The Jungle Book (2016). Esposito said one of the first things he did after accepting the role of Moff Gideon was to contact his friend Samuel L. Jackson, the actor who portrayed Mace Windu in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, and said: \\"Yo man, I'm in that series too, dude!\\" The casting of Esposito was announced on December 12, 2018. Details about his character were not immediately revealed, though there was early speculation he might be playing a villain due to his past performance as Gus Fring, one of the primary antagonists of Breaking Bad and an important character in its spinoff Better Call Saul. Footage of Moff Gideon was first publicly shown at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Chicago on April 14, 2019, which included a brief shot of the character flying his TIE Fighter. Esposito was on-hand at the D23 Expo on August 23, 2019, for the release of the first public trailer of The Mandalorian. Moff Gideon also appeared briefly in a second trailer released on October 28, 2019. In preparation for the role, Esposito rewatched the Star Wars films to get a sense of the \\"style of the films\\" and to try to get feeling for what it would be like to be in that fictional universe. Esposito was a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy film prior to joining The Mandalorian, though he said he was less interested in the later prequel films because they \\"became more and more in a different vein than what I wanted to be in\\". Regarding the original Star Wars films, Esposito said: However, Esposito was disappointed with the lack of diversity in the older Star Wars films and appreciated that there were more minority actors in the later productions, as well as in the cast of The Mandalorian, which he credited to Favreau. He called being cast as Moff Gideon \\"a dream come true\\", and said of the role: \\"He's a very interesting character and I'm so honored to be a part of this production.\\" After the show aired, Giancarlo said two of his four daughters sent him text messages urging him not to hurt the Child, who had become an internet sensation. Esposito said he jokingly responded: \\"I will squash that little big-eared bastard.\\" Costume Several reviewers have noted similarities between the costume of Moff Gideon and that of Star Wars character Darth Vader (pictured). Moff Gideon's costume was designed by Brian Matyas, concept designer and artist for The Mandalorian. He called designing Gideon's costume \\"one of the highlights for me on the show, and for my career as a whole\\". The costume was created based upon the design by costume designer Joseph Porro, with props and costume fabrication by Frank Ippolito via Ippolito's company Thingergy Inc. The costume is all-black and includes body armor, a cape, and an elaborate chest piece, and several reviewers have noted the costume's similarities to that of Star Wars character Darth Vader. Esposito called his costume \\"incredible\\", and said he wanted to keep his costume and props after filming, but was not able to: \\"They said to me, it's all going to wind up in a museum. You're going to be so honored when you see it there in a couple of years. But you can't have it now.\\" Filming Esposito's scenes for The Mandalorian were filmed on a sound stage in Southern California on a \\"Volume\\", a large warehouse-like motion-capture stage with green screens and tracking cameras spread throughout the space. Using a combination of physical set pieces and images projected onto the screens, the Volume allows the actors to be filmed and placed into a digital environment. Esposito said of filming scenes in the Volume: \\"we can control the physical atmosphere of what is projected on the walls and control how gravity is; you get a feeling that gravity is being played with\\". Esposito particularly enjoyed working with Taika Waititi, the director of the season finale, who he described as \\"in his own world creatively\\" and called \\"a very different and odd human being, but aren't we all as creative artists?\\" The sequences with Moff Gideon flying his TIE Fighter were filmed in the Volume, and Waititi was very detail-oriented in working with Esposito on the scenes. For example, Waititi gave Esposito very specific feedback on what he felt Esposito should be doing with his feet during the final scene when he cuts himself free of the crashed TIE Fighter. Esposito found this direction confusing, saying: \\"What's bugging you about the way my feet are? I'm on [a] globe 30 feet in [the] sky.\\" Esposito said he enjoyed seeing and interacting with the animatronic puppet of the Child during filming, saying: \\"It melts my heart, because the reality is, this little baby does things that you could never imagine and when you look at those eyes and that little body, how can you not help but fall in love?\\" Esposito had not seen the finished footage of The Mandalorian until a few months before the show aired. Reception Moff Gideon has been received positively by reviewers and fans alike. Scott Snowden of Space.com said Giancarlo Esposito \\"plays the role to perfection\\". Sean Keane of CNET called the character \\"absolutely magnificent\\" and \\"pretty damn scary\\". Screen Rant writer Kiki Evans said Moff Gideon \\"makes quite a terrifying villain\\". Kevin Pantoja, also from Screen Rant, said the character \\"immediately feels like a major threat\\" upon his introduction to the show. Stephanie Dube Dwilson of Heavy.com said the character \\"strikes the perfect mix of potentially crazy and very powerful\\". SyFy writer Matthew Jackson said though Gideon's appearance in the first season was brief, it was also impactful, writing: \\"The character quickly established himself as a force to be reckoned with.\\" Brian Silliman, also of SyFy, called Moff Gideon a \\"formidable\\" villain. IGN writer Laura Prudom said the first season ends with Moff Gideon positioned as \\"a worthy adversary\\" for the Mandalorian and his allies. Ben Pearson of /Film said the character \\"made a big impact\\" in the season finale. Caitlin Gallagher of Bustle noted that immediately after \\"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\\" aired, many fans expressed \\"outrage, sadness, and anxiety\\" about Moff Gideon, particularly on social media websites, due to his role in the death of the character Kuiil and the kidnapping of the Child at the end of that episode. Moff Gideon ranked second on a Screen Rant list of the most interesting characters from the first season of The Mandalorian, third on a separate list of the ten best characters from the show, and his costume was ranked seventh on a list of the ten best costumes in the first season. For his performance as Gideon in the Season One finale, Esposito was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.

The joint ventures are the Japan Policy and Human Resource Development Fund (PHRD), Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF), Climate Investment Fund (CIF) and Learning from Mega Disasters.  Japan policy and the Human Resource Development Fund (PHRD)  In the JSDF, the Government of Japan has funded $3.0 Billion US dollars. The overall purpose for the Japan Policy and Human Resource Development Fund is to help with preparation and implementation which involve the World Bank. The PHRD has been very innovative when it comes to climate change because recently has started co-financing projects that are completely related to climate change. The PHRD is one of the largest funds within the World Bank, and Japan supports it since 1990, and within the last couple of years the PHRD has paid for at least one-third of the IBRD and IDA loans. Japan Policy and Human Resource Development Fund has also been credited with pushing for innovations. The top ten recipients during Fiscal Year 2006 of PHRA TA Grants were Vietnam receiving 10.8 million, Azerbaijan receiving 7.5 million, Kyrgyzstan receiving 4.7 million, The Philippines receiving 4.2 million, Albania receiving 4.0 million, Senegal receiving 4.0 million, Kenya receiving 3.2 million, Nigeria receiving 3.0 million, The Gambia receiving 3.0 million and Indonesia receiving 2.9 million.  Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF)  The Japan Social Development Fund specializes in helping the individuals that were affected by the Asian Financial Crisis, and it focuses mostly on low-income countries. The Japan Social Development Fund was established to provide grants to the countries that need them, and there are three types of grant categories; Regular Program Grants, Special Program Grants, and Seed-Fund Grants. Regular Program Grants were grants that covered up to $3 million US dollars towards activities that would benefit disadvantaged individuals. Special Program Grants, helped the reconstruction of Afghanistan and pushed them forward to become a stable country. Lastly, Seed-Fund Grants are the grants which are used for the preparation phase during the process they are only helpful with $75,000 US dollars. The two main type of grants that Japan Social Development Fund focuses on are Project Grants and Capacity Building Grants. Project Grants are types of grants that focus of benefiting low-income individuals for a short term. Capacity Building Grants are grants that mainly focus on financing partnerships and strengthen relationships.  Climate Investment Fund (CIF)  The Climate Investment Fund is another venture between the World Bank Group and the government of Japan. It focuses on fighting climate change by taking some action to become greener. The amount of money that the Climate Investment Fund has is about $8 billion, and these funds are mainly given to developing and middle-income countries so they can afford climate financing projects without taking a huge risk. Currently the Climate Investment Fund has gathered 8 billion USD from 14 different countries and has invested in Climate-Smart Investments in 72 countries. About 57% of the projects that have been financed have been for the public sector while 43% of the projects have been for the private sector. There are four major factors of projects that the Climate Investment Fund focuses on: clean technology, climate resilience, energy access, and having sustainable forests.  Learning from Mega Disasters  Another joint venture from the World Bank and Japan is the Learning from Mega Disasters. The Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) was 9.0 earthquake which shook Japan, causing a tsunami and a nuclear power plant disaster. The World Bank and the government of Japan both learned from the earthquake on how other countries should prepare themselves from natural disasters. This information also was given to other countries so they could learn how to prepare for natural disasters before they happened and what to do after they occurred.  World Bank Institute (WBI)  Japan contributes to several different developing countries thanks to the help of the World Bank Institute, and their main focus is to help with initiatives that help developing countries prepare for natural disasters. Another initiative that Japan has focused with the help of the World Bank Institute is Universal Health Coverage.  Sustainable development bonds  Sustainable development bonds is another venture that involved Japan and the World Bank. Recently the World Bank gathered about $2 Billion for the Sustainable Development Bonds, thanks to Japanese investors who currently make up about 85% of the money coming from Japan. The main focus of these bonds is to tackle food waste.

He died in 1765, leaving an only child, Lady Dorothea, who married James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife and who died in 1819 without issue. In 1761, Alexander Sinclair, 9th Earl of Caithness had executed an entail that on the failure of his heirs, his estates should pass to the Sinclairs of Stevenson who were not related to the Sinclairs of Murkle who the Earl was descended from. He had resided at Haimer Castle, which after his death fell into disrepair. Upon his death the male issue of his father, John Sinclair, 8th Earl of Caithness, of his grandfather, Sir James Sinclair, 2nd of Murkle and of his great-grandfather, James Sinclair, 1st of Murkle, became extinct. The title then devolved upon William Sinclair of Rattar, as the lineal descendant of Sir John Sinclair of Greenland and Rattar, third son of John Sinclair, Master of Caithness (d. 1576) and younger brother of James Sinclair, 1st of Murkle.

He was head of the Tumas Group and director of the Maltese-Azerbaijan-German company Electrogas. Suspected of bribing members of the Maltese government, in November 2019 Fenech was arrested as a suspect in the murder of the investigative-journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. He is a key figure in the 2019 Malta political crisis and 2019 protests in Malta. Business Fenech is a prominent Maltese businessman. He was identified in 2018 as being the owner of the Dubai- registered company 17 Black. The company was listed in the Panama Papers and investigative journalist Caruana Galizia had written about 17 Black eight months before her death, alleging the company had links to Joseph Muscat's chief of staff Keith Schembri and to former energy minister Konrad Mizzi. Later, the research group The Daphne Project came across e-mails between 17 Black and two shell companies in Panama, belonging to Mizzi or Schembri. The emails mentioned payments of up to $2 million for unspecified services. Mizzi was then Minister of Energy in Malta, Schembri Chief of Staff of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. Fenech was CEO of the Tumas Group and a director of energy company Electrogas; in 2019 he resigned from both positions. On 25 November 2019 Tumas Group said that allegations linking Fenech to the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia were \\"alien to the Tumas Group's values\\". Daphne Caruana Galizia murder investigation On 16 October 2017, investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia died in a car bomb attack close to her home, attracting widespread local and international reactions. In December 2017, three men were arrested in connection with the car bomb attack. In November 2019, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced a deal with Melvin Theuma, a suspected middleman in the murder. Theuma was thought to be able to provide comprehensive information about the murder case and other crimes, and received a presidential pardon in exchange for information relating to the mastermind of the murder. A day after Theuma's arrest, Fenech attempted to leave Malta on his private yacht, with the Armed Forces of Malta intercepting and arresting him as a \\"person of interest\\" in the Caruana Galizia murder enquiry. Fenech went on to offer himself as a witness. He promised information about the murder case and other offenses, in exchange for immunity. The request was not granted. On 30 November 2019, an indictment was filed against Fenech, and he was accused of complicity in the murder of Caruana Galizia. Fenech pleaded not guilty. Six days after the arrest of Fenech, Keith Schembri resigned his government post as Chief of Staff, and was subsequently questioned by the police. Schembri was later released on police bail. The doctor Adrian Vella was also arrested for questioning. Vella's name also occurred in a number of companies registered or managed via Panama. He is said to have served as a secret messenger between Schembri and Fenech. Fenech, in his court statement, accused Schembri of being the mastermind behind the Caruana Galizia murder. Schembri is also accused of having tried to influence Fenech in order to frame Christian Cardona as responsible for the murder of Caruana Galizia. The case is still ongoing.

Based in South London, she designs plain language sewing patterns and hosts online workshops. Walnes studied at the London College of Fashion after taking and enjoying an introduction to sewing class. Inspired by late 1960s fashion and the French New Wave, she began sewing her own clothes in 2010 and launched Tilly and the Buttons as a way to share her makes and connect with other sewers. The success of the blog resulted in a career change so that she could focus full-time on dressmaking, pattern design and sewing related teaching and writing, putting to use more than a decade of experience designing educational resources. She was motivated to create sewing resources that prioritize visual, plain language instructions after finding that the books she relied on while learning how to sew often relied on hard to follow jargon. In 2013, Walnes appeared on the first series of The Great British Sewing Bee. She was eliminated during the second week after struggling with a self-drafted trouser pattern. Walnes identified the garments she made on the show as some of the hardest she's done in a 2014 interview with PatternReview.com explaining: \\"On the show, you are working to a tight deadline, under hot lights, while being interviewed by camera crews the whole time. It's so easy to forget the basics and mess things up under that kind of pressure!\\" Walnes' work has been recognized multiple times by Sew Magazine's British Sewing Awards, including Best Sewing Blog and Favourite Sewing Personality. In 2018 she discussed her career, personal style and balancing a business as a new mother on the Canadian podcast Love To Sew.

K√§the Ephraim Marcus (also Kathe Ephraim-Marcus, Kaethe; n√©e Ephraim; b. 1892, Wroc≈Çaw ‚Äì d. 1970, Ramat Gan) was a German-Israeli painter and sculptor. Marcus studied at art schools in Karlsruhe and Wroc≈Çaw (then Breslau) between 1911 and 1912. In 1913, she studied with Lovis Corinth and Max Beckmann. Her husband Dr. Joseph Marcus (1886-1961) was a senior government official in Breslau and Zionist organizer. The couple likely met through the hiking group and youth movement \\"Blau Weiss\\" in Breslau. They married in 1917. She met K√§the Kollwitz in 1920 in Berlin and was influenced by her expressionist figuration. She spent 1925 in Paris at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumiere and in the studio of Andr√© Lhote. In 1932, an Austrian-Jewish journal printed an article that described her as most famous for her work for children's books, in which she represented the struggle for a child to understand the world in balanced compositions and harmonies of color. In 1934, she and Joseph emigrated to Palestine after spending 1933 in England. Marcus was evicted from her studio in Jerusalem in 1947 by the British; much of her early work was destroyed. In 1948, she was evacuated to Ramat Gan. Marcus was the subject of many solo exhibitions and retrospectives during the 1960s to the 1980s. Her art also appeared in large group exhibitions that defined Israeli art in major museums in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Marcus's paintings have become part of the canon of Israeli art, and, in particular, of Israeli feminist art. Her art is characterized, in the words of one reviewer, \\"an atmosphere of melancholy, loneliness and alienation. She often painted subjects of mothers and children, bewildered and lonely women in hostile environments, new immigrants and transit camps.\\" In 1961, she published a book titled Out of My Life. She died in 1970 in Ramat Gan, Israel.

She returned, responding to AIDS in Zambia, in the 1990s. Early life and education Patricia Horne was born circa 1929 to Delia Moclair and Andrew Horne Jr, with her twin sister Margaret. Her grandfather was Andrew Horne, founder and first joint master of Holles Street maternity hospital. Her mother studied medicine at Queen‚Äôs College, Belfast and came to work in Holles Street. Her father was a Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) officer at Gallipoli before returning to Dublin and marrying Moclair in 1925. Horne grew up wanting to be a surgeon, and she and her sister went to the Ursulines secondary school in Waterford. Horne went to study medicine in University College Dublin. While in college, Horne lead the UCD women's hockey team to Irish Senior Cup victory in 1951; the cup was not won by UCD again for 58 years. Horne graduated in 1955. Initially, Horne got a job working as a surgeon in Cashel, County Tipperary. In the early period for women as doctors in Ireland, they often found it easier to work in public health, and so, with her mother's experience behind her, Horne also completed a Diploma in Public Health. Overseas work Horne wanted to work overseas and her father's experience at Gallipoli led him to want his daughter to work with nuns if she did so. She applied for government public health operations in Hong Kong, Africa and India but in 1957 went to work on a two year contract to a missionary hospital in Nsukka, Nigeria. The hospital was run by the Holy Rosary Sisters. The country was just three years from achieving independence from Britain in 1960. The hospital was remote and struggling with no electricity or water, and both tuberculosis and yaws were endemic. Childbirth and obstetrics was a major part of Horne's work in the hospital. She was the only doctor in the hospital and worked every day. Some of the surgery methods used due to decisions made locally had strong arguments in their favour but have been controversial in other locations.After two years she left and returned home. A back injury forced Horne to give up surgery and she took up psychiatry and worked in Ireland until her retirement in 1994. After retirement, Horne returned to work in Monze, Zambia, for the next six years. As the AIDS epidemic was the major crisis, the hospitals were dealing with malaria and AIDS-related TB.

He was born in Seal Cove on the island of Grand Manan, New Brunswick. While still in his teens he started contributing local news items to the Saint Croix Courier, a weekly newspaper published in St. Stephen, New Brunswick. In 1934 he became the paper's regular Grand Manan correspondent at a salary of $10 a month. He continued in this role for 21 years. A prolific writer and author of several books, Ingersoll wrote that other than manual labour in the Grand Manan fisheries, \\"everything I have done by way of employment, or community service, since that early beginning in journalism has been made easier by my intimate acquaintance with the typewriter\\". He served in the Canadian army in World War II as a dental technician and returned to Grand Manan, where he became a teacher of business education at the newly opened Grand Manan High School in 1948. He taught school for 21 years, becoming the principal of the Grand Manan school district. Ingersoll was a leader in the effort to establish the Grand Manan Museum, which opened in 1967. He served as the museum's first curator and executive director. He went on to become the curator of Canadian history at the New Brunswick Museum in Saint John, New Brunswick, and in 1973 he was named director of the New Brunswick Museum. He was also director of museums for the province of New Brunswick, a position from which he retired in 1979. On retirement he was named emeritus director of museology in the province's department of historical resources. Ingersoll was named a Member of the Order of Canada on October 27, 1993 in the field of Arts (Writing). The official citation called him a \\"treasure trove of the history of his home community of Grand Manan and of the province of New Brunswick\\", and stated that \\"his writings have illuminated the past, while his enthusiasm as a teacher, columnist and curator has instilled in others, especially young people, an appreciation and interest in the Canadian mosaic\\". Ingersoll died in Fredericton on 16 December 1993. A major expansion of the Grand Manan Museum in 1998 was named the L. Keith Ingersoll Memorial Wing in his honour. The expansion doubled the size of the museum and allowed wheelchair access to the building for the first time. References External links *Lincoln Keith Ingersoll fonds at the Grand Manan Archives *L.

Career  Born in Kiev province, the son of a carpenter, Ushakov left school at age 13 to work the same trade, but was drafted into the Imperial Russian armed forces in 1916. Arrested for desertion, he escaped after spending 50 days in prison. During the Russian Civil War, he fought as a partisan in Ukraine. He joined Cheka in Kiev in 1920, and was based in Ukraine until 1934, when he was transferred to Saratov. From February 1935 to December 1936, he was deputy head of the Special Department of the NKVD in the Belorussian Belarus Republic. Ushakov was transferred to Moscow in January 1937, as assistant to the special department of the NKVD, Mark Gay. He played a major role in fabricating the case against Marshal Tukhachevsky and other Red Army commanders. The first Red Army officer to be arrested in the Great Purge, Dmitry Shmidt, was interrogated by Ushakov, and forced to give evidence incriminating the commander of the Ukraine military district, Iona Yakir. After Marshal Tukhachevsky was arrested in May 1937, Ushkaov took over his interrogation and forced a confession out of him - which he retracted at his trial - by beating him so severely that there were blood stains on the document he signed incriminating himself. After the arrest of Robert Eikhe in April 1938, Ushkaov forced a confession out of him through torture, making use of the fact that Eikhe's broken ribs had not mended properly. Ushakov was sent on a mission to the Far Eastern territory in the summer 1938, and was arrested in Khabarovsk on 5 September, when Lavrentiy Beria was taking control of the NKVD. He was sentenced to death on 21 January 1940, and shot on 26 January. Unlike other victims of the Great Purge, he has never been 'rehabilitated'.

Having originated in North America, it has spread to other parts of the world and become a major pest of cotton crops. Description The adult female is ellipsoidal in shape, about long and wide, with a convex dorsal surface and a flat ventral surface. The body is yellowish-grey but this is largely obscured by the waxy secretions that cover the body, although the segmentation can still be seen. There is a transverse, darker bar on the dorsal surface. There are 18 pairs of very short, lateral wax filaments, and several slightly longer caudal filaments. Distribution and hosts This species was discovered and first described in New Mexico in 1898 by the American entomologist J. D. Tinsley; he found it in an underground ants' nest where it was feeding on the roots and stems of Boerhavia spicata and Kallstroemia californica, and described it from stems of the four wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). It was not reported again until 1967 when it was detected in Arizona, California, Colorado, Mississippi, Texas and Washington D.C.. By 1988 it was found on cotton in a number of areas of Texas and had adapted to feed on 29 different species of plant. It continued to spread in North America and later to other parts of the world, being reported in India in 2004, Pakistan and Brazil in 2005, and China and Sri Lanka in 2008. It is now additionally present in other countries in Asia, Europe, Canada, South America, Africa and Australasia. In India, where the mealybug has become a serious pest of cotton, the winter cherry Withania somnifera has been reported as a new reservoir host of the insect. Ecology The adult female cotton mealybug lays several hundred eggs in an ovisac. On hatching, the nymphs crawl away, dispersing to other parts of the plant. In dry conditions, they move to the roots and the lower leaves and stems, however in wetter conditions they prefer the upper parts of the plant. They may be carried inadvertently by birds or animals to other plants. The adults and nymphs suck sap from the host plant, and secrete the excess fluid as honeydew. Sooty mould tends to grow on the honeydew, and ants are often found among the mealybugs feeding on the secretion. Natural predators of adults and nymphs include ladybirds, and an encyrtid wasp is an effective parasitoid. Damage An infestation of this mealybug on cotton causes stunting of plants and yellowing, distortion and premature shedding of leaves; the presence of sooty mould reduces photosynthesis, bolls may not develop properly and yields of lint are reduced by an average of 35% in India.

He was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant the following September, with Smith granted the full rank following the war in September 1919. Having spent eight years as a lieutenant, he was promoted to the rank of captain in September 1927. Smith made a single appearance in first-class cricket for the Royal Navy against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Chatham in 1929. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed for 7 runs in the Navy first-innings by Sidney Martin, while in their second-innings he was run out for 47. Two years later he played minor counties cricket for Devon, making a single appearance in the 1931 Minor Counties Championship. He was made a brevet major in December 1932. Smith later served with the Royal Marines during the Second World War, which saw him made an acting lieutenant colonel in May 1942. In 1943 he was involved in the formation of No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando. Following the war he was placed on the retired list in January 1948, retaining the rank of major.

Therefore, UC Irvine election law professor Richard L. Hasen said that this was the \\"least bad way\\" campaign finance reform groups could have lost this case. According to Jason Torchinsky, a campaign finance lawyer working in one of the GOP's most prominent law firms, the decision shows that a majority of Justices do not agree with low campaign donation limits, but might be hesitant to take on this fight in today's political climate. Statement by Ginsburg Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a statement respecting the Supreme Court's decision vacating and remanding the ruling of the Ninth Circuit. Ginsburg's statement notes that campaign finance limits regarding political parties in Alaska are more lenient than the limits on contributions to individual donors, unlike the laws in Vermont. Ginsburg expressed concern that Alaska is prone to be influenced excessively by the fossil fuel industry because it is a sparsely populated state that receives much of its revenue from the fossil fuel industry.

This pattern changes in the southern regions during the summer months, when winds from Canada and the Great Plains dominate. This results in a substantially lower average rainfall in July and August in the southern rainforest patches than in the rest of the year, leading to a generally drier summer than in the North where the summers are cool and wet.DellaSala, Dominick (2011).

Because of their humid climate, the inland rainforest patches support the establishment of oceanic species that would typically be expected to grow in maritime and coastal environments. Examples for vascular oceanic species include deer fern (Blechnum spicant) and red huckleberry (Vaccinium parviflorum). A large number of epiphytes occur, such as hanging moss (Antitrichia curtipendula) settling on trees and various oceanic lichen genera (such as Chaenotheca, Chaenothecopsis, Collema, Fuscopannaria, Lichinodium, Lobaria, Nephroma, Parmeliella, Polychidium, Pseudocyphellaria, Sphaerophorus, and Sticta).Arsenault, Andr√©; Goward, Trevor (2000). ‚ÄúEcological characteristics of inland rainforests. Ecoforestry. 15 (4): 21. Roughly 40% of the lichen found in the Pacific northwestern rainforest are also found in the inland rainforest.Radies, David; Coxson, Darwyn; Johnson, Chris; Konwicki, Ksenia (2009). ‚ÄúPredicting canopy macrolichen diversity and abundance within old- growth inland temperate rainforests‚Äù. Forest Ecology and Management (2009): p. 86. Because of their unique occurrence only in the specific climatic conditions provided by the inland rainforests, oceanic lichen has been used as an indicator for the location of these forest patches.Goward, Trevor; Spribille, Toby (2005). \\"Lichenological evidence for the recognition of inland rain forests in western North America\\". Journal of Biogeography. 32 (7): 1210. Fauna Mountain-type Woodland Caribou The inland rainforest regions provide habitat for a large number of carnivores, including black bears (Ursus americanus), grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), grey wolf (Canis lupus), cougar (Puma concolor), lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolverine (Gulo gulo).DellaSala, Dominick (2011). Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Ecology and Conservation. p. 83-84. The most characteristic animal for these forests is the mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus), also referred to as woodland caribou, which is currently listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=4618, accessed 11/06/2019. The reasons for this endangerment are complex: Mountain caribous relies heavily on oceanic hair lichen as main food source during the winter, when ground vegetation is out of reach due to the immense accumulation of snow (2-5m) in the mountainous regions. Because of an increase in logging, the old- growth habitat for these lichen species are diminishing. Another problem is the increasing temperatures: due to a shift towards warmer climate conditions, the inland rainforest patches became successional habitat for moose (Alces alces), deer (Odocoileus) and elk (Cervus elaphus), which led to an increase in predatory species. While the mountain caribou is safe during the winter season due to the altitude that it dwells on, it is highly vulnerable in the summer months, when moose and deer move to higher elevations and attract predators that also prey on the caribous.DellaSala, Dominick (2011). Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Ecology and Conservation. pp. 90-91. Disturbance dynamics The main large-scale disturbances in the northern Inland rainforest patches in British Columbia are infrequent periodic fires and insect outbreaks of the western hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria lugubrosa). On a small scale, these forests are characterized by gap dynamics as results of senescence, heart rot and root rots. Avalanches, wind and snow loading can have varying effects from small-scale events like tree snapping to disturbances that affect large areas.Drinkwater, Bob; Stevenson, Susan K. (2011). British Columbia's Inland Rainforest. Ecology, Conservation, and Management. p. 53-54. Conservation and environmental issues Conservation In British Columbian inland rainforests, there are 17.1% of forests, 5% of old forests and 4.5% of old, intact forests strictly protected. That means that the vast majority of the Canadian Inland rainforests are open to large-scale human impacts like clear-cut logging and other anthropogenic disturbances.DellaSala, Dominick (2011). Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Ecology and Conservation. pp. 97-98. Conservation projects in the United States are as of now not specifically tilted towards the protection of Inland rainforest patches. However, there are efforts to catalogue these areas by using conservation-area design (CAD) techniques.DellaSala, Dominick (2011). Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Ecology and Conservation. pp. 99-100. Environmental issues Currently, there are three major threats to the Inland rainforests: 1. logging, 2. mining and hydroelectric development projects and 3. climate change. Logging The Inland rainforest patches are highly at risk to be clear-cut. These forests have been heavily logged since decades, but as of now, the rate seems to get higher and higher. Forest ecologist Dominick DellaSala compares the speed at which the Inland rainforest in British Columbia gets logged to logging in the tropical rainforest of Brazil.Cox, Sarah (2019). ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs forgotten rainforest.‚Äù https://thenarwhal.ca/canadas-forgotten-rainforest/, accessed 11/06/2019. Hydroelectric development In particular in British Columbia, projects to produce so-called ‚Äòclean energy‚Äô enormously threaten the functionality of the Inland rainforests and other riparian ecosystems, especially because they are often permitted without properly reviewing their impacts on the environment.DellaSala, Dominick (2011). Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Ecology and Conservation, p.103. Climate change Climate change is likely to impact especially the amount of snow in winter and spring and the general annual temperature, which is believed to increase. Summer droughts and fires would be more probable, as well as a higher number of beetle outbreaks due to warmer winters that would allow more beetles to survive. Plant and animal species alike would be affected, for example would a drier climate favor more drought-adapted species over the moisture-dependent plants in the Inland rainforest patches.DellaSala, Dominick (2011). Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Ecology and Conservation, pp. 104-105.

She specialises in anthropological genetics relating to the initial peopling of the Americas and subsequent prehistory of indigenous populations throughout North America. She is the President of the American Association of Anthropological Genetics. Alongside her research Raff is a science communicator who writes and gives public talks about topics in science literacy.  Early life and education  Raff was born in Carbondale, Illinois. She moved from Missouri to Indiana when she started high school. While she was a child her mother started a doctoral degree in neuroscience, which inspired Raff to follow a career in scientific research. During her last year of high school Raff asked a professor in a nearby university if she could join his laboratory, and started to work on molecular biology. She received a B.A. in biology and anthropology from Indiana University in 2001, after which she worked for a year in a yeast molecular genetics lab. She received a master's degree in anthropology in 2008, and a doctoral degree in genetics and biological anthropology in 2008, also from Indiana University.  Research and career  Raff was a postdoctoral scholar working with Dennis O‚ÄôRourke at the University of Utah, with M. Geoffrey Hayes at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago Illinois, and with Deborah Bolnick at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2015 she was appointed Assistant Professor of Biological Anthropology at the University of Kansas where she conducts population genetics research on ancient and contemporary North American populations from the North American Arctic, the Midwest, and Texas. Her research involves the analysis of genomes in ancient and contemporary DNA, which she uses to understand the histories of human populations. In particular Raff has focussed on the development of new approaches to extract ancient DNA. In 2019 Raff was awarded an National Science Foundation Search Grant to investigate the genetic history of the Aleut people. The project will see Raff investigating genomic information from ancient people for the Aleutian Islands. That year she was appointed a Docking Faculty Scholar. As well as research Raff teaches courses on Fundamentals of Physical Anthropology, on Human Evolution, and on Critical Analysis of Scientific Literature. She is a faculty member with the Summer Internship for Indigenous Peoples in Genomics, a program designed to increase representation of indigenous peoples in the field of genetics. In 2018 Raff was made Vice President of the American Association of Anthropological Genetics and promoted to President in 2019. Raff is represented by the agents Janklow & Nesbit and publishers Twelve Books. Her first book, Origin, is due in 2020. The book will be a genetic history of humans in North and South America and looks to teach people about the fundamental science of genetics.  Public engagement  Raff has written for public audiences, on her blog \\"Violent Metaphors\\", in the Huffington Post, for Forbes and for The Guardian. She has written about the importance of vaccination ‚Äì in particular, her article \\"Dear parents, you are being lied to\\" has been translated into several languages, including German, Italian, Norwegian, Vietnamese, Croatian. She has spoken about the dangers of scientific racism and, in particular, Nicholas Wade's book A Troublesome Inheritance. Raff was included in Angela Saini's Superior: The Return of Race Science. Raff provided testimony to the Texas Board of Education concerning the teaching of evolution in schools. She also provided a commentary about the information that could be learned from Elizabeth Warren's DNA test. Raff has worked to improve public understanding of the scientific process. She has appeared on several podcasts, including Science for the People, NPR Science Friday, Inside Science and on the BBC World Service. She was part of The Nature of Things with David Suzuki episode on the Ice bridge. She frequently gives public talks on science literacy issues, and was an invited speaker at Skepticon.

She is notable for her collection and translation of Spanish-language folktales into English.  Writing  Her first work Round a Posada Fire: Spanish Legends appeared in 1881. In the preface, she declares that her intention is to introduce her readers to an overlooked element of Spanish culture: that of peasant folktales. \\"There is hardly a more superstitious creature on the face of the globe than the Spaniard. He delights in everything ghostly and supernatural ...\\" she declares. She also notes that most of the stories have already been published in American journals, but adds the new \\"Lovers of Teruel,\\" about a pair of star-crossed lovers who die from thwarted love. In 1885, her Spanish Legendary Tales was published. It contained thirty folktales from northern Spain. She wrote in the preface: ‚ÄúFriends have remarked to me on the weird and tragic air of many of these tales. The answer is simply that such, as a fact, is the general character of the Spanish legend.‚Äù The tales speak of ghosts, witches, religious miracles and werewolves. \\"The Serpent Woman\\" and \\"The Were- Wolf\\" are both noted as early examples of speculative fiction in the Internet Speculative Fiction Database.

The family made its fortune in trade between Canton and Manila through the firm Russell & Sturgis, co-founded by her father in 1828 as an offshoot of Russell & Co. She was the cousin of British politician Henry Parkman Sturgis, who was named after her father. She was raised as Roman Catholic. She spoke Spanish, French, Italian, German, and English fluently. She married English translator and journalist Samuel George Chetwynd Middlemore (1848-1890). They married on April 18, 1881 at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, where their wedding was attended by Henry James.

Bastien- Lepage painted it in his native village of Damvillers, whose name is written in the work's lower-left corner just above the artist's signature. It was first exhibited at the 1879 Paris Salon and the Russian painter Vasily Surikov saw it in Paris in December 1883, writing to his colleague Pavel Chistyakov at the end of that month: In 1885 (the year after the painter's death) it was acquired by his brother √âmile Bastien-Lepage. Next it was acquired in 1897 by the Australian entrepreneur George McCulloch, who had moved to London in the early 1890s and started collecting paintings. After McCulloch's death in 1907, the painting passed to his widow Mary Coutts Michie. In October 1927 the painting was acquired by the Australian Felton Bequest Foundation, based on funds bequeathed by Alfred Felton and in 1928 it was transferred to its present owner.

History  The shop was founded by Jim McDowell and his cousin Bill Poncher. The shop opened as a skateboard and a roller skate shop. The popularity of rollerskating waned and the shop became a meeting place for the Santa Monica and greater west L.A. skateboard scene. In 1984, Sean Stussy, then an unknown fashion designer, convinced Jim and Bill to carry his clothing in the shop. Before business picked up in the mid-1980s, the shop offered pinball machines as an extra revenue source. Rip City is known for its interior decoration, with the walls of the shop lined with skateboards.  Save Rip City Skates campaign  In November 2019, it was announced that the building at 2709 Santa Monica Blvd where Rip City Skates has been in business for over 40 years was scheduled for demolition and redevelopment. The local skateboard community has begun a community organizing campaign to save the building, asking the city of Los Angeles to deem Rip City Skates a historical landmark. The building, built in the 30s, used to be a surfer bar called Robins Reef.

The event was created in 1992 by a small group of gay and lesbian film buffs after attending Toronto's inaugural Inside Out Film and Video Festival in 1991. Its launch saw some minor controversy over the city's approval of a municipal arts grant to the organizing committee, which some critics tried to connect to the city's denial of a grant to the long-running Kiwanis Music Festival.Noel Taylor, \\"Gay festival spotlights Canadian films\\".

It descended from Ferenc Esterh√°zy (1641‚Äì1683), the younger surviving son of Nikolaus, Count Esterh√°zy. This branch was further divided into three lines by Ferenc's sons. Family * Ferenc Esterh√°zy (1641‚Äì1683) ** Antal Esterh√°zy (1676‚Äì1722), military commander *** B√°lint J√≥zsef Esterh√°zy, soldier **** B√°lint Mikl√≥s Esterh√°zy (1740‚Äì1805), military commander and diplomat in France ** Ferenc Esterh√°zy (1683‚Äì1754) *** M√≥ricz Esterh√°zy (1807‚Äì1890) (descendant) ** J√≥zsef Esterh√°zy First branch The eldest of these sons, Count Antal (1676‚Äì1722), distinguished himself in the war against Francis II R√°k√≥czi in 1703, but changed sides in 1704 and commanded the left wing of the Kuruczis at the engagements of Nagyszombat (1704) and Veresk√∂ (1705). In 1706 he defeated the imperialist general Guido Starhemberg and penetrated to the walls of Vienna. Still more successful were his operations in the campaign of 1708, when he ravaged Styria, twice invaded Austria, and again threatened Vienna, on which occasion the emperor Joseph I narrowly escaped falling into his hands. In 1709 he was routed by the superior forces of General Sigbert Heister at Palota, but brought off the remainder of his arms very skilfully. In 1710 he joined R√°k√≥czy in Poland and accompanied him to France and Turkey. He died in exile at Rodosto on the shores of the Black Sea. Antal's son B√°lint J√≥zsef, by Anna Maria Nigrelli, entered the French army, and was the founder of the Hallewyll, or French, branch of the family, which became extinct in the male line in 1876 with Count Ladislas. Count B√°lint Mikl√≥s (1740‚Äì1805), son of B√°lint J√≥zsef, made his early life in France. He was an enthusiastic partisan of the duc de Choiseul, on whose dismissal, in 1764, he resigned the command of the French regiment of which he was the colonel. It was Esterh√°zy who conveyed to Marie Antoinette the portrait of Louis XVI on the occasion of their betrothal, and the close relations he maintained with her after her marriage were more than once the occasion of remonstrance on the part of Maria Theresa, who never seemed to forget that he was the grandson of a rebel. At the French court he stood in high favour with the comte d'Artois. He was raised to the rank of , and made inspector of troops in the French service in 1780. At the outbreak of the French Revolution he was stationed at Valenciennes, where he contrived for a time to keep order, and facilitated the escape of the French emigr√©s by way of Namur; but, in 1790, he hastened back to Paris to assist the king. At the urgent entreaty of the comte d'Artois in 1791 he quitted Paris for Coblenz, accompanied Artois to Vienna, and was sent to the court of Saint Petersburg the same year to enlist the sympathies of Catherine the Great for the Bourbons. He received an estate from Catherine, and although the gift was rescinded by Paul I, another was eventually granted him. He died in exile at Grodek in Volhynia on 23 July 1805. Second and third branches Two other sons of Count Ferenc, Ferencz and J√≥zsef, founded the houses of Dotis and Csekl√©sz () respectively. Of their descendants, Count M√≥ricz (1807‚Äì1890) of Dotis, Austrian ambassador in Rome until 1856, became a member of the ministry formed by Anton von Schmerling in 1861, and in 1865 joined the clerical cabinet of Count Richard Belcredi. His hostility to Prussia helped to force the government of Vienna into the war of 1866. His official career closed in 1866, but he remained one of the leaders of the clerical party.

He left the force at a time of low morale and became a hotel owner and publican, in which pursuit he was followed by his two sons. History Alford was born in Acton, Middlesex. He emigrated to South Australia aboard John Pirie on a twelve-month contract as an employee of the South Australian Land Company, embarking at Kangaroo Island in August 1836. One of his first assignments was to purchase and accompany from Tasmania (then Van Diemen's Land) two horses and two bullocks, the first brought into the colony. He was next employed by John Barton Hack, who had a small but increasing stock of farm animals. Alford and two others volunteered as special constables to bring in three escaped convicts from Tasmania, led by the outlaw Morgan, whom they apprehended near the whaling stations at Encounter Bay. In April 1838 Governor Hindmarsh inaugurated a police force with Henry Inman in charge with the rank of Inspector, and Alford was one of the first of the twenty-odd men sworn in as constables, in what was Australia's first fully constituted police force. He was assigned to the Mounted branch, who were uniformed, armed and drilled in military fashion, as distinct from the Foot, or Metropolitan, service, who were more like the London \\"Bobbies\\". In October 1838 the newly arrived Governor Gawler promoted Inman to Superintendent of Police, and in November James Stuart and William Baker Ashton were sworn in as sub-inspectors. Alford was a conscientious and efficient officer, making 54 arrests in three years, and by 1841 had been promoted to sergeant, and sergeant-major in 1842. Both Chief Inspector Alexander Tolmer, in his Reminiscences and J. W. Bull, in his Early Experiences refers frequently to his dedication and enterprise in tracking down felons, many of whom were escaped convicts from New South Wales or Tasmania. Alford was promoted Inspector in 1849 following the death of Commissioner Gordon, and in 1853 and 1854 was responsible for guarding gold shipments from Mount Alexander to Adelaide. In September 1853 Alford left the force, leading to a public demand for an investigation into what precipitated such an action. His resignation followed the suspension, later dismissal, of Senior Inspector Stuart. Was the \\"Colonist of sixteen years' standing\\" none other than John Wrathall Bull? and the earlier resignation from the gold escort, of Inspector William Rose A board of enquiry ratified Stuart's suspension, and furthermore removed Tolmer from command of the force, offering it to O'Halloran and, surprisingly, reinstated Tolmer as Chief Inspector, all following the confessions of chief clerk Orde, that he had been complicit in Tolmer's machinations against his subordinates. Alford had previously shown sympathy with publicans, and in March 1854 joined their ranks, taking over the licence of the Stag Inn, corner of Rundle Street and East Terrace, then in 1855 built the Glynde Inn, of which he became licensee in June 1856. His son Henry jun. took the Red Lion on Rundle Street in 1858, then in 1860 the Golden Rule in Pirie Street. His other son, Edwin, took on the job of poundkeeper at Hectorville in 1868, assisting with the management of the Glynde hotel nearby, giving his father leisure time to devote to his garden and a relaxed social life. In 1876 Edwin quit the poundkeeping job, took over the hotel, married, and his wife served as landlady. On Edwin's death she continued management of the hotel until around 1911, so it had been in the hands of the family for 55 years, possibly a State record. Alford's last years were marred by a throat complaint, which caused his death. His remains were interred at the West Terrace cemetery, with many members of the police force among those who attended the funeral.

Biography  Federer's birthplace in Brienz Federer was born on 6 October 1866 in the Bernese village of Brienz. His father, Johann Paul Federer, was a wood carver and school teacher whose family came from Berneck, St. Gallen. He attended grammar school in Sarnen from 1881 until 1887, when he went to study at a college in Schwyz. After studying Catholic theology in Eichst√§tt, Lucerne, and Freiburg, he was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1893 and assigned as the chaplain in Jonschwil. He retired from the priesthood in 1899 after suffering from ill health. After an asthma diagnosis in 1900, he was transferred to a women's home in Z√ºrich to recover. While there, he worked as the editor-in-chief of the Neue Z√ºrcher Nachrichten, a Catholic newspaper. Federer had requested residence at Einsiedeln Abbey but was denied admission due to rumors of inappropriate sexual behavior. On 24 September 1902, Federer was accused of eliciting an abusive sexual relationship with a twelve year old pupil, Emil Brunner. Federer wrote as a novelist, poet, and memoirist. Many of his books had religious themes, and countered the nationalistic Heimatkunst movement in Switzerland. In the 20th- century he was a best-selling author and awarded multiple literary accolades, including the Gottfried-Keller-Preis in 1925.

Produced by Ishari K. Ganesh of Vels Film International, the film stars Varun and Raahei in the lead roles. Featuring music composed by Karthik, the film narrates the tale of a bodyguard who has to look after and protect a high-profile woman who comes to Chennai from London. The film was expected to have a theatrical release in October 2020, but production was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemice in India.  Cast  * Varun as Joshua * Raahei as Kundhavi Chidambaram  Production  Director Gautham Menon agreed terms to work on a film produced by Ishari K. Ganesh of Vels Film International during July 2019, following the producer's sudden intervention to relieve Menon from financial constraints that he faced during the making of Enai Noki Paayum Thota (2019). In return, Menon agreed to make a film starring Ganesh's nephew, Varun, in the lead role. Media reports initially suggested that the film would be based on the script of Yohan: Adhyayam Ondru, which was originally planned with Vijay in 2011, but Menon denied this and claimed it was a separate story. The film was instead based on another action film that Menon had contemplated making with Arun Vijay in 2017. Arun Vijay had earlier trained for the project in Paris with stunt director Yannick Ben, but the film was put on hold in mid-2017 after Menon encountered financial constraints. To prepare for his role, Varun trained with Yannick Ben and his team of stunt directors and parkour experts in Paris during mid-2019. Debutant actress Raahei was also cast in the film as a high net-worth individual, who is protected by Varun's character. By November 2019, fifty percent of the film was completed through a schedule in Chennai. The makers then prepared to shoot scenes in the UK and the USA, while aiming for a February 2020 release. However, filming has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Karthik, replacing Darbuka Siva. One song, \\"Hey Love\\", was to have been released on 29 February 2020 as a single.

It originally aired in the United States on December 1, 2011. The episode was written by Dean Holland and directed by Dan Goor & Michael Schur. Plot After the events of the previous episode, Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) agree to confess their romantic relationship to their boss Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe). Chris reluctantly launches an investigation between Leslie and Ben and holds trials for possible ethics violations. To overcome his depression over the hearing, Chris takes an extreme amount of vitamins and supplements. In the first trial, Leslie admits her relationship with Ben to the ethics committee, but denies any possible corruption or wrongdoing as a result of dating her superior. Unfortunately, Chris announces that he has numerous character witnesses to prove her and Ben's special treatment toward one another, as well as possible bribery. Although Leslie manages to deflect most of the witnesses' arguments brought to the trial, one of the witnesses is rumored to be extremely important to the case. Leslie and Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) initially believe that the important witness is Ron's ex-wife Tammy Two (Megan Mullally); it is revealed to be George Williams, an electrician who was bribed by Leslie and Ben with a gift certificate to ignore their kiss at Li'l Sebastian's memorial service. Knowing she risks being fired, Leslie asks the Parks Department to help her find a loophole out of the situation. When the team is unsuccessful, Ron convinces Leslie to concede to the committee. Surprisingly, Leslie is only suspended for two weeks with pay. Chris reveals that Ben held a private meeting with the committee and took full blame for the bribery, effectively resigning as Assistant City Manager. After the trial, Chris apologizes to Leslie and explains that he was only doing his job. He and the stenographer, Ethel Beavers, reveal that Ben said his relationship with Leslie was worth losing his job; he also declares his love for her. Leslie does the same for Ben by hiring Ethel for an addendum to the court transcript later that night. During the credits, Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir) admits during the trial that his real name is Garry, catching both Leslie and Chris off guard. Reception Ratings \\"The Trial of Leslie Knope\\" received 3.720 million live and same day views when it first aired on December 1, 2011. The episode received a 1.8 rating among viewers 18-49. Critical Reception Steve Eisler of The AV Club gave the episode a B+, scolding the episode for its lack of screen time to the other characters, but praising its ending for its emotional weight.

Design and development The Bakcyl is a two seat development of the single seat PW-2 Gapa primary trainer from 1985. The main improvements were the addition of Frise ailerons and an enclosed cabin for pupil and instructor. The wingspan was increased by 33% and, overall, the changes doubled the empty weight. Despite this and the two occupants, bungee launches remained possible and, with the increased weight, the best glide angle improved by 25%. Over most of the span the two-part wings of the Bakcyl have constant chord and forward sweep but their long tips are trapezoidal, with sweep on their leading edges. Forward sweep has often been employed on two seat gliders to position the rear seat over the centre of gravity, so the aircraft can be flown solo from the front seat without re- trimming; an early example is the Schleicher Ka 2 Rh√∂nschwalbe . Largely constructed of glassfibre, it is built around a single spar with a glassfibre- covered D-box ahead of it and is fabric covered behind the spar. The wings are braced to the fuselage with a single, broad-chord strut on each side. Originally these struts could pivot through 90¬∞ to act as airbrakes, as on the PW-2, but they were later replaced with upper surface spoilers, inboard of the ailerons and positioned immediately behind the spars. The glass-epoxy composite fuselage is in two parts, a forward cabin which ends with a fairing under the wing trailing edge and a slender, square section tailboom just below the wing. Occupants sit in tandem, the student forward and their instructor under the leading edge. A long, one-piece canopy reaches back to the rear seat which has a short, fixed glazed extension under the wing. The Bakcyl lands on a fixed, fully exposed monowheel under the forward fuselage, aft of mid-chord, which has a shock absorber and a brake. A smaller nosewheel and plywood skid complete the landing gear. The Bakcyl's tail is conventional and similar to that of the PW-2, with a rectangular plan, canvas-covered tailplane mounted on top of the end of the tailboom and carrying a one-piece, narrow-chord elevator. Its fin and rudder, well forward of the elevator, are trapezoidal. Operational history The only Bakcyl first flew on 14 August 1988, followed by a period of flight testing. When this concluded the Bakcyl was used by the Bieszczadzki Aeroclub in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and may still be active.

On images of the small loch, when viewing oblique aerial images, the outline of a planned village can clearly been seen. The area covered by the loch was once a cultivated valley that was seized by the Forfeit Estates Commission after the Jacobite rising of 1745 and were portioned out as a reward to those who supported the government. When all those folk had died, Lady Jean (Lady Perth) converted the small valley into a loch, sometime between 1785 and 1800. The plan of the loch shows a street on an east to west alignment, with houses on either side of the street. Each house has a 1-acre plot, laid out at 90¬∞ degrees to the right, behind it. The village was known to extend east to a military road. The features that are visible below the water line are the main axial road with some plot boundaries visible. The west end of the loch below the water line are not visible due to the increasing depth at that end. .

Hanson, The Yavneh-Yam Ostracon The artefact was found in 1960 by Joseph Naveh at Mesad Hashavyahu, near Yavne-Yam. The inscription is known as KAI 200. In the inscription, the worker makes his appeal to the governor on the basis of both the garment's undeserved confiscation and by implication, the biblical law regarding holding past sundown a person's cloak as collateral for a debt (; cf. ). Although the petition does not specifically cite the law, it would have been commonly known by rulers and peasants alike. Some scholars argue that the ostracon bears the first known extra-Biblical reference to the Hebrew Sabbath day of rest, but the issue is debated.The First Extra-Biblical Reference to the Sabbath, c.630BCE Concerning who was in control of this area of the Philistine Plain, Shmuel Ahituv states,Ahituv, Shmuel, Echoes from the Past, (Jerusalem: CARTA, 2008), 158. \\"The letter is written in good biblical Hebrew, plus a possible scribal omission here or there, and the script is that of a trained scribe. The work supervisor mentioned in the text bears a clearly Judaean name, Hoshavyahu. All these factors point to a time of Judaean control over the area.\\" Naveh agrees, \\"The four Hebrew inscriptions together testify to this fortress having been under Judaean control at the time. ... It seems likely that Josiah placed a military governor in charge of the fortress, and that the force garrisoned there was supplied with provisions by the peasants living in the unwalled settlements in the vicinity.\\"Naveh, J. op.cit., 139. The ostracon was found under the floor of a room adjacent to the guardhouse/gate complex, is approximately 20 cm high by 16.5 cm wide, and contains 14 visible lines of text. In all, seven key artifacts were recovered, six of them inscribed ostraca in the Hebrew language. Pottery shards in the layer above represented Greek (early Ionian/Southwest Anatolian) or Persian- period pottery. The ostraca from this site are currently located in the Israel Museum at Jerusalem.

And he stole my garment! It is for the governor to give back the garment of his servant. So grant him mercy in that you return the garment of your servant and do not be displeased.\\" Due to breaks in the ostracon and a missing lower right section, Naveh states that there are too few letters available in line 13 to make an educated guess what it said.

She was the second wife of Theobald le Botiller. As his second wife her five children were not heirs to his lands but they were eligible to be heirs to hers so she and they retained her family name. When her husband died at Poitou in 1230 during the English invasion of France, de Verdun claimed her inheritances and paid the taxes to be allowed remain unmarried. She applied to be a femme sole and retain her independence. The king authorised Maurice FitzGerald to grant to her her lands in April 1233. She built Castleroche, seven miles northwest of Dundalk, in 1236 to defend her lands. She gained a strong and powerful reputation. However she was also very pious. de Verdun founded the Augustinian priory of Grace Dieu Priory in Leicestershire in 1239. As time went on however the pressure to marry again increased until de Verdun decided to become a nun by 1242 she was a member of the community at Grace Dieu. Her son inherited fully in 1247 when she died. Though originally buried at the priory, in the aftermath of the dissolution of the monasteries, the villagers of Belton reburied her in their village. Stories After the building of her castle on the edge of the Irish frontier de Verdun garnered a violent reputation. de Verdun was said to have been a ferocious fighter and wore body armour. Stories were told of her riding into battle against her enemies, the O'Hanlons. There were also fictionary tales around the building of the castle.

According to the New York Times, \\"Luis Estevez always did make a lady look like a vamp\\", known for his high slits, slinky dresses and dramatic necklines. Est√©vez was a founding member of Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA).  Early life and education  First Lady Betty Ford meeting Luis Est√©vez in 1975 in the west sitting hall of the White House. Luis Est√©vez de G√°lvez was born in c.1930 in Havana, Cuba to a wealthy Spanish-Cuban family. His father, Luis ‚ÄúBuffalo‚Äù Est√©vez, was an engineer, his mother, Gloria Cort√≠nas Ben√≠tez de G√°lvez, was a socialite, and his grandfather was a Cuban sugar magnate. His family had many generations of distinguished relatives and were descend from the De G√°lvez family, whom the city of Galveston, Texas was named and from a founder of the city of St. Augustine. His mother frequently had American magazines and adored French haute couture, she encouraged and influenced Est√©vez love of fashion and drawing. At age 10, he was sent to Pennsylvania to live with his aunt and her family because multiple kidnapping attempts were made on him in Cuba. He attended college-preparatory school in Delaware at Sanford School, graduating in 1947. He went on to study Architecture in college at the University of Havana, and upon leaving college, he moved to New York City. He never graduated from the University of Havana. In New York City he started to focus on Fashion and he attended Traphagen School of Fashion, graduating in 1951 in Costume Design. While in school he got a job in window display at Lord & Taylor department store, the job did not pay much but it gave him experience. His mother, who divorced from his father, financially supported Est√©vez, which allowed him to enjoy New York nightlife and meet New York society including at the nightclub El Morocco. He started dating Bahamian-American model Betty Dew at this time, she was a regular guest at the El Morocco nightclub. Lilly Dach√©, milliner and fashion designer hired Est√©vez to create a few designs while he was in school but he realized he was not yet experienced enough in his career and quit that job.  Career  A formal gown with a cape designed by Luis Est√©vez in 1975, for First Lady Betty Ford. Est√©vez and his girlfriend Betty Dew took a 1951 boat trip to France together, where he befriended more established designers including Hubert de Givenchy, Jacques Fath, and French Vogue editor Fran√ßoise de Langlade. He got an internship at the house of Jean Patou and the couple stayed in France for one year. In 1952, Est√©vez returned to New York City and joined Pat Hartley, a ready-to-wear fashion company. By 1955, Est√©vez launched his own label Grenelle-Est√©vez and a ready-to-wear collection with Fred Greenberg, Robert Greenberg and Ben Papell. His signature-style clothing was form-fitting cocktail and evening dresses designed with figure flattering shape, unusual angles, and noticeable necklines. His ready to wear clothing was moderately priced when compared to haute couture clothing, making it easy to sell in stores. One year later in 1956, at age 26, he became the youngest designer to win the Coty Award. He was very socially popular, and often had celebrities in his social circles. He and Dew built a hillside home in Acapulco, Mexico in 1957, named Le Cumbre. The Acapulco home was a popular party choice in the 1960s for celebrities, politicians, and socialites. In 1960, Est√©vez created a black dress based on the John Singer Sargent painting Portrait of Madame X (1884). Dina Merrill modeled the Est√©vez dress for photographer Milton H. Greene published in Life magazine on 11 January 1960. In the 1960s and 1970s he designed swimwear for Sea Darlings of California, a Los Angeles-based company. In 1965, he moved to the Hollywood Hills in California, and began working more closely with Hollywood actors and actresses. By 1972, he was designing under a private label with actress Eva Gabor and for Universal Studios designing costumes for film and television. He dressed many important people in his career including Betty Ford, Lynda Bird Johnson, Nancy Reagan, Eva Gabor, Marlene Dietrich, Grace Kelly, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Natalie Wood, Carol Channing, among others. His label Est√©vez closed in 1968, and he went into working freelance. In the 1970s he designed men's clothing for Jaymar. In 1975, Est√©vez met with Betty Ford in Palm Springs, while she was serving as the First Lady of the United States. Ford and Est√©vez discussed the creation of a line of clothing for Ford that could later be released as part of his own label, after she wore it. He created many original pieces for Ford, which were publicly worn at many formal events. He primarily worked with private clients starting in 1977. In the 1980s he opened the Est√©vez boutique on Melrose Place in Los Angeles, partnering Allan Carr which remained open until 1992. After the closure of the boutique he moved to Miami, Florida. In 1996, he returned to California in nearby Montecito in Santa Barbara County and with a new set of investors, he opened a new boutique which closed within one year due to a legal dispute with the investors. That same year in 1997, he retired from fashion design.  Death and legacy  He died 28 November 2014 in Miami, Florida. Est√©vez work is featured in various public museum collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum, Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Library of Congress, among others. His work is said to have influenced designers Michael Kors and Zac Posen. In 2019, his work was featured in a group exhibition The Traphagen School: Fostering American Fashion at the Museum at FIT in New York City.  Personal life  In 1953, Est√©vez married Bahamian-American model Betty Dew. Additionally he had many affairs with both men and women despite being married to Betty Dew, and was known to have had affairs with fashion designer Halston and actress Ethel Merman.

Foundation of the Russian Internet Sovam Teleport Sovam Teleport is a Russian telecommunications company that was founded in 1990. The company was established as a joint venture of the San Francisco Moscow Teleport network and the All-Russian Research Institute of Automated Application Systems (–í–ù–ò–ò–ü–ê–°). The name stands for \\"Short sOViet-AMerican Teleport\\". San Francisco Moscow Teleport (SFMT) was launched in 1983 by financier George Soros and American Joel Schatz with the support of the US government. It was a non-profit project with a goal to expand the Internet to the USSR. In 1986, the project changed its status and became a commercial enterprise. The All-Russian Research Institute of Automated Application Systems provided a data transmission network with some countries in Eastern Europe, as well as Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam, almost all of the data traffic was scientific and technical information, and in 1983 organized a non-state email network. By the beginning of the 1990s, almost half of the VNII traffic amounted to operational data from electronic mail systems. The company's first network was built on the X.25 protocol in 1990. In 1992, Sovam Teleport began to build a UUCP mail and terminal access system through American servers. Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, DuPont, Estee Lauder, Time magazine, and France Presse were among the first corporate clients of the company. Since 1992, the British company Cable & Wireless, which has its own fiber-optic channels in Europe, has become the third co-founder of the company. On June 4, 1992, the company was re-registered as a limited liability partnership, and all three co-founders - Cable & Wireless, All-Russian Research Institute of Automated Application Systems and SFMT - received almost equal shares.

DEMOS-based network After invading Afghanistan, the Soviet Union found itself under sanctions. However, a group of developers made a Russian version of the Unix operating system, secretly brought from America, and called it DEMOS. Some Unix developers, working at the Kurchatov Nuclear Energy Research Institute created a network that used DEMOS, namely RELCOM. The main feature of this network was that it was a fully horizontal network, i.e. each networked computer could directly communicate with other computers on the network. Many labs took part in joint experiments, so rapid communication was very much needed. Therefore, the first network users were mainly Soviet research institutes, so they could exchange scientific information more rapidly.  Cityline  Cityline was one of the first internet providers in Russia. It was founded in 1996 by Emelyan Zakharov, Demyan Kudryavcev, Egor Shuppe, Dmitriy Bosov and Rafael Filinov. The realization of the fact that the Internet was not appealing for Russian users without content led to content-oriented services. Cityline approached Anton Nosik, a journalist, and Anton would later create content for them. It led to a portal named 'Vechernii Internet' (–í–µ—á–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–π –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç), where Anton Nosik published his articles. In addition, the very first Russian web designer was Artemy Lebedev, who designed websites for Cityline. One of the most popular websites on the Russian internet was Anekdot.ru, a website dedicated to humour and stories. Anekdot.ru was founded by astrophysicist Dmitrii Verner.InterNYET:A History Of The Russian Internet  Episode #1{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdngdbzayHA} Search engines Rambler In 1996, the first Russian search engine, Rambler was launched. It was created by Sergey Lysakov, Dmitry Kryukov and others, who worked as scientists in Pushchino research facility. The algorithm that served as a basis for Rambler initially was used for registering and searching for microorganisms. One of the key features was the so-called Rambler Top-100, that showed the one hundred top searched websites on the Russian internet. In the beginning of 1999, 53% of Rambler's shares were sold to investors Russian Fonds (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –§–æ–Ω–¥—ã) and Orion Capital Advisors. As a result, the founders of the company became less important in the company. In 2000, as a result of the conflict between investors and the founders, Sergey Lysakov and Dmitry Kryukov left the company. Rambler later became a media company that included its own TV channel. Yandex In the early 90s, Ilya Segalovich and Arkadii Volash developed a search algorithm that was based on the morphology of Russian language. Initially this algorithm was proposed to Rambler for approximately 15K dollars, but was rejected. After the rejection, Ilya and Arkadii decided to found their own company, Yandex. Key figures in the company: Ilya Segalovich, Arkadii Volash and Elena Kolmanovskaya, editor-in-chief until 2012. Initially, it was a small company - employees at Yandex were friends of Arkadii Volash. Gradually Yandex became one of the leading Russian internet companies, and today, it includes several sub-companies, including Yandex.Taxi and news aggregator Yandex.News.InterNYET: A History Of The Russian Internet  Episode #3{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tPtg7C__Bo&t;=839s} Social Networks mail.ru Alexei Krivenkov created Russia's first e-mail service, while working for an American IT company. Mail.ru, that is based on a free web mail system created by Alexei Krivenkov, became the main asset of Port.ru, a company he co-founded with his American partner, Eugene Goland. Mail.ru was able to become the top three most visited Russian websites. In 1999, they attracted the first investment in the history of the Russian Internet - 1000000 dollars. One of the top Russian businessman, Yuri Milner - billionaire, global investor, one of co-owners and chairman of Mail.ru Group during the period from 2001 to 2012. He pursued the degree in physics from Moscow State University. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he later studied to become an investment banker. In 1999, Yuri Milner was looking for a project in which to invest his first capital. After studying several industries, he came across a young and growing sector called Internet, that required minimal startup capital and had an enormous potential. Milner raised some investment money and started a company called Netbridge. Among its first acquisitions were entertainment website Fomenko.ru and Herman Klimenko's web directory List.ru. Later Netbridge merged with Port.ru and was renamed after its main asset - Mail.ru. The merger was, in fact, an acquisition - nobody from the old Port.ru team remained in the company. One of the new directions that appeared after merger was online gaming. Dmitry Grishin, the main integration ideologist, became Mail.ru's technical director at the age of 22, later company's CEO. He realized that people in that time in Russia weren't ready to pay for games. Therefore, he decided to make games free. People would play, have fun, and then service offered players to buy something that will make them feel better. VKontakte VK (VKontakte) is a social network, that was founded in 2006 by Pavel Durov with the help of Russian-Israeli investors Yitzchak Mirilashvili and Lev Leviev. Nikolai Durov, the elder brother of Pavel Durov and a winner of multiple awards in mathematics and coding, was the lead software engineer of VKontakte. In 2010 the main office of VK was placed in the Singer building in Saint-Petersburg. Soon after its launch, VK gained massive attention among Russian-speaking users. It was free, in contrast to odnoklasniki.ru. In addition to being a social network, it also functioned as a file sharing network: users had a possibility to upload films, music, pictures, etc. In 2014 Pavel Durov resigned and left Russia. On 16 September 2014, Mail.ru Group became the sole owner of VK. Odnoklasniki.ru Odnoklasniki.ru is a social network that was launched in 2006 and created by Albert Popkov. The concept was similar to the social network Classmates.com, a website that was used for classmates to chat. As a result of losing users to VK, Odnoklasniki.ru focused on a more mature and more provincial audience. In 2008, Popkov's former British employer sued him, claiming that he'd stolen the code for Odnoklassniki.ru. Eventually, Popkov won the trial, however he lost his position as CEO. After that, access to Odnoklasniki.ru became fee-based, which cost Odnoklasniki.ru some users. Ilya Shirokov, the new CEO of Odnoklasniki.ru, rebranded the network, and it became the second most popular social network in Russia. In order to stay relevant, the company added a streaming service that enabled users to stream their own life moments to their friends.InterNYET: A History Of The Russian Internet  Episode #4{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yICRafN9BE&t;=1988s} Mail.ru Group Mail.ru Group is a Russian technology company.

The Mail.ru brand also operates the Mail.ru platform for business, combining all B2B services of the company, a Q&A; system, called Mail.ru answers and other Internet projects. Messengers Telegram After leaving VKontakte, Pavel Durov founded Telegram, a cross-platform messaging service. It includes general chats, secret chats, group chats, channels and chat-bots. The service is cloud-based, which means that all chats can be available on all devices, except for secret chats. The main emphasis was put on anonymity and encryption. Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, where only the sender and receiver have an encryption key. In contrary to general chats, messages are not decrypted on the server and message history is stored on the client devices. It is also possible to set a timer for secret chat, where all messages and files in the chat will be permanently deleted after a certain amount of time. In 2018, Roskomnadzor required Pavel Durov to give access to the encryption keys, otherwise Telegram would be blocked in Russia. As a response, Pavel Durov stated that it is was not possible to transfer encryption keys, as they were being created on a user's device every time that user connects with someone. On April 13, 2018, the Tagansky court of Moscow ruled in favor of Roskomnadzor, allowing them to block Telegram in Russia. As a response to the block, Pavel Durov created Digital Resistance. On April 30, 2018, more than 12 thousand people gathered on Moscow streets to support Telegram. Those events increased interest in Telegram among Russian users.Telegram: –Ω–æ–≤—ã–π –º–µ—Å—Å–µ–Ω–¥–∂–µ—Ä –æ—Ç –ü–∞–≤–ª–∞ –î—É—Ä–æ–≤–∞{https://republic.ru/posts/l/978067} Russian bloggers LiveJournal With the emergence of Facebook, LiveJournal's popularity in the United States began to wane. In Russia, it continued to grow. LiveJournal became a platform for the formation of civil society. The first to unite were car drivers campaigning against the excessive use of flashing lights on the roads. The community received the name of \\"Blue Buckets\\". Civil activists on LiveJournal were soon followed by politicians. Aleksei Navalny's corruption investigations made his blog the most popular one on LiveJournal. The politician is still referred to as a blogger in pro-government media. According to Aleksei Navalny, \\"After 2005 or 2006, when mass media had been cleaned up and there remained only a couple of independent newspapers, the entire political debate moved to LiveJournal.\\" In 2007, LiveJournal was acquired by SUP Media, co-owned by a Russian businessman named Aleksandr Mamut.InterNYET: A History Of The Russian Internet  Episode #5{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ep4tG7fapg} Spasibo, Eva Yry Degtyaryov was one of the first content creators on YouTube. He made videos featuring his friend, Sam Nickel. Degtyaryov soon became a producer on RuTube, a Russian copycat of YouTube. But he didn't produce videos on that platform for long. After he found out that YouTube would start paying for videos through ads, he left RuTube. After that, he created Spasibo, Eva!(Thanks, Eva), a platform for aspiring Russian video bloggers. Among them, Ruslan Usachev, Danila Poperechny, Ilya Madisson, Ilya Prusikin and others. In 2013, hackers from the Anonymous group released internal Spasibo, Eva! emails, from which it became known that Spasibo, Eva! bloggers were paid by the Kremlin. This came as a shock for the majority of Spasibo, Eva! bloggers, as they didn't know where the money came from. KlikKlak After leaving Thanks, Eva!, Prusikin, Usachev and their friends founded KlikKlak, Russia's first independent community of video bloggers. Today, it's one of the biggest production companies on the Russian-language segment of YouTube. In the beginning, they shot their videos in the living room, and as the platform grew, the videos became more and more professional. Nowadays in Russia there are several production teams on YouTube similar to KlikKlak, for instance Chiken Curry and Big Russian Boss. The evolution of online platforms and streaming services makes it possible to monetize and promote web content without involvement by producers or the state. For example, Yuri Dud, journalist and blogger, is gaining around 7 million rubles just with integrated advertising. Bloggers in politics The first Russian politician to start a channel on YouTube was Aleksei Navalny, an opposition figure. In the summer of 2019, Moscow saw protests: first, against not allowing independent candidates to run in local election, and then against police excesses against protesters. Russian Youtubers have been described as one of the driving forces of the Moscow protests. Danila Poperechny, Eldar Dzharakhov and Restaurateur came to St. Petersburg to take part in the rallies. Nikolai Sobolev, a vlogger, covered the protests and the criminal cases against demonstrators.INTERNYET: A History Of The Russian Internet  Episode #7{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkux3LKIZZk&pbjreload;=10} Governmental control League for a Safe Internet Konstantin Malofeyev, founder of the League for a Safe Internet, initiated the first restrictive Internet law in Russia. The so-called filtration law makes it mandatory to block websites containing harmful information, like pedophilia, propaganda of suicide, etc. As Malofeyev stated, the League's main task was to prepare a bill to protect children from negative content. The bill was supported by Yelena Mizulina, a Russian politician. Russian internet leaders, including Yandex, LiveJournal and VKontakte, spoke out against the Internet filtration law, seeing it as a censorship tool. The Russian Wikipedia went on a one-day strike. After that, the Russian State Duma has since passed more than 20 laws restricting the Internet.

For violation of this prohibition, the violator faces a fine of 3,000 to 5,000 rubles with confiscation of encryption.

According to an official statement, the Sovereign Internet Act will increase internet security in case of a cyber attack. According to experts, Sovereign Internet Act will create a possibility to isolate the Russian segment of the Internet, in addition it could be possible to switch off the Internet connection to certain areas of Russia. Among the public, the Sovereign Internet Act was considered to be an instrument of censorship and control over the Internet. On March 10th, 2019, approximately 15 thousand people gathered on Sakharov Avenue to support free internet. The law was enacted on November 1, 2019.

In Warsaw it is organized by the informal group Alliance of Women. The name comes from the slang abbreviation for the word manifestacja, used in this form by the anti-government opposition in the 1980s. In 2007 the Manifa was called the \\"March of Women's Solidarity\\" (alluding to the Solidarity movement) and emphasizing the commonalities of women's struggles. It represents the power of women how they have the moral right women have to obtain the final say in their decisions. The rights that women have fought so hard to make a reality and on June 4, 2009, was the twentieth anniversary in Poland for the celebration of freedom of speech and will of the people. The first Manifa in 2000 was organized to protest against a violent enforcement of anti-abortion law in Lubliniec, where police officers detained a gynecologist patient during an examination and forced her to undergo a forensic examination. It turned into a nationwide feminist, anti-discrimination, and anti-clerical demonstration. The motto of the first Manifa was \\"Democracy without women is only half-democracy.\\" In later demonstrations, the focus shifted to economic and employment issues. The motto of the 2011 Manifa was \\"Enough of exploitation! We give notice!\\" and was attended by the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions, the Polish Trade Union of Nurses and Midwives, the August 80 Free Trade Union, and the Polish Teachers' Association.In March 2017, 4,000 people marched under the slogan ‚ÄúAgainst the Violence of Power‚Äù in Warsaw, along with protesters in eight other cities in Poland.

Approximately 2,000 women walked through Warsaw for an annual Women‚Äôs Day march in defense of women‚Äôs rights, including unrestricted right to abortion. The march focused on Poland‚Äôs strict anti-abortion law and was a response to Poland‚Äôs ruling party's plan to ban the possibility of abortion of sick fetuses, which has drawn vehement protests from women‚Äôs organizations.

It is situated southeast of Hope, northeast of Chilliwack Lake, and west of Silvertip Mountain, which is its nearest higher peak. Following Silvertip, Mount Payne is the second-highest summit in the Hope Mountains, a subset of the Skagit Range. The peak was first climbed in 1950 by J. Bussell, H. Genschorek, I. Kay, A. Melville, and W. Sparling. The peak was named for Damasus Payne, a Benedictine monk and mountaineer who tragically fell to his death on Edge Peak in 1978. Payne was responsible for naming mountains such as Mount Rohr and Mount Duke. He also carried all the materials for mass and communion up to the summit of Slesse Mountain to perform a ceremony to honor the victims of Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 810. Mt. Payne's name was officially adopted May 7, 1984, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into headwaters of the Sumallo River, and into the Klesilkwa River, which is a tributary of the Skagit . Geology Mount Payne is related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Payne.

It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is found in the Cuyo region in western Argentina. Description The blooms of Tagetes mendocina are white or yellow, relatively small in comparison to the rest of the species within the genus Tagetes. This perennial plant has fibrous roots and typically grows to about tall. The leaves are pinnately compound. It is able to grow in many different soil types, though it grows best in areas with good drainage. It can tolerate drought to some extent. Distribution The geographical region in which these species can be found is in Argentina, with in the Cuyo Regions which covers provinces of Mendoza, San Juan, and the Occidental side of San Luis. It consists of diverse regions including high mountain ranges, valley, and desert climate. Its common name in Spanish is Chilchil del Cerro this could be related to the fact that Chili is west of the Cuyo Regions. ‚ÄúDel Cerro‚Äù translates to hills which relates to the diverse mountain ranges. This desert experiences a wide range of temperatures throughout the year, and dry year-round. Cold seasons cause T.mendocina to go into a vegetative state and flourish during warm season. However, like most plants they will not grow in extremely hot temperatures. According to JSTOR Global plants this species has been found in Mendoza providence. The average temperature in this region can range from 37¬∞F-85¬∞F: rarely below 30¬∞F or above 96¬∞F. Invasive species In some areas this may be considered an invasive species but in most it is not. This species is closely related to Tagetes minuta which is considered a noxious invasive plant in some areas. Location of Cuyo Region in Argentina: Mendoza, San Luis, and San Juan Metabolites Thiophene (C4H4S) is a five-ring heterocyclic compound which has been found in the roots of T.mendocina. It is an aromatic, colorless liquid that is said to have a benzene-like odor and reaction. Thiophene has been shown to protect against bacteria, fungi, algae and insects.

He was the recipient of three Navy Crosses, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat. Roberts began his career as a Navy Corpsman attached to 5th Marine Regiment during World War I and earned his first Navy Cross during the Battle of Belleau Wood for evacuation of wounded Marines under heavy machine gun fire. He received his second Navy Cross during the Nicaraguan Campaign in fall 1928, where he distinguished himself while he led several Marine patrols against hostile bandits and the third one for his command of 22nd Marine Regiment during Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Roberts was killed in action by Japanese sniper at the end of Okinawa campaign. Early career Harold C. Roberts was born on October 1, 1898 in Buffalo, New York, the son of George Fenn Roberts, M.D. and his wife Nettie Maude. He graduated from the high school and following the United States entry into World War I, he enlisted the United States Navy. Roberts was subsequently ordered to the Naval Station Great Lakes, Illinois for basic training, which he completed several months later and was sent to the Naval Corpsman School at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Roberts was attached to 5th Marine Regiment and embarked for France. He participated in the Battle of Belleau Wood and distinguished himself on the night of June 7, 1918, when as a Pharmacist's Mate Third Class he showed exceptional heroism by volunteering to cross an open field under heavy machine-gun fire to bring in the wounded who were calling for help. For this act of valor, Roberts was decorated with the Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat. He also received the Silver Star for his later part in the war. Following the war, Roberts remained in the Navy, but applied for commission in the United States Marine Corps. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on June 3, 1922 and was ordered to The Basic School at Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia for basic officer training. Roberts then served at Quantico until June 1924, when he was attached to the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS Pennsylvania. While aboard Pennsylvania he took part in the patrol cruises to Hawaii and to Melbourne, Australia and Wellington, New Zealand. He was transferred to Marine Corps Base San Diego, California in August 1926 and upon his promotion to first lieutenant on November 23, 1927, he was temporarily attached to the 3rd Marine Brigade in China. Roberts was transferred to 2nd Marine Brigade in January 1928 and ordered to Nicaragua, where he participated in the jungle patrols against Sandino bandits in Nueva Segovia Department. He distinguished himself during this assignment and was decorated with his second Navy Cross. Roberts also received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for saving the life of a fellow Marine in March 1928 and the Government of Nicaragua bestowed him with the Presidential Medal of Merit with Diploma. In July 1929, Roberts returned to the United States and assumed duty at Marine Barracks, Parris Island, South Carolina, where he served until June 1930. He was subsequently attached to the Marine detachment aboard the newly commissioned cruiser USS Houston and sailed for the Far East, where he participated in the patrol cruises off the coast of Shanghai, China. Following the outbreak of the hostilities between China and Japan, Roberts was transferred to the 4th Marine Regiment in June 1931 and served at Shanghai International Settlement until December 1933, when he returned to the United States. He then served at the headquarters, Department of the Pacific in San Francisco until July 1934, when he was sent to the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico. Roberts completed the Base Defense Weapons Course there and was promoted to captain on May 31, 1935. He then served at Quantico and was promoted to major on July 1, 1939. He was ordered to Hawaii in April 1940 and joined the 3rd Defense Battalion under Colonel Harry K. Pickett as a battery commander. The Marine defense battalions were special Marine units, which were designated as the defense force of the Pacific naval bases and were be placed on Midway Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Atoll and Palmyra Atoll. In September 1940, Roberts led approximately a third of 3rd Defense Battalion to Midway and assumed responsibility for the anti-aircraft defense of the atoll. Upon the appointment of Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Pepper as commanding officer, 3rd Defense Battalion in February 1941, Roberts was appointed his executive officer. The 3rd Defense Battalion was relocated to Hawaii in October 1941. World War II Pearl Harbor Roberts (second from left) with 3rd Defense Battalion Staff. At the time of Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, Roberts served as acting commander of 3rd Defense Battalion in the absence of Colonel Pepper, who was on an observation tour of Higgins Boats near Midway. Roberts was sleeping in his quarters in Honolulu when he was woken up by a telephone call made by the battalion's assistant communication officer, Frederick M. Steinhauser. He was quickly briefed by Steinhauser and jumped into his car with Major Kenneth W. Benner, commanding officer of the battalion's 3-inch antiaircraft group. They drove through the heavy traffic toward Pearl Harbor, witnessing Japanese planes attacking the Navy ships. Roberts reached the Marine Barracks at Pearl Harbor Navy Yard after a twenty minute trip and began organizing the anti-aircraft defense of his battalion. He directed medical personnel to set up dressing stations at each battalion headquarters; organized the precautions in the temporary wooden barracks, placing extinguishers in the front of them, along with shovels, axes and buckets of sand (the latter to deal with incendiary bombs); hose reel and chemical carts placed near the center hydrant near the mess hall; and all possible containers filled with water for both fighting fires and drinking. In addition, he ordered cooks and messmen to prepare coffee and fill every other container on hand with water, and organized riflemen in groups of about 16 to sit on the ground with an officer or non-commissioned officer in charge to direct their fire. He also called for runners from all groups in the battalion and established his command post at the parade ground's south corner, and ordered the almost 150 civilians who had showed up looking for ways to help out to report to the machine gun storeroom and fill ammunition belts and clean weapons. Among other actions, he also instructed the battalion sergeant major to be ready to safeguard important papers from the headquarters barracks. Roberts directed anti-aircraft defense and subsequent fire extinguishing and recommended that the entire 3d Defense Battalion be commended for \\"their initiative, coolness under fire, and the alacrity with which they emplaced their guns.\\" Guadalcanal Roberts and his battalion then reinforced Midway, Johnston and Palmyra atoll garrisons and was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel on May 8, 1942. He ultimately embarked for Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands and took part in the Landing at Tulagi on August 7, 1942. The 3rd Defense Battalion successfully hit three enemy ships that had beached themselves to land troops and repulsed 133 bombing attacks by Japanese planes. Roberts then took part in Battle for Henderson Field at the end of October 1942 and his battalion defended Lunga Point against an enemy counterattack from the sea. He was promoted to temporary colonel on October 30, 1942. The 3rd Defense Battalion departed Guadalcanal in February 1943 and arrived to New Zealand, where it was garrisoned near Masterton. Roberts succeeded Colonel Robert H. Pepper as commanding officer, 3rd Defense Battalion on March 15, 1943 and received Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" and Navy Presidential Unit Citation for his service on Guadalcanal. Stateside service and Leyte Roberts returned to the United States in June 1943 and joined the headquarters, Fleet Marine Force, San Diego area. He returned to Pacific area in October 1944 and assumed duty as Chief of Staff of the Artillery, V Amphibious Corps under Brigadier General Thomas E. Bourke. While in this capacity, Roberts took part in the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines. Okinawa Roberts (left) only few days before his death, with commander of 3rd Battalion Clair W. Shisler. Okinawa, June 1945. In January 1945, Roberts was ordered back to Guadalcanal, now a large supply and training base, where newly established 6th Marine Division under Major General Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr. conducted intensive training for further combat deployment in Pacific. He was attached to the division staff and took part in the preparations of plans and amphibious training for the Okinawa Campaign. Roberts spent two months on Guadalcanal and embarked for the staging area at Ulithi, a little atoll in the Caroline Islands at the beginning of March 1945. The Sixth Marine Division went ashore on April 1, 1945 and met heavy Japanese resistance, mainly artillery, mortars, machine guns, and snipers. General Shepherd was not satisfied with the progress of 22nd Marine Regiment under Colonel Merlin F. Schneider. General Shepherd thought that Schneider, who served in the Pacific area nonstop since June 1942 needed rest and ordered Roberts to relieve him. Roberts succeeded Schneider on May 17, 1945 after a six weeks of heavy fighting and the first thing he did was establishing of his command post immediately behind front lines. He wanted to demonstrate to his men, that their commander was with them on the front line and also wanted better overview of the tactical situation. He led his regiment during the combats near Naha and the capture of Sugar Loaf Hill. For his service at Sugar Loaf Hill, Roberts received his third Navy Cross. On June 18, 1945, the Twenty- Second Marines were participating in the action of Hill 69 and Roberts had been up forward watching the advance of 2nd Battalion with his executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel August Larson, when a sniper opened fire on them. Roberts was hit in the chest and died a few moments later. Larson assumed command of the regiment. Colonel Roberts was temporarily buried on Okinawa and later reburied at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California. His wife, Faith Newton Roberts (1900‚Äì1972) was buried beside him. They had one daughter, Katherine.

It was listed as a Historic Monument in 1916,, whereas the belfry of the original church across the street was listed in 1840. The belfry is also part of the World Heritage-listed Belfries of Belgium and France. History The original church of the mid-15th century had the shape of a Latin cross. It was consecrated around 1443. It is said to have been erected by prime contractors from Ghent on the site of St. John's Hospice. In 1558, the French troops led by Mar√©chal de Thermes invaded the city and burnt the church. Only the tower survived. The re-construction of the church started in 1559 under the supervision of prime contractor Jean de Renneville and ended in 1567. The sanctuary was enlarged to the east, the main nave was elevated and the side aisles were re-built with chapels. However, the works were stopped in 1585 because of a lack of funding. The old tower remained isolated from the new church by the ruins of the original church and served as a bell tower, municipal belfry and daymark. The original project was never ended. The space between the new church and the belfry was transformed into a public pathway in 1591, then into a street in 1731. In 1782, extension works were made by architect Victor Louis on the behalf of intendant de Calonne to cope with the population growth. Victor Louis offered to move the outer walls beyond the abutments of the side aisles and to merge the two side chapels to build two additional naves. The works lasted until 1787. The campanile added in 1610 was demolished and a new fa√ßade (dated 1785) was built. The fa√ßade is a Classical portico with pediments and pillars. Between 1793 and 1795, the building was used as a Temple of Reason. In 1882, the disintegrating fa√ßade was demolished and replaced with a new one. The Gothic Revival project of architect was selected. The first stone was laid on April 11, 1887, and the new fa√ßade was ended in 1889 by the city architect . The church was heavily damaged during the First World War, in 1915 and 1917. After long restoration works funded by the war damage compensation (dommages de guerre), the church was re-opened. But in May and June 1940, it was hit by incendiary bombs and only the walls survived. Even though the church was re- opened for worship in 1977, the restoration works lasted until 1985. Architecture The long church is made of bricks, except for the window frames, the pillars of the interior and the fa√ßade that are made of white stone. The interior of the church has five aisles, the central aisle being wider than the other ones. The aisles lead to a double ambulatory with five apse chapels. The nave has three bays, while the choir has three bays and five ambulatory bays. Two sacristies are adjacent to two bays of the second side aisle of the choir. Furniture The major part of the furniture prior to 1940 was destroyed. Thus, the church benefited of donations of furniture from the Church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste of the 18th and 19th centuries. The stained glass windows of the choir and the rose window were made by Pierre Gaudin. The other stained glass windows were made by from the drafts of painter . The modern main organ was made by Gonzaled in 1970. It has three 56-chord keyboards of each, a 32-chord mechanical pedalboard, and electric stops. It was recently restored and enlarged by Bernard Dargassies. Tomb The sacristy of Saint-√âloi hosts the remains of the corsair Jean Bart (1650‚Äì1702) who became famous for the Battle of Texel.

A remake of the Malayalam film Charlie (2015) by Martin Prakkat, the film stars Madhavan and Shraddha Srinath in the lead roles. The film's music is composed by Ghibran, with cinematography and editing were handled by Dinesh Krishnan, Karthik Muthukumar and Bhuvan Srinivasan. The film is scheduled to release through Amazon Prime Video on 17 December 2020.  Cast  * Madhavan as Maara * Shraddha Srinath * Sshivada * Moulee * Alexander Babu * Minon  Production  Producers Prateek Chakravorty and Shruti Nallappa of Pramod Films acquired the Tamil remake rights of the Malayalam film Charlie (2015) by Martin Prakkat, in February 2016. The producers were initially keen to retain Parvathy Thiruvothu from the original version, and considered either Vijay Sethupathi, Sivakarthikeyan or Siddharth to play the titular role. In April 2016, Madhavan was signed on to play the lead role, while Prakkat agreed to also direct the Tamil version. The director later opted out and A. L. Vijay was signed in June 2016 to helm the project, and agreed in principle to take up the project after the completion of his commitments on Devi (2016) and Vanamagan (2017). In January 2017, actress Sai Pallavi signed on to play the leading female role, with the makers announcing that production would soon begin in Ooty and Pondicherry. Following several months of inactivity, director Vijay confirmed in June 2017 that he would be prioritising other projects and the adaptation of Charlie was indefinitely postponed. He opted to instead work on the bilingual drama Karu (2018) with the dates he had for Sai Pallavi, and completed an alternate project for Pramod Films, the dance film Lakshmi (2018). In June 2018, Pramod Films announced that they would make the film under the title of Maara with director Dhilip Kumar (of Kalki fame) signed on to replace Vijay. Dhilip confirmed that the makers were keen to retain Madhavan for the film despite the change of crew, believing that only the actor had the \\"innate charm\\" meant for the character of the lead protagonist. Dhilip stated that the makers were initially apprehensive about casting Shraddha Srinath as the lead actress, as she had already been paired with Madhavan in Vikram Vedha (2017), but finalised her because Maara was in a different genre. The director also suggested that he felt both Madhavan and Shraddha shared the real-life characteristics of their on-screen roles. Dhilip worked on editing the script, while the additional screenplay was written by Bipin and dialogues were written by Neelan. Ghibran was signed as the film's music composer, Deepak Bhagwan was selected to be the cinematographer and Malayali art director Ajayan Challisery was also picked to join the crew. The actors completed a week-long rehearsal before the start of shoot, with production beginning in Pondicherry on 18 June 2018. The film was subsequently put on hold and Madhavan later became busy with the production of his first directorial venture, Rocketry: The Nambi Effect (2020), meaning that there was a schedule break of over a year. In October 2019, production restarted in Kochi with child actor Minon and comedian Alexander Babu joining the cast. The film entered post-production in mid 2020.

A Krabby Patty is a hamburger sold by the fictional restaurant the Krusty Krab in the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. Created by the restaurant's founder and manager Eugene Krabs and his archenemy Plankton, it is what the main character SpongeBob cooks throughout his job as a fry cook, and the restaurant's trademark food and most famous burger in Bikini Bottom. A prominent running gag throughout the series is Krabs' nemesis Plankton trying to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. This running gag was given a backstory in the special \\"Friend or Foe\\", where it is revealed that Krabs and Plankton created the Krabby Patty to compete with the health-violating restaurant Stinky Burgers.  Role in SpongeBob SquarePants  Krabby Patties make their debut appearance in SpongeBob SquarePants pilot episode \\"Help Wanted\\" and have had many different variations throughout the show's run. The Krabby Patty burger is a menu item sold by the Krusty Krab as a fast food product. It is considered to be one of the most successful foods in Bikini Bottom. The Krabby Patty formula is a closely guarded trade secret, and rival restaurateur Plankton's futile attempts at acquiring the secret formula is a major recurring theme throughout the series. The Krusty Krab usually attracts customers from Bikini Bottom because of the Krabby Patty's renowned taste and the fact that Plankton's restaurant, the Chum Bucket, has a menu consisting of mostly inedible chum. Due to the lack of viable competition, Mr. Krabs is generally free to engage in price gouging, a practice he has been known to do throughout the show. Sometimes the Krusty Krab is shown to have a drive-thru to serve krabby patties seen in the episodes \\"Driven to Tears\\" and \\"Drive Thru\\" as well as The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water. It is noted by Mr. Krabs that the Krusty Krab and the Krabby Patty is clean and disease-free.  Ingredients  The Krabby Patty is made out of a frozen hamburger with buns, the patty, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, ketchup, mustard, and onions and with a Krabby Patty secret formula, though said secret formula has never been revealed in the series. In the episode \\"Just One Bite,\\" the Krusty Krab is revealed to have a \\"patty vault\\" that contains many Krabby Patties. The Krusty Krab's menu, the Galley Grub, consists mostly of ordinary fast food items, such as french fries and sodas. Its signature sandwich, the Krabby Patty, is celebrated, to a comic degree, by the citizens of Bikini Bottom. In The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, Mr. Krabs states: \\"The Krabby Patty is what ties us all together! Without it, there will be a complete breakdown of social order!\\" The sandwich comprises two buns, with the patty, lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, and pickles between them (in that order).  Theories  The formula has been hinted at but remained a mystery throughout the series. A running gag is Plankton's obsession with obtaining it as a way to produce the sandwiches and attract customers to his across-the- street restaurant, the Chum Bucket. The recipe of the patty is a closely guarded trade secret, which have led viewers to speculate about its contents. Several fan theories have been formed to guess the secret ingredient. According to series animator Vincent Waller, \\"there is absolutely no meat in the Krabby Patty. There's no animal product in there\\", something which was always planned by series creator Stephen Hillenburg. Mr. Lawrence, a show writer and Plankton's voice actor, explained that the show's writers are not allowed to depict fish as food; he stated that there is no meat served in Bikini Bottom except at the Chum Bucket. Tom Kenny, the voice actor for SpongeBob, joked: \\"Krabby Patties are hummus!\\" Some commentators suggest that there is actually no secret ingredient, pointing to Mr. Krabs' miserliness. A writer for Hollywood.com believes that it is \\"all a ruse that crafty Mr. Krabs came up with in order to stop Plankton from focusing on [t]he Chum Bucket. It's legitimately brilliant marketing!\\" The episode \\"Patty Caper\\" shows that there is truly a secret ingredient in the Krabby Patty, which is delivered to the restaurant with high security. On the possibility that the secret Krabby Patty formula will be revealed in future episodes, Waller said in 2017 that he \\"would not count on it\\". In 2019, Waller stated that Hillenburg, who died in 2018, is the only person to have seen it.  Real-life inspirations  Publications such as USA Today have named it among other fictional foods that many have wanted to exist in real life, but according to the New York Daily News, there are four restaurants which serve a similar burger to the seen one in the show. These burgers include the Snow Crab Crispy Rice, Phuket Fantasy, Angry Crab Benedict, and Soft Shell Crab Taco. The Krabby Patties have also inspired real life gummy confectionery treats, primarily in New England. In 2008, a doctor with Texas A&M; Health Science Center College of Medicine warned parents to be aware of where the candy their child consumes is produced due to contamination then found in Chinese milk; SpongeBob Gummy Krabby Patties were among those candies produced in China. In 2019, a reporter with the student newspaper of Capital University gave the gummy candies a rating of a 2 out of 10 in their review of Halloween candy. The Krabby Patty has been used by Katy Perry as a second costume on the red carpet at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. In The SpongeBob Musical, the Krabby Patty was portrayed by an actor on stage at the Palace Theatre. Various merchandise depicts SpongeBob and the Krabby Patty such as HipDot, as make-up, and as dog toys.

The sculpture was first shown at the Paris Salon of 1890. G√©r√¥me subsequently created smaller, gilded bronze versions of Tanagra; several versions of the \\"Hoop Dancer\\" figurine held by Tanagra; two paintings of an imaginary ancient Tanagra workshop; and two self-portraits of himself sculpting Tanagra from a living model in his Paris atelier.

The ancient Tanagra figurines Veiled dancer, Tanagra terra cotta figure, 7 inches high, c. 150-100 B.C.E, Louvre. In December 1870, at a site called Tanagra in Greece, archaeologists unearthed a group of Hellenistic terra cotta figurines bearing traces of original polychrome. The discovery caused a sensation, because it provided firm evidence supporting the theory that ancient sculpture was painted. The Tanagra figurines, which depicted not gods or heroes but ordinary people, were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris, where they charmed and fascinated the public. In subsequent decades, countless forgeries flooded the art market. Tanagra figurines infiltrated popular literature and theater, as seen by references in Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) and An Ideal Husband (1895), and Marcel Proust's Swann's Way (1913). G√©r√¥me's Tanagra Hoop Dancer, c. 1893, by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, Haggin Museum. As a painter and sculptor, G√©r√¥me had long drawn inspiration from the Classical world. His famous images of gladiator combats, chariot races, slave markets, the assassination of Julius Caesar, and other subjects from ancient Greece and Rome were widely influential. In his mid-sixties, G√©r√¥me expressed his fascination with the Tanagra figurines, and the ancients who made and owned them, with his 5-foot-high, tinted-marble Tanagra, a female nude personifying the Tyche, or presiding spirit, of the ancient city. Tanagra sits stiffly upright \\"atop an excavation mound. Numerous figurines have surfaced in the soil. At her feet lie the tools that allude to both the archaeological dig as well as G√©r√¥me's role as sculptor.\\" On the upraised palm of Tanagra‚Äôs hand is a figurine of a female Hoop Dancer (G√©r√¥me's own invention, inspired by, but not a copy of, an actual Tanagra figurine). Thus Tanagra depicts a statue holding a statue. The larger statue sits rigidly posed while the smaller is a \\"twirling figure, who gracefully dips her head into a golden ring clutched in her right hand and cups a golden ball in the other, as her drapery swirls around her.\\" \\"Inspired by his characteristic desire for both archaeological accuracy and realism, G√©r√¥me delicately tinted the skin, hair, lips, and nipples of his Tanagra, causing a sensation at the Salon of 1890.\\" A contemporary critic suggested that if the sculpture had been \\"secretly buried for a time, and then publicly excavated as an antique, perhaps with a broken arm, it would have turned the heads of the whole art world, and been declared in its vital characteristics and subtle anatomy a rival to the Milo Venus.\\"M. Parry Kennard, Boston Transcript, 6 July 1890, as quoted in G√©r√¥me: The Life and Works of Jean L√©on G√©r√¥me by Fanny Field Hering, New York: Cassell Publishing Company, 1892, p. 282.

File:G√©r√¥me - Painting Breathes Life into Sculpture.jpgAtelier de Tanagra (Tanagra workshop), 1893, private collection; auctioned by Sotheby's in 2013 for $125,000. Gerome would subsequently create and sell numerous copies of the Hoop Dancer figurine held by his Tanagra, making the Hoop Dancer the modern-day equivalent of a Tanagra figurine. \\"Here the artist is not so much breathing life into painted or sculpted flesh as reinventing for the modern age the mass-produced figurines of antiquity.\\" In 1893, G√©r√¥me created two paintings of imaginary Tanagra workshops. Although G√©r√¥me opposed the admission of female art students to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, both of these paintings depict a female artist who is painting copies of G√©r√¥me's Hoop Dancer figurine (a modern anachronism retrojected back in time). These Hoop Dancers are offered for sale, along with other figurines, to browsing art- lovers (all female) who themselves resemble Tanagra figurines. In one of these paintings a smaller version of G√©r√¥me's Tanagra presides over the sales counter, holding a Hoop Dancer in her hand. This Tanagra is a painting of a statue holding a statue. Also in this painting, the young artisan is busy \\"colouring an edition of 12 Hoop Dancers in various brilliant hues‚Äîa tongue- in-cheek advertisement, perhaps, made to promote the figurines that he [G√©r√¥me] was offering for sale in two different sizes and a variety of media through his dealer and father-in-law Adolphe Goupil.

In 1894 and 1890, G√©r√¥me painted two versions of a self-portrait depicting the artist at work in his atelier: The Artist and His Model (now at the Haggin Museum) and Working in Marble (Dahesh Museum of Art). The self-portraits are very similar, but differ in at least one significant respect. In these self- portraits G√©r√¥me is seen sculpting Tanagra from a live model who holds the seated, stiffly upright pose, though her upturned palm is empty. Behind the model on its own stand is a large polychrome Hoop Dancer statuette of the sort G√©r√¥me made for sale to the public. Various props litter the studio. In each painting, hanging on the wall in the background, is a painting by G√©r√¥me of Pygmalion and Galatea, another of his works inspired by the ancient world (and made the same year as Tanagra).Sanders, Patricia B. The Haggin Collection, Stockton: The Haggin Museum, 1991, p 92. The self-portraits depict a real sculptor (G√©r√¥me) bringing life to a statue by copying a living woman; the Pygmalion paintings depict a mythical sculptor whose statue is becoming a living woman. File:G√©r√¥me details.jpgLeft: Detail showing Pygmalion and Galatea in the background of The Artist and His Model. Right: detail showing a different Pygmalion and Galatea in the background of Working in Marble. The doppelg√§ngers and visual puns are complex, because the Pygmalion paintings in the two backgrounds are similar but not identical. Just as G√©r√¥me painted two self-portraits, he also painted more than one version of Pygmalion and Galatea. The most famous, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, shows the kissing sculptor and statue from behind; it appears in the background of The Artist and His Model. But G√©r√¥me painted at least one variant (now in a private collection), in which Pygmalion and Galatea are seen kissing from the front. This version appears in Working in Marble. Tanagra at the Mus√©e d'Orsay.In both self-portraits, a variant of Pygmalion and Galatea is depicted as a painting of a mythical sculptor and living statue within a painting of a real sculptor, a living model, and (despite appearances) a plaster (not marble) statue. > Like most 19th-century sculptors, G√©r√¥me did not carve the marble himself > but furnished professional marble cutters with a full-size plaster to use as > a guide. It is this intermediate step that is depicted in Working in Marble, > a title that refers to the overall creative process. G√©r√¥me portrays himself > on a turn stand putting the finishing touches on the plaster version of > Tanagra, carefully judging the accuracy of his work against the live model. L√©opold Bernhard Bernstamm, G√©rome painting a hoop dancer, 1897, Mus√©e Georges-Garret, Vesoul. This complex self-portrait is \\"a summation of G√©r√¥me‚Äôs remarkable career as both painter and sculptor.\\" As in all his works connected to Tanagra, we see G√©r√¥me \\"powerfully evoking the continuous interplay between painting and sculpture, reality and artifice, as well as highlighting the inherently theatrical nature of the artist‚Äôs studio.\\" The Haggin Museum also has a bronze Hoop Dancer by G√©r√¥me, displayed beside The Artist and His Model. The original Tanagra resides at the Mus√©e d'Orsay (fiche oeuvre 15298). A 29.5-inch-high, gilded bronze version of Tanagra by G√©r√¥me is held by the Phoenix Art Museum (object 1986.54), which also has a gilded bronze Hoop Dancer (object 2000.12). More gilded bronze versions of Tanagra exist; one was auctioned in 2011 by Sotheby's for 150,000 GBP, another in 2017 by for $50,000.

Bacigalupi helped to set the direction for two American museums early in their history: The Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.  Early Life and Education  Bacigalupi was born in New York in 1960 and moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when he was nine years old. Bacigalupi studied at the University of Houston where he earned a bachelor's degree. He earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. in art history from the University of Texas, Austin.  Career  Bacigalupi was the Brown Curator of Contemporary Art at the San Antonio Museum of Art from 1993 to 1995. He was director and chief curator of the Blaffer Art Museum at the University of Houston from 1995 to 1998. While at Blaffer, he curated the exhibition Michael Ray Charles, 1989‚Äì1997: An American Artist's Work. From 1999 to 2003, Bacigalupi served as executive director of the San Diego Museum of Art. Dan Stephen, president of the museum's board, described Bacigalupi's tenure as \\"We wanted someone with fire in his belly, and we got someone like that‚Äîsomeone who could do some fence mending, someone who could help us take our place in the community of museums and as an educational resource.\\" During Bacigalupi's tenure, exhibitions at the museum included High Societies, Axis Mexico, Idol of the Moderns: Pierre-Auguste Renoir and American Painting, and Power & Desire: South Asian Paintings from the Edwin Binney 3rd Collection. From 2003 to 2009, Bacigalupi served as director of the Toledo Museum of Art. During his tenure, Bacigalupi acquired numerous works for the collection including The Party by Marisol Escobar, Executive by Duane Hanson, and Chandelier Campiello del Remer #2 by Dale Chihuly. He also spearheaded the development of the Glass Pavilion that opened in 2006. Georgia Welles, a committee member at the museum, said of Mr. Bacigalupi \\"I was always delighted with his enthusiasm when he found wonderful objects to present to us. I would say we had a very successful time under Don's tenure and everyone wishes him well with his new job.\\" Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art In August 2009, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art named Bacigalupi as director, two years prior to its opening in November 2011. John Wilmerding said of the appointment, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an opportunity for it [the museum] to be perceived not as a curiosity in the hinterlands, but as a major American art museum.‚Äù At the time of his appointment, Virginia Germann, director of museum relations at Crystal Bridges, said Bacigalupi \\"has several skills that will enable him to oversee completion of a new, unusual building, to build a team, and interact with both the Bentonville community and his peers around the world. While at Crystal Springs. Bacigalupi curated the exhiibition State of the Art: Discovering American Art Now, which presented work by around 100 contemporary American artists. When Bacigalupi left Crystal Bridges, founder and board chair Alice Walton said of him \\"‚ÄúDon‚Äôs achievements at Crystal Bridges have been numerous, and many of our successes are attributable to his guidance leading up to the opening of the museum and continuing into our highly successful next three years. He came on board when the museum was in its early stages, guiding our direction through the building phase and helping to shape the development and exhibition of our art collection.\\" Shuffleton's Barbershop by Norman Rockwell In November, 2014, Bacigalupi was named founding president of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art. Worth magazine wrote \\"Don Bacigalupi is arguably America‚Äôs most innovative museum director, and he‚Äôs become a trusted partner to some of the nation‚Äôs wealthiest individuals when they want to create public art institutions.\\" Worth described Bacigalupi as \\"a carefully-dressed academic who naturally speaks in paragraphs, [and] has become adept at working with exacting collectors and benefactors.\\" In 2018, during Bacigalupi's tenure, the museum acquired Shuffleton‚Äôs Barbershop by Norman Rockwell. Bacigaluci said of the acquisition \\"This will be one of the anchor works of our museum, which we‚Äôre delighted to share with the public.\\" In February 2019, the museum announced that Bacigalupi would step down as president, continuing in the role of special adviser. George Lucas said of Bacigalupi \\"Don was essential in helping to formalize our vision and in laying the important groundwork that has brought us to this point. We would not have been able to break ground in Los Angeles without him.\\"  Personal Life  As of July 2020, Bacigalupi lives with his husband graphic artist Dan Feder and their teenage son in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.

She is part of BBC's list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2018.  Life  As a child Viji worked as a volunteer at the National Women's Conference held in 1992 in Kozhikode, where she found her political inspiration and direction in feminism. At the age of 16, Viji started her first job in a tailor's shop. At the time, as part of the motivation towards her future movements, whilst most of the family members in the home worked for money for the family, her father worked and spent money for parties and social events. In the early 2000s, she organized meetings where women would compare salaries and working conditions at the biggest commercial area in Kozhikode, Mittayitheru. At the time some were not allowed to drink water during summers, and others not able to go to the bathroom. Even if there were no customers in the store, women would be paid less if they were caught sitting down on the security cameras. It was after seeing this injustice, Viji created Penkoottu, a women's group named after the local word for 'a crowd of/ a friendship between women' or more commonly, 'women for each other', that spread through several districts in Kerala. They were able to successfully fight for further rights like the right to sit for saleswomen. After a law was passed winning several rights for working women on July 4, 2018, Viji still fights for many rights that have yet to be won. She currently is the leader for the women-centric labour organization Asanghaditha Mekhala Thozhilali Union (AMTU), formed in 2014, translating to ‚ÄòUnion of Workers in the Unorganized Sector‚Äô. This was created to aid in the lack of adequate space for women, and their issues, in traditional trade unions. There have been disagreements from other union organizations however that state there is a space, and more women need to come forward. Viji also pushes for the use of the word 'worker' over 'staff, due to the higher associated strength in the word.

The type and only species is Tralkasaurus cuyi, named in 2020 by Mauricio Cerroni and colleagues based on an incomplete skeleton. A medium-sized abelisaurid, Tralkasaurus exhibits a conflicting blend of characteristics found among the early-diverging abelisauroids with others that characterize the highly specialized clade Brachyrostra, and thus its position within the clade is poorly-resolved. Discovery and naming The Violante Farm fossil site in R√≠o Negro Province, Argentina, near the village of El Cuy, was discovered in 1999 by Sebasti√°n Apestegu√≠a on the north shore of the Ezequiel Ramos Mex√≠a Reservoir. In a 2018 conference abstract, Mat√≠as Motta and colleagues reported new fossil discoveries, including a diverse fauna of dinosaurs, made at the Violante Farm site. The strata exposed are yellowish and greenish sandstones that are occasionally tuffaceous (i.e. bearing volcanic ash), which belong to the Cenomanian-Turonian Huincul Formation. The specimens discovered included an incomplete skeleton of an abelisaurid, catalogued as MPCA-Pv 815, which comprises a ; , , and vertebrae; ; and a badly-preserved . Motta and colleagues recognized that this abelisaurid, along with a coelurosaur and carcharodontosaurid, present distinct traits (autapomorphies) from other Huincul Formation theropods. The abelisaurid was formally named in 2020 by Mauricio Cerroni and colleagues as Tralkasaurus cuyi; the generic name is formed from \\"tralka\\", the Mapudungun word for \\"thunder\\", and the suffix -saurus, meaning lizard, while the specific name refers to the village of El Cuy. Description Tralkasaurus was described by Cerroni and colleagues as a \\"medium-sized abelisaurid\\" based on the available material. Its maxilla has a length of , smaller than that of the similarly \\"medium-sized\\" Skorpiovenator (at , with the whole animal measuring long). It is most comparable to the smallest-known abelisaurid, MMCh-PV 69, from the Candeleros Formation, with Tralkasaurus pubis measuring long and MMCh-PV 69's pubis measuring long. The maxilla of Tralkasaurus is a subtriangular bone covered in neurovascular (pits formed by innervation) and rugosities (roughened areas). It encloses the from the front; Tralkasaurus is unique among abelisaurids in that front margin of the antorbital fenestra slopes forwards and upwards, instead of being vertical or sloping backwards. The antorbital fenestra creates on both the upward- projecting process of the maxilla and (atypically among abelisaurids) the inner surface of the bone; this condition is more similar to basal abelisauroids like Noasaurus and Masiakasaurus, as well as the Averostra. Deep neurovascular grooves extend downward from the bottom rim of the antorbital fenestra, which is unlike Carnotaurus, Ekrixinatosaurus, Majungasaurus, and Skorpiovenator but similar to Rugops. More typically, the ascending process tapers and becomes laminar (sheet-like) at the top, like Skorpiovenator, Carnotaurus, and Majungasaurus. The maxilla also bears eleven sockets with four preserved teeth, which are typical of abelisaurids. Like Majungasaurus but unlike Skorpiovenator, the on both edges of the teeth are the same size. Based on comparisons with Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus, the dorsal vertebrae of Tralkasaurus originated from the mid-to-rear back. The that extend out and upward are subtriangular like those of Dahalokely, Viavenator, Majungasaurus, and Masiakasaurus, but unlike the subrectangular processes of Carnotaurus. the that project out and downward are distinctive among abelisaurids in their unusual narrowness and shortness; even in abelisaurids like Majungasaurus and MCF-PVPH-237, where the parapophyses are relatively narrow, they are not as rod-like as in Tralkasaurus. A ridge between them, the , is also shallow and relatively low, unlike the strongly-developed ridges in Carnotaurus, Majungasaurus, and Ilokelesia. Another ridge, the posterior paradiapophyseal lamina, is robust and cross-cuts a fossa below the transverse process (the infradiapophyseal fossa), like Dahalokely. The large transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae, which originated from the front of the tail, are typically abelisaurid, projecting strongly out and upward like Carnotaurus, Skorpiovenator, Aucasaurus, and Viavenator, but are more inclined than Majungasaurus. Processes projecting forwards and backwards at their tips would have been overlapping between caudal vertebrae; this is a distinguishing characteristic of the Brachyrostra. Meanwhile, although the pubis is poorly preserved, the at its tip appears to have been expanded, like Rahiolisaurus but unlike Masiakasaurus or Carnotaurus. Classification Cerroni and colleagues conducted a phylogenetic analysis to determine the affinities of Tralkasaurus. They found that it possesses synapomorphies of the Abelisauridae: a maxilla with a deep body, low ascending process, and reduced maxillary fossa, covered by foramina and rugosities; fused lining the inside of the maxillary tooth row bearing strong vertical ridges; the subdivision of the infradiapophyseal fossae by the posterior paradiapophyseal laminae; a connection between the transverse processes and parapophyses by the dorsal paradiapophyseal laminae; large transverse processes strongly inclined upwards on the caudal vertebrae; and a thin pubic shaft. They also identified the forward-inclined front margin of the antorbital fenestra and its excavation of the body of the maxilla, the rod-like parapophyses, and the low paradiapophyseal laminae as autapomorphies of Tralkasaurus. Within the Abelisauridae, the position of Tralkasaurus was more poorly resolved. In particular, it exhibits a conflicting blend of characteristics: the projections on the caudal transverse processes are typical of the Brachyrostra, but the presence of extensive antorbital fossae on the maxilla is plesiomorphic (i.e. characteristic of basal abelisauroids, and unlike other abelisaurids). The phylogenetic analysis accordingly placed Tralkasaurus among basal abelisaurids, but was unable to resolve its affinities beyond a polytomy (collapsed tree). The resulting phylogenetic tree is partially reproduced below. Palaeoecology Numerous theropods are known from the Violante Farm fossil site, including Gualicho and Aoniraptor (which may or may not represent the same megaraptoran); the carcharodontosaurid Taurovenator; a coelurosaur (identified by Cerroni and colleagues as an unenlagiine) and another carcharodontosaurid that remain unnamed, but are likely distinct species; and another indeterminate megaraptoran. Other dinosaurs also include a titanosaurian sauropod and an ornithopod. Additional vertebrates from the Violante Farm site include the eilenodontid rhynchocephalian Patagosphenos; a crocodyliform, possibly belonging to the Neosuchia; a squamate; a chelid turtle; and a fish referred to Lepidotes.

The RCMP's primary mandate is to maintain \\"peace and order,\\" and Officers provide police services to all Canadian provinces, excluding Qu√©bec and Ontario, as well as to the three Canadian territories, and more than 180 municipalities and Indigenous communities. In recent years there has been growing criticism of the level of harassment occurring within the RCMP and how harassment complaints are handled internally. The Government of Canada has acknowledged that the RCMP has a \\"crises in governance, culture and public accountability\\" that needs to be addressed. In 2014, the RCMP responded to the multitude of reports published by taking into account some of the recommendations for improvement in their current RCMP internal harassment complaint policy outlined in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act. The RCMP is one of \\"Canada's most iconic national institutions\\" however, the current harassment policy has still been deemed insufficient.  Harassment in the workplace  The Canadian Human Rights Commission defines harassment as \\"a form of discrimination. It includes any unwanted physical or verbal behaviour that offends or humiliates you. Generally, harassment is a behaviour that persists over time. Serious one-time incidents can also sometimes be considered harassment.\\" The Treasury Board Policy on Harassment Prevention and Resolution expands on this definition, defining harassment as: \\"Improper conduct by an individual, that is directed at and offensive to another individual in the workplace, including at any event or any location related to work, and that the individual knew or ought reasonably to have known would cause offence or harm. It comprises any objectionable act(s), comment(s) or display(s) that demean, belittle, or cause personal humiliation or embarrassment, and any act of intimidation or threat.\\" Using data from the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS) on Canadians at Work and Home, Statistics Canada finds that 19% of women and 13% of men experienced harassment in the workplace in the past year of at least one type (verbal abuse, humiliating behaviour, threats, physical violence, and unwanted sexual attention or sexual harassment), with verbal abuse being most commonly experienced. For every type reported, the proportion of women reporting was larger than the proportion of men. The 2014 Workplace Bullying Institute (WBI) U.S. Workplace Bullying Survey found that 61% of people who are bullied at work lose their job, and 74% lose their particular job (i.e. 13% of those bullied move to a different job or location but remain with the same employer). WBI also found that only 15% of perpetrators lost their job.Namie, G. 2014. WBI 2014 U.S. Workplace Bullying Survey. Workplace Bullying Institute (WBI).

Depression in the workplace: An economic cost analysis of depression- related productivity loss attributable to job strain and bullying. Work & Stress, 27(4), 321-338.  Civilian Review and Complaints Commission (CRCC)  Created in 1988, the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission (originally known as the Commission for Public Complaints against the RCMP) is an independent, impartial body that receives complaints from the public and reviews the handling of complaints when the complainant is dissatisfied with the RCMP's review process. On average, the CRCC receives approximately 2,000 public complaints per year. The Commission helps to uphold various laws and legislations including: *Enhancing Royal Canadian Mounted Police Accountability Act *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act *Witness Protection Program Act  Public recognition of harassment within the RCMP  In June 2001, the Treasury Board amended its Policy on the Prevention and Resolution of Harassment in the Workplace. In a statement by Odette Lalumi√®re, Senior Counsel for the Canadian Judicial Counsel, spoke specifically to the RCMP's handling of internal harassment policy complaints, stating that their policy must comply with Treasury Board policy. Lalumi√®re continues to say that ‚Äúthe Committee recently reminded the Force of this obligation in case G-251‚Äù in January‚ÄìMarch 2001.  Task Force on Governance and Cultural Change in the RCMP: The \\"Brown Report\\"  In 2007, the Government of Canada established a Task Force to address the \\"crises in governance, culture and public accountability\\" within the RCMP.Task Force on Governance and Cultural Change in the RCMP, Rebuilding the Trust (Ottawa: Government of Canada, 2007), p. 41, Retrieved from: <https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/cntrng-crm/tsk-frc-rcmp- grc/_fl/archive-tsk-frc-rpt-eng.pdf>. The report, presented to the Minister of Public Safety and the President of the Treasury Board, investigated these concerns including: human resource capacity; training for current and future persons in positions of authority; processing of complaints on all matters, and the \\"culture of policing\\" which they identify \\"one of fear and intimidation\\" by persons in positions of authority. The report makes 49 recommendations for structural change.  Public Interest Investigation Report Into Issues of Workplace Harassment within the RCMP  In November 2011, Ian McPhail, the former Interim Chair of the Commission for Public Complaints against the RCMP (now known as Civilian Review and Complaints Commission) made an official complaint and declared the initiation of a public interest investigation regarding the process in which allegations of harassment within RCMP workplaces are handled. The Commission stated it will examine: * Whether those RCMP members notified of allegations of harassment adhered to the appropriate legislation, policies, procedures and guidelines in respect of workplace harassment; * Whether RCMP members conducting investigations into allegations of workplace harassment did so in a thorough and impartial manner; and * Whether existing RCMP policies, procedures and guidelines are adequate to ensure that allegations regarding RCMP members engaged in workplace harassment are dealt with fairly, effectively and thoroughly. In February 2013, the Report, Public Interest Investigation Report Into Issues of Workplace Harassment within the RCMP, was published. The Report examined 718 workplace harassment complaints against the RCMP from 2005‚Äì2001. The key findings from the report reveal that 90% of complaints could ‚Äúreadily be classified‚Äù as abuse of authority (e.g. bullying, psychological abuse, and belittling and demeaning behaviour), and that 386 (56%) were repeated incidents of ‚Äúperceived harassment.‚Äù Additionally, 4% of all complaints reported sexual harassment.  Civilian Review and Complaints Commission Recommendations  Based on the findings of the Report, the Commission made eleven recommendations in total, which address five areas that require improvement: * Independence of the process * The definition of harassment * Required standards for harassment investigations * Training and prevention * Evaluation {   colspan=\\"2\\" Commission's Recommendations - Recommendation No. 1 That the RCMP implement a systematically compiled and nationally comparable system of data collection and reporting in respect of workplace conflict. - Recommendation No. 2 That the RCMP institute centralized monitoring and coordination of the harassment complaint process, located at RCMP headquarters and reported directly to a senior executive outside the divisional chains of command. - Recommendation No. 3 That the centralized coordination function also be responsible for receiving complaints of retaliation, the procedure for which should be clearly delineated in the applicable policy. - Recommendation No. 4 That an external mechanism for review of harassment decisions be implemented. - Recommendation No. 5 That the RCMP's policy regarding fostering a respectful workplace be defined as equally applicable to precursors of harassment, such as workplace conflict, in order that its dispute resolution mechanisms may be accessed at an early stage. - Recommendation No. 6 That harassment investigators receive mandatory specialized training in respect of conducting investigations into workplace conflict and/or harassment prior to being tasked with such investigations. - Recommendation No. 7 That the RCMP develop clearly defined investigative standards specifically in respect of investigations into harassment and workplace conflict. - Recommendation No. 8 That the RCMP implement timelines for the treatment of harassment complaints, including for efforts at early resolution. - Recommendation No. 9 That all supervisors and managers, upon appointment, be required to complete a relevant training program addressing workplace conflict and harassment within a set time of assuming their responsibilities. - Recommendation No.10 That the online training module, which should address workplace conflict, including harassment, be delivered on a regular basis. - Recommendation No.11 That the RCMP develop a comprehensive method of evaluation to ensure that changes are producing the desired effects, and that the results of such evaluation be regularly and publicly reported. }  Current RCMP harassment policy  An overview of the internal RCMP harassment complaint process, as of January 1, 2019. In reaction to the CRCC's 2013 Report, the RCMP reformed its Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act in 2014, and introduced new disciplinary processes for those who do not act in accordance with the Code of Conduct. The policies have been described as \\"zero tolerance,\\" however there remain many critiques by the CRCC, specifically that these specific policies make it even more difficult to report and results in too many complaints being deemed \\"unfounded.\\"  Internal process for addressing complaints  Since 2014, the internal process for addressing complaints of harassment within the RCMP follows a review system as follows: (a) If an allegation of harassment is made and there is an early resolution (e.g. through mediation), this is the end of the process. (b) If a written complaint is made, it is referred to a Human Resources Officer who decides if there is sufficient evidence to warrant a final decision or if there needs to be a further investigation. The Human Resources Officer makes recommendations to the Responsible Officer (the Responsible Officer is typically a police officer from the same Division as the complainantsFraser, S. 2017. Review of four cases of civil litigation against the RCMP on Workplace Harassment: Report to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness ‚Äì March 2017.) who makes the ultimate final decision regarding the complaint. (c) If the Human Resources Officer recommends a criminal investigation, they will inform the Responsible Officer who will initiate a Code of Conduct investigation pursuant to Part IV of the RCMP Act.  Lawsuits & settlements  In 2015, four RCMP officers (Alice Fox, Catherine Galliford, Susan Gastaldo and Atoya Montague) who were in the midst of civil lawsuits against the RCMP for alleged harassment wrote to the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Liberal Members of Parliament and Senators. The letter asked these figures for support in ensuring the women were not discharged from the RCMP before their civil legal proceedings were concluded.Government of Canada. 2018.

B.C. women suing RCMP ask Justin Trudeau for help. CBC News. Retrieved December 3, 2019. The letter spurred the Review of four cases of civil litigation against the RCMP on Workplace Harassment, also known as the Fraser Report so named after the primary author of the Report, Sheila Fraser. The Report, written to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (Honourable Ralph Goodale, P.C., M.P.), found that the process of civil litigation regarding alleged workplace harassment in the RCMP places unfair burden on the complainant, particularly in financial and emotional costs. Fraser reports that these costs are \\"an indication of the failure of the RCMP to effectively deal with their cases.\\"  Female policing RCMP class action  These four cases resulted in a significant win for current and former female RCMP employees who had experienced harassment within the workplace.Clancy, N. October 7, 2016. \\"RCMP apology, $100 million compensation fund comes without harassers held accountable\\" CBC News. On October 6, 2016, the then RCMP Commissioner, Bob Paulson, officially apologized and offer $100 million in compensation for harassment and sexual abuse against female officers and employees in the RCMP, affecting more than 3,100 officers who claimed these offences occurred on the job.  Female non-policing RCMP class action  In 2019, a class action lawsuit was formed on the grounds of alleged gender and sexual orientation-based discrimination and harassment within the RCMP. While the RCMP has not admitted liability, they have settled with compensation of $10,000 - $220,000 for public-identified females who experienced harassment (including sexual harassment, physical assault, bullying based on gender or sexual orientation, sexual assault, and intimidation or abuse based on gender or sexual orientation) from September 16, 1974 (the first year women were welcomed into the RCMP) to July 5, 2019 by RCMP personnel. This is the second $100 million settlement in 3 years. Eligible class members include publicly- identified females that ‚Äúworked or volunteer in an RCMP controlled workplace supervised or managed by the RCMP‚Äù including but not limited to: public service employees, commissionaires, volunteers, contractors, and municipal or regional district employees.

Water is drawn from behind a dam above the Wairere Falls, which diverts the water through two penstocks to the Wairere Power Station, before being discharged back into the Mokau River. The station was commissioned in 1925 with the first generating unit. Three more generating units were added between 1938 and 1981 before a major refurbishment resulted in three of the units being replaced by a single generating unit in 2013-2014. History Development After being hired in 1903 by the Public Works Minister William Hall-Jones to investigate the hydro-electric potential of New Zealand, American electrical engineer L. M. Hancock identified 41 locations in 1904. Wairere Falls was ranked number 27. Lawrence Birks had become the chief electrical engineer of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 1919 was familiar with the falls and was able to convince a number of residents of Aria and Piopio that the Mokau River and Wairere Falls should be developed. As a result, in November 1919 a group of citizens in Aria and Piopio formed a committee to undertake the work. They engaged experienced engineer Henry \\"Harry\\" Richmond Climie (1884-1961) of consulting engineers H.W. Clime & Son to undertake an investigation which he reported on at two meetings that were held recently at Piopio and Aria respectively. Climie estimated that a turbine capacity of 125 hp would be ample to supply present requirements within a radius of the proposed power station and that double this amount would meet the demand for many years, provided no large industry such as a freezing or lime works required a supply. He estimated that the location had a potential total capacity of 1,500 hp As work progressed the committee were invited by an offer in August 1922 to amalgamate their efforts with the new created Te Kuiti provisional power board. Wishing to maintain their independence and aware that they were remote from Te Kuiti they decided to continue on their own. Despite the withdraw of some of the potential customers who had initially expressed their support the Wairere Electric Power Board was established in January 1923. The new board's first official meeting was in Piopio in May 1923, which Harry Climie attended. He was subsequently engaged to design the power station and the associated distribution system. Climie submitted his design within several weeks. Following acceptance, the board began the process of obtaining the required water, power and distribution licences, as well as polling the ratepayers in their area to raise a loan to pay for the works. Climie had estimated that the construction of the power station and associated distribution network would cost ‚Ç§38,500 plus an additional amount to pay for the first three years of operation until sufficient customers could be connected. Unfortunately no one was prepared to provide the money. With the assistance of their local MP the board was able to obtain enough funds to commence construction of the power station. It was several more months before a loan for the full amount was able to be obtained. Construction Construction of the power station was undertaken by a workforce under the control of the board‚Äôs engineer, F. Harvey. Commissioning The power station commenced commercial generation in December 1925, with 80 customers receiving a supply in Aria and Piopio and surrounding districts by January 1926. The new power station was officially opened on 27 May 1926 by Prime Minister Gordon Coates with a single generating unit (G1) which had a Boving & Co horizontal Francis turbine driving a ASEA generator which gave an original installed capacity of 480 kW, which was generated at 6.6 kV. The generating unit was supplied with water via a concrete and steel diameter, long penstock with a capacity of up to 3.1 cumecs. By 1936 the Wairere Power Board had an annual revenue of ¬£5,000, with the power station supplying about 350 consumers via approximately 120 miles of transmission line. On 9 January 1936 while in the process of assisting in installing a new and more efficient stator on the generating unit Francis Rosengrave Harvey, an engineer employed by the Wairere Power Board was electrocuted and killed at the power station when a ruler with which he was taking measurements, came into contact with live equipment. Installation of G3 In September 1937 the board gave approval for its consulting engineer Lloyd Mandeno to purchase a second machine. In 1938 the powerhouse was extended which allowed an additional 240 kW machine (G2) with a Boving & Co horizontal Francis turbine driving a ASEA generator to be installed which increased the total installed capacity to 624 kW. This generating unit was supplied via a dual end concrete diameter, long penstock with a capacity of up to 7.1 cumecs to G2. Eels were initially a problem at the power station, which was solved in 1939 by suspending an electrified rod in the surge chamber. Following a period of dry weather which reduced the station's output and faced with increasing demand the board installed a second hand 200 kW diesel generator at the power station to supplement the station's output. The commissioning of the second generating unit (G2) allowed essential loads to be supplied while G1 to be taken out of service and overhauled after having been in practically continuous operation since its installation. Taken out of service on the evening of 20 June 1939, G1 was dismantled overnight, transported up the hill from the power-house, from where all parts requiring repair were transported to Hamilton, where for the next two days it was refurbished and by the midnight on the following Tuesday last the machinery was returned to the power station and returned to service in time to carry the evening load on Thursday. While this repair was being carried out opportunity was taken install a new and more efficient stainless-steel runner, a rubber- lined submerged bearing was installed in place of the old oil circulation bearing, and improvements made to the lubrication system. These improvements lead to a 12 per cent, increase in output. To impound more water a weir was built across the head of the falls and flashboards installed to raise the river level. The tailrace was deepened in order to utilise all of the available head, while the riverbed downstream from the power station was blasted to remove the rock bars which have impeded the flow of the stream below the station. Associated with the expansion of the power station the capacity of the transmission line which conveyed power from the power station to Piopio was doubled to cope with the heavy increase in consumption in this part of the Board's district. Following the death of the power station's operator in October 1942 the offer of his widow Isobel Gibbs to undertake his duties as a contribution to the war effort was accepted at a salary of ‚Ç§4 10 shillings, which was 25% less than her late husbands. She worked seven days a week from 6 am to 10 pm. Following the end of the Second World War the board hired Lloyd Mandeno to about improving the power station and its connection to the system. He recommended that the board build a tie-line to connect the power station's output to the State Hydro-Electric Department's (SHD) system which would allow the board to supply its customers when the station was unable to supply all of its load as well as allowing them during periods of low load to sell any surplus generation from Wairere to the SHD. A condition of the connection to the SHD system was that the power station had to be manned 24 hours a day, which led to a second operator joining Mrs Gibbs at the power station. Upon her resignation in 1952 the board paid her a gift of ‚Ç§20. Installation of G3 In August 1952 a major upgrade of the power station was completed which included the installation of an additional generating unit (G3) which had a horizontal Francis turbine driving a 825 kW Lancashire Dynamo & Crypto generator. Following discussions that had been going on intermittently since the early 1930s the Wairere Electric Power Board merged with the Waitomo Electric Power Board in 1978 and took its name. Installation of G4 Between 1978 and 1981 the Wairere Power Station was upgraded at a cost of NZ$2 million and a new machine (G4) was added in 1981 which improved efficiency and maximized the use of the river flow. In response to the introduction of the Energy Companies Act in 1992, the Waitomo Electric Power Board changed its financial structure to become Waitomo Energy Services Ltd. In 1998 the New Zealand Government passed the Electricity Industry Reform Act which was intended to change the structure of the electricity industry to encourage competition. This Act required the operational separation of lines and generation business activities by 1 July 1999 and separation of the ownership by 1 January 2004. To lead after a period of consultation to King Country Energy on 1 April 1999 purchasing the generation and retail assets of Waitomo Energy Services while the later company purchased the network assets of King Country Energy and changed its name to \\"The Lines Company\\". As a result in 1999 Wairere became owned by King Country Energy. In 2005 upstream and downstream fish passages were commissioned with a monitoring programme which includes maintaining video footage. During the summer period of 2009 it was estimated that 1000 eels migrated downstream through the fish passage while approximately of juvenile eels (elvers) had moved upstream. Installation of a tipping gate which would minimize upstream impacts in low to medium flood events was completed in 2006. In 2009 G4 was overhauled and fitted with replacement runner blades. Installation of G5 In 2010 the company reviewed the operation of Wairere and identified the option of either overhauling the three old units or install a single new one. At the time the station was generating a combined mean output of 18 GWh a year. The company opted for the latter and in December 2013 decommissioned units 1, 2 and 3 and replaced them with a single new generating unit, G5. The commissioning of the new generating unit in June 2014, lead to a five per cent improvement in efficiency compared to what the older three units produced altogether. As well as the installation of a new penstock, draft tube, main inlet valve, turbine, and generator, two of the existing turbines and associated draft tubes were removed. At the same time the powerhouse was seismically strengthened and the existing tailrace lowered by . In 2015 Trustpower became a majority shareholder of King Country Energy, which lead in 2017 to Trustpower taking over operation of all of KCE‚Äôs power stations following the signing of an operation and maintenance contract with KCE. Design Water is impounded by a high concrete dam with a spillway flap gate, that can discharge up to 110 cumecs in normal conditions and up to 320 cumecs in a flood. There are two sets of intakes both fitted with an automatic screen cleaner and hydraulic gate. The original intake which supplied G1 is now decommissioned. From each intake a single penstock transports the water to respectively the powerhouse, which was built in the late 1980s to house machine G4 and to a second powerhouse containing machine G5 which was commissioned in 2014. The penstock that supplies G4 has a capacity of 17.55 cumecs, is of concrete construction, has a diameter of and is in length. Generating unit G4 which was installed in 1989 consists of a Kaplan turbine driving a Parsons Peebles 3 MW generator. Generating unit G5 which was installed in 2014 consists of a Turab 1.12 m dia horizontal Francis turbine driving a 1.2 MW generator. The power station is embedded within The Lines Company network behind Transpower's Hangitaki Substation, but can also be switched within The Lines Company network to support Transpower's Whakamaru substation on a limited supply basis. Operation Operation of the power station is covered by the requirements of three resource consents which expire in December 2032.

According to Jewish law, a ben pekuah may later be slaughtered for consumption without adhering to shechita.  Status under Jewish law  According to the Torah, all ruminants that have split hooves are permitted to be eaten. They must, however, be slaughtered in a manner prescribed by Jewish law, and certain parts of these animals, including certain fats and gid hanasheh (the sciatic nerve), may not be consumed. Anything that is inside an animal at the point of slaughter is considered an organ of the animal. Therefore, if a mother was pregnant when slaughtered and a live offspring is removed, the offspring is considered a part of the mother. If the mother was slaughtered in adherence to shechita, then the offspring, a ben pekuah, is deemed already to have undergone ritual slaughter, and may therefore be theoretically slaughtered for human consumption without adhering to shechita. According to rabbinic law, if the animal is killed immediately there is no need to perform shechita however, if the animal has started to walk it must be killed with shechita, but the animal's meat remains kosher even if the slaughter fails to conform fully to the regular requirements. The offspring has the same status as the mother, so if the mother was found to be glatt kosher (smooth lungs with no lesions), the offspring is considered glatt even if its lungs are not smooth. The parts of an animal that are normally not permitted to be eaten, such as the gid hanasheh and the chelev fats, are permitted when they belong to a ben pekuah, although its blood is still forbidden. When a ben pekuah mates with another ben pekuah, their offspring is deemed a ben pekuah. However, when a ben pekuah mates with a regular animal, consumption of their offspring is forbidden altogether.  Modern innovations  A company in Victoria, Australia, has attempted to build a herd of ben pekuah animals in order to reduce the cost of kosher meat. This effort met with considerable controversy and has yet to gain widespread rabbinic acceptance.

They had also gone out early in both the FAI Cup and the League of Ireland Cup. Manager Dermot Keely was entering his first full season in charge, having replaced Turlough O'Connor early the previous season. It was Dundalk's 69th consecutive season in the top tier of Irish football. Season summary In pre-season, veteran Gino Lawless was awarded a testimonial, and Manchester United were the visitors. In front of a packed Oriel Park, Dundalk took a 2‚Äì0 lead, and Eddie van Boxtel saved an Eric Cantona penalty, before United ran out 4‚Äì2 winners. Manager Dermot Keely, a Jim McLaughlin protege who had won the Double in 1978‚Äì79 as a player at Oriel, had to rebuild the squad due to its age profile, despite a worsening financial position. Early in the new season, however, the financial issues came to a head, and a number of local businessmen formed a new Interim Company to take the club over, saving it from bankruptcy. Dundalk had started the season poorly, but a steady improvement in results saw them climb the league table. They reached finals in both the League Cup, (losing 2‚Äì1 on aggregate), and the Leinster Senior Cup (losing 2‚Äì1), and in the FAI Cup they were defeated in the quarter-final. With seven games to go in the League as many as eight clubs were in contention, but Dundalk were the most consistent, and Keely steered his team to a ninth league title on a final day of drama. They defeated Galway United at home, then, with players and supporters waiting on the pitch to hear the results of Shelbourne's and Derry City's matches, news filtered through that both had failed to win, confirming Dundalk as Champions - their third title in eight seasons. The trophy presented was that won in 1991, as the new trophy lay unopened in Athlone, where Derry City had been favourites to win out on the day. Notably, despite winning the title, nobody at Dundalk won a monthly or end of season award.

The Millennium of the Polish State (, literally A Thousand Years of the Polish State) was a national celebration of the Christianization of Poland and the subsequent establishment of the first Polish nation. The celebrations took place over the years 1960‚Äì1966 by a resolution of the Sejm in 1958. The inauguration of the jubilee celebrations took place at the plenary session of the National Committee of the Unity Front on 16 February 1960 in Kalisz. The jubilee celebrations were accompanied by the educational program One thousand schools for the 1000th anniversary during which in the years 1959‚Äì1972 nearly 1.5 thousand schools were built. It was decided to use the anniversary by both the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and the Polish United Workers' Party) for the propaganda in Poland. The church planned the celebration of the millennium of the baptism of Poland while the state authorities strictly commemorated the jubilee of the beginnings of the Polish nation. Varying interpretations of the anniversary A contemporary mural in Gniezno commemorating the baptism of Poland. The anniversary was interpreted in various ways depending on context. While most of the diaspora and the religious Catholic community celebrated the introduction of Christianity in Poland, the Communist-led government of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZWP), which pursued a state policy of atheism, sought to undermine the international celebrations be re-conveying the anniversary as an anniversary of the birth of the Polish nation. In doing so, the PZWP framed the celebrations as a secular and political anniversary instead of a religious one. This specifically caused friction between the PRL and the Vatican, which resulted in the twice denyal of Pope Paul VI to visit Poland in 1966. As British-Polish historian Norman Davies noted, the Church and the PZWP had \\"rival, and mutually exclusive, interpretations of [Poland's baptism] significance.\\" Commemorations Commemorative Coins Commemorative coins were issued in connection with the celebrations. Their designs were prepared for a competition announced by the National Bank of Poland in 1957. As a result of the decision, it was decided the following year that the 10 z≈Çotych note designed by J√≥zef Gos≈Çawski with the image of Mieszko I and Princess Doubravka as a 100-z≈Çotych silver commemorative coin.

The twenty- eighth named storm and sixteenth typhoon of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, Kammuri developed from a tropical wave situated a couple hundred miles south of the Mariana Islands. From November 25 up until November 27, the system tracked westward at a steady pace and rate of intensification, first making minor impacts in Guam. On November 28, the system intensified into a typhoon as environmental conditions became marginally conducive for significant development. From November 29 up until late December 1, Kammuri was unable to strengthen to previous estimates due to its near stationary movement as a result of weak steering currents, upwelling itself consequently. On December 2, the system tracked westward at a much faster speed of 12 mph (19 km/h) and rapidly intensified over warm Philippine Sea waters, before making landfall in the Bicol Region of the Philippines at peak intensity as a category 4-equivalent typhoon. Upon leaving the Philippines, Kammuri significantly weakened as wind shear increased and interaction with the Philippine islands caused the structure of the system to degrade rapidly, and throughout December 3, it stayed as a category 1-equivalent typhoon, with its outer rainbands barely on land. By December 4, Kammuri drifted over the South China Sea as a weakening tropical storm. Through December 5 and December 6, Kammuri weakened significantly and its low-level circulation center became exposed; as a result, it dissipated on December 6.  Meteorological history  On November 23, 2019, a low pressure system developed to the southeast of Guam. It then began to show signs of development and earned a defined circulation, developing into a tropical depression on November 25, with the JTWC assigning it as 29W. The depression then began to develop banding features to the northeast of its center, confirming intensification and allowing it to earn the name Kammuri (which is a Japanese name for Corona Borealis). Kammuri then passed south of Guam, and further intensified into a severe tropical storm on November 27, and then into a typhoon the next day. As the weak typhoon continued west, upwelling of itself due to its quasi-stationary movement combined with moderate wind shear hindered significant intensification of Kammuri over the next three days. It eventually entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) with PAGASA assigning the name Tisoy on November 30. After entering the PAGASA's area of responsibility, Kammuri began to show signs of intensification again, and PAGASA noted the possibility of Kammuri making landfall in the Philippines as a somewhat powerful typhoon. After very slowly moving west and on approach to the Philippines, the system began to accelerate towards the Philippines and then began to rapidly intensify by the time it came within 200 miles of the coast of Catanduanes, due to the lowering of wind shear and increasing ocean heat content; all of which combined to counteract the upwelling. It became a category 2 typhoon and soon after, a category 3 typhoon. Kammuri reached its peak intensity as a 140mph category 4-equivalent typhoon on 07:00 UTC on December 2, and PAGASA reported that Kammuri had made its first landfall over Gubat, Sorsogon at 11:00 pm, 2 December, very shortly after reaching its peak intensity. Typhoon Kammuri crossing through the Philippines during the morning of December 3. Through midnight and early morning of December 3, Kammuri crossed the Bicol Region and weakened due to land interaction. It made another landfall at 4:00 am PST over San Pascual town in Burias Island. Moving in a generally westward direction, Kammuri weakened into a Category 3 after land interaction and developed a new eye, moving very close to the Bondoc Peninsula before making its third and fourth landfalls at 8:30 am PST over Torrijos, Marinduque and at 12:30 pm PST over Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, respectively. Continued land interaction weakened Kammuri to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon before it exited the Philippine landmass. The center of the typhoon was reported to be over the Mindoro Strait by late afternoon. Soon after, the system continued to weaken and became a Category 1-equivalent typhoon as it entered the South China Sea. Kammuri's structure then began to suffer, with wind shear tearing apart convection on the western portion of the storm as it weakened back into a tropical storm while drifting over the South China Sea. By 11:00 am PST, December 5, PAGASA issued its last bulletin on Kammuri as it exited the PAR. Kammuri lost its inner rainbands and its low-level circulation center became exposed to high wind shear, causing the system to dissipate on December 6 with the JMA issuing its final advisory on the system. Preparations At their 119th Climate Forum, PAGASA discussed the possible threat of Kammuri to the Philippines and the potential landfall of Kammuri in the Bicol Region during the 2019 Southeast Asian Games as a powerful typhoon. On November 28, PAGASA stated in a press conference that appropriate measures and linkaging with the 2019 SEA Games organizers have been in place in preparation for the typhoon, such as storm chasers and mobile radars dispatched to competition venues in Metro Manila and Central Luzon. SEA Games organizers also reported that a contingency plan has been set up in preparation for Kammuri. By the afternoon of November 30, the day of the opening of the SEA Games, the agency assigned Kammuri with the local name Tisoy as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and raised its first warnings over Eastern Samar and Northern Samar provinces. On November 30, local governments in Bicol Region started preparing in anticipation of Kammuri's arrival. Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals (TCWS) #1, 2 and 3 warnings were issued as the storm began to come close to Luzon on December 2. Throughout the same day, more warning signals were raised in some areas in the Visayas region. TCWS #1 was raised in the province of Antique and therefore, suspended classes in a total of 14 towns. Some of the suspensions were issued for all levels while others were only from pre-school to senior high. Local governments throughout Eastern Visayas declared suspension of classes in all levels along with work. Provinces such as Northern Samar, Samar, Eastern Samar and Biliran were raised to a TCWS #2 while Leyte and Southern Leyte only had a TCWS #2. In Cebu, TCWS #2 was also alerted which prompted 7,376 people to evacuate. Over 200,000 people were evacuated ahead of Kammuri due to fears of flooding and landslides. Flights and operations at Ninoy Aquino International Airport were suspended for twelve hours starting at 11:00 p.m. PST on December 3, 2019, and ending at 11:00 a.m. on December 4. 16 flights were canceled at Mactan‚ÄìCebu International Airport on December 2. A total of 358 domestic flights and 203 internation flights were cancelled due to Kammuri.  Impact and aftermath  Typhoon Kammuri weakening on December 3 In the 12th severe weather bulletin issued by PAGASA on December 2, 2019, reported that prior to its first landfall, the southern eyewall of Typhoon Kammuri brought violent winds and intense rainfall over the neighboring province of Northern Samar. Photos and video footage from the towns of Mapanas and Gamay, both located on Northern Samar's Pacific side, show severe flooding and high winds from the typhoon. Hours later, Kammuri made its first landfall near Gubat, Sorsogon with winds equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. In Northern Samar, winds were reported to reach as up to 135 km/h (84 mph) with a total accumulated rainfall of 605.5 mm (23.8 inches) within the course of 24 hours on December 2. The Bicol Region (Region V) was impacted the most by the typhoon. After the passage of the storm, roads between regions, especially routes from the Bicol Region towards Manila were not passable due to fallen branches and uproot trees. Several vehicles and passengers were stranded along highways due to this. On December 4, the provinces of Albay and Sorsogon, and the city of Naga were issued a state of calamity after widespread damages were seen. The region's Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) estimated that an estimated 130,000 children were affected by the storm. In Camarines Sur, about 293 classrooms suffered from major damages while the province of Albay had a total of 883 classrooms damaged as of December 5. By December 6, Catanduanes experienced heavy damages and therefore, a state of calamity was issued. On December 4, Northern Samar's Province Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) recommended a state of calamity, and shortly after, it was raised in two towns: Catarman and Gamay. Massive destruction along with widespread flooding, damaged houses, landslides and even weak communication signal prompted their local government to issue the state of calamity in the two towns. 224,171 individuals were affected by Kammuri (Tisoy) in Northern Samar, and based on post-disaster assessment, about 28,577 houses were damages while an additional 3,774 were washed out by extreme flooding. Power outages were seen in many villages, and the Northern Samar Electric Cooperative stated that power supply would be restored in Catarman and nearby towns by Christmas Day, but other towns could still suffer from no power until after Christmas. Moreover, Kammuri's rain bands extended to as far north as Cagayan Valley, where, with the inclusion of the northeastern monsoon, saw one of the worst flooding in decades for the northern region. Roughly 66,000 people have evacuated their homes due to extreme flooding and torrential flooding. On December 6, state of calamity was raised. Severe flooding in 18 areas in the province damaged agriculture and paralyzed transportation. As of January 22, 2020, the NDRRMC stated that at least 17 people were dead and at least 318 were injured. There has been an estimated damages of ‚Ç±6.65 billion (US$130 million) across the nation and about ‚Ç±95.7 million (US$1.87 million) to relief efforts and assistance. Totals of 2,249 damaged schools and 558,844 damaged houses, of which 63,466 were \\"totally\\" damaged, were reported. 121 road sections and 5 bridges were damaged due to Kammuri, of which six road sections and one bridge were still considered impassable a week after landfall.  Sporting tournaments The 2019 Southeast Asian Games, held in the Philippines this year, had several matches and events either cancelled or rescheduled due to Kammuri. Ramon Agregado, the organising committee's head of the Subic cluster of venues, stated, \\"The windsurfing has been cancelled until we have a more accurate picture of the weather.\\" Duathlon events that were scheduled for Tuesday, December 3, took place on Monday, December 2. Occidental Mindoro also withdrew as hosts of the 2020 Palarong Pambansa, the national students sports competition of the Philippines, due to damage caused by Kammuri in the province.  Retirement  Due to the extensive damage brought about by the typhoon in the Philippines, PAGASA officially retired Tisoy from the rotating lists of tropical cyclone names within the Philippine Area of Responsibility. The agency selected Tamaraw as its replacement.http://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/learning-tools/philippine- tropical-cyclone-names The name Kammuri was also retired during the 52nd annual session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in February 2020, and a replacement name will be chosen in early 2021.

The specific epithet (sparsa) is from the Latin sparsus meaning \\"scattered\\". In Alan Fairley's book \\"Seldom Seen -Rare Plants of Greater Sydney\\" he states \\"When Brown made the first collection, it had finished flowering, so he got the wrong impression. In fact, plants often bear many flowers\\". Distribution and habitat This species has a restricted distribution only known from four populations, Faulconbridge, Grose River area, north of Richmond and Avoca Vale Reserve. It is found growing in shady, rocky, wet situations in nutrient poor clay or sandy soils. It tolerates periods of high rainfall.

Activism She is the co-founder (together with Kazimiera Szczuka and Agnieszka Graff) of the 8th March Women‚Äôs Coalition which organizes the Manifa, an annual demonstration taking place in various Polish cities on International Women's Day. In the years 2001‚Äì2006 she co-founded the feminist hip-hop group Duldung. She is deeply engaged in the struggle to restore women's right to legal abortion in Poland. She caused an uproar when she declared that she was pregnant and intended to get an abortion on Christmas Eve. She is a co-founder and president of the Polish pro-choice association Same o Sobie S.O.S. in 2006 and the initiator of the \\"Abortion coming out\\" campaign, in which women confessed to having an abortion. She sat on the Supervisory Board of the MaMa Foundation. With Kazimiera Szczuka, she issued the Du≈ºa ksiƒÖ≈ºka o aborcji [The big book about abortion], which aimed to inform adolescents and women of the rights they have and explain what they can do in the case of unwanted pregnancy. Just few months after the premiere, a negative campaign started to remove the book from store shelves dedicated to adolescents. Book stores surrendered to public pressure and restricted the book to shelves dedicated to adults. She is a member of the board of the Polish Labor Party, and also a member of the Committee for Assistance and Defense of Repressed Workers. She has described communism as \\"the most pro- human system.\\" Selected publications *(with Kazimiera Szczuka): Du≈ºa ksiƒÖ≈ºka o aborcji.

The tournament took place on December 1, 2017, in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico. CMLL's recurring La Copa Junior tournament featured second, third, or fourth-generation wrestlers competing against each other. The 2017 version of the La Copa Junior was the tenth tournament held by CMLL. The 2017 La Copa Junior VIP tournament was contested under torneo cibernetico elimination match rules. The six man teams saw Niebla Roja, Car√≠stico, Volador Jr., M√≠stico, Dragon Lee, and Stuka Jr. face off against the team of Negro Casas, Mephisto, Shocker, Euforia, Sans√≥n, and El Felino. In the end Niebla Roja pinned Mephisto to eliminate him, earning the 2017 La Copa Junior VIP trophy. Production Background Starting in 1996 the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (\\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) held their first ever La Copa Junior tournament. CMLL held the tournament to celebrate the fact that lucha libre in Mexico is often a family tradition, with a large number of second, third, or even fourth generation wrestlers following the footsteps of their relatives. The premise of the tournament is that all participants are second-generation or more, although at times the family relationship is a storylines family relationship and not an actual one. One example of this is Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. being billed as the grandson of Drag√≥n Rojo, when in reality that is simply a storyline created by CMLL. The original La Copa Junior was won by H√©ctor Garza. CMLL would not hold another La Copa Junior until the 2005 tournament (won by Shocker), followed by a 2006 tournament won by Dos Caras Jr. The tournament did not return until 2010 where Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. won the 2010 version. In 2012 third-generation luchador La Sombra won the Junior cup In 2014, CMLL held two La Copa Junior tournaments, first a tournament on January 1, won by Super Halc√≥n Jr., , followed by a VIP tournament, featuring higher card wrestlers than the usual tournaments, which was won by M√°ximo The semi- regular tournament returned in 2016, won by Esfinge In 2017, Soberano Jr. won the La Copa Junior Nuevos Valores Storylines The tournament featured a number of professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Those affected typically have motor and language delays, low muscle tone and gastrointestinal dysmotility. Facial features include a wide nasal bridge, widely-spaced eyes, prominent, low-set ears, a flat nose tip and a small mouth. Less common features include congenital spinal abnormalities, hearing loss or seizures. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the CDK13 gene, which encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 13. Cyclin-dependent kinases are protein kinases, which are critical for regulating DNA transcription for cell differentiation. CDK13 promotes expression of genes involved in various developmental processes, and these processes are disrupted or not completed when the gene is mutated. The syndrome is diagnosed when genetic testing confirms a mutation in CDK13. Treatment centres around the symptoms. Medication or, in severe cases, gastrostomy can be used for the gastrointestinal dysmotility. Speech therapy as early as possible or assistive communication devices can aid language development. The prognosis is not certain as of yet, due to the lack of known patients, however a few patients in mid-adulthood have been identified. , at least 44 individuals with the condition had been identified and studied. Mutations in CDK13 were first identified as pathogenic in a 2016 cohort study, and the disorder was first outlined by Bostwick et al. in 2017, who also established the name CHDFIDD.  Signs and symptoms  392x392px Most individuals with CDK13-related disorder have congenital heart defects, typically an atrial or ventricular septal defect. Those with the disorder typically have a characteristic facial appearance which includes a wide nasal bridge, widely-spaced eyes, upslanted eyelids, epicanthic folds, high-arched eyebrows, prominent, low-set ears, a flat nose tip and a small mouth with a small upper lip. In some of those affected, the syndrome causes curly hair. The facial appearance has been noted to resemble that of Kabuki syndrome. The syndrome typically results in intellectual disability, including motor and language delays. Some individuals have had agenesis of the corpus callosum or aplasia of the cerebellar vermis. This can sometimes manifest with symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Low muscle tone and strabismus are also common. A few patients have had microcephaly and seizures. Affected individuals tend to have dysautonomic symptoms of gastrointestinal dysmotility, which can include gastroesophageal reflux, constipation and trouble swallowing. A few of those affected have had ear problems such as sensorineural hearing loss or recurrent ear infections, and a few individuals have had congenital spinal abnormalities including fused vertebrae or spina bifida as well as scoliosis.  Cause  The syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene CDK13, which encodes the protein cyclin dependent kinase 13. Cyclin-dependent kinases are protein kinases, which have an essential function in the cell cycle and the transcription of DNA. This is specifically through protein phosphorylation, which functions to turn off or on certain proteins, allowing cell differentiation and the progression of the normal developmental processes. A mutation in one of the two copies of these genes results in some proteins not being formed correctly and therefore some developmental processes being disrupted or not completed. Specifically, CDK13 appears to phosphorylate RNA polymerase II and enable it to carry out transcription of genes on DNA. It appears to largely do this when RNA polymerase II is transcribing certain genes involved in promoting cell development. Mutations in CDK13 that have been identified in individuals with this disorder have mostly been missense mutations (single amino acid changes) that have changed the amino acid structure of the otherwise highly conserved (little-changed) protein kinase domain of the gene, leading to structural changes that affect the operation of this critical protein. The most commonly identified mutations are those that change the 842nd amino acid of the protein, an asparagine (Asn), to a serine (Ser) or an aspartic acid (Asp), but many others have been identified. Different mutations, depending on how much they reduce the kinase functionality of the gene, have resulted in different severities of the syndrome. Those with total activity-eliminating mutations have, for example, had microcephaly. Mutations in both copies of CDK13 are embryonic lethal in mice. Mice who have had both of their copies of CDK13 knocked out do not survive past the 16th day of embryonic development due to heart failure, as the heart has significantly fewer myocytes and less myocardium, with less expression of myosin. All organs are smaller and less developed, and the embryo is reduced in size.  Diagnosis  The condition is generally diagnosed after genetic testing confirms CDK13 as mutated, although the condition may be suspected based on the symptoms. Methods to detect the mutation include whole exome sequencing and panel testing, in which a selection of potential genes involved are sequenced. The mutation can be confirmed by Sanger sequencing.  Treatment  Treatment centres around the symptoms. Atrial or ventricular septal defects are usually treated with observation but can be surgically corrected in severe cases. Prokinetic medication can be used to promote gastric emptying. If the gastric dysmotility is too severe for adequate intake, a gastrostomy can be performed. Speech therapy as early as possible or assistive communication devices can aid in language development.  Prognosis  The prognosis is not certain as of yet, as most of the individuals discovered and studied have been children, however a few patients in mid-adulthood have been identified.  Epidemiology  The prevalence is not yet known, as the disorder was only recently defined. Beginning with Bostwick et al.'s report in 2017, at least 44 individuals with the condition have been identified and studied .  History  Mutations in CDK13 were first identified as pathogenic in 2016, when they were identified in 7 individuals from a large cohort of 1,891 patients with congenital heart defects in a study by Sifrim et al. Mutations in CDK13 were then found again in 2017 in 11 individuals from an even larger cohort of 4,293 patients from the UK and Ireland with developmental delay by McRae et al., as part of the UK Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) cohort study. The disorder was first established and outlined by Bostwick et al, (2017) (9 patients), who also established the term congenital heart defects, dysmorphic facial features and intellectual developmental disorder (CHDFIDD). Later work by Hamilton et al. (2018) (16 patients), Uehara et al. (2018) (3 patients) and van den Akker et al. (2018) (15 patients) identified and studied additional patients.

However, the Ertuƒürul sank off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture in the night of 16 September 1890. With more than 500 crew members dead, it was the largest sea accident in history at that time.

In order to deliver the collected money, Foreign Minister Aoki Sh≈´z≈ç advised Yamada to go to Turkey in person. Yamada thus left for Istanbul on January 30, 1892, from the port of Yokohama. He sailed on the British ship Pasan, tasked with bringing back Japanese battleship Matsujima, then under construction in Lyon, France, for the Imperial Japanese Navy. During this period, Yamada teamed up with Nakamura Kenjir≈ç, a former naval officer from an Osaka family that traded clothing and fabrics. Both men were interested in opening trade and starting good relations with the Ottoman Empire. Arrival in Istanbul On April 4, 1892, Yamada arrived in Istanbul. He met Ottoman Foreign Minister Mehmed Said Pasha and gave the donated money to him. He offered Sultan Abd√ºlhamid II some Nakamura family goods, including samurai armor, a helmet, and a sword. The Sultan asked him to stay in Turkey for two years. The two built a close relationship. With the help of Noda Shotar≈ç, Yamada began to teach Japanese to army cadets. The future President of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, is said to have been one of his students. He returned briefly to Japan in 1893 aboard the Matsujima. On April 16, at the suggestion of Foreign Minister Enomoto Takeaki, Yamada gave a lecture at the seminary of the Japanese Colonial Association (Shokuminky≈çkai) on the Ottoman Empire and Egypt, reflecting Japan's new interest in expanding its trade network in the region. Commercial activity in Istanbul A picture of Yamada in a suit In Summer of 1893, Yamada left Kobe to return to Istanbul, where he founded the store Nakamura Shoten with Nakamura Kenjir≈ç. At the time, they were the only two permanent residents of Japanese ethnicity in Istanbul. Despite the fact that Japanese subjects had no legal status in the city due to the lack of official diplomatic relations between the Ottoman Empire and Japan, they received permission from the Ottoman government to run their business. Yamada formed good relations with the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ƒ∞stanbul Ticaret Odasƒ±) who authorized him to run his business as a \\"commercial museum\\" according to an Ottoman law promulgated in 1890. He also became a friend of Spirakis Alexandritis, the General Secretary of the Chamber and publisher of the Bulletin of the Oriental Directory, with whom Yamada continued to communicate even after his return to Japan decades later. Yamada obtained authorization to sell Japanese products such as silk, porcelain, tea, and wooden objects in a room in the Chamber of Commerce before renting a shop on Pera Street to set up Nakamura Shoten. Over the years, the shop became and important place for Japanese people visiting Istanbul. It first opened at Hazzopulo Pass on 19 Pera Street, and later moved to the Beyoƒülu District. The Sultan and members of the Ottoman dynasty particularly valued Japanese- manufactured goods as well as Japanese household and decorative items, becoming important customers of the store. Japanese products became a trend in Istanbul, partly because of the arrival of Japanophilia in Europe but also because of the growing admiration of Japan by the Turks. The current collections of Dolmabah√ße Palace, Topkapi Palace, and other palaces in Istanbul hold many items sold at Nakamura Shoten. \\"Meiji's Pleasant Boy Jumping to Turkey-Torajiro Yamada, p.108 Correspondence with Japan Yamada was a witness to the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 as well as the Occupation of the Ottoman Bank (picture of the Ottoman Bank shown above) in 1896 by Armenian militants, triggering a massacre of Armenians in Istanbul. From 1895 to 1899, Yamada published numerous articles on Turkey in the Taiy≈ç magazine. He also translated Turkish plays that occurred during the month of Ramadan as Daƒülƒ± Kƒ±z (The Daughter of the Mountain), a story about the beautiful daughter of a mountain bandit who saves people from kidnapping, and Kƒ±skan√ßlƒ±k (Jealousy), a romantic comedy. During this period, Yamada also published articles such as The Real Circumstances of Turkey and Egypt in the Japanese trade magazine Nihon Sh≈çgy≈ç Zasshi, Women of Turkey in 1895, News of Turkey in 1896, and Conditions of Life in Turkey in 1899. None of his articles, however, related to culture. Yamada also reported news from the Occupation of the Ottoman Bank in 1896 by Armenian militants to the Taiy≈ç magazine. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese government asked Yamada to secretly monitor the Bosporus for possible Russian naval movements. On July 4, 1904, he reported that three Russian warships passed the Dardanelles. At the time, the Turks began to take a great interest in Japan, a country that had modernized quickly to compete with major European powers. Due to the Russian threat to the North, the Turks were happy to learn of the Russian defeat. Return to Japan Yamada returned to Japan in 1905 and established a Turkish-Japanese partnership in a cigarette paper factory in Osaka in the same year. He made his pilgrimage to Mecca on a return trip from Turkey in 1914. He became master of a tea school known as Yamada Soyu. He published the picture book Toruko Gakan (A Pictorial Reflection of Turkey; ) in 1911 in which he attempted to explain the city of Istanbul as well as Islam to his countrymen. In 1931, he returned to Turkey, meeting with President Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. He died in 1957 after publishing his autobiography, entitled Shingetsu.

Portrayed by Christian Bale, this version of Batman is arguably explored more in-depth compared to that of the previous film series by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher, as the Dark Knight film series provides a full arc for the character and was intended by Nolan to be more realistic than previous portrayals. In the films, Bruce is the billionaire CEO of Wayne Enterprises, specializing in military defense. After witnessing the murder of his parents at age 8, Bruce travels the world in order to train to fight crime, returning to claim inheritance of his father's company. Subsequently, he begins fighting crime in Gotham City as Batman, utilizing advanced technology in doing so and basing his persona on conquering his fear of bats. Bale's portrayal of Batman has often been considered one of the greatest of the character in film, and has also been credited with the success of the Dark Knight film series, with the latter two films both grossing over $1 billion each, and thus, the restoration of public interest in Batman in the 21st Century. Character concept and development Batman first appeared in DC Comics stories in 1939 as the writers were adding more costumed superhero characters for the company's lineup. He was first portrayed in film in the 1940s with two film serials from Columbia Pictures: Batman in 1943, and Batman and Robin in 1949, with Lewis Wilson and Robert Lowery portraying the caped crusader in each respective series. In 1966, following the success of the television series on ABC, 20th Century Fox released a film for the series, with Adam West reprising his role from the show as Batman. After years of waning popularity and development hell for the character, Warner Bros. decided to develop a new Batman film in the mid 1980s, having recently adopted fellow DC Comics character Superman for film with a successful movie in 1978 and subsequent series. Tim Burton was hired as director of the film, which was released in 1989 with Michael Keaton taking on the role of Batman. Following the film's success, Burton made a sequel to the film, Batman Returns, with Keaton reprising his role, but both Burton and Keaton left the franchise after the film's release in 1992, being replaced by Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer, respectively. Schumacher's additions to Burton's film series, Batman Forever in 1995 and Batman & Robin in 1997 (which saw George Clooney replace Kilmer as Batman), saw mixed-to-negative critical reviews. Following the latter's critical and box office failure, the Batman film series was put in jeopardy. Development of the Dark Knight film series In January 2003, Warner Bros. hired Memento director Christopher Nolan to direct an untitled Batman film, and David S. Goyer signed on to write the script two months later. Nolan stated his intention to reinvent the film franchise of Batman by \\"doing the origins story of the character, which is a story that's never been told before\\". Nolan said that humanity and realism would be the basis of the origin film, and that \\"the world of Batman is that of grounded reality. [It] will be a recognizable, contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises.\\" Goyer said that the goal of the film was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Nolan felt the previous films were exercises in style rather than drama, and described his inspiration as being Richard Donner's 1978 film Superman, in its focus on depicting the character's growth. Also similar to Superman, Nolan wanted an all-star supporting cast for Batman Begins to lend a more epic feel and credibility to the story.The Journey Begins: Creative Concepts [DVD, 2005] Goyer wanted to reboot the franchise; he and Nolan saw Batman as a romantic character, and Nolan envisioned a large, sweeping film like Lawrence of Arabia. Nolan did not have a problem with the studio's requirement that the film not be R-rated because he wanted to make the film that he wanted to see when 11 years old. His personal \\"jumping off point\\" of inspiration was \\"The Man Who Falls\\", a short story by Denny O'Neil and Dick Giordano about Bruce's travels throughout the world. The early scene in Batman Begins of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was adapted from \\"The Man Who Falls\\". Batman: The Long Halloween, written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Tim Sale, influenced Goyer in writing the screenplay, with the villain Carmine Falcone as one of many elements which were drawn from Halloweens \\"sober, serious approach\\". The sequel to Halloween, Batman: Dark Victory, also served as a minor influence. Goyer used the vacancy of Bruce Wayne's multi-year absence presented in Batman: Year One to help set up some of the film's events in the transpiring years. A common idea in the comics is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan explained that by ignoring that idea ‚Äì which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances ‚Äì it emphasized the importance of bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different. Casting According to Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale had \\"exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for.\\" Christian Bale was already an established actor when cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman, but had not yet attained movie star status. Before he was confirmed on September 11, 2003, having expressed interest in the role since Darren Aronofsky was planning his own film adaptation, Eion Bailey, Henry Cavill, Billy Crudup, Hugh Dancy, Jake Gyllenhaal, Joshua Jackson, Heath Ledger, David Boreanaz and Cillian Murphy took interest in it as well. Amy Adams served as the casting reader for the casting of Bruce Wayne / Batman in a favor to the casting director. Bale felt the previous Batman films underused Batman's character, emphasizing the villains instead. To inform his characterization, Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero. Director Nolan said of Bale, \\"He has exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for.\\" Goyer stated that while some actors could play a great Bruce Wayne or a great Batman, Bale could portray both radically different personalities. Bale described the part as playing four characters: the raging Batman persona; the shallow playboy fa√ßade Bruce uses to ward off suspicion; the vengeful young man; and the older, angrier Bruce who is discovering his purpose in life. He later reflected on Batman as a \\"very, very dark, messed-up character.\\" At his audition, Bale wore the Batsuit (minus the cape, which has been missing for some time) Val Kilmer donned for 1995's Batman Forever. Bale's dislike of his costume, which heated up regularly, helped him get into a necessarily foul mood. He said, \\"Batman's meant to be fierce, and you become a beast in that suit, as Batman should be ‚Äì not a man in a suit, but a different creature.\\" Since he had lost a great deal of weight in preparation for his role in The Machinist, Bale hired a personal trainer to help him gain of muscle in the span of only a couple of months to help him physically prepare for the role. He first went well over the weight required and created concern over whether he would look right for the part. Bale recognized that his large physique was not appropriate for Batman, who relies on speed and strategy. He lost the excess weight by the time filming began. Bale trained in Wing Chun Kung Fu under Eric Oram in preparation for the movie. Child actor Gus Lewis portrays an 8-year-old Bruce at the beginning of the film. Bale reprised the role of Batman in the sequel The Dark Knight, released on July 18, 2008. He trained in the Keysi Fighting Method, and performed many of his own stunts. He reprised the role again for the sequel The Dark Knight Rises, released on July 20, 2012. Of all the actors who have portrayed Batman on film, Bale did so for the longest time period. Following a shooting at a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises, he visited survivors in an Aurora, Colorado hospital. Despite the success of the Dark Knight trilogy, Bale decided not to return for a potential fourth film appearance as Batman out of respect for Christopher Nolan's creative direction and the fact that the trilogy provided a full arc for the character. Voice Though previous Batman actors Michael Keaton and Kevin Conroy created separate voices for Batman and the unmasked Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale's \\"Batman voice\\" is often considered the most memorable live-action rendition and was made famous by the films. Director Christopher Nolan states that \\"Christian, somehow, figured this out before the screen test, that you could not give a normal performance, that you could not give an ordinary performance. You had to project massive energy through this costume in order to not question the costume. So it's about feeling and a voice, and I think Christian's voice was a big part of the impression he made in the test. He decided that Batman needed to have a different voice than Bruce Wayne; he needed to put on a voice that supported the visual appearance of the character.\\" The vocalization of Bale's Batman (which was partly altered during post-production) was the subject of particular criticism by some commentators, with David Edelstein of NPR describing Bale delivering his performance with \\"a voice that's deeper and hammier than ever.\\" Alonso Duralde at MSNBC, however, referred to Bale's voice in The Dark Knight as an \\"eerie rasp,\\" as opposed to the voice used in the Batman Begins, which according to Duralde \\"sounded absurdly deep, like a 10-year-old putting on an 'adult' voice to make prank phone calls.\\" Batsuits Batman has several bodysuits in the trilogy, with a detailed description given to the one utilized in Batman Begins. Variations of military-grade body armor are used, with Christian Bale requesting changes made due to a lack of mobility with the first suit used. Characterization Bruce Wayne is very dedicated to his work of crime-fighting. He sometimes employing illegal and morally dubious tactics, gaining the moniker \\"The Dark Knight\\", as opposed to Harvey Dent, who fights crime through legal methods as Gotham's \\"White Knight\\" before his transformation into Two-Face. Bruce's strongest characteristic is his strong moral code: while he often severely injures the criminals he fights, he refuses to kill them, as he believes that doing so would make him no better than them. To the public, Bruce Wayne puts on the fa√ßade of a shallow, dim-witted playboy so that no one will take a serious look into his life and discover his secret. As Batman, he employs the image of a monstrous, shadowy, bat-like creature that is not intimidated by criminals and can disappear at will, in order to strike fear into the hearts of criminals and provide the people of Gotham a symbol of hope and justice. Abilities Batman is a highly skilled martial artist, having been trained by Ra's al Ghul in ninjutsu. Batman has achieved such feats as single-handedly subduing a team of trained S.W.A.T. officers and taking out a group of the League of Shadows with minimal injury. Even prior to his training, Bruce Wayne is able to fight an entire gang of convicts in a prison brawl, with the guards locking him in solitary for the other inmates' \\"protection.\\" Batman is also highly intelligent, being a brilliant detective and an expert tactician. He has proven himself exceptionally good at stealth, being able to disappear at will and sneak up on others unexpectedly. With his vast wealth, Batman has access to cutting-edge technology to help in his war on crime. Film appearances Batman Begins (2005) The Batsuit, worn by Christian Bale in Batman Begins (2005) Bruce Wayne first appears in the film Batman Begins. As a child, he falls into a well on his parents' estate and is rescued by his father Thomas (Linus Roache), but develops a fear of bats after a flock of them attack him. Bruce tours a new monorail funded by his father, who explains that he nearly bankrupted his company Wayne Enterprises to build it in order to help Gotham City, which is experiencing an economic depression. Bruce then accompanies his parents to see the opera Mefistofele, but is frightened by a bat-like character in the production. As his parents take him home, they are confronted by a mugger named Joe Chill (Richard Brake), who shoots them both dead right in front of Bruce, leaving him deeply traumatized. Bruce is comforted by police officer James Gordon (Gary Oldman) as Chill is arrested, then raised by his parents' butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine). Fifteen years later, Bruce is still mourning his parents, and plans to kill the recently paroled Chill. Before Bruce can take his revenge, however, Chill is murdered by an assassin working for mobster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), whom Chill was going to testify against. When Bruce tells his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) what he had planned to do, she is disgusted and lectures him about the difference between justice and revenge, which motivates him to confront Falcone himself. Falcone laughs Bruce off, stating that he does not understand the criminal world, so Bruce leaves Gotham, exploring the world and working for criminal organizations to try and understand them. After being arrested in Bhutan for robbery and engaging in a prison fight, Bruce is approached by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who invites Bruce to join the League of Shadows, an elite vigilante group. Bruce trains with Ducard and the League and conquers his fears, but refuses their final test, the execution of a thief. When Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be beyond saving, he burns down the League's temple, killing their leader Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) but saving an unconscious Ducard. Bruce returns to Gotham, intending to use the martial skills he learned from the League to fight crime as a symbol of fear. Bruce takes an interest in Wayne Enterprises, which is being taken public by the unscrupulous William Earle (Rutger Hauer). Company archivist Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a friend of Bruce's father, allows Bruce access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and a heavily armored vehicle, the Tumbler. Bruce poses publicly as a shallow playboy, while setting up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor and taking up the vigilante identity of \\"Batman\\", inspired by his childhood fear. He reaches out to Rachel, now the city's assistant district attorney, and Gordon, now a sergeant, to aid him in his fight against crime. While patrolling as Batman one night, Bruce intercepts a drug shipment by Falcone, tying him up and providing incriminating evidence for Rachel and Gordon to arrest him. Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), Arkham Asylum's corrupt chief psychiatrist, doses Falcone with a fear-inducing hallucinogen, driving him insane. Batman confronts Crane, who doses him with the hallucinogen as well, incapacitating him with visions of his parents' murder. Alfred rescues him, however, and Fox administers an antidote. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, he reveals he has introduced his drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel, but Batman subdues and interrogates Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administering her the antidote and giving her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. At Bruce's birthday party, Ducard reappears and reveals himself to be the real Ra's al Ghul, the other one having been a decoy. Having stolen a microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him. Ra's loads the microwave emitter onto Gotham's monorail system to release the drug at the city's central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. As Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy a section of the track, Batman defeats Ra's and escapes the train, leaving him to die as the train crashes. Bruce wins Rachel's respect and love, but she decides she cannot be with him as long as Gotham needs Batman. Batman becomes a public hero and Bruce reveals he has purchased a controlling stake in Wayne Enterprises, firing Earle and replacing him with Fox. Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant and shows Batman the Bat-Signal, and tells him of a criminal who leaves behind Joker playing cards. The Dark Knight (2008) A year later, Batman has become a thorn in the side of Gotham's organized crime families, and inspired the public - to the point that several gun-toting vigilantes have begun dressing as him and attacking criminals in a misguided attempt to help his crusade. Batman stops a group of these vigilantes when they attack Crane and a group of mobsters and apprehends the entire group, but injuries suffered during the confrontation lead him to design a new, more versatile suit of armor. Batman and Gordon contemplate bringing Gotham's new district attorney - and Rachel's boyfriend - Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in on their plan to eradicate the mob. While Bruce is Dent's rival for Rachel's affection, he is impressed by the D.A.'s dedication to fighting crime, and hopes that Dent will become the city's protector so that he can give up being Batman and live a normal life with Rachel. Bruce travels to Hong Kong under the guise of a weekend fling with the Russian Ballet in order to apprehend the mob's accountant Lau (Chin Han) as Batman so Gordon and Dent can use him to confiscate the mob's money. Meanwhile, Batman and Gordon become aware of a murderous bank robber calling himself \\"the Joker\\" (Heath Ledger). In retaliation for briefly being arrested, mob bosses Sal Maroni (Eric Roberts) and the Chechen (Ritchie Coster) pay the Joker half of their money to kill Batman. The Joker publicly threatens to kill people every day until Batman reveals his true identity, and makes good on his threat by killing Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb (Colin MacFarlane) and, apparently, Gordon. Bruce decides to turn himself in to the police, and shares another kiss with Rachel, who says that they cannot be together if he goes to prison. Before Bruce can give himself up, however, Dent publicly admits to being Batman to draw the Joker out of hiding. The Joker attempts to kill Dent during transport, but Gordon (who faked his death) and Batman intervene in time to apprehend him. With the Joker in custody, Batman and Gordon, now promoted to GCPD Commissioner, believe that the crisis is over, but become alarmed when Dent goes missing. Desperate to find Dent, Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that Rachel and Dent have been taken to opposite sides of the city, far enough apart that Batman would not have time to save both of them. Batman speeds off to save Rachel, while Gordon and the police head after Dent. Unbeknownst to them, however, the Joker had switched the locations, sending Batman after Dent and Gordon after Rachel. Batman rescues Dent just as both buildings explode, but Dent's face is disfigured and Rachel is killed. Bruce is devastated by her death, taking solace only in the belief that she would have chosen him; in order to spare him pain, Alfred decides to burn a letter Rachel had given him in which she wrote that she had decided to marry Dent. Meanwhile, the Joker convinces Dent to take revenge against the people he blames for Rachel's death: Gordon and Batman. When the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless someone kills Coleman Reese (Joshua Harto), a Wayne Enterprises accountant who has deduced Batman's secret identity, Bruce risks his life to save him, persuading Reese to keep his secret. The Joker then kidnaps a busload of people and puts them on a ferry rigged to explode, threatening to kill them unless they remotely detonate another similarly rigged ferry full of prisoners, while his men hold another group of hostages at gunpoint. Batman persuades a reluctant Fox to use a sonar device to monitor all of Gotham so he can find the Joker. Batman frees the hostages and subdues the Joker, while neither group on the ferries destroy each other. The Joker nevertheless gloats that the citizens of Gotham will lose faith in humanity once they learn of Dent's murderous rampage as the vigilante \\"Two-Face\\". Horrified, Batman goes to find Dent as the Joker is taken into custody. Batman finds Dent holding Gordon and his family hostage at the site of Rachel's death. Dent threatens to kill Gordon's son in order to inflict upon him the pain of losing a loved one, but Batman persuades him to pass judgement on the people he holds responsible for Rachel's death: Batman, himself, and Gordon. Dent flips his lucky coin to decide their fates, shooting Batman and sparing himself. As Dent is about to kill Gordon's son, Batman, who is wearing body armor, tackles him off a ledge to his death, saving the boy before falling and injuring his leg. Determined to preserve Dent's heroic image, Batman convinces Gordon to let him take the blame for Dent's crimes, and disappears into the night, now branded a murderer. The Dark Knight Rises (2012) Eight years later, Bruce has become a recluse, still mourning Rachel's death and rarely leaving Wayne Manor. In addition, Wayne Enterprises is losing money after Bruce discontinued a fusion reactor project when he learned that it could be weaponized. His efforts to rid Gotham of crime have been successful, however; using Dent's image as a martyred hero, Gordon and Gotham's politicians have eradicated organized crime in the city with the Dent Act, a bill giving police increased authority. Bruce hosts \\"Harvey Dent Day\\" at Wayne Manor, but does not join the festivities. Cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) steals a pearl necklace belonging to Bruce's late mother, and overpowers him when he tries to stop her. Bruce discovers that the real target was his fingerprints and not the necklace. Bruce tracks Selina to a gala and takes back the pearls, but Selina escapes again. Shortly afterward, Wayne is visited by police officer John Blake (Joseph Gordon Levitt), who tells him about an attack on Gordon by Bane (Tom Hardy), an excommunicated member of the League of Shadows. Blake also tells Bruce that he has deduced his secret identity as Batman and can relate to him; Blake is also an orphan and has learned to hide his anger. He asks Bruce to return as Batman. Against Alfred's advice, Bruce resurfaces as Batman in order to pursue Bane, but the police opt to chase him instead. When Bruce returns home, he gets into an argument with Alfred, who fears that Bruce will get himself killed; Alfred reveals that Rachel chose Dent over him, and resigns his service. Batman saves Selina from Bane and his men, escaping in the Bat, a giant aerial craft made by Fox. Surprised that Batman is the \\"powerful friend\\" Bruce told her of, Selina informs him that she sold Bruce's fingerprints to John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn), Bruce's corrupt business rival. Bane uses Bruce's stolen fingerprints to make a series of transactions that leaves Bruce bankrupt. Bruce is fired from Wayne Enterprises' Board of Trustees, but persuades CEO Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) to prevent Daggett from taking over the company. Bane then kills Daggett, who had secretly been working with him. Bruce and Miranda spend the night together, before Selina takes him to see Bane in his hideout. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham. Batman fights Bane, but Bane breaks his back and takes him to an underground prison in the middle of a Middle Eastern desert. The inmates tell Bruce the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before escaping ‚Äî the only prisoner to have done so. Bruce helplessly watches news coverage of Bane turning Gotham into a no man's land - freeing its criminals, imprisoning police, and revealing the truth about Harvey Dent's crimes. Months later, a recovered Bruce escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham after Bane has taken over the city, planning to destroy it with the fusion reactor. Batman frees the police and they clash with Bane's army in the streets; during the battle, Batman overpowers Bane. Miranda intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself as Talia al Ghul, Ra's al Ghul's daughter, and pledging to complete her father's work and avenge his death. She activates the bomb's detonator, but Gordon blocks the signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Selina arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Selina pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses his aerial craft, the Bat, to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman kisses Selina, and indirectly reveals his identity to Gordon. In the aftermath, Batman and Bruce are both presumed dead, with the former honored as a hero. Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage and Bruce's estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the Bat Signal repaired, while Fox discovers that Bruce fixed the malfunctioning auto-pilot on the Bat. While vacationing in Florence, Italy, Alfred discovers that Bruce is alive and in a relationship with Selina. Blake resigns from the GCPD and receives a parcel from Bruce leaving him the Batcave and passing on his legacy as Gotham's protector, as Bruce finally moves on with his life. In other media Film Bruce Wayne/Batman is the subject of Batman: Gotham Knight, an animated anthology film that takes place in the universe ofThe Dark Knight trilogy and contains six stories, animated by different anime studios. The film is set between the events of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, though the producers have acknowledged that the plot of the anthology isn't necessarily integral to the main story told within the films. Batman is portrayed fighting against the mobs of Gotham City in addition to other villains such as Deadshot and Scarecrow. Batman is voiced by Kevin Conroy, who also voiced the character in Batman: The Animated Series. Video games The suit from Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight film was added as an alternate skin to Batman: Arkham Knight during a free update in December 2015. Reception Christian Bale's portrayal of Batman has received widespread critical acclaim, even though Bale himself has said he could have given a better performance. Before the premiere of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (which saw Ben Affleck take on the role), The Guardian surveyed the previous Batman actors, including Bale, and judged him to be the best Batman due to his balanced and realistic portrayal of the character, especially in Batman Begins, stating that \\"Bale gave us a Batman we could believe in, in more ways than one.\\" To date, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises are Bale's most financially successful films, and all three films in the Dark Knight Trilogy are often regarded as some of the greatest superhero films of all time. While he was an established actor prior to his casting, Bale gained more international exposure due to his role as Batman. He received numerous award nominations for the role spanning across the three films, including winning Best Actor at the Empire Awards.

Roughly speaking, the conjecture states that for any bipartite graph H and graph G on n vertices with average degree pn, there are at least p^{E(H)} n^{V(H)} labeled copies of H in G, up to a small error term. Formally, it provides an intuitive inequality about graph homomorphism densities in graphons. The conjectured inequality can be interpreted as a statement that the density of copies of H in a graph is asymptotically minimized by a random graph, as one would expect a p^{E(H)} fraction of possible subgraphs to be a copy of H if each edge exists with probability p. Statement Let H be a graph. Then H is said to have Sidorenko's property if, for all graphons W, the inequality : t(H,W)\\\\geq t(K_2,W)^{E(H)} is true, where t(H,W) is the homomorphism density of H in W. Sidorenko's conjecture (1986) states that every bipartite graph has Sidorenko's property. If W is a graph G, this means that the probability of a uniform random mapping from V(H) to V(G) being a homomorphism is at least the product over each edge in H of the probability of that edge being mapped to an edge in G. This roughly means that a randomly chosen graph with fixed number of vertices and average degree has the minimum number of labeled copies of H. This is not a surprising conjecture because the right hand side of the inequality is the probability of the mapping being a homomorphism if each edge map is independent. So one should expect the two sides to be at least of the same order. The natural extension to graphons would follow from the fact that every graphon is the limit point of some sequence of graphs. The requirement that H is bipartite to have Sidorenko's property is necessary ‚Äî if W is a bipartite graph, then t(K_3,W)=0 since W is triangle-free. But t(K_2,W) is twice the number of edges in W, so Sidorenko's property does not hold for K_3. A similar argument shows that no graph with an odd cycle has Sidorenko's property. Since a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles, this implies that the only possible graphs that can have Sidorenko's property are bipartite graphs. Equivalent formulation Sidorenko's property is equivalent to the following reformulation: : For all graphs G, if G has n vertices and an average degree of pn, then t(H,G)\\\\geq p^{E(H)}. This is equivalent because the number of homomorphisms from K_2 to G is twice the number of edges in G, and the inequality only needs to be checked when W is a graph as previously mentioned. In this formulation, since the number of non- injective homomorphisms from H to G is at most a constant times n^{V(H)-1}, Sidorenko's property would imply that there are at least (p^{E(H)}-o(1))n^{V(H)} labeled copies of H in G. Examples As previously noted, to prove Sidorenko's property it suffices to demonstrate the inequality for all graphs G. Throughout this section, G is a graph on n vertices with average degree pn. The quantity \\\\operatorname{hom}(H,G) refers to the number of homomorphisms from H to G. This quantity is the same as n^{V(H)}t(H,G). Elementary proofs of Sidorenko's property for some graphs follow from the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality or H√∂lder's inequality. Others can be done by using spectral graph theory, especially noting the observation that the number of closed paths of length \\\\ell from vertex i to vertex j in G is the component in the ith row and jth column of the matrix A^\\\\ell, where A is the adjacency matrix of G. Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz: The 4-cycle C4 By fixing two vertices u and v of G, each copy of C_4 that have u and v on opposite ends can be identified by choosing two (not necessarily distinct) common neighbors of u and v. Letting \\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v) denote the codegree of u and v (i.e. the number of common neighbors), this implies : \\\\operatorname{hom}(C_4,G)=\\\\sum_{u,v\\\\in V(G)}\\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)^2\\\\geq\\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{u,v\\\\in V(G)}\\\\operatorname{codeg}(u,v)\\\\right)^2 by the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality. The sum has now become a count of all pairs of vertices and their common neighbors, which is the same as the count of all vertices and pairs of their neighbors. So : \\\\operatorname{hom}(C_4,G)\\\\geq\\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{x\\\\in V(G)}\\\\deg(x)^2\\\\right)^2\\\\geq\\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{x\\\\in V(G)} \\\\deg(x) \\\\right)^2\\\\right)^2=\\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}(n\\\\cdot pn)^2\\\\right)^2=p^4n^4 by Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz again. So : t(C_4,G)=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{hom}(C_4,G)}{n^4}\\\\geq p^4 as desired. Spectral graph theory: The 2k-cycle C2k Although the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz approach for C_4 is elegant and elementary, it does not immediately generalize to all even cycles. However, one can apply spectral graph theory to prove that all even cycles have Sidorenko's property. Note that odd cycles are not accounted for in Sidorenko's conjecture because they are not bipartite. Using the observation about closed paths, it follows that \\\\operatorname{hom}(C_{2k},G) is the sum of the diagonal entries in A^{2k}. This is equal to the trace of A^{2k}, which in turn is equal to the sum of the 2kth powers of the eigenvalues of A. If \\\\lambda_1\\\\geq\\\\lambda_2\\\\geq\\\\dots\\\\geq\\\\lambda_n are the eigenvalues of A, then the min-max theorem implies that : \\\\lambda_1\\\\geq\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{1}^\\\\intercal A\\\\mathbf{1}}{\\\\mathbf{1}^\\\\intercal\\\\mathbf{1}}=\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{x\\\\in V(G)}\\\\deg(x)=pn, where \\\\mathbf{1} is the vector with n components, all of which are 1. But then : \\\\operatorname{hom}(C_{2k},G)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\lambda_i^{2k}\\\\geq\\\\lambda_1^{2k}\\\\geq p^{2k}n^{2k} because the eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix are real. So : t(C_{2k},G)=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{hom}(C_{2k},G)}{n^{2k}}\\\\geq p^{2k} as desired. Entropy: Paths of length 3 J.L. Xiang Li and Bal√°zs Szegedy (2011) introduced the idea of using entropy to prove some cases of Sidorenko's conjecture. Szegedy (2015) later applied the ideas further to prove that an even wider class of bipartite graphs have Sidorenko's property. While Szegedy's proof wound up being abstract and technical, Tim Gowers and Jason Long reduced the argument to a simpler one for specific cases such as paths of length 3. In essence, the proof chooses a nice probability distribution of choosing the vertices in the path and applies Jensen's inequality (i.e. convexity) to deduce the inequality. Partial results Here is a list of some bipartite graphs H which have been shown to have Sidorenko's property. Let H have bipartition A\\\\sqcup B. * Paths have Sidorenko's property, as shown by Mulholland and Smith in 1959 (before Sidorenko formulated the conjecture). * Trees have Sidorenko's property, generalizing paths. This was shown by Sidorenko in a 1991 paper. * Cycles of even length have Sidorenko's property as previously shown. Sidorenko also demonstrated this in his 1991 paper. * Complete bipartite graphs have Sidorenko's property. This was also shown in Sidorenko's 1991 paper. * Bipartite graphs with \\\\min\\\\\\\\{A,B\\\\\\\\}\\\\leq4 have Sidorenko's property. This was also shown in Sidorenko's 1991 paper. * Hypercube graphs (generalizations of Q_3) have Sidorenko's property, as shown by Hatami in 2008. ** More generally, norming graphs (as introduced by Hatami) have Sidorenko's property. * If there is a vertex in A that is neighbors with every vertex in B (or vice versa), then H has Sidorenko's property as shown by Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov in 2010. This proof used the dependent random choice method. * For all bipartite graphs H, there is some positive integer p such that the p-blow-up of B has Sidorenko's property. Here, the p-blow-up of H is formed by replacing each vertex in B with p copies of itself, each connected with its original neighbors in A. This was shown by Conlon and Lee in 2018. * Some recursive approaches have been attempted, which take a collection of graphs that have Sidorenko's property to create a new graph that has Sidorenko's property. The main progress in this manner was done by Sidorenko in his 1991 paper, Li and Szegedy in 2011, and Kim, Lee, and Lee in 2013. ** Li and Szegedy's paper also used entropy methods to prove the property for a class of graphs called \\"reflection trees.\\" ** Kim, Lee, and Lee's paper extended this idea to a class of graphs with a tree-like substructure called \\"tree-arrangeable graphs.\\" However, there are graphs for which Sidorenko's conjecture is still open. An example is the \\"M√∂bius strip\\" graph K_{5,5}\\\\setminus C_{10}, formed by removing a 10-cycle from the complete bipartite graph with parts of size 5. L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz proved a local version of Sidorenko's conjecture, i.e. for graphs that are \\"close\\" to random graphs in a sense of cut norm. Forcing conjecture A sequence of graphs \\\\\\\\{G_n\\\\\\\\}_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} is called quasi-random with density p for some density 0 if for every graph H, : t(H,G_n)=(1+o(1))p^{E(H)}. The sequence of graphs would thus have properties of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi random graph G(n,p). If the edge density t(K_2,G_n) is fixed at (1+o(1))p, then the condition implies that the sequence of graphs is near the equality case in Sidorenko's property for every graph H. From Chung, Graham, and Wilson's 1989 paper about quasi- random graphs, it suffices for the C_4 count to match what would be expected of a random graph (i.e. the condition holds for H=C_4). The paper also asks which graphs H have this property besides C_4. Such graphs are called forcing graphs as their count controls the quasi-randomness of a sequence of graphs. The forcing conjecture states the following: : A graph H is forcing if and only if it is bipartite and not a tree. It is straightforward to see that if H is forcing, then it is bipartite and not a tree. Some examples of forcing graphs are even cycles (shown by Chung, Graham, and Wilson). Skokan and Thoma showed that all complete bipartite graphs that are not trees are forcing. Sidorenko's conjecture follows from the forcing conjecture. Furthermore, the forcing conjecture would show that graphs that are close to equality in Sidorenko's property must satisfy quasi-randomness conditions.

Biography  Mario Saint-Amand is a Quebecois actor and singer. He began his career in 1987 at the Denise-Pelletier Theater in Le Mariage de Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro) alongside Guy Nadon. Saint-Amand made the transition from opera to theatre by taking the role of Harlequin in Marivaux's play Le Jeu de l'Amour et du Hasard (The Game of Love and chance). Throughout the early 1990s, he appeared in a plays directed by Andr√© Brassard, Dominique Champagne, and Andr√© Montmorency. Saint-Amand began his film career in the late 1980s. His first starring role was in the 1991 movie 'Love-Moi' directed by Marcel Simard. He starred in several TV series including Scoop, Networks and more recently, in Grande Ourse (Big bear), directed by Patrice Sauv√©. At the 1994 Gemini Awards, Saint-Amand won the \\"Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Supporting Role\\" award for his notable portrayal of a man with AIDS in a guest appearance on the TV series L'Amour avec un grand A (Love with a Capital L).

Lyrically, frontman Jacoby Shaddix states that the song is about sticking with friends and loved ones during hard times in their lives. The song was written around mental health awareness, with Shaddix elaborating that it was also about the power of music to connect with people to overcome adversity. Shaddix stated that the song was about himself to a certain capacity as well, in his feeling that music helps him feel connected to something \\"bigger than [him]self\\". The song's music video plays into the themes as well, focusing on a fan that was affected by the band's music. The video focuses around the band's long-time fan Mark Moreno, who had followed the band since their breakout in 2000, and had attended over 60 lives shows since then. The band invite Moreno to a concert, thank him for his support, give him a plaque to honor his sister who had died in 2016, and awarded him two tickets for Papa Roach live shows for life.

Casciaro is an American man who was wrongfully convicted for the 2002 disappearance and presumed murder of Brian Carrick in Johnsburg, Illinois. Conviction and appeal Brian Carrick‚Äôs body has never been found. Casciaro was first arrested in June 2007 and charged in McHenry County with nine counts of perjury related to the disappearance of Carrick. He was acquitted by way of a directed verdict during a bench trial in September 2009. He was subsequently arrested in February 2010 and charged with 6 counts of Felony Murder. The state nolle prossed four of the counts and proceeded to trial on the two remaining counts of Felony Murder by Intimidation and Unlawful Restraint. The January 2012 trial concluded in a hung jury. He was tried a third time in 2013 on the remaining count of Felony Murder by Intimidation. In his third trial, he was convicted by a jury after a two-day jury deliberation and sentenced to 26 years in the Illinois Department of Corrections. Casciaro is the only person to have ever been charged with Felony Murder Using Intimidation in the history of the United States.People v. Casciaro, 2015 IL App (2d) 131291 Casciaro was also one of 523 people to have ever been brought to trial in a no-body murder case in the history of the United States. In September 2015, the Second District Appellate Court of Illinois unanimously overturned Casciaro‚Äôs conviction for Murder on direct appeal. He was represented by Kathleen Zellner, a prominent attorney who is known for her representation of Steven Avery on Making a Murderer Season 2. The court cited insufficiency of evidence and determined that no reasonable juror could have convicted on the evidence presented by the state. The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the Appellate Court in March 2016.

She is a Professor of archaeology and heritage at the University of Sydney. Clarke is a leading scholar in Australian archaeology, both historical and Aboriginal, as well as critical heritage studies. She has specialisms in archaeobotany, contact archaeology and rock art.  Education  Clarke obtained a BA (hons) from the Institute of Archaeology, University of London in 1980. In 1989 she obtained a MA from the University of Western Australia with a thesis titled An Analysis of Archaeobotanical Data from Two Sites in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory.Clarke, Anne Fiona. (1987). An analysis of archaeobotanical data from two sites in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory. (Unpublished MA thesis) She obtained a PhD in 1996 from the Australian National University, supervised by Rhys Jones, Mike Smith and Matthew Spriggs. Her thesis, titled Winds of Change: an archaeology of contact in the Groote Eylandt Archipelago, Northern Territory explored the dynamics of contact and colonialism between Indigenous people living in the Groote Eylandt archipelago, Macassan traders and later European colonists. It also represented and early model of engaged, community archaeology, as Clarke carried out her fieldwork in collaboration with the local Aboriginal communities of Groote Eylandt.  Career  After completing her PhD, Clarke was employed by the Australian National University, first as a post-doctoral fellow and lecturer. In 2003, she was appointed as a lecturer in heritage studies at the University of Sydney. Over the course of her career, Clarke has held a number of grants, including a large number of Australian Research Council Linkage projects. From 2006-2009, Clarke (along with colleagues Robin Torrence of the Australian Museum and Jude Philp of the Macleay Museum) directed the ARC-funded \\"Producers and Collectors: Uncovering the Role of Indigenous Agency in the Formation of Museum Collections\\". From 2012-2015 she was lead Chief Investigator on the project \\"The archaeology and history of quarantine\\" that investigated the Sydney Quarantine Station at North Head. She is currently involved with two ARC Linkage projects: \\"Reconstructing museum specimen data through the pathways of global commerce\\" led by Jude Philp and \\"Heritage of the air: how aviation transformed Australia\\" led by Tracey Ireland of the University of Canberra. For the latter project, she is analysing material culture related to aviation held in a number of collections, including by Qantas and the SFO MuseumSFO Museum at San Francisco Airport. Clarke is best known for her work on the archaeology of cross- cultural exchange, community archaeology and cultural heritage. Her work on Groote Eylandt focussed scholarly attention on paintings of Macassan praus in Aboriginal Australian rock art. She applied these methods to the study of graffiti made at the Sydney Quarantine Station by people interned there in the 19th and 20th centuries. This research led to the 2016 publication of the book Stories from the sandstone: quarantine inscriptions from Australia's immigrant past (co-authored with Peter Hobbins and Ursula Frederick) that won the NSW community and regional history prize at the 2017 NSW Premier's History Awards. In recent years, Clarke has returned to Groot Eylandt where she has been working with the local community to develop educational programs, repatriation protocols and future archaeological research projects.

The reason for the interest in the second-largest eigenvalue is that the largest eigenvalue is guaranteed to be d due to d-regularity, with the all-ones vector being the associated eigenvector. The graphs that come close to meeting this bound are Ramanujan graphs, which are examples of the best possible expander graphs. Theorem statement Let G be a d-regular graph on n vertices, and let A be its adjacency matrix. Let \\\\lambda_1 \\\\ge \\\\lambda_2 \\\\ge \\\\cdots \\\\ge \\\\lambda_n be its eigenvalues. Then :\\\\lambda_2 \\\\ge 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} - \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{d-1} - 1}{\\\\lfloor m/2 \\\\rfloor}. The above statement is the original one proved by Noga Alon. Some slightly weaker variants exist to improve the ease of proof or improve intuition. Two of these are shown in the proofs below. Intuition The Cayley graph of the free group on two generators a and b is an example of an infinite d-regular tree for d=4. The intuition for the number 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} comes from considering the infinite d-regular tree. This graph is a universal cover of d-regular graphs, and it has spectral radius 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}. Saturation A graph that essentially saturates the Alon‚ÄìBoppana bound is called a Ramanujan graph. More precisely, a Ramanujan graph is a d-regular graph such that \\\\lambda_2, \\\\lambda_n \\\\le 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}. A theorem by Friedman shows that, for every d and \\\\epsilon > 0 and for sufficiently large n, a random d-regular graph G on n vertices satisfies \\\\max\\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_2, \\\\lambda_n\\\\\\\\} < 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} + \\\\epsilon with high probability. This means that a random n-vertex d-regular graph is typically \\"almost Ramanujan.\\" First proof (slightly weaker statement) We will prove a slightly weaker statement, namely dropping the specificity on the second term and simply asserting \\\\lambda_2 \\\\ge 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} - o(1). Here, the o(1) term refers to the asymptotic behavior as n grows without bound while d remains fixed. Let the vertex set be V. By the min-max theorem, it suffices to construct a nonzero vector z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{V} such that z^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{1} = 0 and \\\\frac{z^{\\\\text{T}}Az}{z^{\\\\text{T}}z} \\\\ge 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} - o(1). Pick some value r\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}. For each vertex in V, define a vector f(v)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{V} as follows. Each component will be indexed by a vertex u in the graph. For each u, if the distance between u and v is k, then the u-component of f(v) is f(v)_u = w_k = (d-1)^{-k/2} if k\\\\le r-1 and 0 if k\\\\ge r. We claim that any such vector x = f(v) satisfies :\\\\frac{x^{\\\\text{T}}Ax}{x^{\\\\text{T}}x} \\\\ge 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{2r}\\\\right). To prove this, let V_k denote the set of all vertices that have a distance of exactly k from v. First, note that :x^{\\\\text{T}}x = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}V_kw^2_k. Second, note that :x^{\\\\text{T}}Ax = \\\\sum_{u\\\\in V}x_u \\\\sum_{u'\\\\in N(u)}x_{u'} \\\\ge \\\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}V_kw_k\\\\left[w_{k-1} + (d-1)w_{k+1}\\\\right] - (d-1)V_{r-1}w_{r-1}w_r, where the last term on the right comes from a possible overcounting of terms in the initial expression. The above then implies :x^{\\\\text{T}}Ax \\\\ge 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}V_kw^2_k - \\\\frac{1}{2}V_{r-1}w^2_r\\\\right), which, when combined with the fact that V_{k+1} \\\\le (d-1)V_k for any k, yields :x^{\\\\text{T}}Ax \\\\ge 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{2r}\\\\right)\\\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}V_kw^2_k. The combination of the above results proves the desired inequality. For convenience, define the (r-1)-ball of a vertex v to be the set of vertices with a distance of at most r-1 from v. Notice that the entry of f(v) corresponding to a vertex u is nonzero if and only if u lies in the (r-1)-ball of x. The number of vertices within distance k of a given vertex is at most 1 + d + d(d-1) + d(d-1)^2 + \\\\cdots + d(d-1)^{k-1} = d^k + 1. Therefore, if n \\\\ge d^{2r-1} + 2, then there exist vertices u, v with distance at least 2r. Let x = f(v) and y = f(u). It then follows that x^{\\\\text{T}}y = 0, because there is no vertex that lies in the (r-1)-balls of both x and y. It is also true that x^{\\\\text{T}}Ay = 0, because no vertex in the (r-1)-ball of x can be adjacent to a vertex in the (r-1)-ball of y. Now, there exists some constant c such that z = x - cy satisfies z^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{1} = 0. Then, since x^{\\\\text{T}}y = x^{\\\\text{T}}Ay = 0, :z^{\\\\text{T}}Az = x^{\\\\text{T}}Ax + c^2y^{\\\\text{T}}Ay \\\\ge 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{2r}\\\\right)(x^{\\\\text{T}}x + c^2y^{\\\\text{T}}y) = 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{2r}\\\\right)z^{\\\\text{T}}z. Finally, letting r grow without bound while ensuring that n \\\\ge d^{2r-1} + 2 (this can be done by letting r grow sublogarithmically as a function of n) makes the error term o(1) in n. Second proof (slightly modified statement) This proof will demonstrate a slightly modified result, but it provides better intuition for the source of the number 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}. Rather than showing that \\\\lambda_2 \\\\ge 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} - o(1), we will show that \\\\lambda = \\\\max(\\\\lambda_2, \\\\lambda_n) \\\\ge 2\\\\sqrt{d-1} - o(1).

However, it is also true that the number of closed walks of length 2k starting at a fixed vertex v in a d-regular graph is at least the number of such walks in an infinite d-regular tree, because an infinite d-regular tree can be used to cover the graph. By the definition of the Catalan numbers, this number is at least C_k(d-1)^k, where C_k = \\\\frac{1}{k+1}\\\\binom{2k}{k} is the k^{\\\\text{th}} Catalan number. It follows that :\\\\operatorname{tr}A^{2k} \\\\ge n\\\\frac{1}{k+1}\\\\binom{2k}{k}(d-1)^k :\\\\implies \\\\lambda^{2k} \\\\ge \\\\frac{1}{k+1}\\\\binom{2k}{k}(d-1)^k - \\\\frac{d^{2k}}{n}.

Biography   Early life  Douglas Lapraik was born in London, England on 7 October 1818 to George Rankine Lapraik and his wife, Susan Lapraik (Black). Though born in England, Lapraik's family was of Scottish origin, likely descended from the Lickprivick noble house of East Kilbride in the Shire of Lanark whose main holdings were Lickprivick Castle and, from the reign of Robert III in 1397, Lords of Killbride and owners of the relevant emoluments associated with the lordship. George Rankine Lapraik was originally from Muirkirk, Ayrshire in western Scotland and worked as an expat in London for Scottish trading firm William Mathieson & Company. The couple had five children including John Lapraik (1814-1839), Douglas Lapraik and George Rankin Lapraik. Douglas Lapraik was baptised on 2 March 1819 at the Scotch Church on London Wall in the City of London.  Career   Macao  Lapraik arrived in Macao in 1839 and became apprentice to a Scottish watch and clockmaker named Leonard Just at his company, Just & Son. In 1942, Just sent Lapraik to Hong Kong in order to open a new branch of that company in the newly founded colony.  Hong Kong  View of the main entrance to Douglas Castle at Pok Fu Lam, now University Hall, taken in 2012. Lapraik arrived in the crown colony of Hong Kong in 1842 from Macao, following the cession of Hong Kong to the British Crown in perpetuity after the First Opium War the previous year. Soon after arriving in the colony, Lapraik established himself with his own business as a watchmaker by 1846, apparently concurrently while executing similar duties for Just & Son. Due to his trade in chronometers and watchmaking and given the need in the colony for shipping companies to register a local address, Lapraik soon found himself drafted as a shipping agent. Lapraik became established as a wealthy Hong Kong Taipan during the 1850s and 1860s, taking part in the founding of many of the colony's business ventures and expanding his business interests to many sectors of the colony's economy. Starting in 1855 with its founding, Lapraik served on the committee of the colony's first English language public school, the St. Andrew's School which closed in 1861. In 1858, John Steward Lapraik, the son of Lapraik's eldest brother arrived in Hong Kong to join his uncle's business. Steward Lapraik would go on to later largely inherit his uncle's business empire after Lapraik's death in 1869. In 1861, Lapraik became one of the founders of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce. In 1862, Lapraik made significant contributions to the erection of the Pedder Street Clock Tower. The tower, which stood at the corner of Pedder Street and Queen's Road Central, could be seen from Victoria Harbour and debuted on New Year's Eve 1862, standing until 1913. One of the clock's faces was later incorporated into the Kowloon-Canton Railway Clock Tower at Tsimshatsui. In 1863, after acquiring a shipyard off Queen's Road and building two more at Aberdeen and Whampoa, Lapraik co-founded the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company together with Jardine Matheson & Company and Thomas Sutherland, the Hong Kong agent of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. The company's incorporation was announced in the Hong Kong Daily Press on 4 January 1864. The dockyard would go on to become the largest shipyard in Asia at its zenith. The resulting company also became the first limited company to be registered in Hong Kong, prompting the government to begin work on the Companies Ordinance of 1865. In 1864, Lapraik went on to be appointed as a member of the provisional founders committee of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation which would be founded in 1865. Later in 1864, Lapraik also oversaw the completion of his Gothic style mansion at Pok Fu Lam, dubbed as Douglas Castle and today known as Nazareth House, a university house of the University of Hong Kong. Lapraik leased the 310,227sqft. plot, then known as Rural Building Lot 32 from the government for a period of 75 years in 1861 and had been building his home and base of operations at the castle since that time, though he would not long enjoy its use. Lapraik was also a founding director of the Hongkong, Canton & Macao Steamboat Company which was incorporated as company number 0000002 in the Hong Kong Companies Registry in 1865 when the registry was also first formed. 1865 was also the year that Lapraik began his involvement as a founding Director in the Hongkong Hotel Company together with Englishman Charles Henri Maurice Bosman (father of Ho Fook and Robert Hotung), a Director of the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company and a German, Baron Gustav von Overbeck, the Prussian and Austrian Consul in Hong Kong. The company opened the Hongkong Hotel in 1868 on Pedder Street and Queen's Road, then the first luxury hotel in the city. The hotel group would go on to become the Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Group. Lapraik left Hong Kong and returned to London in mid 1866, apparently due to health issues. In 1855, Lapraik transferred all interest in his watchmaking company, Douglas Lapraik China to his colleague, George Falconer, with whom he had previously apprenticed in his youth at Just & Son. The company was renamed as George Falconer & Company, sold to the Lee Hing Group in 1997.  Death  Lapraik retired and returned to England in 1866 after settling a trust in favor of his longtime Chinese mistress. After returning, married 28 year old Julia Hearn in November 1866. The couple had no children. He died in London in March 1869 without any legitimate heir.  Family and Descendants  The former headquarters of Douglas Lapraik & Company in Taiwan. Lapraik married 28 year old Julia Hearn, a daughter of the lord of Carisbrooke Castle, in November 1866. The couple had no children and Lapraik died in March 1969. After Lapraik's death, his nephew, John Steward Lapraik founded the Douglas Steamship Company in 1883 which continued to run Lapraik's steamer business and which also took up management of other assets owned by Douglas Lapraik & Company. In 1867, Jane Lapraik, Lapraik's niece and sister of John Steward Lapraik was married in Hong Kong to Robert Ellis Baker. John Steward Lapraik continued his uncle's business activities in Hong Kong until his death in 1893, having two children named John Douglas Lapraik (1866) and Thomas Steward Lapraik (1867) who also continued in the business.  Legacy   Law  Between 1856 and 1861, Lapraik together with George Chape brought a suit as plaintiffs against the Respondent, Silas Enoch Burrows, in a suit which traveled from the lower Vice Admiralty Court before finally in 1859, being heard before the High Court of Hong Kong concerning the disputed ownership of the steamer SS Australia. The ship arrived at Hong Kong in around 1852, badly damaged and in need of repairs. Costs of the repairs in question exceeded the actual value of the ship, exacerbated by the debts accrued for wages and expenses owed. Permission for the master to sell the ship would have taken up to four months to obtain from its American owners and there was no available financial options for the ship's master. The circumstances necessitated that the master sell the ship without waiting for the relevant permission to do so. The case helped to develop the concept of agency by necessity in case law as it relates to commercial law which grants the master of the ship the responsibility of acting as agent for the owner of any vessel in the existence of emergency situations, inability to communicate with the principal and provided that such agent is acting in good faith.

It is situated southeast of Hope, south of Mt. Grant, and northwest of Silvertip Mountain. The peak was first climbed in 1950 by J. Butcher, F. Rodgers, and E. Jenkins. The peak was named to honor Canadian Army Private Douglas B. Eaton (1911-1944), from nearby Chilliwack, who was killed in action in World War II. The mountain's name was officially adopted April 7, 1955, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Nearby Eaton Creek and Eaton Lake were named in memory of his younger brother, William, also killed in action a year earlier. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Silverhope Creek, a tributary of the Fraser River. Geology Eaton Peak is related to the Chilliwack batholith, which intruded the region 26 to 29 million years ago after the major orogenic episodes in the region. This is part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, an eroded volcanic belt that formed as a result of subduction of the Farallon Plate starting 29 million years ago.Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North AmericaCatalogue of Canadian volcanoes: Franklin Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences which lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Eaton Peak.

It has been particularly prominent in gold fields in Australia and California in the nineteenth century.Water and Gold: Interpreting the Landscape of Creswick Creek, Peter Davies, Susan Lawrence and Jodi Turnbull, Messmate Press Melbourne 2015 p.64 In the 1840s in California and 1850s in Australia, methods for extracting alluvial gold were developed which involved washing soil and gravel through sluice boxes using diverted streams and other water sources. The waste or tailings were released into the waterways forming large deposits of highly mobile sediment. This 'sludge' as it was generally termed, blocked the stream channels causing flooding and burial of land downstream. The cyanide process also involved releasing sediment contaminated with cyanide, while other sludge deposits have a variety of contaminants used in the mining process. Large areas of land were affected by sludge, particularly in Victoria, where a Royal Commission was established in 1858-9 to investigate and manage the problem.Victoria.

This resulted in a number of regulations and the construction of large stone- lined sludge channels to concentrate and divert the sludge away from settled areas and buildings. the towns of Bendigo, Ballarat, Castlemaine, Creswick and Maryborough have channelized streams running through them as a result. Ultimately hydraulic sluicing was banned in 1904 as a result of the continuing environmental damage caused to waterways in places such as Omeo, and a Sludge Abatement Board was established to regulate and repair the problem..

Biography Personal life Ribbius Peletier was a daughter of cigar manufacturer Gerlacus Ribbius Peletier (1856-1930) and Adriana Louise Wijbelingh (1863-1939). She studied law at the University of Utrecht. Ribbius became president of the Utrecht Female Student Association (1915) and board member of the Dutch Association of Women with Academic Training (1918). She graduated in 1916 and in 1920 she graduated cum laude with professor C.W. Star Busmann. After graduating, Ribbius moved to an Amsterdam guesthouse and started working as a volunteer at the Central Bureau for Social Advice. In 1922 she became a state institution and law teacher and deputy director at the School of Social Work. During her studies she was attracted to anarcho-communism. After a study trip through Great Britain, where she came in contact with the Labor Party, she felt more for social democracy. In 1925 she became a member of the Arbeiders Jeugd Centrale, the youth movement of the Social Democratic Party. Shortly thereafter, she was asked by Mathilde Wibaut to apply as a female secretary to the party board. She succeeded Liede Tilanus as secretary-treasurer of the main board of the Association of Social Democratic Women's Clubs. She ensured an expansion of women's work and committed to training work for working-class women. In 1932, thanks to her father's legacy, she was able to buy land in Bennekom, where she founded the De Born training center for working class women the following year. Political career Ribbius was elected a member of the Provincial States of Noord-Holland (1931-1941, 1946-1958) and appointed as a member of the Senate of the States General (1937-1947). She was a political group spokesperson in the field of justice and social affairs and was responsible for internal affairs. The SDAP was banned by the occupiers during the Second World War. Ribbius kept in touch with the women's clubs at the time, and De Born was able to continue to operate as a private property. After the war, she became a member of the PvdA party council and chairwoman of the women's association. In addition to re-joining the Provincial States, she became a member of the Provincial Executive of Noord-Holland (1946-1958) and was charged with, among other things, healthcare and spatial planning. In 1951 she was a member of the United Nations Commission on the Legal Status of Women. In that year she was named Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. In 1956 she was a UN women's representative and went to the General Assembly of the United Nations to give a speech. In April 1958 she was appointed as the first female member, alongside the Queen, of the Council of State (1958-1966), after which she settled in Scheveningen. At the age of 75, Ribbius resigned as State Council, but she remained involved with De Born. Ribbius-Peletier- Medal The \\"Ribbius-Peletier-Medal\\" will be awarded for five years from 2019 to a woman who has made herself worthy for the position of women in North Holland politics.

It was established in 2017 to accommodate increasing enrollment and relieve overcrowding in the fast-growing area. It is part of the Pasco County Schools district.  History  Cypress Creek Middle High School was established in 2017 in Wesley Chapel, Florida and was built to accommodate increasing enrollment and relieve overcrowding in the fast-growing area. The Pasco County Schools district said it \\"couldn‚Äôt afford to build the new middle school at the same time\\", so the decision was made to open a new facility as a combined middle and high school, intending to construct a separate middle school at a later date. In building the facility, the district sought to alleviate potential concerns from parents by segregating the high school and middle school locker rooms. A screen was also installed in the gymnasium to allow it to be divided for high school and middle school physical education classes. However, high school and middle school students do share bus routes, as was already occurring in other schools in the district. Students from four other high schools were rezoned to attend the new Cypress Creek, and adjustments were made to other boundaries. As a result, middle school-age children in grades 6‚Äì8 share the facilities with high school students, pending the opening of the separate Cypress Creek Middle School in the fall of 2020 on an adjacent campus. Considerable rezoning of school boundaries affecting an estimated 1,000 pupils is expected to result. Thereafter, the school for grades 9‚Äì12 will be known as Cypress Creek High School. Once Cypress Creek Middle School opens, it will have a projected 1,554 students and the high school's enrollment is expected to be 2,080, almost its design capacity of 2,090.  Academics  The school offers Advanced Placement classes, as well as course specialties, termed \\"Academies\\", in such subjects as Criminal Justice, where students are introduced to law, forensics, patrol enforcement, and self-defense techniques. Business courses include information technology, where pupils become proficient in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Upon successful completion and examination, students may qualify for Microsoft Office Specialist certification. STEM courses also form part of the school's elective curriculum. At the school's debut, some students in the highest high school and middle school grades (11th and 8th grades), known as \\"Pack Leaders\\", were trained on leadership and peer counseling and placed into classes in the lower grade levels, to help students in those classes.  Athletics  When the school opened in 2017, its high school had grades 9-11 only, with no seniors on the football team in the first season. It now has a full varsity sports program, including football, soccer, basketball for both boys and girls, track and field, swimming, and baseball. A weight room is part of the facility, alongside the county's only rubberized track; the nickname is the Coyotes.

She was a member of the Amsterdam City Council and was on the national board of the Association of Social Democratic Women's Clubs. Biography Tilanus was born in Amsterdam as the youngest of eight children. With her two brothers and five sisters, she grew up on Herengracht in Amsterdam. She was the daughter of Johanna Victoire Liotard (1831‚Äì1906) and Jan Willem Reinier Tilanus (1823‚Äì1914), professor of surgery at the University of Amsterdam. Tilanus went to a private school and then traveled through Europe. In Sweden she studied homework and crafts (sl√∂jd). On 9 August 1899 she married artist Michel Duco Crop (1863‚Äì1901) in Bloemendaal. They had been married for less than two years when her husband died in a mental institution. On 11 May 1905, she remarried with Jan Eisenloeffel (1876‚Äì1957). She continued to use her own name. Not long after the death of her first husband, Tilanus became a member of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. Together with Mathilde Wibaut, Carry Pothuis-Smit and Henri√´tte van der Mey, among others, she founded the Amsterdam Women's Club in 1905, later the Association of Social Democratic Women's Clubs (BSDVC). Tilanus became secretary of the union and pleaded for a women's section in Het Volk in 1913, but that proved in vain. From 1914 she became involved in the women's suffrage movement. From 1919 to 1935 Tilanus was a member of the Amsterdam City Council. She was on the council committee for public health assistance and worked for more practical homes, Montessori education, the introduction of consultations for infants and female inspectors in the vice police. In her last months as a municipal councilor, she prevented men from officially taking precedence over women in municipal vacancies. Until 1940 she continued to edit - together with Mathilde Wibaut - Ons Kinderblaadje, an appendix to the social-democratic women's magazine De Proletarische Vrouw. The last years of her life she was bedridden. She died in Zeist on March 31, 1953, after which Het Vrije Volk praised her work for the socialist education of Dutch working class women.

They were the holders of both the League Cup and the FAI Cup, having achieved their first domestic cup double. In the process, they had qualified for the Cup Winners' Cup. 1981‚Äì82 was Jim McLaughlin's eighth season as manager, and was Dundalk's 56th consecutive season in the top tier of Irish football. Season summary The new season opened with the President's Cup, and Dundalk defeated Athlone 4‚Äì3 on aggregate to win it for the third season in a row. But the League Cup was surrendered in the first round, when County Louth neighbours Drogheda United defeated them on penalties. Later that season, they lost the Leinster Senior Cup final. The League schedule commenced on 10 September 1981, using a trial point system of 4 for an away win, 3 for a home win, 2 for an away draw, and 1 for a home draw. Dundalk started with five victories but, after they drew Tottenham Hotspur in the Second round of the Cup Winners' Cup, there was a wobble in League form with all eyes at Oriel Park on the upcoming glamour tie. They fell 10-points behind Bohemians, but subsequently charged to the title, sealing it on the final day away to defending champions Athlone. But it was Bohemians that came out of a four match, seven and a half hour FAI Cup semi-final marathon, depriving McLaughlin of a shot at a second League and Cup Double. As FAI Cup holders from the season before, they qualified for the 1981‚Äì82 European Cup Winners' Cup. In the first round they drew Fram, and won through 5‚Äì2 on aggregate, with what remains their record victory in Europe ‚Äì a 4‚Äì0 win in Oriel Park. In the second round, McLaughlin's unbeaten record in Europe at Oriel reached eight matches, when Tottenham Hotspur were held to a 1‚Äì1 draw. A 1‚Äì0 defeat in White Hart Lane ultimately ended their interest in the competition.

Pavle's father Hristofor and mother Jevrosima were all born in the Pomorisje region, better known as krajina. Pavle Kengelac studied at the Evangelical Lyceum in Bratislava and Ke≈æmarok where his professors were philosophers and scholars J√°n Juraj Streƒçko,mathematician and physicist Stefan Sabeland historian Stefan Fabri. That Protestant school nurtured religious tolerance and offered a broad cameralist education as well the study of Latin, German, Hungarian and Slaveno-Serbian (Russian Slavonic) languages, grammar, rhetorics, mathematics, physics, natural science, geography, history, and philosophy. In 1790 Kengelac enrolled at the theological seminary in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra (later called Saint Petersburg Theological Academy) and from there went to the University of Halle where his teachers included August Hermann Niemeyer, Johann Salomo Semler, Friedrich Albrecht Carl Gren, Johann August Nosselt and Johann Augustus Eberhard.He was awarded the doctor of laws at the inauguration ceremonies in 1794, together with a sword as a gift from Frederick William III of Prussia. He returned to his homeland and opened a law practice. It was a time when there were a few vociferous folks on both sides such as Vuk Karad≈æiƒá advocating a purely popular language and Pavle Kengelac favoring a complete acceptance of Slavonic-Serbian, then in literary use, and those in the middle who sought to \\"reform\\", though in a compromising manner.Kengelac was a composite of Hungarian Serbian merchant, intellectual with an international education (Germany and Russia) in natural science, law, theology, and astronomy. He became an Archimandrite later in life. After Kengelac wrote about Astronomy in \\"Estestvoslovie\\" (Natural History; Buda, 1811), poet Eustahija Arsiƒá dedicated a part of her Poleznaya Razmislyenye o cetirih Godisnih Vremeneh (Useful Reflections on the Four Seasons) to Astronomy. Geographical investigations in the territory of Vojvodina had a rather early start. Among the first concerned with her geography may be noticed Pavle Kengelac, a natural scientist and historian, who studied abroad. His main work Estestvoslovie contains many valuable elements of interest for the scientific geographical field. One of the few intellectuals of his day, the Serbian Archimandrite of the Sveti ƒêuraƒë monastery, then part of the Habsburg Empire, Pavle Kengelac, adhered to the ideology of enlightenment and deism as the prevailing philosophy of the 18th century. It is known that the aim of this philosophy was to reconcile contemporary scientific achievements with the official theology. This movement resulted from the intensive study of nature and its phenomena, so it included a broad circle of scientists of that time and acquired a very broad range of followers. Archimandrite Kengelac expressed his adherence to this movement in his work Jestestvoslovije (Natural History) published in Buda in 1811. Kengelac's work faced resistance in the top circles of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci, including the Metropolitan himself, Stefan Stratimiroviƒá. One of the many reasons for that was insidiousness and personal animosity of the mentioned Metropolitan towards the man who wanted 'to be recognized'; even more important reasons were the activities of the conservative top circles of the Austrian state administration and of the Vienna Court itself, as well as the Metropolitan Stratimiroviƒá's fear to arouse anger in these circles and fall into disgrace himself. Works Kengelac is best known for his Estestvoslovie (Buda, 1811)and Vsemirnago sbytijaslovija: cast' pervija (Buda, 1821). He also wrote many pamphlets and articles in newspapers.

April 2019, Seite 7  Life  Hetzer was born as the daughter of the entrepreneur Siegfried Hetzer, who had founded a Victoria (motorcycle) dealership in Berlin in 1919 and had been operating an Opel car dealership since 1933. From 1954 she learned the profession of automotive mechanics in the family business. After an attempt to become self-employed at age 21, she worked again in her father's business. At the age of 31, Hetzer took over the company based in Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1969 after the death of her three- year-older sister and her father, which made her one of the largest car dealerships in Berlin and managed until 2012. Since neither her daughter nor son wanted to continue the business, she sold the company.Viva!, Heft 3/2015, S. 7. As one of the few successful female entrepreneurs in her industry and as a racing driver, but also through her social commitment, Hetzer was one of the best known personalities in Berlin's economy. The high media presence through newspaper reports, interviews and talk show appearances also made Berlin beyond the point that she was widely in the spotlight. Hetzer had a daughter and a son and lived in Charlottenburg. On 21 April 2019 she was found dead in her apartment at the age of 81 years.

Januar 2007  Scandal about racist utterance  In the ZDF Morgenmagazin on March 13, 2017, Hetzer spoke racially about black people. The subject of her trip around the world, during which she was repeatedly robbed by dark-skinned South Africans: On March 14, 2017, she apologized in an interview with B.Z.: \\"That was a mistake. I apologize for this statement. How can I make amends? \\". Her statement refers to a surveillance video in which four dark-skinned South Africans stole their navigation system from the locked vintage car. Furthermore, in Cape Town the golden Berlin bear had been ripped off her neck by a black man and her car was completely vacated in St. Lucia. The presenter of the morning magazine, Jana Pareigis, also commented on Facebook on the incident and condemned the statements as false, racially stereotyped and hurtful. However, she hopes that the interview will at least lead to racist prejudice being discussed.

Content Ethnic Identity and the State in Iran examines the position of ethnic minorities in Iran and their impact on the country's politics, security discourses, and wider societal trends. The book uses a framework that combines work by the Copenhagen School of Security Studies and the literature on ethnic conflict to provide insights into the identity and sense of discrimination and deprivation felt by the major ethnic groups of Iran, namely: the Azeris, Kurds, Arabs, Baluchis, and Turkmen. In so doing, the book uses political science methodologies to explore the roots of Iran's current political and societal issues‚Äînot just those that affect the minorities but those that directly impact wider political decision-making and public life at every level of society. Reception The book has already received positive reviews in the Middle East Journal, Review of Middle East Studies, the British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, and Nations and Nationalism.

This plant has six dark red/purple flowers and has tiny white, silky villose hairs. Pulsatilla cernua flowers from April to May, and then the seeds ripen from May to June. P. cernua is insect pollinated. This plant has both male and female parts, which means it is a hermaphrodite. Most parts of this plant are not edible, except for the roots and leaves. __TOC__  Taxonomy  Pulsatilla cernua is a member of the family Ranunculaceae, the buttercup family. This family consists mainly of herbs, a few aquatics, and some vines or shrubs. The genus Pulsatilla has 33 herbaceous perennial species that grow in meadows and prairies in Asia, Europe, and North America. Pulsatilla is derived from ‚Äúpasakh‚Äù, which is the Hebrew word for Passover.  Habitat  Pulsatilla cernua is native Eastern Asia including Korea, Japan, north-east China, and parts of far-east Russia. This plant is commonly found in the low mountains of Japan as well as grassy slopes in the northern parts of China. Pulsatilla cernua prefers moist soil, which is why it is found in lower parts of the mountains or on slopes. The soil must also be sandy and loamy and be well drained, or else the Pulsatilla cernua will not live and grow. Pulsatilla cernua can also grow in acidic, basic, or neutral soil. It can even manage to grow in very alkaline soils. This plant also cannot grow in shady areas, and it must be in a position where it is almost always in the sun's light.

They are obligate anaerobes first isolated from human feces in the 1980s. Prior to their discovery, they were known as the 3452A DNA homology group. The type strain is now identified as ATCC 43185. Cell morphology and physiology Bacteroides caccae is a saccharolytic anaerobic, nonmotile Gram- negative bacteria. They have a DNA GC content of 40-46 mol %. Growth occurs at human temperature (37 ¬∞C) under anaerobic conditions. There is no growth at 25 ¬∞C or 45 ¬∞C. Its cell shapes are rods that are 1.4-1.6 by 2.5-12 ¬µm in size. The rods are found in single cells or in pairs. In a broth culture mixed with a fermentable carbohydrate, the cells will appear vacuolated or beaded. The surface colonies of cells grown on BHI blood agar plates following 48 hours of incubation show a circular cell of 0.5‚Äì1 mm in diameter. In addition, colonies are convex, gray, translucent, shiny, and smooth. Growth on rabbit blood shows slight hemolysis. In glucose broth, the cultures appear turbid with a smooth sediment and a final pH range of 5 ‚Äì 5.2. The type strain reduces neutral red but does not produce hydrogen sulfide. Growth on peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth cultures with 20% bile yields vast amounts of acetate and succinate but minor amounts of propionate and isovalerate. Lactate and threonine are not used by the type strain. B. caccae produces a trace amount of (0.1%) of hydrogen. They hydrolyze esculin, weakly digest gelatin, and are susceptible to chloramphenicol and clindamycin, but not susceptible to penicillin G and tetracycline. Pathogenicity For the onset of intestinal bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) or Ulcerative colitis (UC), commensal enteric bacteria are generally required as a pathogenic factor. B. caccae contains a TonB-linked outer membrane protein called OmpW that has only been characterized in this particular strain. The OmpW protein contains features similar to a bacterial TonB-linked outer membrane protein which allows the bacteria to increase its ability of iron or vitamin uptake in an environment where it lacks these variables. The TonB-linked outer membrane protein contains a TonB box that is highly conserved and also present in OmpW. OmpW may play a role in facilitating the organism's ability to uptake substrates that are important for commensal bacterial survival in the intestine. The immunological finding of OmpW is an elevation of anti-OmpW IgA levels in some patients with Crohn's disease in comparison to these IgA levels in patients with ulcerative colitis or healthy subjects. More remains to be elucidated on its potential pathogenicity with regards to OmpW. In addition, B. caccae has also been found in cultures from infections in the appendix and the abdomen (peritoneal) Metabolism Bacteroides caccae was specified as being a fiber-degrading microbial specialist in the microbiomes of Western individuals. In a study geared at determining the fermentation of pectin in B. caccae from a rabbit cecum, it was determined that cultures grown with pectin produced more acetate than formate, lactate, fumarate, and succinate as opposed to those cultures grown on glucose which yielded vast amounts of lactate. This elucidates the metabolism of a plant fiber by a human commensal. In addition, B. caccae showed no growth on arabinan (a pectin), arabinoxylan (wheat), xylan, xyloglucan, glucomannan, galactomannan, B-glucan, lichenin, and laminarin. They do grow on host-derived glycans like neutral mucin O-glycans, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. The monosaccharides that induce growth are arabinose, fructose, fucose, galactose, galacturonic acid, glucose, glucuronic acid, glucosamine, mannose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylneuraminic acid, rhamnose, ribose, and xylose References Category:Bacteroidetes Category:Gram-negative bacteria ","title":"Bacteroides caccae"},{"id":"62480965","text":"Marie Louise [Mascha] Oettli (11 June 1908 ‚Äì 27 April 1997) was a Swiss socialist and trade unionist, engaged in feminist struggles. Biography Mascha Oettli was born and raised in a cultivated and open intellectual milieu. Her father, Max Oettli, was educated at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where he graduated as a \\"master\\" in natural sciences in 1902, and then completed his doctorate at the University of Zurich. He was a teacher at the Landerziehungsheim Glarisegg near Steckborn, where Mascha was born and spent her childhood. Her mother, Natalie (Tata) Oettli- Kirpitschnikowa (1875-1966), the daughter of a well-known Russian teacher, had first been a teacher in Russia before coming to Switzerland to study medicine; she was a school doctor at the Glarisegg. Her parents were married in 1905 and had 6 children. In 1921, the family settled near Lausanne in Vers-chez-les- Blanc, and Mascha attended the Lausanne gymnasium. From high school, she became interested in politics and became a member of a school-aged youth movement where she became acquainted with the future Social Democrats Eugen Steinemann and Ruedi Sch√ºmperli. She studied medicine and natural sciences. She then heard about the \\"Walkem√ºhle\\" school in Melsungen run by the German pedagogue and socialist Minna Specht based on the philosopher Leonard Nelson's pedagogical conceptions. She took economics courses and acquired the \\"socialist tools\\" and remained there for three years. During her stay in Germany, she was denounced for acts of resistance to Nazism. Her struggle against Nazism with her German comrades from 1933 to 1934 was followed on her return to Switzerland from her membership of the Socialist Party of Switzerland. She is then editor of the newspapers of the public services union and the federation of trade, transport and food. She is secretary of the Union of Swiss Peasants from 1942 to 1947 and central secretary of the Socialist Party and Swiss Socialist Women from 1952 to 1970. She is in charge of agricultural policy. It is committed to women's right to vote and equal pay. Following a four-week trip to India, Mascha Oettli collected money from Socialist party women's groups for a school in Calcutta. For several years, she also managed the Al Forno holiday and education center in Ticino. The creation of this center was due to two former students of the Walkm√ºhle school (founded in 1922) and Mascha Oettli had chosen to be a student for his training: the couple Ren√© and Hanna Bertholet from Geneva had organized to give courses of political and educational formation. She subsequently acquired a solid legal basis which enabled the foundation on 29 May 1944 of the \\"Al Forno holiday center\\", of which Mascha Oettli was from the beginning the president and the person in charge. During and after the Second World War, the center also housed German political refugees. In 1983, Macha Oettli moved from the city of Zurich to Bolligen.

Biography  Cohn was born in New York City to Goodman Cohn and Jennie Nathan. His parents were Jewish immigrants. He married Anna Messing in Brooklyn in 1916. He began working as a film editor in the early 1910s, although like most editors of that era, he was not credited onscreen for his efforts. Eventually the family moved from New York City to Los Angeles, where he continued his career. He was a founding member of the Society of Motion Picture Film Editors (a precursor to the Motion Picture Editors Guild) in 1937; early on, he served as treasurer. In the 1930s, he began working as a producer on projects, although editing seems to have continued to be his primary focus. During this time, he was credited with pioneering the \\"change-over,\\" a technique that allowed projectionists to keep a film running without stopping to change reels. He died in 1953 in Hollywood, where he had lived for 28 years. He was survived by his wife, Anna, and his son, Quinn Martin (who later became a famous TV producer). His brother Elias worked in Hollywood as a cameraman.

The elderly population includes those aged 65 or older in the entire population. According to Article 3 no.1 of the Framework Act on Low Birthrate of an Aging Society, the term \\"aging population\\" refers to the increasing proportion of elderly people in the entire population, i.e, aging. South Korea population pyramid 1960-2020 Aging is often caused by the dramatic improvement of living standards derived from the development of science and medicine, increasing the life expectancy of the average individual; however, aging is also greatly affected by the decrease in birth rates. In 2045, Korea will become the world's most aged population, with a great portion of the population becoming aged 65 or older. With its entrance as an aged society in 2017, South Korea will see its aging population reach the fastest pace in the world, with the proportion of people aged 65 or older soaring to an unprecedented 47 percent in 2067. On the other hand, the working age population is expected to decrease below the elderly population, and Korea's total health and welfare spending will soar to 120.2 in 2067 and 102.4 in old age. According to the World and Korea Population Forecast released by the National Statistical Office, Korea's population aged 65 or older will reach 37.0 percent in 2045, surpassing Japan's 36.7 percent. The report is based on a comparative analysis of the U.N.'s World Population Outlook for 201 countries and the National Statistical Office's special estimate of the future population between 1967 and 2017. South Korea's portion of the elderly population is projected to grow at the fastest pace in the world from 14.9 percent in 2019 to 46.5 percent in 2067.  Causes  The main cause is low fertility. Decreased fertility rates are manifested in ways such as decreased marriage rates, early marriages, and increased ages. As a result of the decrease in the marriage rate and the avoidance of multiple children, the existing research mainly suggests economic factors such as income, labor market conditions, socio-cultural factors including the changes in the values of education and gender roles, and policy factors of family and health policy. Fertility Unlike in countries in Europe where fertility rates naturally fell below the level of population replacement due to industrialization and socio-cultural factors, Korea's birthrates fell sharply due to birth control policies. In the early stages of industrialization, the decline in potential fertility was involved in raising the per capita income level by suppressing rapid population growth and achieving rapid economic growth. As a result, the decline in population is likely to be greater than in other developed economies during the period of natural decline after industrialization. Korea's birth control policy began in the 1960s and ended in the mid-1990s when birth rates fell significantly below the level of population replacement. As a result, Korea's fertility rate has declined to about half from the end of the 1970s to about 1.5 at the end of the 1980s. In the 2000s, when low birth rates began to become a problem, the government turned to the population policy, but the birth rate has declined at a more rapid rate than any other country, as the birth rate of advanced countries has declined as well as the exogenous birth rate. On the other hand, Korea has a tendency to increase the proportion of adult males compared to other countries except for the Korean War during the 1950s, according to the traditional preferences of South Korea. In developed countries, high-income countries, or Japan, where sex ratios are not much greater than in Korea, the rate of birthrates slowed more slowly. This suggests that if the hysteresis effect of South Korean preference is gradually weakened and the gender ratio of male and female generations in the future is restored to balance, the negative effect on the falling birth rate may be offset.  Costs  As mentioned above, the housing price increase rate is an indicator used in the analysis of marriage or parenting costs in Korea. In general, it is recognized that the increase in housing prices affects coma costs or parenting costs. Statistically, the housing price increase rate in Korea and the marriage rate and fertility rate are negatively correlated. As housing prices rise, the number of marriages or fertility rates drop significantly.  Environment  As such, marriage costs and child- rearing costs add to the burden on marriage and indirectly affect fertility rates. In addition to the cost of marriage, analysis of the points that unmarried men and women pointed out as necessary for marriage policy revealed that the factors that make marriage difficult are youth unemployment, the disadvantages of marriage, workplace weddings, and long hours of work practices.  Effects  The biggest problem that happens when South Korea becomes older is that the satisfaction level of the lives of the elderly has become lower. The main reason for this is that the elderly have a weak economic base to lead basic lives. South Korea's poverty rate for senior citizens is serious among advanced countries, but the country has so far failed to properly prepare for the aging population. The government has sought to support senior citizens by providing temporary and direct support to address poverty among the elderly. There is a limit to how old people cannot live in a way that is consistent and contributes to society. It can be said that the problem of the exclusion of the elderly from the labor market is difficult to solve only through social respect and support for the elderly that has been carried out in the past.  Productive age population  While the number of elderly people is increasing, the total cost of raising the number of young children and the elderly to support every 100 people in Korea's production age is expected to soar from 37.6 in 2019 to 120.2 in 2067, the figure is expected to rise to the highest level in the world. In particular, the number of people aged 65 or older who will be supported for every 100 people in the productive age group will surge five-fold from 20.4 in 2019 to 102.4 in 2067. South Korea's best growth is expected to pick up around the world outlook also exceeded 100 costs and keep old age. In the same period, the world's total maintenance is only to 2019, up from 53.2 million to 62.0, 2067 Old age support ratio is 2019 from 14.0 2067, rose to 30.2. Shot up from 43.7 years old in 2020 is our country by median age of 62.2 years old, 2065. By median age is age to list in the order of the total population means a person's age in the center. 1.2 years old from Europe (42.5 years), a high level until next year, but it is by median age of our country, 14.6 years old will be higher than Europe (Also, 47.5 years old) in 2065. By the median age of the world's population was 30.9 years old in 2020 from 38.2 years old will rise by 2065.  Economic  People have different economic needs and different degrees of contribution to the economy at each stage of their lives. In general, people do not have income activities in their childhood, but they do not have access to learning activities under the care of their parents. Focus on production and generate income until you retire from youth saving money for the future, living based on assets accumulated in the youth and the old age.  Government policies  South Korea's aging society measures include strengthening the income security system for stable retirement, expanding the conditions for improving the quality of life of the elderly, seeking ways to utilize the manpower against the reduction of the available population, and taking the leap to an aging- friendly economy.  Strengthening income security system for stable retirement  As the average life expectancy grows older, the problem of poverty may intensify. Accordingly, the 3rd Basic Plan intends to strengthen the public and private retirement income security system. To relieve blind spots in public pensions, the government will expand women's pension entitlements and increase their participation in national pensions such as one-time and part-time special employment. The plan is to establish a one- person national pension system. The plan is to increase membership by easing the requirements for housing pension and farmland pension. We will improve the financial system in preparation for long-term risks due to the safety assets of the elderly and expand the retirement preparation services so that they can prepare for their own retirement.  Expanding conditions that can improve the quality of life of the elderly  To improve the quality of life of the elderly, we will expand the conditions to improve the quality of life for the elderly. This includes efforts to create a safe living environment. Specifically, the process includes vitalizing the health mileage system, strengthening chronic disease management, expanding comprehensive nursing care and nursing services, strengthening long-term care insurance system quality management, and reinforcing hospice palliative care services. We will support the health of the elderly by supporting them. The company plans to support active retirement by expanding social participation opportunities such as developing leisure culture tailored to the elderly and expanding participation in volunteer support. We will create a safe living environment by expanding rental housing for the elderly, mandatory safety training for senior drivers, and reducing traffic accidents for elderly pedestrians through the establishment of elderly protection zones.  Manpower utilization plan compared to the reduction of productive population  As the decrease in the number of people available for production began in earnest in 2016, we are devising measures to utilize women, middle-aged and foreign workers. Women's employment will be activated by diversifying the form of work such as part- time work and strengthening the reemployment support system for career- breaking women. We will strengthen the working base of middle-aged and older workers by spreading the wage peak system to establish the 60-year-old retirement age system and mandatory life support service. In order to expand the recruitment of overseas talented individuals, especially in areas where there is a shortage of domestic specialists, we will provide opportunities for long-term employment and settlement, and establish a mid- to long-term immigration policy to utilize foreign workers.  Leap to an Age-Friendly Economy  As the elderly population grows, active efforts for the aged- friendly industry are needed. Therefore, the 3rd basic plan aims to foster the industrial sectors such as medical care, tourism, and food related to the elderly, and to support the development of universal design and user-oriented elderly-friendly products. Meanwhile, in order to cope with the reduction of school age population due to low birth rate, we will promote university structural reform, teacher training, and reschedule supply and demand plan. Let's race. In order to cope with the declining population in rural areas due to aging and urbanization, the government also proposes measures to revitalize return-to-home villages. Finally, it plans to reform the national pension system and stabilize the income base of health insurance to manage the financial risk of social insurance. The government will also plan to reform special occupational pension plans. For the efficient use of national finance, the government proposes measures to reorganize quasi-duplicate financial projects, expand revenue bases, and manage mid- to long-term financial risks.

Early life  Alban Lynch was born in Queensland in 1930. He attended the Christian Brothers College, St Patricks, Strathfield. He worked as an industrial chemist between 1947 and 1953 while studying his Diploma of Chemical Engineering part time through the Sydney Technical College.  Career  After completing his diploma Lynch worked as a metallurgist with the Zinc Corporation of Broken Hill from 1954 to 1958. Here he worked with Maurice Mawby. He studied a BSc externally from the University of New South Wales graduating in 1956. He took his PhD from the University of Queensland in 1965 and a DSc from the University of New South Wales in 1975. Lynch joined the staff of the University of Queensland‚Äôs Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering as a Research Officer in 1958. He began work on an Australian Mineral Industries Research Association (AMIRA) project on grinding in 1962. This was conducted at Mount Isa Mines (MIM) using circuits in its old concentrator to conduct their experiments. James Foots, the General Manager of Mount Isa Mines supported the project during this time. This project continues at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) and other universities.  Establishment of the JKMRC  In 1971, Mount Isa Mines established the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre at the site of the former Indooroopilly Silver Mine in Brisbane, Queensland owned by the University of Queensland. Lynch was founding director and continued in the role until 1989. He pioneered the early use of computers to produce comminution and classification models which used operational plant data. This enabled simulation modelling of crushers, grinding mills, hydrocyclones and flotation. He pursued field blasting research, which has improved practice and measurement internationally. His network of industry and academic colleagues led to fieldwork opportunities for students and he supervised over 30 doctoral students during his time as director. Lynch was Head of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering at the University from 1988 until his retirement in 1993. He continued to lecture on modelling and establishing research programmes in countries such as Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico and Turkey.

The term ‚Äúdaoye‚Äù, combining Chinese words dao (speculation) and ye (a respectful title for a male), is Beijing slang for profiteering and speculation and was especially common in Beijing at the time. In English, ‚Äúprofiteer‚Äù is a pejorative term for those who reap excessive profits by charging exorbitant prices for goods. In Chinese, however, ‚Äúdaoye‚Äù is more ambiguous. On the one hand, the term disparages the people engaged in this activity as parasites for exploiting state assets. And, on the other, the term regard such people as harbingers of China‚Äôs first post-revolutionary wealthy class.  Overview  Daoye is a side effect of the distinctive pattern the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) adopted to implement economic reform: dual-track system (shuangguizhi ÂèåËΩ®Âà∂) , in which a traditional plan and a market channel coexisted for the allocation of a given good, as a transitional device. Before its formal operation in 1985, resource allocation in China was done mostly under the plan via the planning bureaucracy. In the early 1980s, the Chinese government relaxed bureaucratic control over resource allocation by allowing State-owned Enterprises (SOE) to produce and sell above-plan output at the market. Rather than dismantling the plan immediately, reformers guaranteed a long-run dynamic process that would gradually increase the share of non-plan, market transactions in the economy and made the dual-track system into an unabashed transitional device. This approach had obvious advantages, including the opening up of opportunities for the development of the private sector, while avoiding a ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù reform, that is, sudden transformation to marketization that was attempted in Eastern Europe and Russia. Nonetheless, the uneasy coexistence of disparate elements of old (centrally planned) and new (market oriented) economic institutions and policies induce contradictions and weaknesses, all of which generated a skewing of opportunities for daoye to capture windfall profits by engaging such activities as speculation, profiteering, bribery and corruption. Daoye took enormous forms of behavior associated with attempts to make profit in the dual-track environment. Some are entirely innocent and even conducive, for they alleviated the shortage of some products and increased the market transactions in the dual-track system. Much behavior represents a kind of mild corruption, with private traders‚Äô buying goods at the fixed state price, usually through their connection to official employees, and reselling at a market price. And some are profiteer of government officials and their relatives, demanding from bribes and extortion in exchange for massive deals. These government officials collaborating with businessmen in price speculation are also known as ‚Äúofficial profiteer‚Äù guandaoÂÆòÂÄí. In many cases, the above three categories of profiteer are interwoven. It is noteworthy that profiteer is not technically illegal unless it involves committing a crime. For example, profiteering exists when companies manipulate their prices, or when those in positions of authority abuse their powers. In China, however, under the criminal law in 1979, daoye would be put in prison as long as they increase prices when there is a supply shortage. For example, a daoye would be considered guilty if he transported clothes from Guangdong Province to northern cities and resold at high prices. This ‚Äúspeculation crime‚Äù was not abolished until 1997. Daoye phenomenon has been the subject of much controversy, reflecting a call to account for success and failure of China‚Äôs first decade reform. Using techniques of questionable legality, these men and women, many of whom had been political prisoners during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 70s, wrote an important chapter in China‚Äôs economic and political history following Beijing's decision in 1978 to loosen its reins on the economy. For the most part, daoye exploited loopholes in the transitional system to turn huge profits. But regardless of their machinations, it is the labor and hustle‚Äîand sometimes sleaze‚Äîof these businessmen, that accelerated the country‚Äôs economic transformation in the 1980s and 1990s. They started a process that has proved to be unstoppable. In this sense, they played an important role.  Background  Daoye is a side effect of the dual-track (shuangguizhi ÂèåËΩ®Âà∂), in which the command economy and the market economy co-existed, as a transition strategy during the initial phase of economic reform. China‚Äôs pre-reform economy, particularly with regard to heavy industrial development, rather closely followed the model of Soviet Union style command planning. After the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC) was established in October 1949, the CCP gave overwhelming priority to channeling the maximum feasible investment into heavy industry. To achieve this goal, a command economic system was adopted, by which production and allocation were placed in the hands of state ‚Äúcommand‚Äù and ‚Äúplan‚Äù rather than left up to market forces. Planners controlled a large volume of resources in the economy, particularly the scarcest and most vital inputs, and controlled the flow of those resources from producer to consumer through the process of price settings. On the whole, therefore, the signals upon which economic actors based in this type of economy came from bureaucratic commands rather than market-responsive prices. The command economy was an effective way to subordinate individual economic decision-making to the overall national development strategy of building China into industrial power. But the substantial distortion in the price system and in resource allocation made the economy unable to realize the scale of economy and general equilibrium. On the eve of economic reform, there is substantial evidence suggesting that China‚Äôs command economy was performing relatively poorly, which made China continuously sought a workable set of principles for decentralization. Rather than dismantling the plan immediately, reformers guaranteed a long-run dynamic process that would gradually increase the share of non-plan, market transactions in the economy and made the dual-track system into an unabashed transitional device. This approach had obvious advantages, including the opening up of opportunities for the development of the private sector, while avoiding a ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù reform, that is, sudden transformation to marketization that was attempted in Eastern Europe and Russia. Nonetheless, the uneasy coexistence of disparate elements of old (centrally planned) and new (market oriented) economic institutions and policies induce contradictions and weaknesses, that is, price differences between plan and market, supply scarcity, institutional and administrative disorder, all of which generated a skewing of opportunities for daoye to capture windfall profits.  Dual-track Price  Short after the third Plenary Session of the Eleventh CCP Central Committee held in December 1978, the Chinese government relaxed bureaucratic control over resource allocation. The July 1979 State Council allowed SOEs to sell above-plan products, giving birth to the second track ‚Äì that is, the market ‚Äì for the circulation and pricing of enterprise output. At first, the market for goods that were subject to negotiated pricing was small and it did not have much influence. In January and February 1985, official recognition caught up with concrete reality, and enterprises were formally given the right to transact outside plan goods at market determined prices. With this decision, the dual-track system was fully in place and given clear legitimacy for the first time. In so doing, the government gave explicit definition to two separate spheres of economic activity, each marked by its own characteristic means of regulation. The planned sector, with compulsory deliveries at state fixed prices, was to persist but its scope was clearly delineated and fixed in absolute terms. The market sector, with freely determined prices, was to cover the remainder of the economy, and was to grow steadily as the economy grew. Markets for outside-plan products then developed rapidly in China in parallel to the existing plan. Because nearly every good has more than one price, illicit income can be made merely by transforming the status of a good. Anyone who can purchase a good at the low, state-set price and then sell at the higher market price derives substantial profit. For example, during the mid-1980s, a standard medium-weight truck sold for a plan price of 20,000 RMB, and a market price around 35,000 RMB. Illicit sale of a single truck in high demand by emerging peasant entrepreneurs would yield a profit of 15,000 RMB, about fifteen times the average annual urban wage. Distortions are large relative to money incomes, so temptations are great.  Supply Scarcity  The tension between overall social demand and supply is another critical reason for daoye. In the early 1980s, private operators still depended mainly on state supply organs for the bulk of producer goods and consumer goods. The state wholesalers often discriminated against private buyers. This was attributed in press report to the state units‚Äô inadequate grasp of the importance of the private economy or lingering leftist attitudes (i.e., conservatives‚Äô opposition to the policy of encouraging private business) and to feelings of solidarity with state retailers threatened by private competition. The methods used against private business also indicate that in some cases state wholesalers discouraged individual buyers because their small orders were less convenient to handle than those of the larger state and collective buyers. Even if a series of reforms in marketing worked to reduce the importance of state distribution agencies and to widen the supply avenues open to private business, private operators continued to be disadvantaged, though in another way, when obtaining supplies. These markets, authorized in 1984 to sell above-plan supplies, obviously operated in what are essentially sellers‚Äô markets. For example, in Hubei in 1983, over 95% of the goods sold by private retailers were bought from state commercial outlets and supply and marketing cooperatives. By 1987 this had fallen to 48.5%. Until around 1984, private sectors usually complained of outright refusal to sell them popular goods. In later years such complaint continued to appear, but they began to be far outnumbered by complaints that wholesalers took advantage of a seller‚Äôs market by charging high prices or demanding bribes and favors. Such was the nature of this supply system, however, with its uneasy mesh of planned and market distribution, inadequate distribution arrangements and pressing demand, that the opportunities for profiteering, were immense. To private businesses this meant that high-demand goods could be obtain ‚Äì but at a price. Continuing material shortage is further exacerbated by rapid economic growth. Since 1984, China‚Äôs economic development had been overheated with the scale of investment increasing year by year and the excessive growth in consumption funds. The high-speed economic growth, with GNP accelerated to a remarkable 11.5% annual rate between 1983 and 1988 , developed into a situation of double inflation of both vestment demand and consumption demand. For four consecutive years, social demand had exceeded social supply, with the supply-demand difference ratio being expanding from 4.7% in 1983 to 13.6% in 1987.  Institutional and Administrative Disorder  When the reform was first introduced, China had just emerged from several decades of political turmoil. In the difficult and unprecedented transformation from a command economy to the vaguely conceived ‚Äúsocialist market economy‚Äù, this process was indeed facing a vast vacuum. Since the economic management system was in a transitional stage, the boundary between market regulation and administrative regulation was blurring. More there was a lack of supervision over administrative powers. Without the various institutional arrangements and supervisions under the dual-track system, a number of problems, including speculation, operating without a license, earning exorbitant profit, and manufacturing and selling counterfeit and fake commodities, had arisen that both demanded and defied solution. As early as 1983 the central government had frequently issuance of bulletins bemoaning its inability to carry through with national construction projects. The crux of the problem reportedly lies in the state‚Äôs loss of control over raw material. In addition, a pattern of policy oscillation marked through the implementation of dual-track system, these policies shifted in ways that were unpredicted and disruptive to the economy. By mid-1980s, the disorder in the economy had become rather serious, particularly in terms of circulation, i.e. excessive social demand, excessive industrial development speed, excessive issue of credit and currency, excessive price increase and disorder in the economy. The situation was called the ‚Äúfour excessive and one disorder‚Äù (siguo yiluan ÂõõËøá‰∏Ä‰π±).  Development   1979-1985: The Rise of Daoye  Most daoye started up their businesses by buying up goods in short supply, such as famous-brand wines and cigarettes, grain, fertilizer, televisions, even special-issue postage stamps, for resale at high price. Many of these goods were transported from southern and coastal cities, where free market was more developed and commodities were in relatively ample supply, to the northern provinces and hinterland. In Chengdu, for example, there was a regular cigarette market on the banks of the Jin River, where private vendors could buy top-brand cigarette at about twice as the state retail price. In August 1987, this market was reported as handling two thousand cartons each day; one year later it was still going strong, and several private vendors said they always got their top-brand cigarettes there. Under the dual-track price structure, the ability to obtain official quotas is the key to pocket the price differences. Good connection, therefore, is essential for daoye to obtain supply from state supply units. Illegal sales from the state units could be made by managerial staff, or by staff members lowers down. In either case, it was necessary for private traders to have good connections with the people concerned. Private business in trades where supplies might be a problem, such as a tinsmith, a signmaker using plastics, and a chicken farmer requiring large amounts of feed, were run by former state employees or their relatives, and obtain their materials from former work units or from connections made when working there. If private profiteers did not happen to have these connections, they had to bribe the state employees. High demand for some goods provided amply opportunity for cadres in the state units who had power over those goods to profit from their positions. The state unit or staff member could profit by selling not the commodities themselves but the stage-unit status that facilitated buying. Many of the cases of illegal trading reported in the media involved individual businessmen using checks, identification, or letters of introduction from state or collective units.  1986-1989: Profiteer Grew Rampant  Starting in the latter half of 1980s, the illicit trade in some items became quite common and open. All kinds of ‚Äúofficial profiteering‚Äù guandao and ‚Äúprivate profiteering‚Äù affiliated had massed huge wealth. The ‚Äúlegends‚Äù about making great fortune overnight by profiteer emerged one another, generating greater incentives for more people to engaging in this lucrative market. Statistics showed that nearly 41 million people, accounting for 43% of the total labor force in the tertiary sector, participated in business activities related to the dual-track price structure by 1988. The overall annual amount of the price differentials for commodities, bank loans, and foreign currencies between the planned and market sectors totaled 200 to 350 billion RMB, accounting for 20% to 30% state revenue that year. As profiteer grew rampant, the issue was canvassed extensively in the national press as a campaign against speculation and profiteering was launched. On 18 August 1988, the official media People‚Äôs Daily published a commentary entitled ‚ÄúControl Official Profiteering‚Äù, blaming openly guandao as the culprit for many social malaises, ‚ÄúOfficial profiteers also carry the banner of economic rejuvenation and productivity development. Yet, what they are doing does not create material wealth. In fact, because of them the distribution for commodities are more blocked up, the time required for commodity distribution is longer, and prices are higher. Enterprises and consumers have to bear heavier burdens, the order of the socialist market economy is destroyed, and the development of productivity is obstructed. The collaboration between government officials and businessmen seriously erodes the cadres, destroys the image of party and state, dampens the people‚Äôs enthusiasm for reform and construction, and is detrimental to the overall conditions for reform.‚Äù By 1989, a massive amount of bureaucratic profiteers and individual profiteers had touched off strong discontent in society. As a result, ‚Äúcracking down on official profiteering‚Äù became a major target for the authority‚Äôs campaign against corruption that year. Beginning in the early 1990s, the government decided to eliminate the dual-track system, but managed to suggest that the way to do so was by a gradual shift to a market price system.  Early 1990s: Foray into Russian Market  While losing its ground in China, daoye found niche market in Russia. In sharp contrast to the tumultuous, and sometimes extremely unstable relationship during the Cold War, China and Russia normalized their relationship in the beginning of 1990s, largely based on tactical accommodation of each other‚Äôs interests. After the dissolution of USSR in 1991, both Russia and China desired to find a path towards free-marketing and new ways of economic development. Millions of Chinese people came to Russia, seeking business opportunities and wealth: the total value of trade increased from $3.9 billion dollars in 1991 to $5.86 billion dollars in 1992. In 1993, it even reached 7.68 billion dollars, which was also a significant increase. Besides official support and agreements, there were also several critical reasons and motivations for this sharp increase: due to the unbalanced economic development patterns in the Soviet era, the shortage of agricultural and light industrial products was a big problem at that time; on the other hand, Chinese individual business also was eager to find a new market. In addition, China and Russia are geographically close, which makes it easy and cheap to travel across the border. Russian visa policies at that time were also relatively loose, which enabled foreigners to travel in Russia easily. To do transnational profiteer, daoye usually bought cheap light industrial products (like clothes and shoes) and food (such as candies) in China and take the train from Beijing to Moscow. When the train entered Russia, they would sell their products to Russians in one station after another at a very high price. They also would buy Russian products (typically, they were military products or fur) on the way back and sell them in China. In the process, they could earn enormous profits due to the differences of product prices in Russia and China. Generally, after the dissolution of USSR, this trade alleviated the shortage of agricultural and light industrial products in Russia. Russian products and raw materials were also important complements for the industrial development of China at that time. However, this massive but nonstandard trading development created several serious problems, which then caused crises in non-governmental trade. Firstly, the economic and political environment of Russia was chaotic and unfriendly to foreigners, which, together with the activity of gangs, violated the legal rights and security of Chinese people and companies: local Russian officials and police usually asked for bribes from Chinese businessmen and they did little to prevent business people from being robbed. Secondly, many products sold to Russia, like down jackets and shoes, were pinchbeck and low- quality, which made Russians hostile to Chinese and Chinese products. Finally, the Russian government set high tariffs on imported products----it also took several initiatives to eliminate tax evasion. As a result, the total amounts of Sino-Russian trade stopped increasing from 1994 to 1999. The economic crisis and the collapse of ruble in 1998 also made the bad worse.  Legendary Daoye Mou Qizhong: Trade Canned Food for Aircraft  Among the early daoye who latter formed China‚Äôs first post-revolutionary wealthy class, Mou Qizhong is the undoubtedly the most famous and controversial figure, variously described as the ‚Äúnumber one rich man‚Äù and the ‚Äúnumber one cheat‚Äù. Born in 1940, Mou was the son of a capitalist financier from Sichuan Province. His bad ‚Äúclass background‚Äù meant that he was denied the right to complete college. During the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, Mou became disillusioned with China‚Äôs direction and wrote an essay titled ‚ÄúWhere Is China Heading?‚Äù which, at least, headed him straight to jail. In 1975, Mou was sentenced to death for writing the essay, but the political shift following the end of the Cultural Revolution led to his being spared. He was freed in 1979. Like many rehabilitated political prisoners, Mou had nowhere to go. He did not belong to state-owned unit so he had no possible source of income. Mou went into business, just as hundreds of thousands of political prisoners and educated youth returned to cities took the same path in the early 1980s. Since then, Mou built his reputation by barter deals that traded China‚Äôs low-cost goods and agricultural products for foreign capital, technology and high-priced foreign products. With the earnings from barter, he expanded into real estate, the stock market, aviation and telecommunications. His Beijing-based Land Economic Group, which is involved in barter trade, telecommunications, real estate and a host of manufacturing ventures, was once the sixth-largest (in asset size) private company in China. At the time, Beijing had allowed provinces to establish their own airlines. Sichuan Airlines needed planes but had no cash; the Soviet Union needed China's light industrial products. Mou arranged a barter deal-500 goods-filled railroad cars for four Soviet Union aircraft‚Äîthat garnered him worldwide fame. In 1995, the Chinese government recognized him as one of China‚Äôs ‚Äú10 Best Private Entrepreneurs‚Äù and China‚Äôs ‚ÄúReform Hero.‚Äù At its height, the Land Group had assets worth $240 million. That year, Mou hatched a plan to launch a series of satellites aboard Russian rockets, but his brainstorm came just as the Chinese government put the brakes on the country's overheating economy. Mou arranged for a $75 million letter of credit from the Bank of China to import computers and then used it to finance the satellite launches. Two satellites eventually were launched, but Land Group officials say Mou may actually have done little more than pay millions to put the company's name on them; the launches generated no significant revenue and Mou‚Äôs company fell more than $40 million in debt. In 2000, he was sentenced to life in prison for foreign-exchange fraud.  Criticism  Daoye phenomenon has been the subject of much controversy, reflecting a call to account for success and failure of China‚Äôs first decade reform. Using techniques of questionable legality, these men and women, many of whom had been political prisoners during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 70s, wrote an important chapter in China‚Äôs economic and political history following Beijing's decision in 1978 to loosen its reins on the economy. For the most part, daoye exploited loopholes in the transitional system to turn huge profits. But regardless of their machinations, it is the labor and hustle‚Äîand sometimes sleaze‚Äîof these businessmen, that accelerated the country‚Äôs economic transformation in the 1980s and 1990s. They started a process that has proved to be unstoppable. In this sense, they played an important role. The complexity of daoye is further enhanced by its wide range of practices. Clearly, there is enormous forms of behavior associated with attempts to operate in the dual-track price environment. Some behavior is entirely innocent. Much behavior represents a kind of mild corruption collaborated with the low-level official employees and small-scale private traders. And some are the large-scale profiteering of high-level officials and their relatives, demanding from bribes and extortion in exchange for massive deals. It is noteworthy that in most countries, profiteering is not technically illegal unless it involves committing a crime. For example, profiteering exists when companies manipulate their prices, or when those in positions of authority abuse their powers. In China, however, under the criminal law in 1979, daoye would be put in prison as long as they increase prices when there is a supply shortage. For example, a daoye would be considered guilty if he transported clothes from Guangdong Province to northern cities and made a profit. This crime was not abolished until 1997. The populace perspective about daoye is also ambivalent, paralleling a society changing so fast that various currents of hybridization and ambivalence overlapped. In general, daoye were not respected since majority of them were seen to have made money through illegal or more accurately improper connections to official rather than through sound business decisions and investment. More important, daoye nurtured a dramatic rise in levels of income inequality and a skewing of opportunities for upward social mobility. They made profit from the dual-track price system, exploiting state assets which should have been the shared more widely with the public. In this sense, daoye were seen to be involved in a zero-sum game with the rest of society since their gains were balanced by others‚Äô losses. On the other hand, daoye were admired by their huge fortunes, taking in heart the spirit of the time pronounced by Deng Xiaoping‚Äôs slogan ‚Äúto get rich is glorious‚Äù. Indeed, profiteering was not limited to government officials and their relatives and friends. While official profiteer guaodao was universally resented, profiteer had indeed become a common part-time money-raiser for virtually everyone in Chinese society who happened to know the right people at the right time. During the process of extolling the virtue of getting rich, it was frequently unclear just which activities were legal and which were illegal. References Bibliography Edward S., Steinfeld.

More specifically a man who lacks the demeanour (Ghayrah) of paternalistic protectiveness with regards to female family members or his spouse.Sallo, Ibrahim Khidhir. \\"A Sociolinguistic Study of Sex Differences in Mosuli Arabic in Mosul-Iraq.\\" There are many variations in how dayouth is spelled, including dayyuth, dayuuth, or dayooth. Related terms in English are cuckold or wittold. The term dayouth has historically held religious, legal and familial implications, depending on time and region, especially if a liaison results in pregnancy. Arabs of various religions, often conceive the concept of the dayouth in a negative light, either personally or scripturally. The term has also permeated into populations that have religious denominations with such explications (such as Islamic jurisprudence) or geographically adjacent populations where the term is in usage. The public perception within non-Arab communities that have adopted the notion of the dayouth as a loan-word varies. This ranges from criticism of its usage as an pejorative being suggestive of acceptance of vain paternalistic gender roles, stigmatization of sexuality or overprotective intrusive sexual gatekeeping within a household and thereby an approval of patronization, to acceptance of its usage in instances where there is an affront to modesty or the archetype of religiously inspired abstinence.

Biography Youth Her youth is deeply influenced by the engagement of her parents in the French Communist Party, where they met. The Spanish Civil War marks a break in his life. His father entered in 1936 in the International Brigades, in whose ranks he died at the Battle of Teruel. She was raised until the war with a young Spanish refugee welcomed by his mother after the defeat of the Republicans. World War Two She studied at Lyc√©e Stendhal in Grenoble. She was close to her French teacher, Colette Audry (1906-1990), who published several novels after the war and whose influence probably played a role in her vocation as a writer. She joined the French Resistance in 1943 in the immigrant workforce (MOI), an organization of the Communist Party gathering immigrants, the most active in the Resistance in Grenoble in 1943. She fought under the authority of Charles Wolmark, who is arrested by the Gestapo and shot at Charn√®cles. She meets the man who becomes his companion then his husband and who was then called Claude Henriot. She later chose to take as a pen name a name formed by the meeting of the two first names, Catherine and Claude, under whom she and her future husband who, for security reasons, wore false identities, met each other. She was in charge until May 1944 to develop in the lyc√©es of Grenoble another organization dependent on the Communist Party, the National Movement Against Racism. She was then sent to Lyon in May 1944 and to Marseille where she joined Claude. Writer and militant feminist She joined the Communist Party in January 1945. She participated at Ce soir, a newspaper created by the Communist Party in 1937, as a journalist in the foreign policy department. She got married in 1945. She moved with her husband to Grenoble and worked as a journalist for the newspaper Le Travailleur alpin, from September 1945 to June 1946. She was active in the Communist Party, particularly in the Union of French Women. She and Claude distanced themselves in 1956 after the repression of the Budapest uprising by the USSR and the publication of the Khrushchev Thaw. She reapproached the Communist Party in 1968 and participated in the creation of the Union of Soviet Writers, by a group led notably by Jean-Pierre Faye, Nathalie Sarraute and Michel Butor. She carried out several commitments by mixing writing, militant action and theoretical reflection around what remains like the great affairs of her life: * the emancipation of women: La Querelle des femmes, √âlever seul son enfant; * social emancipation through the popular struggle: C'est la f√™te de l'Humanit√©; * historical reflection: L'Enfance de l'humanit√©; * ecology: Voyages et aventures en √©cologie. She defended a feminism based on the search for authentic femininity more than on the fight against men. About her book La Querelle des femmes, Christian Mass√© wrote: \\"From the Frankish woman to the red woman of May 1968, Catherine Claude describes a je-femme fighting for the parity of the two sexes\\" and, further: \\"Catherine Claude pronounces 333 times the word woman without ever condemning man.\\" Lighter, Paris en zigzag, written with Colette Franc, is a walk in Paris over the course of history. She signed the Manifesto of the 343 published in Le Nouvel Observateur on 5 April 1971, in which 343 women declared having an abortion, which was then prohibited. She collaborated with La Nouvelle Critique magazine during the 1960s and 1970s. She moved away from the Communist Party in the late 1970s. She devoted herself to historical and linguistic research. L'Enfance de l'humanit√© is the product of this reflection. She studies the process by which hierarchical societies with hierarchical languages gradually dominated and eliminated peaceful, non- hierarchical societies.

It was founded in 2019 by Terry Mills, an incumbent member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. He had originally been a member of the Country Liberal Party (CLP). In March 2020, two additional independent MLAs joined the party, Jeff Collins (independent, formerly Australian Labor Party) and Robyn Lambley (formerly CLP). This saw the Alliance surpass the CLP as the second-largest party in the Legislative Assembly, but failed to gain official opposition status after a secret ballot of non-Government members of the Legislative Assembly instead recognised the CLP in a 5-3 vote. Despite hopes of forming government in its own right, or a coalition with the CLP or Labor in a minority government, the party was left with only one seat following the 2020 Territory election. History In March 2020 the Alliance gained its second MP, former Australian Labor Party (ALP) member Jeff Collins, who had been expelled from the ALP in 2018. Collins' decision to join the Alliance saw it draw level with the CLP as the equal second-largest party in the Assembly. This prompted Mills to suggest his party had a claim to the status of official opposition. On 18 March 2020, independent MLA and former CLP deputy chief minister Robyn Lambley announced that she was joining the Alliance. This gave the party its third MLA and saw it pass the CLP as the second-largest parliamentary party. However, less than a week after claiming opposition status, CLP leader Lia Finocchiaro put a motion to the Legislative Assembly seeking recognition of the official opposition, which the CLP won in a 5-3 vote (with the Labor Government abstaining and the three independents favouring the CLP). Ideology and positions Territory Alliance has promoted itself as an \\"ideology-free\\" alternative to the Northern Territory's two major parties, the centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP) and centre-right Country Liberal Party (CLP). In November 2019, Mills announced that the party's key issues would be \\"law and order\\" and \\"youth crime\\", while party secretary and Charles Darwin University law lecturer Danial Kelly said that the new party would be \\"non-religious\\". The party's first candidate announcements for the 2020 Northern Territory general election included Kelly and Regina McCarthy, a former candidate for the defunct far-right Rise Up Australia Party. The selection of McCarthy, as well as Kelly's \\"strong religious conservative\\" views, led the Northern Territory News to describe the party's candidates as having a \\"far-right tinge\\". McCarthy stated that her views had \\"evolved\\" since her RUAP candidacy in the 2019 federal election. Incumbent MLA Jeff Collins, who joined the Alliance in March 2020, was originally a member of the ALP and is a \\"vocal advocate of progressive issues such as drug decriminalisation\\". He has stated that the \\"left/right ideological dichotomy [...] has not produced good government for us\\" and that more conservative members of the party \\"still are people I can have conversations with\\". The Alliance preferenced the Greens ahead of the ALP and CLP at the 2020 Johnston by-election. Another former Labor MLA, Ken Parish, joined the party in early 2020. In June 2020, the party announced its policy of a ban on fracking. Election results In December 2019, the party announced that their candidate in the 2020 Johnston by- election would be Steven Klose, the CLP candidate for the seat at the previous election. Klose finished runner-up to the ALP candidate Joel Bowden on both first preferences (22.2 percent) and the two-party preferred vote (47.4 percent). At the 2020 Northern Territory general election, Territory Alliance contested 21 of the 25 seats in the parliament, holding hopes of building on their three seats to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament, with Mills even saying his intention was to win government outright. However, the ambitions of the party were dashed as leader Mills lost his seat of Blain, and Jeff Collins the seat of Fong Lim (both to Labor). The party failed to gain any other seats, leaving Robyn Lambley (Araluen) the only remaining member in the parliament.

Biography  She was born to the Dutch Reformed minister, Johannes Tak van Poortvliet, and his wife, Christina Louisa Henrietta Geertruida van Oordt (1850-1897). She remained unmarried. Little is known about her youth or education. She became wealthy after her father died and left 1,500,000 Florins, equivalent to roughly ‚Ç¨18 million ($20 million) in 2013, to be distributed among his four children. After 1906, she spent the summers in Domburg with her companion, Jacoba van Heemskerck, for whom she set up a studio and acted as a patron. Soon, she began acting as a patron for several other artists; often by purchasing their works. By 1920, she had accumulated over 120 pieces. Later, she sold some to various Dutch museums; leaving a legacy to the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen and the Stedelijk Museum. Tak and Van Heemskerck were both supporters of the Antroposophy movement of Rudolf Steiner and she translated several of his works into Dutch. With her help, and Steiner's, Dr. Willem Zeylmans van Emmichoven was able to establish the Netherlands branch of the Anthroposophical Society in 1923. Three years later she helped to create \\"N.V. Cultuur Mij Loverendale\\", which promotes agriculture and animal husbandry in the Biodynamic manner. She also contributed articles about Anthroposophy, music and art to various journals. She died in Dornach; Steiner's home town. The in Domburg is named after her.  Sources  *Nederland's Patriciaat 44 (1958), p. 303. *A.H.

This degeneration causes compressions in soft tissues and nerve root locations in the ultimate caudal area of the medulla, causing neuropathic pain in the lumbar vertebrae. It is analogous to Cauda equina syndrome in humans.  Signs and Symptoms  DLSS has been found to affect dogs between the ages of 7 and 8, males ranging twice as higher than females in the research area. Medium to large-sized working breeds with high rates of activity are mostly affected by this disease, the German Shepherd breed being the most common on DLSS diagnosis. Common symptoms for Degenerative Lumbosacral Stenosis in dogs are physical difficulties in normal daily activities, such as: * Mild to severe pain when walking (dragged hind limbs). * Discomfort when ascending or descending stairs. * Lumbar disturbances when resting or lying down. * Unwillingness to perform exercise. * Urinal and defecation discomfort Behavioural problems will also be presented in dogs affected by DLSS, due to the pain they suffer on their lower back. It has been researched that there is a positive correlation regarding a dog's behaviour with the amount of lumbar vertebrae that are affected by this disease, respectively showing that behavioural disturbances are more likely to appear with dogs that have 3+ affected vertebrae. Symptoms such as anxiety, sudden loss of appetite, or mild aggressiveness when performing physical activities can become clear signs of this disease.  Research  Degenerative Lumbosacral Stenosis is associated with behavioural problems depending on how much the disease affects the dog; in other words, the more tissue and bone that is affected by DLSS, the more reluctant the dog will be to perform any kind of physical activity. Its most general overview and research ground for understanding this pathological disease takes place in the military, since dogs who take part in the special forces (German and Dutch Shepherd, Labrador Retriever and Belgian Malinois being the most proper breeds) are widely studied as they progress through their incredibly active life. Those affected by DLSS, generally diagnosed in their retirement period, show a wide range of decreased activity when performing certain demanding tasks that require physical stress, thus, becoming crucial exemplars for lumbar diseases.  Treatment  Degenerative Lumbosacral Stenosis is commonly identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) due to their precision in recognising abnormalities in soft tissue and small bone structures. Medical treatment is necessary to correct this lumbar disease, generally varying from anti-inflammatory drugs (lacking steroids, such as: tramadol and gabapentin) to surgical correction; surgery being the most effective of course. Dorsal Laminectomy is the most common procedure for DLSS treatment, which implies the decompression or des-inflammation of soft tissues and nerve roots. Surgical fusion of the lumbosacral vertebrates has also been found to improve the affected vertebrae, since it reduces motion by eliminating certain nerve compressions located in the vertebral canal. Specific facetectomy (fat surgery) can also be performed in order to maintain stability in the affected joint tissue. Alternative conservative or non- surgical treatment is also a convenient option with dogs that have not fully developed Degenerative Lumbosacral Stenosis; ranging from regular walks to underwater exercises that aid the affected lumbar vertebrae decompress and tone the corresponding muscle. Statistically, physiotherapy has a success rate of 79% in all affected patients. If there is no surgical intervention, oral tramadol and alternative gabapentin have shown to decrease the neuropathological pain dogs suffer when affected by the disease.

On August 8, the USSR declared war on Japan; on August 9, hostilities began in Manchuria. By August 20, 1945, the main hostilities ended, and individual clashes continued until September 10. Soviet troops occupied Manchuria. Money circulation in China was in a chaotic state, a single emission center did not exist. In Manchuria, the yuan of Manchukuo and the money of other puppet Chinese governments were in circulation. To pay for purchases of food and other goods and services needed to provide Soviet military units, the Soviet military command launched the release of military money.

His research in the fields of cell biology and biochemistry has significantly contributed to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the intracellular traffic within eukaryotic cells, more especially in the endolysosomal pathway. Using innovative approaches such as phospholipid-specific antibodies and reconstituted cell- free systems, Jean Gruenberg and his colleagues were able to unravel several important mechanisms regulating the biogenesis and membrane dynamics of early and late endosomal compartments.  Biography  Jean Gruenberg was born in Switzerland in 1950. Jean Gruenberg is married to Fran√ßoise Gisou van der Goot, and they have two children. Jean Gruenberg and his family reside in Switzerland and he works at the University of Geneva as an emeritus professor in the Department of Biochemistry.  Scientific achievements   Cell-free reconstitution of endosomal fission and fusion events  After early studies on parasites (T. brucei and P. falciparum), Jean Gruenberg switched focus and studied the dynamics endosomal processes when he started to work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) with Kate Howell, and made several important discoveries on the molecular factors directing endosome dynamics, and was successful in reconstituting the process in vitro. When he became an independent investigator, first at the EMBL and then at the University of Geneva, he continued this line of research and worked on the characterization of early and late endosomes, and identified a transport intermediate between these organelles known as the ECVs/MVBs (Early Carrier Vesicles / MultiVesicular Bodies).  Molecular mechanisms of endosomal biogenesis and membrane dynamics  Throughout his career, Jean Gruenberg and his colleagues identified several molecular factors directing endosomal biogenesis and dynamics, including various cytoskeleton-associated proteins, the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7, Annexin A2 (previously named Annexin II), the vacuolar ATPase, COP coat proteins, the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor, the small transmembrane proteins of the p24 family, the p38 MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, intra-endosomal cholesterol, the redox sensor thioredoxin-like protein, sorting nexins, the adaptor protein complex AP1, components of ESCRTs and associated proteins and the atypical phospholipid LBPA/BMP (see next section). Using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as a ‚Äúhijacker‚Äù of the endocytic pathway, Jean Gruenberg and his colleagues demonstrated that intralumenal vesicles present within multivesicular endosomes are able to undergo back-fusion with the limiting membrane of these organelles, thus releasing their content into the cytoplasm, a process regulated by the ESCRT-related proteins TSG101 and ALIX, and since shown to be exploited by various other invaders of the cells such as the Anthrax toxin, and several other viruses.  Characterization of lysobisphosphatidic acid using anti-phospholipid antibodies  A milestone discovery in the career of Jean Gruenberg was the identification and the characterization of an atypical inverted cone-shaped phospholipid, originally named lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) and also known as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP). Using specific monoclonal antibodies, LBPA/BMP was shown to be enriched in intralumenal vesicles of late endosomes and to regulate the intracellular transport and homeostasis of cholesterol.

The virus was first described in 1976 in Scotland and in 1989 in Norway. It affects farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) caused by Marine SAV2 and SAV3 and has also been identified in Rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) in the seawater phase caused by SAV2 where the disease is commonly referred to as Sleeping Disease (SD).  Salmon Alphavirus Salmon Alphavirus is an RNA virus. There are six sub-types of the SAV virus have been identified (referred to as SAV1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), differentiated by the nucleic acid sequences of certain genes. The strands of SAV causing PD is SAV1, Marine SAV2 and SAV3.  Diagnosis  When the fish is infected, it can cause sudden loss of appetite, lethargy and increased mortality. The general symptoms of this virus infection also include difficulties to maintain a correct position in the water due to muscle damage.  Transmission  Cross infection is caused by seawater currents, human activities and lacking measures to prevent risk of transmission between sites. Fallowing procedures have proved successful and prevents the survival of the virus in the environment through the fallowing period, and repeated disease outbreak on the same site is due to introduction of new virus.  Geographical distribution  Most research is performed in Ireland, Scotland and Norway but the virus has also been identified in England and Mainland Europe where the SAV2 virus affects rainbow trout.  Economic impact  The virus is highly infectious and causes large economic losses in the fish farming industry, particularly in Norway and Scotland. In 2010, the economic loss was estimated to be 0.72 ‚Ç¨ per kg in Norwegian salmon production due to high mortality rates, reduced growth and the quality of the finished product.  Prevention and treatment  A monovalent vaccine against PD was made commercially available in 2007 and a multivalent vaccine, capable of immunising the fish against multiple strains of the SPDV, was introduced in 2015. Vaccination is shown to reduce the risk of the fish being infected and reduces the mortality rates due to PD. In addition, vaccination reduces viral shedding into the environment (virus being released from the cells) from already infected individuals, reducing the risk of contamination of neighbouring fish farms. Commercially available fish feed has also been used in an attempt to improve the fish's immune system, but the efficiency of this has not been documented. In Norway, a combination of vaccination, improve biosecurity measures, depopulation, closure of poorly managed fish farms and geographical separation of sites has proved to reduce PD outbreaks. In addition, regularly updated interactive maps are updated daily allowing all interested parties to monitor and contribute to the current state of PD geographically. Between 2009 and 2011 there were between 75 to 89 outbreaks per year. To prevent spreading the Norwegian coastline was in 2008 divided into two administrative zones separated by a production free zone of 10 nautical miles at the same time a vaccination programme was introduced. However, the effect of this has been questioned since the number of PD outbreaks has not been reduced.

Stelis gracilis are small epiphytes with greenish-white flowers in raceme inflorescences. This rare species of orchid is found in tropical rainforests in North and Central America. It was first described by the American botanist Oakes Ames in 1908.  Description  Stelis gracilis is a small-sized, warm growing epiphyte with erect to ascending, slender ramicauls enveloped basally by 2 to 3 dry and membranous sheaths and carrying a single apical, erect, subcoriaceous, oblanceolate, conduplicate blade attached to a petiolate base leaf. This species blooms in the spring and summer on a filiform, slender, 12 cm long, densely flowered, greenish-white raceme inflorescence.. These flowers are photosensitive, only opening in the sunlight. The three symmetrically rounded sepals generally form a triangle with a small central structure, made up of the column, small petals and small lip. Stems are up to 3 cm long; floral bracts around 1.5 mm. Florets are about 3 mm in size and have 0.6-0.8 mm long and 0.8 mm wide, inflated, greenish-white petals, oval and obtuse 3-nerved sepals (1.9-2.0 mm dorsal length and 1.0-2.0 mm width), and lip with a transverse thickening at the base. Florets have arched ovaries, which are 1.0 mm to 2.5 mm in length.Tropicos - Stelis gracilis Ames. (2006). Retrieved 2 November 2019, from http://www.tropicos.org/name/23512851?projectid=7  Etymology  The generic name Stelis is the Greek word for \\"mistletoe.\\" The term was coined by Theophrastus to describe a hemiparasitic plant that grows on trees. The name mistletoe originally referred to the species Viscum album (European mistletoe, of the family Santalaceae in the order Santalales). Over the centuries, the term has been broadened to include many other species of parasitic plants with similar habits, found in other parts of the world, that are classified in different genera and even families‚Äîsuch as Misodendraceae and the Loranthaceae. Orchids do not belong to these families, but, however, the genus Stelis was named for its resemblance to mistletoes.  Distribution and habitat  These plants are rare; mostly found in North and Central American areas.Karremans, A., Bakker, F., & Pupulin, F. (2012). Phylogenetics of Stelis and closely related genera. Plant Systematics and Evolution. 299:151-176 Found in countries such as Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama in dense, wet tropical forests at elevations around 1050 to 1100 meters.  Cultivation  Stelis gracilis can be grown potted in a fine bark-based compost in cool to intermediate temperatures, moderate to heavy shade. Requires good ventilation and high humidity throughout the entire year. If properly cared for in artificial conditions, an individual specimen may live for several years. This genus is not common in cultivation.

Biography Mariella Gramaglia was one of the leading Italian feminists, active through both journalism and political office. She was a member of the Chamber of Deputies in the 10th legislature and had administrative and political offices in the municipality of Rome during the administration of the mayors Francesco Rutelli and Valter Veltroni. Professional start After graduating very young at the University of Turin, she moved to Rome. She published one of the first collections of feminist texts in Italy, already in 1972. For a few years she taught Literature and Philosophy at the Unitary Experimental High School of Rome and had among her pupils Valerio Magrelli, Fabio Ferzetti, Guglielmo Loy, Riccardo Barenghi, Nicola Pecorini, Daniele Archibugi and Alessandra Baduel. Journalism After a few years, she left teaching to devote herself, under the guidance of Luigi Pintor, to journalism. From 1975 she wrote for Il manifesto where she worked on gender equality issues and civil rights. She followed with passion the debate on the law on voluntary termination of pregnancy. After Il manifesto, she worked as a political notary for the daily newspaper Il Lavoro in Genoa, then directed by Giuliano Zincone. Subsequently, she was a regular Rai collaborator of the program \\"Si dice donna\\", curated by Tilde Capomazza. And she worked on the Radiotre programs, directed by Enzo Forcella, in particular at the \\"NoiVoi Loro Donna\\" program. In 1983 she eventually became director of Noi Donne. Parliamentary career She was elected to the Chamber of Deputies on June 14, 1987 on the list of the Italian Communist Party in the College of Rome - Viterbo - Latina - Frosinone, she joined the parliamentary group of the independent Left. She remained in office throughout the legislature, which ended on 22 April 1992. She participated in the Social Affairs Commission, presenting numerous bills on social problems, on family status and on the status of women. \\"Se non ora quando\\" She was very involved in the feminist movement Se non ora quando (If not now when), which arose in 2011 following the scandals of the then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi concerning accusations of frequenting underage prostitutes. On that occasion, Gramaglia collaborated with several other feminists of his generation, including Cristina Comencini, Francesca Comencini, Licia Conte, Silvia Costa, Lidia Ravera, and Serena Sapegno. Personal life After her first marriage to Luca Codignola, for a brief period in the early seventies she was romantically linked to the director Nanni Moretti, for whom she acted in the short film P√¢t√© de bourgeois. Her companion was the economist Fernando Vianello, from whom she had a daughter and a son.

History The yeshiva was founded by the late Rabbi Yisroel Bloom and is headed by Rabbi Yaakov Bender, who was described by The New York Times as \\"ultra-Orthodox... Litvish or Yeshivish.\\" It has been operating long enough to have parents who graduated from it, including on the board of directors. The school is growing; a decade after having 1,400 students, it has over 2,000 enrolled students in pre- kindergarten through post-high school seminary. The bais medrash has been described as \\"large\\". The yeshiva recently refinanced its mortgage. On May 16, 2018, United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos became the first high- profile federal government official to visit a yeshiva, which was a two-day visit to Yeshiva Darchei Torah and to another school, a girls high school in Manhattan, called Manhattan High School for Girls.

While most students benefit from the school's STEM offerings, Darchei's \\"policy of inclusion for some special-needs children\\" makes its special education wing an important component. High school Although the high school curriculum offers nine Advanced Placement classes and Regents exams, it also has \\"a vocational program for students who are struggling in a traditional academic program.\\" In June of 2019, United States Ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman toured the yeshiva campus, including the Weiss Vocational Center, which had him in awe: \\"If I were still in yeshiva, I would be running to this very special and educational program, it's really a special thing and a big kiddush hashem\\".

History  John Klosowski was born 13 June 1937 in Detroit, Michigan. He studied at Cass Technical High School, learning about architecture. He moved to New York City and studied at Traphagen School of Fashion, graduating in 1958 in Costume Design. After briefly living in Paris, in 1963 he moved back to New York City and opened a custom dressmaking business. Henri Bendel, a women's accessories store based in New York City was credited with discovering John Kloss and providing him with early work. His dresses in the 1960s were unconstructed jersey and crepe fabric, but worn tight to show the body shape. By the 1970s his dresses were more loose in shape. Kloss received two Coty Awards, in 1971 and 1974, for his lingerie designs. His 1970s line of bras had an impact on the lingerie industry, John Kloss Glossies made by Lily of France, came in five bold colors, seamless, minimal, but still an underwired bra - for a braless-look. He died at the age of 49 on 25 March 1987 in his home in Stamford, Connecticut from a carbon monoxide poisoning-related suicide. According to the New York Times, \\"Mr. Kloss had been under severe pressure because of tax problems in recent years, according to business associates.\\" Kloss' work is found in many public museum collections including at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met), Victoria and Albert Museum, among others.

He was elected as MLA from 43 (ST) Phungyar Assembly Constituency in the 11th Assembly Elections as a Naga People's Front candidate for the term 2017‚Äì2022 AD. Early life Leishiyo Keishing is the son of Samphang Keishing and Martha Ningshen of Nambashi Horton village in Kamjong district, Manipur. He completed BE (Electrical) from Bihar University in 1999 and did post graduate in Thermal Power Plant Engineering and MBA in Human Resource Management. After completing his studies, he briefly worked as Mathematics teacher at Nambashi High School and Ukhrul Public School. From 2008-2010 he served as Assistant Manager (Electrical) for J&K; \\"Rail Link Project\\" under Indian Railway Construction (IRCON). From 2010, he worked with the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) as Assistant Engineer (Electrical) till 2016 when he voluntarily resigned from the job to contest in the Manipur Assembly Elections. Political career In an exclusive interview with AJA a Tangkhul vernacular daily, Leishiyo Keishing stated that he entered politics with the main objective to serve the people at his prime age and not after superanuation as many people opt to do. In the 11th Manipur Assembly General Elections, He contested as Naga People's Front (NPF) candidate and won the race beating his nearest rival Somi Awungshi of BJP by a huge margin of 4778 votes. Leishiyo Keishing was initially inducted as a Parliamentary Secretary in the BJP led Coliation Government of Manipur until the position was scrabbed in 2018. The political tide within the BJP led coalition was on a bumpy path when the NPF \\"In Principle\\" decided to pull out of the coalition in the run up to the Lok Sabha Elections in May 2019. The decision was however, withdrawn after due consultations. In 2019, he toured the remotest border villages within his constituency and pointed out that no development works were undertaken in Phungyar Assembly Constituency for the past 20 years. He also lamented at the disparity between the funds allocated for development between the valley constituencies and that of the hills. Phungyar Assembly Constituency, according to Leishiyo Keishing is larger than the whole area covered by the 40 constituencies in the valley. However, annual developmental fund allocated is a meagre 2 crore INR equivalent to the amount allocated to Singjamei AC the smallest Assembly Constituency in Manipur. Pathetic condition of the constituency in terms of road connectivity and electrification, according to Leishiyo Keishing hopefully will change with the implementation of various state and centrally sponsored programs.

It was located on the √éle Saint-Louis, on the west side of the rue Poulletier at its intersection with the quai du Dauphin (now 24 quai de B√©thune, 4th arrondissement of Paris).Bordier 1998, p. 104; Cojannot 2012, p. 103. Architecture Layout Le Vau's designs for the H√¥tel Hesselin were reproduced in six engravings by Jean Marot, which were published in the Grand Marot in 1686.Cojannot 2012, pp. 105‚Äì108; Deutsch 2015, pp. 461‚Äì462. The house shows Le Vau's skill at adapting plans to unique and unusual sites. Since the plot was located on a quiet quai, where street noise was minimal, he moved the entrance courtyard, which typically kept the main part of the house, the corps de logis, far away from the street, to behind the wings used for living, so the latter were near the River Seine and provided vistas across the river toward the University and upriver toward the Salp√™tri√®re.Blunt 1953, p. 132. The courtyard was reached from the quai via a carriage entryway (porte coch√®re) and passageway. The impressive doors of the carriage entryway were sculpted by √âtienne Le Hongre and have been preserved. The courtyard led directly to the garden at the rear, and the stables were east of the garden, along the rue Poulletier. On the right side of the courtyard a short flight of steps led to a highly decorated vestibule with a grand staircase on its south side leading to the main floor above, where there was a grand gallery (grande galerie) running parallel to the quai, with four windows overlooking the river to the south and three, the courtyard to the north.Bordier 1998, pp. 169‚Äì191.

Elevations Another imaginative feature of the house was the arrangement of the facades along the river. Le Vau was also responsible for the design and construction of the house to the left, the H√¥tel Sainctot, the river side of which was nearly complete by 1640.See Cojannot 2012, pp. 103‚Äì104, for the dating of the H√¥tel Sainctot. He combined the elevations of the two houses so they formed a nearly symmetrical ensemble.

When the last of the tenants moved out, Helena Rubinstein moved to have the hotel demolished despite the neighbouring residents and press protesting against the demolition.Helena Rubinstein The Woman Who Invented Beauty by Michele Fitoussi She justified her decision by saying the foundations had been undermined by repeated flooding of the Seine. The hotel was demolished in 1935 at the request of Helena Rubinstein, Helena Rubinstein,Bordier 1998, p. 180. and a new building was erected to the designs of the architect Louis Sue.Cojannot 2012, p. 104.

He was awarded the President's Medal by the Badminton World Federation in 2015.  Biography  Yoneyama was born on 15 October 1924 in Koshiji, Niigata (now part of Nagaoka), Japan. During World War II, he served in the Imperial Japanese Army in a suicide unit whose task was to ram boats filled with explosives into American ships. However, he did not receive an order to execute a mission before his capture by the Americans in Okinawa, where he was subsequently held in a prison camp. After his release at the end of the war, Yoneyama made floats for recreational fishing starting in 1946. When business slumped, in 1957 he began making rackets for badminton, which was becoming popular in Japan at the time. He incorporated Yoneyama Company the following year. In 1963, the company's racket factory burned down, but Yoneyama was able to set up a new plant and resume production in only three days. The company branched into tennis rackets in 1969 and golf clubs in 1982. It was renamed as Yonex in 1982 and relocated to Tokyo. Yonex signed contracts with some of the world's top tennis players such as Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, and Kimiko Date. As the company diversified under Yoneyama's leadership, he still paid close attention to badminton, inking a sponsorship agreement with the Badminton World Federation (BWF) in 1988 and signing badminton greats such as Rudy Hartono and Poul-Erik H√∏yer Larsen as brand ambassadors. The company became one of the world's top producers of tennis and badminton rackets and golf clubs. In 2015, Yoneyama was awarded the BWF President's Medal for his \\"extraordinary services to the sport\\". The medal was presented by H√∏yer, who was by then the president of BWF.

The airline specialized in both regional, domestic and international flights. It was founded in 1970 and completed its entire operations by 1983.  History  On the initiative of Victor Manuel Ferrucho, AeroTal was created and was based in Villavicencio. The objective was to make non-scheduled flights to Meta. He started with one Cessna 206 and one Piper PA-21. Then, with the closure of the Avianca base in the town of Villavicencio, it was decided by the AeroTal board to expand their route chart and retake destinations abandoned by the rival company Avianca. In 1974, a bunch of Douglas DC-3 airplanes were also purchased to operate to new destinations. Those Douglas DC-3s were bought from AVIANCA and a new base of operations was made in Bogota. A year later, LAN Airlines Sud Aviation Caravelle aircraft were acquired by AeroTal to operate the busiest routes of the company in Arauca and Leticia. When there was specific transport of cargo, international charter flights were made, which in turn made the possibility of replacing the DC-4 with larger planes to cover for the mass international routes it had at that current time. At that time, the AeroTal board had no interest whatsoever in generating flights to the Eastern Plains. However they planned to make flights to the Eastern Plains when they started off in 1970 to make flights there. That very same year the main trunk routes began to operate, such as Cali, San Andres, among other routes. It was also decided by the AeroTal company board to suspend operations in Leticia to use the new jets on trunk air routes. Three years later, a fourth Sud Aviation Caravelle was incorporated to AeroTal's fleet to accommodate for the enormous demand for the trunk air routes. That was when AeroTal changed its name to \\"Colombian Territorial Airlines\\". Then in 1979 the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) authorized cargo flights to Miami, for which a Boeing 707 was acquired through Leasing. At the beginning of the early eighties, the company started getting routes to Pereira and Medell√≠n. They were improving their markets greatly during that time and their position in the domestic market. When Aerocondor Colombia ceased operations, the airline saw the possibility of expanding. The company then ordered 720 and 727 aircraft, which operated on the companies most important routes. In 1981, promotions never before seen in Colombia were launched, with which tariff schemes were broken. These gave the idea of starting to operate passenger flights to Miami, temporarily from Barranquilla, Bogot√°, Medell√≠n and San Andr√©s. AeroTal crisis and bankruptcy AeroTal's first major problems began with a series of hijackings, some of their 727 and several of their Boeing 727s. The latter had been warned in a statement by Boeing, which mentioned problems with the ailerons and the rudder, leaks in the hydraulic and fuel system. Then in 1983, there was a financial crisis in some banks and that caused AeroTal to suspend a lot of its operations to cease. During that time the company had to receive significant financial aid. Also during that period there was a restructuring of AeroTal executives, and Avianca was requested to cover the airline's routes temporarily. After the brief period the company was out of service from operating it. The company was unable to order or get any spare parts for its aircraft. In addition to not having any spare parts, the company was out of workers since they couldn't pay them. So most of the workers went another other line of work or went to work at Avianca. Due to these problems, it was decided by the AeroTal company board to hire the former employees of Aeroc√≥ndor. But the problem was not the lack of staff, but the lack of budget. Finally, due to serious debts, AeroTal operations were permanently suspended because of everything that happened in those early eighties. After the bankruptcy of AeroTal, irregularities were discovered in the operation of the company, as well as invalid procedures to take the aircraft to other countries. So the company if it was in service it would¬¥ve been severely fined and probably taken out service either way. Revival of the company In the year 1984, the president of the company, Hugo Salguero, presented a plan to the AeroTal company board to save the company. It included renting a Boeing 727 to the company AVIANCA. Another Boeing 727 was also loaned to ACES. It was also planned to operate the Caravelle taken from the fleet years ago. However, this project did not work. Again in 1988 a new plan was created to recover the liquidated company.

It aired on television as a special episode of MLW's television program Fusion on September 14, 2019 on beIN Sports. Twelve matches were contested at the event, with two matches airing at War Chamber while eight matches being taped for future episodes of Fusion and two non-televised matches. The main event was the namesake War Chamber match, pitting Team Von Erichs (Marshall Von Erich, Ross Von Erich, Low Ki and Tom Lawlor) against Contra Unit (Ikuro Kwon, Jacob Fatu, Josef Samael and Simon Gotch), which Tom Von Erichs won. The undercard featured a match between Leo Brien and Blake Banks. Production Background Major League Wrestling previously held the WarGames event twice which featured the namesake WarGames match. However, in 2018, WWE acquired the rights to the WarGames name from MLW for its NXT TakeOver events, which led to MLW stopping the usage of WarGames name. On June 2, 2019, MLW.com reported that MLW would be holding an event in Dallas, Texas for the first time later in the year. The following day, it was reported that the event which would be titled War Chamber would be taking place on September 7 at the NYTEX Sports Centre. It was later revealed that the War Chamber match would headline the event, which was a variation of the WarGames match, with the only difference being that the ring would be locked by a carbon steel chamber and barbed wire would be placed on the top of the chamber and victory could be attained by pinfall or submission. It was announced that the War Chamber event would air on television as a special episode of Fusion on beIN Sports on September 14. Storylines The card consisted of matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by MLW's writers. Storylines were played out on MLW's television program Fusion. The Contra Unit trio of Simon Gotch, Jacob Fatu and Josef Samael debuted in MLW at Intimidation Games by attacking Tom Lawlor after Lawlor had successfully defended the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Low Ki in a steel cage match. The group attacked Lawlor numerous times, leading to a title match between Lawlor and Fatu at Kings of Colosseum, which Fatu won thus winning the World Heavyweight Championship. On the June 22 episode of Fusion, Ross Von Erich and Marshall Von Erich, the sons of Von Erich family member Kevin Von Erich made their MLW debut alongside Lawlor to defeat Contra Unit in a six-man tag team match, thus becoming Lawlor's allies in the rivalry. On the August 3 episode of Fusion, Ikuro Kwon made his MLW debut as the newest Contra Unit member by spraying mist into Marshall Von Erich's eyes after the Von Erichs defeated The Spirit Squad. On August 4, MLW.com reported that Lawlor and the Von Erichs challenged Contra Unit to the namesake match at the War Chamber event, which was made official on August 7. On the August 10 episode of Fusion, Kwon was added to the War Chamber as the fourth member of the Contra Unit. On August 20, it was announced that Kevin Von Erich would be the cornerman for Lawlor and Von Erichs at War Chamber. On the August 31 episode of Fusion, Lawlor received his rematch against Fatu for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Fatu retained with the help of Contra Unit. Contra Unit attacked Lawlor and the Von Erichs after the match until Low Ki made the save for them. On September 3, it was announced that Ki would be joining Lawlor and the Von Erichs as the fourth member on their team in the War Chamber, stemming from a previous attack by Contra Unit on Low Ki on the May 25 episode of Fusion. Event The event opened with a match between Leo Brien and Blake Banks. Brien executed an Oklahoma Stampede on Banks for the win. After the match, LA Park and Salina de la Renta showed up and Park attacked Banks and the referee and then Renta announced that Park would be cashing in his Golden Ticket opportunity for the World Heavyweight Championship at Saturday Night Superfight pay-per-view. The main event was the namesake War Chamber match, pitting Team Von Erichs (Marshall Von Erich, Ross Von Erich, Low Ki and Tom Lawlor) against Contra Unit (Ikuro Kwon, Jacob Fatu, Josef Samael and Simon Gotch). Marshall and Ross hit a double-team iron claw slam on Gotch for the win. Aftermath LA Park would receive his World Heavyweight Championship opportunity against Jacob Fatu at Saturday Night SuperFight, where Fatu retained the title.

It was established in 2000 to encourage, nurture and support Aboriginal artists with disabilities and the organisation focuses on empowerment through art. Artists working with Mwerre Anthurre come from around Central Australia but most live in Alice Springs, often due to the need to access appropriate medical services, and the painting process allows them to express themselves and their connection to their home country.  History Mwerre Anthurre developed out of The Bindi Centre, which opened in 1976 and sought to provide employment and community engagement to people with disabilities. In the 1990s, when working in the workshop, Billy Benn Perrurle started painting on off-cuts of timber and metal and Mwerre Anthurre was founded in order support his talent. Mwerre Anthurre is an Australian Disability Enterprise and receives funding from the Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FAHCSIA). Additional funds are also raised by the sale of work, following commissions given to the artists. In 2011, Mwerre Anthurre won the Northern Territory Chief Minister's Award For Excellence in Inclusive Practice by Aboriginal Arts Centres. Exhibitions and critical assessment Artworks produced by the collective's painters hang in public galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia, and have been exhibited nationally. Mwerre Anthurre Artists who have been publicly exhibited include Adrian Robertson and Billy Tjampijinpa Kenda, both selected for inclusion in the 2018 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Robertson won an Alice Springs mayoral award for his artwork undertaken through Mwerre Anthurre, and was also a finalist in the Alice Prize, a central Australian art competition. Reviewers have commented on the quality of the works of individual artists, linking them to the art collective. Chris Raja observed that the works from Mwerre Anthurre Artists, alongside those from other Desart member art centres, \\"showed once again that the force of creativity among the original desert- abiding people continues unabated\\".

North Pole and rotation axis  If the rotation axis of the planet is not perpendicular to the orbit plane, the incidence of the Sun on each point of planet surface will change during the year, which is the main reason of existence of seasons.  Equinox direction  Given the different Sun incidence in different positions in the orbit, it is necessary to define a standard point of the orbit of the planet, to define the planet position in the orbit at each moment of the year w.r.t such point; this point is called with several names: vernal equinox, spring equinox, March equinox, all equivalent, and named considering northern hemisphere seasons. This point is defined as the point in the celestial sphere where the Sun appears in a specific moment of the year: * the date is one of the two of the equinoxes on the planet, when daytime and nighttime are of approximately equal duration all over the planet. The word is derived from the Latin 'aequinoctium', from 'aequus' (equal) and 'nox' (genitive 'noctis') (night). * in that date the apparent position of Sun in the sky (subsolar point) appears to leave the Southern Hemisphere and to cross the celestial equator, heading northward as seen from the planet. The date when instead the subsolar point appears to cross the equator southward is the other equinox, named autumn equinox. There are only two equinoxes in one year.  Orbit eccentricity  Orbit eccentricity causes the planet/Sun distance to change during the year: The higher is the eccentricity, the higher is the change; Sun rays intensity in various moments of they year changes as the planet/Sun distance changes. Earth eccentricity is very low (0.0167 in a scale from 0 to 1.0000) , hence it does not affect so much temperature changes during the year.  Year duration  Conventionally one year is divided in 4 seasons, hence their duration is different if the year duration in Earth days is different.  Data needed for the determination of planets seasons   Direction of north pole / rotation axis of Solar System planets  From inclination of rotation axis it depends the direction of vernal equinox.

After years of internal and external strife, the Cambodian government is currently focusing its attention to rebuilding and renovating the national economy through grants and loans from multilateral sources like the International Monetary Fund. In March 1994, the International Committee for the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC) developed a comprehensive plan in effort to support Washington Consensus policy prescriptions. These reforms aimed to shift the economy from a socialist state-controlled economy towards a capitalistic market-controlled one. Since then they've had a total of two arrangements addressing fiscal management. Directors approved a loan for SDR 28.0 million (about $41 million) in support of Cambodia's 1995-96 macroeconomic and structural reformations. In 1997 domestic political uncertainty following an alleged coup d‚Äô√©tat halted IMF disbursements but resumed again in 1998 after the formation of a new government. Since the 1990s there have been no active IMF loans, but Cambodian and IMF relations continue through Technical Assistant strategies and yearly Article IV reports.  History  In order to gain global economic recognition from the International Monetary Fund, Cambodia was required to make fiscal structural reforms that mimic the mechanisms of a liberal-market economy. With that said, Democracy in Cambodia has little to no legitimacy in its economy. Following independence from French colonization in 1954, Cambodia has undergone four major economic and political changes.Sisowath, Chanto. ‚ÄúGlobalization and Generational Change: The Evolution of Cambodia‚Äôs Social Structure.‚Äù Fairness, Globalization, and Public Institutions: East Asia and Beyond, by Jim Dator et al., University of Hawai'i Press, HONOLULU, 2006, pp. 300‚Äì311.

Then Sihanouk was overthrown by the Lon Nol dictatorship who was supported by the United States. Subsequent to the Vietnam war, President Nixon secretly bombed Cambodia. This bombing invigorated the Khmer Rouge, a communist party, with anti-modernization, and anti-western ideologies. As a result, the Cambodian Civil war and Genocide began. The organization ultimately oust Lon Nol and formally established Cambodia as a self-contained communist country. Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader, systemically abolished money, private property, emptied cities and killed approximately 2 million Cambodian citizens.‚ÄúCambodia.‚Äù The Politics of Human Rights in East Asia, by Kenneth Christie and Denny Roy, Pluto Press, LONDON; STERLING, VIRGINIA, 2001, pp. 199‚Äì216.

The time when Ancient Khmer Empire ruled South-East Asia and heavily relied on the agricultural sector. By December 1978, Cambodia was invaded by Vietnam who implemented Hun Sen, as the new leader of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, a former Khmer Rouge commander.\\"A coup in Cambodia.\\" The Economist 12 July 1997: 33+. Business Insights: Global. Web. 2 Dec. 2019. Guerrilla warfare still ensued post-war which cause Cambodia to suffer international economic isolation. In the 1990s the United Nations convened a Paris Conference and achieved a comprehensive international settlement for the Cambodian Conflict. Currently, Cambodia once again is a constitutional monarchy in name but is ruled exclusively by the Coalition government controlled by Hun Sen.  IMF Loans   First Arrangement: 1994  The agreements outline in the Paris Peace Agreements satisfied the conditionality agreements of \\"Good Governance\\" according to the IMF standards. The first financial arrangement was approved on May 6, 1994, of a total of 84 million in SDR. The arrangement type is under the Extended Credit Facility (EFC) aimed to assist Cambodia with poverty reduction and growth. Although economic growth projections calculated an approximate 7 percent growth of Cambodian economy there was almost no growth in 1997. The Hun Sen Coup in 1997 increased inflation, and military spending. In 1996 the IMF froze transactions in response to corrupt logging practices and no collection of revenues. Cambodia received only $11.7 million of the 84 million during its three-year contract.  Second Arrangement: 1999  Hun Sen, Cambodia's Prime Minister Loans began to resume once again on October 22, 1999 when Cambodian authorities in collaboration with International Monetary Fund and World Bank Staff prepared and implemented the \\"Economic and Financial Policy Framework Paper of 1999‚Äì2002.Keat Chhon, Cambodian Minister of Economy and Finance and Chea Chanto Governor of the National Bank of Cambodia believed their economic program will support reconstruction and economic growth of Cambodia by improving social conditions and macroeconomic stability. The Memorandum outlined the formulation of a new government in 1998, and framework objectives focusing on Fiscal Reform. The IMF approved the new policies and estimated an economic growth of 6 percent if the Cambodian government is committed to the policies.  IMF Technical Assistance  IMF technical Assistance is help from world-class IMF economists who provide expertise and advice on macroeconomic policy issues, central banking, monetary and exchange rate policies, public financing, budgeting, tax policy and administration and statistics.

It is named for the state stud farm of in Bilovodsk Raion of Luhansk Oblast in the easternmost part of Ukraine, where it was bred. It shares its early history with the Russian Heavy Draught bred in Imperial Russia in the second half of the nineteenth century, and until after the Russian Revolution known as the Russian Ardennes; later development took place in Ukraine, where it received official recognition in 1999. It was bred for draught work, but it is also reared for meat and particularly for mare's milk, of which it is a high-yielding producer.  History  Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1900 The Novoolexandrian Draught initially developed as a sub-type of the Russian Ardennes (later named Russian Heavy Draught), and so shares its early history. Selective breeding of what would become the Russian Ardennes began in the 1860s at the Petrovsky Agricultural and Forestry Academy in Moscow and at various stud farms including the historic at , in Bilovodsk Raion of Luhansk Oblast in the easternmost part of Ukraine. From about this time, stallions of the Franco-Belgian Ardennais heavy horse were imported to the Russian Empire from Sweden in increasing numbers; between 1875 and 1915, their number grew from nine to almost six hundred. These were put to local mares; some Braban√ßon, Percheron and Orlov Trotter blood was also introduced. The aim was to produce a compact draught animal suitable for farm work. The Russian Ardennes was presented at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. As with other Russian horse breeds, the events of the First World War and the Russian Revolution caused a severe decline in numbers; in 1924, fewer than a hundred Russian Ardennes stallions remained. Several breed lines had developed within the Russian Ardennes, of which the smallest was the Dibrivsky, from the stud farm of the same name at in Myrhorod Raion of Poltava Oblast. In 1923 breeding stock of this line was moved to the stud farm of , which like the Derkulski Stud was in Bilovodsk Raion of Luhansk Oblast in eastern Ukraine. Other horses of the same type were moved there from a collective at Mariupol, in Donetsk Oblast, in 1929, and selective breeding for a compact but powerful draught horse began. In 1970 the Ukrainian or Novoolexandrian type was officially recognised by the Soviet ministry of agriculture. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union and the independence of Ukraine, the Novoolexandrian Draught received official recognition from the Ministry of Agrarian Policy in November 1999.

Access control  Many file systems' Access Control Lists implement an \\"append-only\\" permission: * chattr in Linux can be used to set the append-only flag to files and directories. This corresponds to the flag in . * NTFS ACL has a control for \\"Create Folders / Append Data\\", but it does not seem to keep data immutable. Many cloud storage providers provide the ability to limit access as append-only. This feature is especially important to mitigate the risk of data loss for backup policies in the event that the computer being backed-up becomes infected with ransomware capable of deleting or encrypting the computer's backups.  Data structures  Many data structures and databases implement immutable objects, effectively making their data structures append- only. Implementing an append-only data structure has many benefits, such as ensuring data consistency, improving performance, and permitting rollbacks. The prototypical append-only data structure is the log file. Log-structured data structures found in Log-structured file systems and databases work in a similar way: every change (transaction) that happens to the data is logged by the program, and on retrieval the program must combine the pieces of data found in this log file. Blockchains add cryptography to the logs so that every transaction is verifiable. Append-only data structures may also be mandated by the hardware or software environment: * All objects are immutable in purely functional programming languages, where every function is pure and global states do not exist. * Flash storage cells can only be written to once before erasing. Erasing on a flash drive works on the level of pages with cover many cells at once, so each page is treated as an append-only set of cells until it fills up. * Hard drives that use shingled magnetic recording cannot be written to randomly because writing on a track would clobber a neighboring, usually later, track. As a result, each \\"zone\\" on the drive is append-only. Append- only data structures grow over time, with more and more space dedicated to \\"stale\\" data found only in the history and more time wasted on parsing these data. A number of append-only systems implement rewriting (copying garbage collection), so that a new structure is created only containing the current version and optionally a few older ones.

Russia In Russia, the Law for the Purpose of Protecting Children from Information Advocating for a Denial of Traditional Family Values was unanimously approved by the State Duma on 11 June 2013 (with just one MP abstaining‚ÄîIlya Ponomarev), and was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin on 30 June 2013. The Russian government's stated purpose for the law is to protect children from being exposed to homosexuality‚Äîcontent presenting homosexuality as being a norm in society‚Äîunder the argument that it contradicts traditional family values. The statute amended the country's child protection law and the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses, to make the distribution of \\"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\\" among minors, an offence punishable by fines. This definition includes materials that \\"raises interest in\\" such relationships; cause minors to \\"form non-traditional sexual predispositions\\"; or \\"[present] distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non-traditional sexual relationships.\\" Businesses and organisations can also be forced to temporarily cease operations if convicted under the law, and foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported, or fined up to 5,000 rubles and deported. The Kremlin's backing of the law appealed to the Russian nationalist far-right, but gained broad support among the Russian people and the Russian Orthodox Church, as 50% of Russians are Russian-Orthodox. The law was condemned by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe (of which Russia is a member), by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and by human rights groups, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The statute was criticised for its broad and ambiguous wording (including the broadly worded \\"raises interest in\\" and \\"among minors\\"), which critics described as an effective ban on publicly promoting the rights and culture of the LGBT community. The law was also condemned for leading to an increase in, and justification of, homophobic violence, while the implications of the law in relation to the then-upcoming Winter Olympics being hosted by Sochi were also cause for concern, as the Olympic Charter contains language explicitly barring various forms of discrimination. United States (sub-national) Several U.S. states have \\"no promo homo laws\\", which prohibit or limit the mention or discussion of homosexuality and transgender identity in public schools. In theory, these laws mainly apply to sex education courses, but they can also be applied to other parts of the school curriculum as well as to extracurricular activities and groups such as gay-straight alliances. These explicit anti-LGBT curriculum laws can be found in 6 US states namely Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. They are similar to the now-repealed section 28 of the British Local Government Act 1988, which prohibited local authorities from \\"intentionally promoting homosexuality, publishing material with the intention of promoting homosexuality, or promoting the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.\\" States that have repealed their \\"no homo promo\\" laws include Arizona (since 1 July 2019),https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/54leg/1R/adopted/H.1346FloorSHOPE_Merged.pdf North Carolina (since 2006) and Utah (since 1 July 2017). Repealed laws Australia (sub-national) In December 1989 in the state of Western Australia, the Parliament of Western Australia passed the Law Reform (Decriminalisation of Sodomy) Act 1989 which decriminalised private gay sex while making it a crime for a person to \\"...promote or encourage homosexual behaviour as part of the teaching in any primary or secondary educational institutions...\\" or make public policy with respect to the undefined promotion of homosexual behaviour.Law Reform (Decriminalisation of Sodomy) Act 1989Gay Law Reform in Australian States and territories It was repealed in 2002 via the Acts Amendment (Gay and Lesbian Law Reform) Act 2002, which also repealed the laws with respect to promotion of homosexual behaviour in public policy and in educational institutions.Acts Amendment (Gay and Lesbian Law Reform) Act 2002 full text Romania \\"Article 200\\" (Articolul 200 in Romanian) was a section of the Penal Code of Romania that criminalised homosexual relationships. It was introduced in 1968, under the communist regime, during the rule of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, and remained in force until it was repealed by the NƒÉstase government on 22 June 2001. Under pressure from the Council of Europe, it had been amended on 14 November 1996, when homosexual sex in private between two consenting adults was decriminalised. However, the amended Article 200 continued to criminalise same-sex relationships if they were displayed publicly or caused a \\"public scandal\\". It also continued to ban the promotion of homosexual activities, as well as the formation of gay-centred organisations (including LGBT rights organisations). South Korea In 2001, South Korea's Ministry of Information and Communication's Information and Communications Ethics Committee began censoring online LGBT content, but it stopped the practice in 2003. United Kingdom \\"Section 28\\" or \\"Clause 28\\"While going through the UK Parliament, the amendment was constantly relabelled with a variety of clause numbers as other amendments were added to or deleted from the Bill, but by the final version of the Bill, which received Royal Assent, it had become Section 28.

Life  Born in Reichenbach near K√∂nigsbr√ºck as a child of poor parents and unable to practise a trade due to an accident in his childhood, Bergmann had to contribute to his own livelihood early on. However, he attended school and was promoted by his father, who was a violinist, in the field of music. After hearing a polyphonic choir at a fair for the first time, he prepared himself as well as possible privately to be accepted into the Dresden Singchor. His father, however, believed that he could only finance an education at a teacher's seminar, but Bergmann was able to take an entrance examination at the Kreuzschule with the intercession of the local priest, with whom he had had Latin lessons. In the six school years that he spent there, he suffered material hardship and went through several serious illnesses. Out of poverty he finally decided to become a schoolmaster and learned to play the organ for this purpose. On 15 October 1814 he was appointed cantor in Senftenberg. In September 1816 he got an engagement at the Royal Saxon Court Theatre in Dresden thanks to his beautiful tenor voice; the singer Miksch and the actor In memoriam ‚Äì Geburtstage im M√§rz 2015 auf der-neue-merker.eu trained him further in their subjects. Court actor Christ also became Bergmann's father- in-law on 23 October 1821; Demoiselle Henriette Christ also belonged to the court theatre. Bergmann's preferred roles included Pylades in Iphig√©nie en Tauride, Florestan in Fidelio and Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni. His melting tenor voice was praised in a summary of his life in the New Necrology of the Germans, although it was more suited to the performance of songs than to the singing of bravura arias. Although his appearance had \\"not been advantageous for the stage\\", \\"his high slender figure, his decency and other good posture\\" had ensured that it had at least \\"not been disturbing\\". Bergmann died in Dresden at the age of 36.  Further reading  * * Heinrich Ferdinand Mannstein: Denkw√ºrdigkeiten der churf√ºrstlichen und k√∂niglichen Hofmusik zu Dresden im 18. und 19.

Max Samuel's commitment to humans and society  Max Samuel did not really observe the sabbath rest and did not maintain a kosher diet, but diligently avoided snubbing feelings of those who did, such as his father-in-law Jakob Ge√üner (1848‚Äì1937). However, he was very and authentically Jewish in appreciating and valuing human life, aiming to support, maintain, rescue, or protect it, he wanted to take away problems from humans so that they could truly live, thus he sanctified life, the highest Jewish value. According to Herbert, Max Samuel was very impulsive and generous, and he was excited by opportunities to help people. He was very compassionate and his sympathy could be quickly excited. In religious matters he wanted to support the troubled Jewish congregation, which ‚Äì having lost all its savings in the inflation between 1914 and 1924 as so many private people and charities ‚Äì was brought back into solvency with his financial acumen.Frank Schr√∂der, ‚ÄûMax Samuel: ‚ÄπHauptsache anst√§ndig‚Ä∫ ‚Äì Ausstellung und Vortr√§ge √ºber den Rostocker Unternehmer, Gemeindevorsitzenden und Fl√ºchtling‚Äú, in: Hanse Anzeiger, 22 February 2006, Lokales p. 15.

He reformed the congregation's taxes (member dues). While a businessman in Rostock, Max Samuel liked playing football with his dog (a competition he referred to as the dog team vs. EMSA-Werke). He wanted his children to be extensively educated, as he had left school at the age of 14 and did not want his children to experience that. Although he was not academically trained, he was very pragmatic and socially intelligent. As his granddaughter Ruth Kaiser Nelson recalled ‚Äì when he had time for himself, he enjoyed being engrossed in reading newspapers.

Reprint of the Megillath Esther which Max Samuel helped finance in 1930. Inspired by Erichson, Max Samuel helped finance the 1930 reprint of the Esther Scroll which was originally printed in the 1700s and acquired for the Rostock university library through then chief librarian Oluf Gerhard Tychsen (1734‚Äì1815).Tychsen happened to be the government expert who recommended to Grand Duke Frederick Francis I in 1813 that the Jews in Mecklenburg-Schwerin should be emancipated, then enacted by law, however, suspended again in 1817 under pressure by the non-Jewish estates of the knighthood and the cities.

When in Rome both incapable of Italian, Ge√üner with his education in classical languages was unable to make himself understood whereas the practical Max Samuel succeeded communicating with shop assistants by gestures and mimics. The EMSA-Werke suffered an economic decline during the Great Depression, but survived the crisis intact. Instead of firing staff, Max Samuel maintained the previous levels of employment and production, accumulating stocks and causing shrinking profits in 1931 and a net loss in 1932, the first ever recorded for EMSA, which Max Samuel compensated with reserve capital formed in earlier profitable years.Cf.

She was the daughter of the teacher and hazzan Jakob Ge√üner, who, as a widower, had lived with his daughter and her husband since 1906. The Ge√üners were a well-educated, but rather poor, middle-class family from Lower Franconia.

Due to this regulation, the EMSA-Werke did not see an increase in convertible currency even though export profits were rising.

These various aid activities were financially supported by the company funds of the EMSA-Werke as well as by Herbert Samuel. Also, the increasingly difficult paperwork of the ILM was carried out by clerks in the EMSA-Werke. The company thus fell under increasing financial duress even though export profits were rising. Max Samuel reacted by running the EMSA-Werke on deteriorating machinery which he saw no point in replacing in view of the difficulties imposed by the Nazi government, and the factory building was also decaying.Cf.

On 30 and 31 August 1935, Max Samuel and ILM's syndic Richard Josephy visited many of Mecklenburg's Jewish congregations,After on 4 June 1934 the general assembly of the Israelitische Landesgemeinde Mecklenburg-Schwerin (ILM) had decided to incorporate the Israelitische Landesgemeinde Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the 1912-formed statewide merger of Mecklenburg-Strelitz' then five local Jewish congregations, the united umbrella body skipped the affix Schwerin from its name since it then comprised all Jewish congregations in the two Mecklenburgs, themselves united since 1 January 1934. especially all those recently dissolved or on the verge of dissolution, in order to collect all religious objects from defunct synagogues.Mecklenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv, 10.72-1 Israelitischer Oberrat, 28 [Gesch√§ftsbetrieb des Oberrates, Rechts- und Personalangelegenheiten des Oberrates und der Landesversammlung (Handakten des Rechtsanwalts Dr. Richard Josephy)], folio 5, 27 August 1935 (Max Samuel to Richard Siegmann, letter). Max Samuel concluded from these visits to the congregations that their financial situations, like that of the ILM, were terrible and continuously deteriorating.Mecklenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv, 10.72-1 Israelitischer Oberrat, 28 [Gesch√§ftsbetrieb des Oberrates, Rechts- und Personalangelegenheiten des Oberrates und der Landesversammlung (Handakten des Rechtsanwalts Dr. Richard Josephy)], folio 12, 27 September 1935 (Max Samuel's expos√© to the general assembly). The anti-Semitic discriminations made the congregations' well-earning contributors lose their incomes and/or emigrate, while more destitute members increasingly needed aid. The congregations and their umbrella ILM were running out of money because dues had dropped to a third of their pre-1933 level.Mecklenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv, 10.72-1 Israelitischer Oberrat, 57 [Schriftverkehr mit der Gemeinde Rostock], folio 69, 20 September 1933 (Max Samuel to Mecklenburg- Schwerin's Ministry for Education, Art, spiritual and medical Affairs, letter) So in 1935 the Upper Council had to increase ILM's religious tax, a surplus on the regular state income tax progressing with rising income, by 10 to 20 percent (also progressing).Mecklenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv, 10.72-1 Israelitischer Oberrat, 57 [Schriftverkehr mit der Gemeinde Rostock], folio 53, 4 March 1935 (Max Samuel to Richard Siegmann, letter). In 1935 Max Samuel's engagement in the ILM, including its paperwork and correspondence by his staff in the EMSA-Werke, aroused criticism in the upper council from the deputy Max Marcus (1876‚Äì1945In 1939 he and his family emigrated to Haifa, one of his grandsons, Daniel, born 1944 became an Israeli ambassador.

Marcus ended the disputes after Max Samuel, Richard Siegmann, and Richard Josephy presented their plan for how to continue the ILM's activity under financial and personal stress under the ongoing Nazi discrimination and combined their suggestions with their joint offer to resign if the general assembly would not agree.Jan-Peter Schulze, Richard Siegmann: ‚Ä¶ aber wir waren Deutsche, Stiftung Begegnungsst√§tte f√ºr j√ºdische Geschichte und Kultur in Rostock (ed.), Rostock: Redieck & Schade, 2011, (=Schriften aus dem Max-Samuel-Haus; vol. 11), pp. 168seq. This offer must have seemed to the members of ILM's general assembly to be a threat. Max Samuel further pleaded to the general assembly to vote for the ILM to apply for accession to the Prussian State(wide) Association of Jewish Congregations (), hoping for monetary support from the bigger and financially stronger Prussian umbrella body. In November 1935, the upper council under Max Samuel fulfilled a request from Rubensohn by sending Torah scrolls from the dissolved Teterow congregation to Pardes Hanna for a new congregation there.Mecklenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv, 10.72-1 Israelitischer Oberrat, 100 [Aufbewahrung und Verkauf von Kultgegenst√§nden 1930-1937], folio without no., 9 November 1935.

Also in November 1935 K√§te travelled to Herbert and gave birth to her daughter Ruth in London, meaning she was born a British subject, the first Briton in the Samuel family. On 7 December 1935 the Rostock tax office sent K√§te an order to provide collateral funds amounting to ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ 29,500, presuming that she and her husband's emigration was pending, in order to secure for the tax office the flight tax on capital.Cf.

They avoided this payment by returning to Rostock. On 12 January 1936 at ILM's general assembly in G√ºstrow, Max Samuel, as head of the upper council, gave a farewell address to his friend and neighbour Richard Siegmann, who was resigning from membership and presidency of ILM's general assembly after, with effect of 31 December 1935, the Rostock tram company had dismissed him as its chief executive.Mecklenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv, 10.72-1 Israelitischer Oberrat, 9 [Sitzungen der Landesversammlung der Israelitischen Landesgemeinde Mecklenburg-Schwerin], folio 16, 12 January 1936 (protocol) and Mecklenburgisches Landeshauptarchiv, 10.72-1 Israelitischer Oberrat, 13 [Protokolle und Anordnungen des Landesversammlung 1926-1936], folio 25, without date (wording of Max Samuel's speech). On 6 April 1936 the ILM and the Prussian Landesverband agreed that the latter would contribute 20% to the ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ 5,000 retirement grant of the chief rabbi's widow Helene Silberstein, n√©e Wei√übrem (1879‚Äì1952).As Mecklenburg-Schwerin chief rabbis had been state officials till 1919 the Mecklenburg state government was in charge to pay a pension, at least for the years 1910-1919, but as part of the general anti- Semitic politics simply refused to do so. The ILM professed itself financially unable to come up for all the pension and thus asked the Prussian Landesverband for aid. Cf.

However, she had not even applied for a passport. Thus the police were made aware of this and began processing a file on not issuing her passport before she even applied for it. According to Herbert, the family members in Wembley telegraphed her, explaining that her father was very ill and that they wanted her to see him. But Kate worried about the family, Jewish friends, and employees to be left behind, and so Max Samuel sent EMSA's Danish and Norwegian representatives to his daughter to help her understand the gravity of the situation. A few days later the notary sent a letter explaining that the bill had been paid so he would no longer object issuing her passport.Ernst Lutz to Polizeipr√§sidium Rostock on 19 September 1938 (letter), Stadtarchiv Rostock sign. 1.1.8 748. So soon after when K√§te applied for her passport she received it and left with her daughter Ruth, arriving in Britain on 30 September 1938. On 18 September 1938, after his previous plenipotentiary and son-in-law Hermann Kaiser had left for Britain by May, Max Samuel commissioned his proxy agent Dr. Paul Hoffmann (1896‚Äì1969), one of the clerks employed in the EMSA-Werke after they had been fired as Jews in the mid-1930s, to liquidate the EMSA-Werke.

Max Samuel's EMSA-Werke were subsequently seized in 1939 and 'Aryanised'. Meanwhile Herbert travelled to Scandinavia and gained faithful EMSA clients to redirect their orders to Blackburn.

Soon after, the German and Soviet invasion of Poland had been followed by the German occupation of much of western and central Europe and the Soviet occupation of much of eastern Europe. The British government, alone in its military resistance to Nazi Germany, ordered the internment of enemy aliens. Hugo Kaiser was interned and only released shortly before emigrating with his wife to Tulsa in May 1940, while Herbert Samuel was spared from internment on the grounds of his task as business manager and Max Samuel due to his bad heart condition.

Expropriation of the Samuels in Germany  After the emigration of the Samuel family became obvious to the authorities, the tax office issued a flight tax demand amounting to ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ 200,000,Ingrid Ehlers and Frank Schr√∂der, Zwischen Emanzipation und Vernichtung: zur Geschichte der Juden in Rostock, Rostock: Stadtarchiv, 1988, (=Schriftenreihe des Stadtarchivs Rostock; no. 9), p. 60\\\\.

The 'Arianisers' of EMSA shamelessly sent the tax bills to England, hoping Max Samuel would pay them.

On 10 July 1939 Vo√ü and Helmers gave Eder a 10% share in the EMSA-Werke, only effective as of 9 January 1940, as confidants of Jewish businessmen were excluded from 'Aryanisations' probably due to suspicion that they would conceal a continued proprietorship of the previous Jewish owner. Due to supply shortages during the war, production declined after 1939, and exports continued only to Sweden and Switzerland.Bericht √ºber die Pr√ºfung des Jahresabschlusses der Firma Emsa- Werke Kommanditgesellschaft, Seestadt Rostock vom 31.

In 1941 the EMSA-Werke were renamed Vo√ü-Werke KG, however the usage of the trademark EMSA was continued. Deutler also found an 'Aryaniser' for the villa, and on 3 May 1939 he signed a contract with the newly-founded (institute of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft for research in animal breeding), represented by its administrator Julius Ost, paying ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ 70,000. The contract would only become effective once the city waived its right of pre√´mption and once various Nazi authorities would confirm it, such as the authority rationing convertible foreign exchange () and the price control office (), established in 1935, dictating prices in order to repress the surging inflation caused by the Nazis' steady money printing. The Rostock tax office was to be paid its tax demand against the EMSA-Werke, which since June 1933 was partially secured by a mortgage of ‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥ 50,000 on Max Samuel's private premises on Schillerplatz 10. However, Deutler did not know that the villa was legally not under his custodianship, since its sale to the EMSA- Werke had not been registered in the land registry, so it still documented Max Samuel personally as the proprietor. Once aware of this Deutler achieved his official appointment as custodian of the villa with effect of 24 JulyCf. Mecklenburgisches Staatsministerium, Abteilung Inneres (Mecklenburg State Administration, department of the interior) to the Grundbuchamt Rostock (Rostock land registry) on 29 July 1939 (letter). in order to fulfill the requirements of the purchase contract of 3 May. On 5 September 1939 the Mecklenburg state government approved the sale of Schillerplatz 10.Cf.

After the tax office had confirmed its demand was fulfilled,Finanzamt Rostock-Stadt to Grundbuchamt der Stadt Rostock on 26 March 1933 (letter). its mortgage on the villa was cancelled on 22 April 1940 and the land registrar registered the Reich's Ministry for Nutrition and Agriculture, the legal representative of the institute for animal breeding, as proprietor of Schillerplatz 10.Cf. Grundbuch Rostock (Rostock land registry), Flurbuchabteilung II, No. 5/1461, folio 5112. In 1945 Rostock became part of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany. The Soviet-appointed new pro-communist administration expropriated the absent Vo√ü, who had fled Rostock before the Soviet invasion on 1 May 1945, and Helmers, who then followed Vo√ü to the British zone. The business' name was changed to Rostocker Schuhfabrik (Rostock shoe factory). The minority holder Eder successfully reclaimed his share. After the foundation of the East German Democratic Republic (1949; GDR) he was expropriated too in 1951.Nagel und Partners (lawyers) to Herbert Samuel on 8 March 1991 (letter), Max-Samuel-Haus archive sign.

The Mecklenburg government then made the shoe factory a part of the combine called Vereinigung volkseigener Betriebe Textil-Bekleidung-Leder des Landes Mecklenburg (union of publicly owned companies for textiles, clothing, and leather of the state of Mecklenburg), which was combined with other businesses in 1957 to make the even bigger combine Rostocker Elektro-Ger√§tebau (Rostock electric equipment manufacturing), which later was changed again into the Deutsche Handelszentrale f√ºr Pharmazie- und Krankenhausbedarf (German trade centre for pharmaceutical und hospital supplies). Presumably through all these name changes the same or similar orthopedic products continued to be produced. This combine withdrew from its location in the Friedrichstra√üe 28 and on 25 March 1966 the city of Rostock reallocated the premsises to its VEB Stadtbeleuchtung Rostock (Rostock street lighting).Cf. Stadtbeleuchtung Rostock GmbH to Senat der Hansestadt Rostock on 12 March 1991 (letter), p. 4. In July 1945 the institute for animal breeding was ordered to evacuate the villa and the Rostock local branch of the Cultural Federation for Germany's democratic renewal moved in with the cultural office of the city and tenants in the attic flat. In 1955 Ilse-Dore Eckardt, a child nurse then in charge of furnishing and installations of daycares, converted the villa for its usage into Kinderkrippe Schillerplatz, as more and more mothers were employed in the communist production system.Ilse-Dore Eckardt (widow of sculptor Wolfgang Eckardt; 1919‚Äì1999), Interview of Ilse-Dore Eckardt in the Max-Samuel-Haus on 7 July 2017 (Ulf Heinsohn and Steffi Katschke, interviewers), Rostock: typescript, 2017, Max-Samuel-Haus archive sign.

After being unraced as a juvenile she won on her racecourse debut in 2019 and finished fourth in the Irish Oaks before going on to win the Galtres Stakes and the Irish St Leger. Background Search For A Song is a chestnut filly with a broad white blaze and white socks on her hind legs bred and owned by the Moyglare Stud. She was sent into training with Dermot Weld at the Curragh, County Kildare. She was from the fourteenth crop of foals sire by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. His other progeny include Australia, Frankel, Waldgeist, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Search For A Song's dam, Polished Gem won one minor race from five attempts, but has been a very successful broodmare, producing several other winners including Free Eagle, Sapphire (British Champions Fillies and Mares Stakes) and Custom Cut (Sandown Mile). Polished Gem is a daughter of the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Trusted Partner. Racing career 2019: three-year-old season On 30 May Search For A Song made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over ten furlongs on good to firm ground at Fairyhouse Racecourse in which she was ridden by Chris Hayes and started the 4/6 favourite in a six-runner field. After racing prominently from the start she went to the front in the last quarter mile and pulled away to win \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths from Lady Olenna. At Naas Racecourse on 26 June Search For A Song was stepped up in class and went off the 2/1 favourite for the Listed Naas Oaks Trial. She led for most of the race but was overtaken inside the last quarter mile and finished second, two and three quarter lengths behind the Jessica Harrington-trained Trethias. On 20 July the filly was moved to the highest level to contest the Group 1 Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh. After racing in mid-division she stayed on well in the closing stages without ever looking likely to win and came home fourth behind Star Catcher, Fleeting and Pink Dogwood. For her next start Search For A Song was sent to England and started 2/1 favourite for the Listed Galtres Stakes at York Racecourse on 22 August. Ridden by Oisin Murphy she raced in third place before taking the lead in the straight and stayed on well to win by one and three quarter lengths and a head from Vivionn and Spirit of Appin. Dermot Weld commented \\"She did that very nicely. Oisin did a nice job getting her in behind the speed and she's a nice staying filly. I was quite relaxed throughout the race... I really see her coming into her own as a four-year-old.\\" On 15 September Search For A Song was ridden by Hayes took on nine older male opponents in the Irish St Leger at the Curragh and started at odds of 10/1. Cross Counter went off favourite while the other contenders included Kew Gardens, Latrobe and Capri. After pulling against Hayes' attempts to restrain her the filly took the lead at half way and kept on well in the straight to win by two and a half lengths from Kew Gardens. After the race Weld said \\"Search For A Song was running so freely early on that it was either going to work out brilliantly or be a disaster. Chris made the right call and it was a very brave one and a hard one to make... When she got to the front the filly settled and we knew she would stay, there's a lot of stamina in her pedigree.

For more than forty years, he was a reporter and columnist for The Providence Journal, a Pulitzer Prize-winning publication and the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper. Early life Robert Kerr was born in Cortland, New York to his parents, who were both teachers. He lived in New York until his late teens when his family moved to Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Kerr graduated from Grosse Pointe University School. He served for two years in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War as a war correspondent. He later worked for The Detroit Free Press and The Charlotte Observer. Kerr graduated from Hamilton College as an English major. Career at The Providence Journal Bob Kerr was the Journal's metro columnist for the last 20 years of his career of four decades. He routinely covered community stories, public interest stories, as well as profiles of individuals that were often overlooked by Providence society in everyday life. Kerr was unceremoniously forced to retire as Belo Corporation was in the process of being purchased by GateHouse Media (now Gannett) in 2014 during a slew of lay-offs as the paper transferred ownership and Dave Butler became the Journal's Executive Editor. Nicholas Alahverdian columns From 2002 until 2011, Kerr reported on the efforts of Nicholas Alahverdian, a Rhode Island government state employee who was also in the care of the state's troubled Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth & Families and its night-to-night program. Kerr detailed Alahverdian's efforts as an insider who informed lawmakers of the abuse and negligence that was ensuing in Rhode Island group homes. In 2011, Kerr later exposed how Alahverdian was sent out of state to Nebraska and Florida where he was allowed no contact with anyone shortly after the early media coverage, and was left there until his 18th birthday. Of Alahverdian's time in the night-to-night program, Kerr wrote that \\"He was put in night-to-night placement by the Department of Children, Youth and Families, a practice so hideously abusive and stifling that it would seem better fit to a Charles Dickens novel than to 21st century Rhode Island.\\" Kerr also wrote that \\"[Alahverdian] has always suspected that he was sent out of state because he was so outspoken about the horrors of night-to-night placement. He had been a page and an aide at the Rhode Island State House before his exile, and he was not reluctant to point out the hard lessons learned from his DCYF experience.\\" In Kerr's final article on Alahverdian, Kerr wrote that \\"through intelligence and sheer will, he is now at Harvard. He knows that Cambridge is a much healthier place for him to be than anywhere in Rhode Island. Regardless of what happens in federal court or at the State House, Alahverdian has left his mark. Night-to-night placement has been ended forever. And Manatee Palms, the Florida facility where Alahverdian experienced so much abuse, is no longer used by DCYF. Alahverdian, I have to believe, had something to do with those changes.\\" References Category:Living people Category:20th-century American journalists Category:20th-century American writers Category:21st-century American journalists Category:21st-century American writers Category:American investigative journalists Category:American male journalists Category:American male writers Category:American newspaper reporters and correspondents Category:American political writers Category:Hamilton College (New York) alumni Category:United States Marines Category:1945 births ","title":"Bob Kerr (reporter)"},{"id":"62482877","text":"Br√¨ghde Chaimbeul (born 1998) is a Scottish bagpipe player, who plays the traditional Great Highland bagpipe and the revived Scottish smallpipes.
