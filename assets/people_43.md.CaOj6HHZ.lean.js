Innovative methods of glass manufacture developed by the company resulted in the company earning great income, and members of the Pilkington family became beneficiaries of company trusts.Barker, T. C. (1977), The Glassmakers: Pilkington: 1826‚Äì1976, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Hugh Pilkington was the son of Roger Windle Pilkington (b. 17 January 1915, died 5 May 2003) who in 1962 became president of the London Missionary Society. Hugh, while still young, accompanied his father on travels overseas, including to East Africa.Roger Pilkington, A Pilkington Memoir, 1995, privately published == Education and early working life == Hugh was educated at Cambridge University in the 1960s and upon graduation was named the top classical scholar in his graduation year having gained a double first degree and was awarded a number of university prizes.\\"Dr Hugh Pilkington: 1942‚Äì1986\\", Biography distributed at his funeral, copy held by Windle Trust International, Oxford, UK He then worked for the family firm, Pilkington Glass. In Germany and elsewhere but came to realise that he was not suited to the world of commerce. He travelled to Africa to translate the Bible and in 1972 he joined the Theology and Philosophy Department of the University of Nairobi, eventually becoming a naturalised Kenyan citizen. He became interested in the book of Proverbs and its early manuscripts of Coptic origin. This launched him on an Oxford doctoral degree, and also required him to read manuscripts in Ge'ez, the almost extinct church language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. To learn Ge'ez, Hugh found two young Ethiopian refugees to teach him the language in exchange for board and lodging in his Nairobi home.Michael Valpy, \\"An unusual man is given his due\\", Toronto Globe and Mail (November 1986) In 1979 Hugh was awarded a doctorate from Oxford.Footage of Hugh Pilkington receiving his PhD from Oxford University on 16 June 1979 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R12INC6g5gY.

Through his contact with the two Ethiopian refugees who assisted him in his doctoral studies, he became increasingly involved with supporting other young refugees to continue their studies at universities in Africa and overseas.Robin Shawyer, \\"The Windle Trusts: A Brief History\\", July 2011, Windle Trust International, Oxford, UK In 1977, he set up the Windle Charitable Trust in Kenya to support needy Kenyan students.:. Retrieved 17 March 2014 In 1980 Pikington left his university post and dedicated himself full-time to providing educational opportunities, particularly for refugees. Hugh valued his own education highly and believed that good education was a key to promoting positive change in Africa and this became the vocation of the last ten years of his life: to help rebuild the lives of young Africans driven from their countries because of political beliefs and ethnic origins.Professor Edward Ullendorff, FBA, \\"Obituary of Dr Hugh Pilkington \\", Times [London, England] 22 October 1986. Academic OneFile. Web. 27 December 2013 He became increasingly concerned with the plight of African refugees arriving in Kenya and with the need for educational development in Kenya. He opened his home in Nairobi to refugees from other parts of Africa, particularly from Ethiopia and Eritrea, and subsequently financed their education in universities in the UK, North America and as far abroad as Fiji. He arranged for scholarship for hundreds of refugees; he was their counselor and their friend. He compiled a handbook of African universities for refugees, and helped run a small hostel for homeless refugees, presided over a teachers' committee for a refugee school, planned old people's homes and often assisted individual refugees including bailing detained refugees out of prison. == Death and legacy == On 16 October 1986 he was knocked down by a car in Canada. At the time, he was on a tour of Canadian universities to speak about the plight of African refugees, promote university scholarships for refugees, and to visit African students whom he had helped to place in Canadian universities and colleges. As the UNHCR High Commissioner at the time, , observed, Hugh was an outstanding example of the capacity of one man to improve the human condition by individual effort. Before his death he had made arrangements for his personal estate to be used to set up a foundation to promote the education of refugees and in 1988 the Hugh Pilkington Charitable Trust (HPCT) was established in the UK. In 2002 Windle Trust International (WTI) was formed to manage the programmes of HPCT as a charitable company limited by guarantee. Since Hugh's death the Windle Trusts, which are built on the foundation of the work he started, have assisted over twenty thousand young people in Africa whose lives have been blighted by conflict..

One of PACUNAM¬¥s priorities is the conservation of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. PACUNAM¬¥s main objectives are: * Provide financial support for the study of strategic archaeological sites within the Maya Biosphere Reserve in order to protect it as an ecological and cultural system. * Develop the Carmelita-Mirador route as a sustainable tourist circuit to provide revenue for local communities. * Support the Conservation Incentive Program in local communities, in order to make biodiversity conservation a viable choice for users of local resources. * Encourage international cultural exchanges through events, seminars, conferences, workshops, and exhibits. PACUNAM supports initiatives that promote sustainable development in the country in three strategic areas: archaeological research, environmental conservation and sustainable economic activities. ==Strategic areasSupport to archaeological research, restoration and preservation=== Program dedicated to the rescue, restoration, consolidation and preservation of archaeological sites, such as the Mirador Basin, Holmul, La Corona, El Per√∫, Cival and Naacht√∫n. Also, they support expositions worldwide, such as the one in the Quai Branly museum in Paris, France, named \\"The Maya Civilization: From Dawn until Dusk\\". The archaeological discoveries that have been made in the archaeological field have expanded the information that is known of the Maya Civilization. The Maya Biosphere Reserve is a tempting location for the people that do illegal activities: Mayan ruins not protected from looters, jungles filled with precious wood for woodcutters, virgin land for illegal occupiers and new routes for drug trafficking. The archaeological projects have proven to be a key component to stop these situations. PACUNAM is focusing its support in archaeological sites that contribute to having a physical presence during all year and generate scientific results and discoveries that attract global attention and show the value of the Mayan culture. ===Sustainable economic activities=== PACUNAM supports the development of economic activities linked to community development done in a sustainable manner. This is achieved through the support to the development and strengthening of sustainable forestry that contributes to the protection of natural resources through a controlled operation, and with the implementation of projects aimed to help develop the tourism potential of natural and archaeological resources, encouraging new productive activities in conjunction with the communities. ===Conservation of the environment=== Focused on the conservation of the Maya Biosphere Reserve, taking into account the protection of tropical forest, flora and fauna of the region. In addition, they support national programs that have a positive impact in environmental conservation in Guatemala. Through partnerships, they host forums on strategic issues and implement projects aimed at conserving the environment through payment of environmental services and incentives for conservation, among others. == References  External sources == * Official Site Category:Environmental organizations based in Guatemala Category:Organizations established in 2006 ","title":"Foundation for Maya Cultural and Natural Heritage"},{"id":"41983182","text":"Among those who were born in the London Borough of Merton, or have dwelt within the borders of the modern borough are (alphabetical order): ==A== *Khalid Abdalla ‚Äì actor, The Kite Runner and United 93 *Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot ‚Äì Commander of the Royal Navy in North America during the American War of Independence *Bob Astles ‚Äì former associate of Ugandan presidents Milton Obote and Idi Amin *Ray Austin ‚Äì TV and film director, actor, stuntman;

In 1861, as the Civil War broke out, he was an early volunteer for the Union Army, Company One, Ninth Illinois Infantry. After serving an initial three-month enlistment, he re-enlisted for three years and mustered out as a Sergeant in 1864.Norton, W.T., Flagg, Hon. N.G., & Hoerner, J.S. (1912). Centennial History of Madison County, Ill., and Its People, 1812-1912‚ÄîVol. II. p.1127.

After the war, he took up farming and studied law.Portrait & Biographical Record of Madison County, Ill. (1894). Chicago, IL: Biographical Publishing Co. p.531. === Business Pursuits === He soon abandoned his study of law in favor of matrimony and mercantile pursuits. In partnership with J. A. Barnsback, he opened the first lumberyard in Troy. He purchased his partner's interest in 1869 and conducted the business successfully as sole owner until 1876, when he entered the livestock commission trade at the National Stockyards at St. Clair, Co., Ill. In 1885, with H.H. Padon as his partner, he opened the Troy Exchange Bank and became sole proprietor in 1887. While political office did not appeal to him, he still served his fellow citizens as one of the first commissioners of Madison County, from 1874-1876, before inauguration of the township system.History of Madison County, Ill.

Sherman's business affairs in the Troy area, and their friendship. Gen. Sherman was a guest at the Jarvis home when he visited the area, and Mr. Jarvis named one of his sons (Willie Sherman Jarvis, who died in childhood) after the General. == The Jarvis House == 321x321px Mr. Jarvis designed his home in the picturesque Italianate style, which dominated American houses constructed between 1850 and 1880, particularly in the towns and cities of the Midwest. The house is significant and distinctive by its outstanding state of preservation and architectural integrity, and by its being the only remaining example in the local community of the asymmetrical, compound-plan subtype. The two-story house has a projecting mass on one side of the front facade and a porch on the other. A polygonal window bay protrudes from the first floor of the projecting mass. All of the house's windows are sash windows, constructed of sugar pine, and topped by pediment hoods. The house's cross gabled roof features overhanging eaves and a cornice decorated with large, ornately scrolled eave brackets with turned finials.Schmidt, Harold & Marie (25 Aug 1986). \\"National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Jarvis, William W., House\\". National Park Service. Retrieved from http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/ This photo of the William W. Jarvis house was taken in June 2020.The entryway of the home features a curving staircase, with a large, octagonal carved walnut newel post at the base, turned spindles, and scrolled stair brackets. The handrail is constructed of seven pieces of solid, hand-carved walnut, each individually numbered and butt-joined together. The first floor features marble fireplaces in the Italianate style in the front and main parlors, and a brick fireplace in the formal sitting room. The two main doors are solid wood with oval, beveled glass cutouts, in the Victorian style. All doors have transom windows above. A narrow stairway to the former maid's quarters on the second floor is concealed within an interior wall. The unique floor in the formal dining room consists of alternating slats of oak and walnut. Light fixtures throughout much of the house are the original gas futures which were subsequently converted to electric.228x228px Soon after construction, Jarvis made alterations to the house in the interest of gaining living space for his growing family. None of these alterations changed the fundamental structure and, as owner of Troy's lumber yard, his unencumbered access to fine construction materials enabled his ability to accomplish structural alterations with matching materials and little impact. Subsequent owners added an approximately 20 foot addition to the rear of the home and a detached garage, both of which are complementary to the original structure. The grounds are heavily wooded, dominated by black walnut and white oak, but also containing an abundance of unique species‚Äîa previous owner was an ardent arborist. William W. Jarvis lived in the house until his death in 1927, when his daughter, Bessie Jarvis Keller, took over residency. The house remained in the family for almost 100 years, and the current owners are only the third owners of the home outside of the Jarvis family. === Recognition === The home was named on the National Register of Historic Places on 3 Feb 1988, is the recipient of the Historic National Road‚Äôs Art & Architecture Plaque as one of the ‚ÄúTop 100 Art & Architecture sites on the National Road‚Äù,‚ÄúArt and Architecture Guide, National Road of Illinois‚Äù.

The events came as part of the aftermath of the Tunisian Revolution which ousted the country's longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, followed by a general election which saw Ennahda win a plurality alongside Moncef Marzouki's allied Congress for the Republic (CPR). The crisis gradually subsided when Prime Minister Ali Laarayedh resigned and a new constitution was adopted in January 2014. Many incidents fueled the protests including the assassination of prominent secular leaders Chokri Belaid on 6 February 2013 and Mohamed Brahmi on 25 July. Other factors include the government's failure to deal with the rise of hardline Salafist groups including Ansar al-Sharia which is widely believed to be behind the assassinations, as well as many other attacks on security personnel and state institutions. This prompted the government to list the group as a terrorist organization amid growing pressure by opposition groups. The protests intensified on 23 October 2013, when thousands of demonstrators took to the streets calling for the government to step down hours before talks between the ruling Islamist coalition and opposition leaders that concluded with Ennahda promising to resign in three weeks ending a months-old political deadlock. In exchange for Ennahda's resignation, the opposition agreed to pass a constitution in which freedom of worship will be guaranteed but in the same time gave a greater role to religion in public life than before. == Background  Tunisian revolution of 2011 === A period of civil resistance characterized by riots and unrest took place throughout the nation following the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2011 and fueled by high unemployment, corruption, political repression and poor living conditions forcing President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country ending his 23-year rule over Tunisia. This was followed by the suspension then dissolution of the former ruling RCD party and the resignation of Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi amid further public pressure. === Constituent Assembly and new government === Ennahda leader Rashid al-Ghannushi. Following the revolution, an election for a constituent assembly which had 217 seats was held on 23 October 2011 that saw the Ennahda Movement led by Rashid al-Ghannushi win a plurality in the election (41% of the seats) closely followed by the Congress for the Republic (CPR) led by Moncef Marzouki (13.4% of the seats) who was later elected as President of Tunisia by the Constituent Assembly. The Ennahda Movement had long been banned in the political spectrum by former President Ben Ali, most notably in the 1989 elections where some of its members had to run independently due to government repression. Two years after the elections Ben Ali jailed nearly 25,000 of its activists with Ennahda militants responding by attacking the ruling party's headquarters killing one person and splashing acid on others. Following the revolution, it described itself to be a \\"moderate Islamist\\" party by advocating democracy and recognizing political pluralism and dialogue with the West. Its supporters back then regarded the party as an example of how a balance can be struck between modernity and Islamism while its critics viewed it as a threat to secularism in Tunisia, which was often regarded as the most secular Arab state. In addition, leading Ennahda figures have repeatedly tried to reassure worrying Tunisians that it would protect civil rights and democracy. However, the movement was accused to have been shaped by Qutbism and is highly influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt and many of its secular opponents pointing out to acid attacks on female students in the 1980s for dressing \\"indecently\\" as a warning sign from Islamist repression. It is also believed that Rashid al-Ghannushi himself, the co- founder of the party had a long history of violent thinking. Following Ben Ali's ouster, the party was legalized and Ghannushi was welcomed by a crowd of 1,000 people upon his return to the country after 22 years of exile in Europe.As Tunisians Cheer Egypt, Islamist Leader Returns , NPR, 30 January 2011 Ghannushi later formed an alliance called the Troika with two secular political parties which are Moncef Marzouki's CPR and the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties. == Issues  Political assassinations === Assassinated Tunisian politicians Chokri Belaid (on the left) and Mohamed Brahmi (on the right). The protests were fueled by high scale political assassinations, most notably the murder of Democratic Patriots' Movement leader Chokri Belaid on 6 February 2013 and of People's Movement leader and member of parliament Mohamed Brahmi on 25 July 2013 who were both members of the same left-wing coalition. Both murders were blamed on Islamic extremists with Boubacar Hakim, a hardline Salafist who is being sought for under suspicion of smuggling weapons from Libya, as the prime suspect.  Assassination of Chokri Belaid  On 6 February 2013, Chokri Belaid was leaving his house on his way to the headquarters of the Tunisian General Labour Union for a meeting with its secretary general when he was shot four times by a gunman who later took off on a motorbike driven by a second accomplice. Belaid was quickly rushed to the nearest clinic but the doctors were unable to save him and he was pronounced dead at the clinic. Current secretary general of Belaid's party and leader of the Popular Front, Ziad Lakhdhar, said in a statement: \\"Chokri Belaid was killed today by four bullets to the head and chest ... doctors told us that he has died. This is a sad day for Tunisia\\". It was also reported that Belaid had received several death threats prior to his assassination with many of his supporters blaming Ennahda for failing to protect him following those threats and an incident targeting fellow party members a week earlier. Belaid had always attacked the \\"Leagues for the Protection of the Revolution\\" (LPR), a government-aligned nationwide organization that claims to root out remnants of Ben Ali's regime but are accused of thuggish behaviour towards opposition groups, and he claimed that there are groups inside Ennahda that incite violence and that the LPR's committees are tools used by the government and its allied Islamists to get rid of the party's leftist coalition. The night before the incident, he appeared in a political talk show on Tunisia's Nessma TV and said; \\"Rashid Ghannushi considers the leagues to be the conscience of the nation, so the defense of the authors of violence is clear. All those who oppose Ennahda become the targets of violence.\\" Following his assassination, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the Interior Ministry building in Tunis carrying Belaid's coffin and shouted \\"The people demand the fall of the regime\\". The day turned violent when some of the protesters threw rocks with the police using tear gas to disperse the rallies.  Assassination of Mohamed Brahmi  On 25 July 2013, Mohamed Brahmi was shot dead in his car in front of his home in Tunis by unknown gunmen on a motorbike in front of his wife Mbarka and his daughter Belkis who were both shocked after the tragedy. The incident occurred on the day Tunisia was set to celebrate Republic Day when the country was celebrating the 56th anniversary of the beginning of Habib Bourguiba's presidency. He was later transported to Charles Nicolle Hospital after being paraded down Avenue Habib Bourguiba by thousands of his supporters including relatives and fellow party members who demonstrated and blamed the incumbent Ennahda Party and their followers for the assassination while shouting \\"Down with the rule of the Islamists!\\". They were also joined by his wife and daughter in front of the hospital where he died.Daragahi, Borzou. Salafist identified as suspect in Tunisia assassination. Financial Times. 26 July 2013. Hundreds of supporters also protested in Brahmi's hometown of Sidi Bouzid. During Brahmi's funeral, protesters called for the government to be toppled, while police fired tear gas on them. According to a statement made by the Tunisian Prosecutor regarding the autopsy of Brahmi's corpse; \\"The deceased had been hit with fourteen gunshots: six in his torso and eight in his left leg\\". Brahmi's killing was condemned by many international leaders including UN Human Rights chief Navi Pillay and President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz who said in a statement; \\"I am deeply saddened to learn of the despicable murder of our colleague Mohamed Brahmi. I condemn this assassination in the strongest terms.\\"  Investigations  Investigations had been issued following both assassinations and Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou announced at a news conference that the same 9mm automatic weapon that killed Belaid also killed Brahmi. The Chokri Belaid defense committee spokesman Tayeb Oqaili claimed on 2 October that, according to official documents, Abdulhakim Belhadj of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group was involved in the killings of both Belaid and Brahmi, pointing to links between the LIFG, Ansar al Sharia and the Ennahda Movement. The left-wing leader maintained that Belhadj apparently intended to carry out terrorist attacks in Tunisia, and trained the Ansar al-Sharia cell that killed the opposition politicians, all under close observation by Ennahda leaders Rashid al-Ghannushi, Hamadi Jebali and Samir Dilou, among others. On 19 September 2013, Tunisia's interior minister told lawmakers the CIA informed authorities Brahmi was a target and said there'd been a \\"failure\\" in the security services' response. He announced an investigation had been opened. === Rise of extremism === The post-revolution Tunisia has witnessed an unprecedented rise in extremism th increasing militant activity, weapons smuggling from Libya and involvement in the political scene. They range from self-claimed moderate parties like Ennahda to the more hard-line Ansar al- Sharia and Hizb ut-Tahrir. Most of them denounced violence as a way to reach their goals and have advocated democracy. However, some have been engaged in numerous clashes with security forces mainly in the south and north-west of the country resulting in numerous casualties on both sides in a conflict that is often related to the wider Maghreb insurgency. Several attacks by extremist factions took place in the Mount Chaambi national park on the border with Algeria. On 29 July 2013, a military convoy was ambushed by militants resulting in a number of deaths with many of the victims found beheaded and others mutilated. A week later, the Tunisian Armed Forces responded with an army offensive and air strikes to clear out the mountains of Islamist elements responsible for the assaults. One of the most prominent extremist organizations is Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia (AST) that was highly involved in the political scene before being listed by the government as a terrorist group. The group was founded in April 2011 by Abu Iyadh al-Tunisi, who had previously co-founded the Tunisian Combat Group (TCG) in Afghanistan with Tarek Maaroufi. Unlike Al-Qaeda and other like-minded groups in the Arab world, the AST claims to be non-violent and engages in charitable activity as a way of gaining support providing food, medicine and clothing while at the same time preaching mainstream Salafist thinking. However, they have been involved in numerous violent incidents such as their alleged role in the storming of the US embassy in Tunis and an attack on a television station that showed the animated film Persepolis because it depicted God while repeatedly calling for the Islamization of the Tunisian media.Radical Islamists urge bigger role for Islam in Tunisia Reuters Lin Noueihed They have also carried out attacks on art exhibits, premises that sell alcohol and ransacked ancient shrines it considered un-Islamic. == Timeline == * 6 February 2013 ‚Äì Following news of Chokri Belaid's assassination earlier in the day by unknown gunmen, thousands of his supporters took to the streets across the nation. The National Guard fired tear gas at protesters who barricaded Avenue Habib Bourguiba using bins, coffee tables and barbed wire. Other violent protests erupted in other parts of the country including Mezzouna where people torched the premises of the Ennahda party, Gafsa where the party's offices were ransacked and in Sidi Bouzid, the birthplace of the 2011 revolution, where 4,000 demonstrators reportedly flooded the city, burning tyres and throwing rocks at security forces prompting clashes with the protesters. In an evening televised address, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali announced that he would dissolve the government and said that he \\"decided to form a government of competent nationals without political affiliation.\\" * 7 February 2013 ‚Äì Tunisia's governing Islamists rejected Jebali's plan to dismiss the government without consulting other party members. \\"The prime minister did not ask the opinion of his party,\\" said Abdelhamid Jelassi, Ennahda's vice-president. * 8 February 2013 ‚Äì Hundreds of thousands of mourners, gathered at the funeral of Chokri Belaid, were disrupted by a number of young men armed with machetes who reportedly attempted to steal the protesters' phones and cameras and set fire to cars, prompting the police to use tear gas to disperse the demonstrators who clashed with them outside the cemetery.

Hours before crisis talks between the Islamist-led government and the mainly secular opposition, thousands of Tunisians doubtful about the Ennahda's intentions rallied across the country calling for the government's immediate resignation. However, talks have been delayed to Friday following clashes between Islamist militants and security forces that left six policemen dead. * 24 October 2013 ‚Äì The UGTT called for a general strike in Sidi Bouzid following the deaths of six police officers the previous day. * 25 October 2013 ‚Äì Talks between the government and the opposition began, with discussions over a new and peaceful political transition. * 28 October 2013 ‚Äì Ennahda leader, Rashid al-Ghannushi, said in a televised interview that the party may be willing to give up the government but not power. * 27 November 2013 ‚Äì Three cities were hit by general strikes in protest over economic difficulties.

Out of 21 parties participating in the dialogue, 18 were supposed to participate in the election of the new PM with 9 voting in favor of Jomaa. Seven had withdrawn, including Nidaa Tounes, due to their opposition of Jomaa's candidacy because he was a member of the governing cabinet serving as Minister of Industry. In addition, two parties voted for the runner-up and three were absent. * 26 January 2014 ‚Äì A 146-article draft constitution was completed.

It was produced by Punk Cinema, Cowboy Films and BBC Films and was released in the UK on 18 September 2015 by Vertigo Films. The film is a fictional take on the young William Shakespeare's search for fame and fortune, as written by Laurence Rickard and Ben Willbond and directed by Richard Bracewell who co- produced with Tony Bracewell, Alasdair Flind and Charles Steel. It features the six lead performers playing several different roles each including Mathew Baynton, Martha Howe-Douglas, Ben Willbond, Simon Farnaby, Jim Howick and Laurence Rickard. Bill has received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed $968,534 worldwide. The film also received nominations for the Evening Standard British Film Award for Award for Comedy and the Into Film Award for Family Film of the Year. ==Plot== Bill is set during Shakespeare's \\"lost years\\"‚Äîthe crucial period, long a mystery to scholars, covering his rise from obscurity in Stratford-upon-Avon to fame as a playwright in London. According to the official synopsis, the film will tell the \\"real story\\" of what happens when \\"hopeless lute player Bill Shakespeare leaves his family and home to follow his dream. It‚Äôs a tale of murderous kings, spies, lost loves, and a plot to blow up Queen Elizabeth I.\\" Writer Rickard further explained that this \\"very different\\" version of the future Bard has already tried \\"everything from contemporary dance to playing lute in a band. He's never found his calling.\\" ==Cast== The six members of the starring troupe have been announced as playing 40 total roles, in the manner of the Monty Python films. Confirmed named roles are listed below: * Mathew Baynton as William Shakespeare * Martha Howe-Douglas as Anne Hathaway * Ben Willbond as King Philip II of Spain * Simon Farnaby as Juan, Earl of Croydon * Jim Howick as Gabriel, Christopher Marlowe * Laurence Rickard as Lope, Sir Francis Walsingham It was subsequently confirmed at the 2014 Cannes film festival that Homeland star Damian Lewis would be joining the cast as Sir Richard Hawkins.Listed in the Internet Movie Database. Other supporting actors include: ==Production== The starring cast in York Minster. L-R: Laurence Rickard, Simon Farnaby, Mathew Baynton (as \\"Bill\\" Shakespeare), Martha Howe-Douglas, Ben Willbond and Jim Howick BBC Films announced Bill on 13 May 2013, as a co-production with fellow UK production companies Punk Cinema and Cowboy Films. Head of BBC Films Christine Langan said that \\"we‚Äôre thrilled [to be] making the first film starring this team of incredibly talented and popular British comedy writers and performers.\\" In November of the same year ScreenDaily.com reported that the BFI (British Film Institute) Film Fund had invested ¬£1 million in the production, with further undisclosed amounts coming from BBC Films, LipSync and Screen Yorkshire, through its Yorkshire Content Fund. Principal filming began on 10 February 2014 at locations around Yorkshire, including York Minster, Skipton Castle, Marske-by-the-Sea, Bolton Castle and Selby Abbey. Other filming locations included Stowe School, Caroline Gardens Chapel in Peckham, London, and Weald and Downland Open Air Museum in West Sussex. The closing scenes were filmed at Shakespeare's Globe, a modern recreation of the theatre where many of Shakespeare's plays were first performed. Former Horrible Histories co-stars Rickard and Willbond are credited with the Bill screenplay, and are also the top-billed performers along with the four other members of the HH starring cast (Baynton, Howe-Douglas, Farnaby and Howick). Despite this connection, and sharing a similar subject matter, the film has no official affiliation with the earlier TV series. It is the second project (after Yonderland) created by the sextet as a means to continue working together as a troupe after Horrible Histories ceased production in 2012, while maintaining the familiar character- and-costume driven comedy style. Making the move to film was \\"a bit scary,\\" Willbond said, \\"but we cooked up a really nice plot.\\" Rickard described the overall tone of the new project as \\"a hundred different brands of idiocy, really... We staunchly defend the idiocy.\\" In contrast to the conscientious grounding in accuracy that was the trademark of Horrible Histories, Bill is by design a purely imaginary tale. In the initial press release for the film, the co-writers noted that \\"We're playing with history, just as Shakespeare did, for the entertainment of the audience.\\" Commenting on the choice of subject, Rickard added that in fact \\"the joy of the \\"lost years\\" is we can tell a fun story without trampling on the facts‚Äîit gives us licence to take William Shakespeare on a truly ridiculous caper, yet end with him becoming the man the world knows.\\" The first full-length trailer for the film was released in December 2014, at which point the film's theatrical release date ‚Äì originally scheduled for late February 2015 ‚Äì was confirmed to have been delayed until 27 March the same year. This was subsequently revised again ‚Äì with no official explanation ‚Äì to 21 August. Vertigo Films announced on 12 August 2015 that it would be releasing Bill in the UK after previous distributor Koch Media had closed its UK film distribution business. Vertigo Films co-owner Rupert Preston told Screen International that ‚ÄúThe film is really good fun and plays well with both adults and kids. It‚Äôs clever, bright and great British entertainment.‚Äù ==Soundtrack== The film's score was composed by Andrew Hewitt.

The Franciscan Hospitaller Sisters of the Immaculate Conception are members of a Roman Catholic religious institute of consecrated women, which was founded in Portugal in 1871. They follow the Rule of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis. and, as the term ‚Äúhospitaller‚Äù indicates, focus their ministries on a spirit of medical care. Their charism emphasizes hospitality and service under the model of the Good Samaritan. In this congregation, the postnominal initials used after each Sister's name is \\"F.H.I.C.\\" The Sisters‚Äô mission, as expressed by their foundress, Mother Maria Clara, is ‚Äúto do good where good needs to be done‚Äù. These words have paved the way for a large variety of apostolates including education, catechesis, healthcare, pastoral work, assisting the elderly, missionary work, running orphanages, assisting immigrants, and assisting the homeless. The local needs where each convent is located oftentimes determine the apostolates of the sisters who live there, although generally each sister is also able to choose her preferred field of ministry to carry out. Ordinarily the habits that the sisters wear are grey, but those sisters working in the healthcare field don white habits while they are working. The daily prayer life of the sisters in this order consists of Mass, an hour of Eucharistic adoration, Liturgy of the Hours, and the rosary. ==History== On June 15, 1843 Lib√¢nia do Carmo Galv√£o Mexia de Moura Telles de Albuquerque was born in Amadora, Portugal. This third child of seven in a noble and devout Christian family had a very happy childhood until 1856 and 1857 when she suddenly lost her parents to a cholera and yellow fever epidemic. At age 14 she entering a boarding school for orphaned nobility until the Daughters of Charity who taught her were expelled from Portugal in 1882 due to the anticlerical laws then passed. For five years Telles e Albuquerque then lived in the palace of the Marquis of Valada. In 1869 at the age of 26, she entered religious life as a Capuchin nun, receiving the name \\"Sister Maria Clara of the Infant Jesus\\". She soon desired to form a new community that would serve the people of Portugal who were wounded in a time of political unrest. Supported by Fr. Raimundo dos Anjos Beir√£o, she traveled to Calais, France, for her novitiate formation under the Franciscan Hospitaller Sisters of that city, preparing to found a new community after her novitiate has been completed. After professing her vows in France on April 14, 1871, she founded the first house of her new community, called the \\"Congregation of the Hospitaller Sisters of the Poor for the Love of God\\", in Lisbon on May 3, 1871. Only five years later, on March 27, 1876, the congregation was approved by Pope Pius IX. Despite many trials, the new religious institute continued to grow rapidly with more and more convents being established. The large number of sick, poor, and orphaned people found relief in the houses which the Sisters opened to shelter and care for them. In 1886 the Sisters expanded their service to the Portuguese colony of Goa, now part of India. On December 1, 1899, Mother Maria Clara died. Her remains are in the crypt of the chapel of the general motherhouse in Lisbon, where many people still come to pray and ask her intercession. She was beatified on May 21, 2011 by Pope Benedict XVI, and her canonization process continues. ==Legacy== This international congregation is now represented in fifteen countries. ===United States=== In the United States, the sisters are located only in the state of California, residing in the Dioceses of San Jose, Fresno, and Monterey. The Hospitaller Sisters first came to the United States in 1960 in order to aid Portuguese immigrants. These sisters ran and taught in schools, but their education and catechesis work has come to consist of teaching Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults and Faith Formation, or Confraternity of Christian Doctrine. The majority of the California sisters now are involved in healthcare. In Los Banos, where eleven sisters now live, the sisters run a non-profit house of residential care and skilled nursing for the elderly. This facility, called New Bethany, after the village of Bethany that Jesus stayed in, was opened in 1999. The sisters attend to their patients' physical needs, and to their spiritual needs through frequent public prayer and liturgy. The sisters in the three California houses also visit the sick and bring them Holy Communion. The United States province is the smallest of the fifteen CONFHIC provinces worldwide, but has had a renewed interest in their lifestyle amongst young women who are discerning a religious vocation. The convent in San Jose is designated as the house of formation for American vocations. ==References * http://www.confhic.com/ Category:Catholic religious institutes established in the 19th century Category:Catholic female orders and societies Category:Catholic nursing orders Category:Catholic teaching orders Category:Congregations of Franciscan sisters Category:Religious organizations established in 1871 ","title":"Franciscan Hospitaller Sisters of the Immaculate Conception"},{"id":"41983846","text":"Nicolae Robu (born May 28, 1955) is a Romanian politician, engineer and owner of ACS Poli Timi»ôoara football club.

Its full title was \\"An Act for raising Money by a Poll and otherwise, to enable His Majesty to enter into an actual War against the French King, and for prohibiting several French Commodities\\". The Whig MP William Harbord in a speech claimed that \\"the French abstract one million yearly from us in trade\\" and that while this went on the French would govern English counsels. The solution was to \\"make a law to prohibit French trade: you need no wine and few of his commodities; and France will grow poor, and we shall grow rich\\".W. J. Ashley, Surveys: Historic and Economic (New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1966), p. 278. Therefore, a Bill was introduced by another Whig MP William Sacheverell embodying these protectionist proposals. The beginning of the Act read: > And forasmuch as it hath beene by long Experience found that the Importing > of French Wines Brandy Linnen Silke Salt and Paper and other Commodities of > the Growth Product or Manufacture of the Territories and Dominions of the > French King, hath much exhausted the Treasure of this Nation, lessened the > Value of the Native Commodities and Manufactures thereof and caused great > detriment to this Kingdome in generall Bee it further enacted by the > Authoritie aforesaid That from and after the Twentyeth of March One thousand > six hundred seaventy seaven Noe French Wine Vinegar Brandy Linnen Cloath > Silks Salt.

In his Speech from the Throne opening the parliamentary session of 1679, King Charles II lamented \\"the loss I sustain by the prohibition of French Wines and Brandy, which turns only to my prejudice, and to the great advantage of the French\\".Ashley, p. 281. In the opinion of the economic historian William Ashley, the Act was the \\"real starting-point in the history of Whig policy in the matter of trade\\".Ashley, p. 271. It was regarded by writers in the eighteenth century as a turning point in the economic history of England but by the nineteenth century had been forgotten.Ashley, p. 271. The Act was intended to expire in three years' time but as Parliament was not sitting it remained on the statute book. Upon the accession of James II a new Parliament was elected that was strongly Tory and therefore the Act was repealed by the Importation Act 1685 (1 Ja. 2 c. 6).Ashley, p. 282. However the Whigs criticised its repeal, with one Whig writer lamenting that \\"an inundation of French commodities to the value of above four millions sterling, within the compass of less than three years, whereby all the evils formerly complained of were renewed, insomuch that the nation would have bee soon beggared, had it not been for the happy revolution in the year 1688, when all commerce with France was effectually barred\\" by the Trade with France Act 1688.Ashley, p. 283. ==Notes== Category:1678 in law Category:Acts of the Parliament of England Category:1678 in England Category:Protectionism ","title":"Prohibition of 1678"},{"id":"41984166","text":"Harry C. \\"Bud\\" Mallott (June 11, 1917 ‚Äì January 28, 1996) was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, representing Clermont County from 1973‚Äì1990.

Contained within the Manzanar concentration camp in Owens Valley, California, it held a total of 101 orphans from June 1942 to September 1945. ==Incarceration of Japanese Americans== Civilian Exclusion Order posted in San Francisco Issued a little over month after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, on February 19, 1942, Executive Order 9066 authorized military commanders to designate military zones from which \\"any or all persons may be excluded.\\" On March 2, 1942, General John L. DeWitt and the Western Defense Command issued a public proclamation that established Military Areas 1 and 2, encompassing all of California, the western halves of Washington and Oregon, and Southern Arizona. Although the executive order had not specified who was to be excluded, DeWitt's proclamation made it clear that Japanese American residents would be required to vacate the newly created exclusion zone, and Public Law 503, passed by Congress on March 20, 1942 and signed into law by the President the following day, created penalties of up to $5,000 and one year in prison for violating the military restrictions.Brian Niiya. \\"Public Law 503\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 22 May 2014). Approximately 5,000 Japanese Americans moved through a short-lived \\"voluntary evacuation\\" program ‚Äî many of them into what they were assured would remain a \\"Free Zone\\" in eastern California but would later fall within the scope of exclusion ‚Äî however, most remained in their homes while they waited for further information.Brian Niiya. \\"Voluntary evacuation,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 4 Apr 2014). The first civilian exclusion order was issued on March 24, 1942, and in April, Alaska was under military orders to evacuate its Japanese residents as well (due to the territory's small Japanese population, it was not designated with any exclusion zones). Over the next five months, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans were transported from the West Coast and Southern Arizona to isolated inland camps. ==The orphans of Children's Village== Manzanar Children's Village superintendent Harry Matsumoto with several orphan children. (\\"Mr. Matsumoto and group of children\\" by Ansel Adams, courtesy of Library of Congress Prints & Photographs Division, LC-DIG-ppprs-00362) Prior to 1942, most orphans of Japanese ancestry lived either with relatives or foster families, or were housed in one of three California orphanages.Catherine Irwin. \\"Manzanar Children's Village,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed Feb 19, 2014) The Shonien and Maryknoll Home in Los Angeles and the Salvation Army Home in San Francisco cared specifically for children of Japanese ancestry, although the mainstream institutions where white children were typically placed would from time to time accept a Japanese American child.Helen Whitney, \\"Care of Homeless Children of Japanese Ancestry during Evacuation\\" (M.A. thesis, University of California, Berkeley, 1948), 13. About two-thirds of the orphans who would reside in Children's Village during the war came from these three homes, and several Shonien, Maryknoll and Salvation Army staff members would serve as their caretakers in camp.Emmy E. Werner. Through the Eyes of Innocents: Children Witness World War II (Basic Books, 2001), 86. Others were not orphans before the war. Following Japan's December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the FBI carried out large-scale arrests of Japanese Americans suspected of fifth column activity, mainly Issei community leaders and business owners (including Shonien director Rokuichi KusumotoFord Kuramoto.

Because their foster parents were not subject to exclusion from the West Coast, these children were either extracted from their homes after officials learned that they were part or full Japanese, or, influenced by propaganda that promised strict penalties for harboring Japanese, their guardians turned them over to authorities themselves.Renee Tawa. \\"Childhood Lost: The Orphans of Manzanar,\\" Los Angeles Times March 11, 1997. Half of the children confined in the Manzanar orphanage were under age seven when they arrived; 29 percent were less than four years old. Nineteen of these 101 orphans were of mixed- race heritage, some with as little as one-eighth Japanese ancestry, including several children who were unaware of their racial background until army authorities identified them by scouring confidential orphanage and federal records.James L.

The Assistant Director of the Shonein, Lillian Iida, a 29-year-old Nisei woman, fought against the Army plan to divide the orphans equally amongst the staff and send each staff member, with orphans, to an internment camp as a new family unit. The result of her opposition to the Army's plan was the building of the Children's Village at Manzanar. Lillian and her new husband, Harry Matsumoto, then ran the Children's Village for the early years of the war. The nuns of the Maryknoll Home managed to find foster homes outside the exclusion zone for 26 of the 33 orphans in their charge. The 61 remaining children in Maryknoll, Shonien and the Salvation Army Home were slated for removal. On June 23, 1942, they were bused, under armed guard, with several adult caretakers from Los Angeles to Manzanar. Over the next few months, approximately thirty more children from Washington, Oregon and Alaska, mostly orphans who had been living with non-Japanese foster families, would arrive in Manzanar. Infants born to unmarried mothers in other WRA camps were also sent to Children's Village over the next three years. Barracks at the Manzanar concentration camp. (\\"Barracks with Mt. Williamson\\" by Dorothea Lange) Children's Village consisted of three barracks ‚Äî one for staff apartments and communal areas, and two that contained the children's dormitories ‚Äî located across from barracks 28 and 29, near the hospital, at the northwest end of the Manzanar complex. With running water and independent kitchen and bathroom facilities, the orphanage was largely self-contained and operated separately from the rest of the camp. Harry and Lillian Matsumoto, social workers who accompanied the Shonien orphans and served as superintendents of Children's Village, led the children in a daily schedule of breakfast, a Christian service, school, homework, recreation, and dinner. Younger children went to bed at 7:30 p.m., and a curfew of 9:00 p.m. was enforced for the rest of the Village. The children had very little interaction with other Japanese Americans in Manzanar. Because the orphanage facilities were more self- sufficient than the family barracks, there was little need to leave the Village. They ate inside the orphanage with their caretakers, separate from other camp inmates, who ate their meals in communal mess halls assigned by block. Additionally, they were ostracized by other children, who had been told by their parents not to play with the orphans.Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston. Farewell to Manzanar (Random House, 2012), 114. This isolation, and the fact that many orphans came to Manzanar together and had known each other and their staff guardians for years, made the closure of Children's Village at the end of the war especially difficult. ==After the war== In late 1944, Roosevelt issued Public Proclamation 21, allowing Japanese Americans to return to the West Coast starting in January 1945, and most of the WRA-run concentration camps closed over the course of that year.Brian Niiya. \\"Return to West Coast,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 4 Apr 2014). When word came that Manzanar would begin to shut down, camp officials and orphanage staff began the process of determining where to send the children. Most were returned to the group homes they had been taken from or sent to live with relatives or guardians. Some, whose records had been lost during their removal or did not have an appointed guardian, remained in Children's Village while authorities attempted to find relatives or at least determine the child's legal residence. These unclaimed children were placed with adoptive parents or sent to foster homes and other institutions when the Children's Village closed in September 1945. The history of the Manzanar Children's Village was largely unknown, even within the Japanese American community, until the late 1980s, when Francis Honda, an orphan confined in Children's Village during the war, gave testimony of his experiences at Manzanar for the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians hearings.Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. Personal Justice Denied. Manzanar Children's Village is no longer standing, but there is a National Park Service-operated informational slide about the orphanage at its former site, and the Children's Village Oral History Project, archived at the Center for Oral and Public History at California State University, Fullerton, contains interviews with former residents and staff members. ==ReferencesFurther information== Children's Village Oral History Project.

This design utilizes a centralized controller to decide which access point (AP) will be used to communicate with a client device. This method allows the network to maintain a higher level of control over the communication medium than does multiple-channel architecture, which allows client devices to determine which APs to communicate with. == Principles == Single-channel architecture is based on a principle of \\"virtual cells\\". All APs joined to a virtual cell use the same wireless channel and identify themselves with the same basic service set identifier (BSSID, i.e. a MAC address). The APs in a cell are managed by a centralized Wireless LAN controller (WLC) that coordinates the APs such that APs/transmissions do not interfere with one another. From a client's point of view, a virtual cell appears as a single AP. Multiple virtual cells can co-exist, with each virtual cell having its own BSSID and channel. This topology effectively simulates a multiple-channel architecture and can be used to reduce channel congestion in environments with high AP density and overlapping signal range. For example, in a classroom with two cells, clients can be directed to associate with one or the other cell, leaving more bandwidth available to the clients on each channel. == Benefits == The biggest advantage of a single-channel architecture is that there is a zero handoff time for roaming clients. In multiple-channel architecture, as a client device travels around the physical location of the network, it will change which AP it is associated with. Since each AP in a multiple-channel architecture has its own BSSID, a client needs to re- authenticate itself every time it associates with a new AP. In comparison, in a single-channel architecture, since the client only sees one AP, it is up to the central controller to decide when to communicate with the client using a different AP. This means that the handoff can occur behind the scenes and is completely invisible to the client. With a zero handoff time, there is no interruption to the client, which is ideal when a client is utilizing voice or video applications and does not have bandwidth in reserve to deal with the re- authentication process. When implemented properly, single-channel architecture eliminates most, if not all, shared-channel interference by carefully regulating which APs are transmitting and preventing APs which would interfere with each other from transmitting at the same time. By knowing the transmit power of each radio, the central controller can make a good estimation of which APs would and would not interfere with each other, and regulate them when a possible interference scenario occurs. Another potential advantage of single-channel architecture is the reduced planning required. Since every AP will use the same channel, there is no channel planning required (except to initially decide which channel is to be used). Since the controller works to eliminate any interference, it doesn't matter where the APs are placed, as long as there is adequate signal coverage and the controller is aware of the placement and capabilities of the APs. == Disadvantages == The algorithms and settings used in single-channel architecture are delicately balanced. If information regarding AP placement or capabilities is incorrectly reported to the controller, then the controller could make an incorrect determination of which APs can transmit at the same time, which could potentially increase interference rather than decrease it. Also, since every AP transmit on the same channel, APs cannot change channel to avoid external interference. Thus, in the event of external interference, the client throughput would suffer. While the controller's settings could be changed such that all APs use a different channel, but that manual configuration would negate the reduced planning advantage of single-channel architecture. Another point to consider is that with single-channel architecture, as with wireless communications generally, increasing AP density is not always better than having fewer APs placed further apart. Placing more than one AP in a single space, a classroom for instance, will not increase the available bandwidth for clients. This is because, when multiple devices on the same channel are in range of one another, only one of them can transmit at a time. In contrast, in multiple- channel architecture, neighboring APs can be on different channels and can therefore transmit simultaneously. While multiple virtual cells could be created to avoid congestion, this has the same disadvantages as a multiple- channel architecture in that it increases management complexity and handoff time for roaming clients is no longer zero. ==See also== * Multiple-channel architecture (MCA) ==References== https://badger-fi.com/2016/08/31/single- channel-architecture-and-virtual-cell-and-its-effect-on-co-channel-contention/ https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/solution- guides/deployment-guide-infrastructure-secure-access.pdf https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/_media/isrm/articole/aruba_single_channel_wp.pdf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_7IBx4Hhsw https://praveenkumar4blog.wordpress.com/2017/05/01/single-channel- architecture-vs-multi-channel-architecture/ Category:Wireless networking standards ","title":"Single-channel architecture"},{"id":"41984377","text":"Macrobrochis albifascia is a moth of the family Erebidae.

Each of the Bakugan are associated with a different element ranging from Pyrus (the attribute of fire), Subterra (the attribute of earth), Haos (the attribute of light), Darkus (the attribute of darkness), Aquos (the attribute of water), and Ventus (the attribute of wind). ==Known Bakugan== Each of the known Bakugan are sorted into different categories: ==Battle Brawlers Bakugan== The following Bakugan are owned by the Battle Brawlers: === \\"Drago\\" === The Bakugan main protagonist in the series (and also main protagonist of series among with Dan), and also Dan's partner who resembles a dragon. Drago is the leader of the Bakugan with strong convictions and morals, and is arguably the most powerful of all the bakugan. Together with Dan, they set out to defeat the Doom Beings, and rebuild the Perfect Core of Vestroia. He has the ability to radiate intense heat in battle dissolving everything around him. He is equipped with high intelligence. He is limited in battle mobility, but compensates for it through powerful strikes. He is able to infinitely evolve on his own and with every evolution it makes him stronger and it brings him one step closer to the Perfect Core. Drago was killed when the chevralkin force launched a war on vestoria and also lost his friend Dan Kuso during the war. and just after 10 minutes after he is slain and killed, Drago is thrown in the lake of fire and the fires of hell along with Dan and never comes back and remains gone. :* Delta Dragonoid II :: Drago's first evolution during Dan, Runo, and Marucho's battle against Julio, Klaus, and Chan Lee in Drago's On Fire. He fought against Dual Hydranoid, and lost, sending him to the Doom Dimension. In the Doom Dimension he battled Apollonir, after defeating him, he had to defeat Shun, Julie, Runo, and Marucho. He has three sleek horns and a hard plated armor in ball mode with chrome rings. He has an extra set of wings and a pitchfork tail. :* Ultimate Dragonoid :: Drago's second evolution when he defeated Storm Skyress. He has markings on his wings, which are now split, and he also has two horns that are merged. He was also used to defeat Alpha Hydranoid. :* Infinity Dragonoid :: Drago's third evolution (as an ultimate Bakugan) when he absorbed the Infinity Core from Wavern. He used it to absorb the Silent Core from Naga, becoming the Perfect Dragonoid completely, and later transforming himself into Vestroia's core. :* Neo Dragonoid :: Drago's regeneration in New Vestroia, after the Ancient Soldiers separated him from the Perfect Core in Invasion of the Vestals. Although he is weaker than his previous form, he still is one of the strongest bakugan. He still has a connection to the Core, and can gain new abilities from it during emergencies. When Dan lost his battle to Spectra and Helios, he also lost Drago and because of his forced defection, his color change from a pure red to mixture of red and black (turning him into a dark and corrupted Hex Dragonoid). Drago has now also lost all his free will in this form and his pupils have been erased. Drago gained the ability to change into any chosen attribute at the cost of his physical health. NOTE: As Drago has a portion from Vestroia's Core, he can evolve more of four times than in the first season. :* Cross Dragonoid :: Drago's next evolution when he inherits the Pyrus attribute energy from Apollonir in Six Degrees of Destruction, sadly Apollonir died. He lost the Pyrus energy when he, Helios, and Wilda lost a battle against Farbros and Dryoid. :* Helix Dragonoid :: Drago's next evolution when he absorbed the 6 Attribute energies from the BT System in Exodus. This evolution also marks the first anthropomorphic design of Drago. He can now combine with Battle Gear (JetKor), and his Dragon Hummer abilities gives him super speed. His Battle Gear is JetKor, a dual cannon blaster which can shoot an energy blast and defeat opponents. A lock on beam from the green lens freezes the opponent before the blaster attacks. It combines the two blaster beams into one enormous blast. It was used by Dan to combine with Drago in Fusion Confusion. The finished version was shown in episode 46. Unlike Helios' Battle Gear, it was made using Drago's own DNA so that it'd be more organic in nature, due to Drago's hatred of mechanical Bakugan and not wanting to become a cyborg like Helios. Because of this, JetKor acts like a part of Drago's own body when he uses it. :* Lumino Dragonoid :: Drago's next evolution in Gundalian Invaders. He evolved in, when Neo Ziperator gave him the Element in The Element. He has four wings and a tail with a giant X shape on it. Curiously his body looks like a amalgamation between his previous forms Cross and Helix. This marks the quickest time Drago has evolved in any of the series. His second Battle Gear is Explosix Gear (Cross Buster), similar to the JetKor with the only differences being the appearance of the cannons and its expansion to cover Drago's new wings. From this on, he also started to use two Mobile Assault Vehicles: Raytheus, a large motorcycle like hover vehicle with a laser mounted in front, and Jakalier, a resemblance to the ocelot's glider with the only difference being Dan being able to ride inside of it. :* Blitz Dragonoid :: Drago's next evolution when Dragonoid Colossus evolves him as a reward for defeating him in Genesis. He now has armor covering his front body and has a set of wings again, but bigger than his previous version's wing, Lumino Dragonoid. He is also able to combine with Dragonoid Colossus respectively. His third Battle is Axator Gear, given from Dragonoid Collossus. In this form, he represents the original Dragonoid who banished the Nonets to the Doom Dimension. :* Titanium Dragonoid :: Drago's next evolution, when Code Eve rewarded him for defeating Barodius and Dharak in Destiny Revealed. His Mechtogan is Zenthon and his Mechtogan Titan is Zenthon Titan. His BakuNano is Sonicannon, while his Mobile Assault Vehicles are the motorbike Zoompha and surfboard-like Rapilator. He gave some of Code Eve's power to the other Brawlers to summon their Mechtogan. :* Fusion Dragonoid :: After connect the power of the Gate and Key, Drago evolved again to a \\"Baku Sky Raider\\" of himself. His razor sharp wings and infamous horn give him tenacious attack when he leaps into battle. Only the bravest opponents can measure up to the combined ruthlesness and courage of Fusion Dragonoid. Fused with Reptak, he becomes Aeroblitz. His Battle Suit is Defendtrix. :* Maxus Dragonoid / Maxus Cross Dragonoid : Neo Dragonoid's / Cross Dragonoid's transformation when combined with the six mechanical Bakugan Traps Brachium, Grafias, Dark Hound, Grakas Hound, Spitarm, and Spyderfencer. === Skyress === Skyress is Shun's guardian Bakugan that resembles a phoenix. She possesses the ultimate ability to resurrect herself. Her Impressive vision scours the horizon. She has gigantic wingspan and numerous long tails with bladed feathers at its tip. She is noble with a chivalrous spirit and fair in battle. Shun received Skyress as a gift from his sick mother right before she fell into a coma (in the English version; in the Japanese, she died). :* Storm Skyress :: Storm Skyress evolved from Skyress when Shun met an illusionary girl he realized was his mother in the past. Because of him missing his mother, he wanted to stay with her so that she wouldn't get ill like she did, realized he could not live alone with an illusionary form of his younger mother and his friends were depending on him. She is a larger, stronger version of Skyress with a colossal wingspan and a blade-tipped tail. In Blast From the Past, she was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was resurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Ingram === Shun's second Guardian Bakugan in New Vestroia. Shun saved Ingram in midair when he was being sucked into the Vestal Destroyer. Ingram is a bird-type monster with six wings and a hard-plated steel chest. His sharp, clawed feet can shred his opponents. He can also fly high into the air and nosedive directly into his opponents to eliminate them. * Master Ingram : :: Ingram's evolution after gaining Oberus' elemental energy in Six Degrees of Destruction. Ingram is now a ninja/warrior Bakugan with an additional set of wings who can call upon Shadow Wing as a battle partner. He lost the Ventus energy when he and Nemus lost a battle against Boriates and Macubass, due to the Vexos' cheating. In Blast From the Past, he was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was resurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Hawktor === Shun's third Guardian Bakugan that resembles a humanoid hawk in Gundalian Invaders. He appeared in Phantom Data Attack along with Aranaut, Akwimos, and Coredem. In Hostile Takeover, his real form replaced Shun's synthetic Bakugan. Hawktor is excited to be partnered with Shun, eager to learn some stealth attacks from the ninja. His Battle Gear is Swayther, a giant jet pack with dual laser cannons on the wings. also called cucklord === Taylean === Shun's fourth Guardian Bakugan in Arc 1 of Mechtanium Surge. Taylean is from Neathia as such he is always calm about how to approach things. Taylean is Shun's first bakugan to not resemble a bird. His BakuNano is Hammermor and his Mobile Assault Vehicle is Zoompha. His Battle Suit is Blasterate. In Blast From the Past, he was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was resurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Jaakor === Shun's fifth Guardian Bakugan in Arc 2 of Mechtanium Surge. He is a Baku Sky Raider. He is the one who is strong and even the one who seeks supreme power. It is his second bakugan to not resemble a bird, instead, it resembles Taylean and Primo Vulcan. Its Baku Sky Raider Combination with Skytress and Oberum is Magmafury === Preyas === Preyas is a chameleon-like Bakugan with strong loyalty to Marucho. His greatest strength is that Preyas can change his molecular structure allowing him to turn to Darkus or Subterra. Even though he has a menacing appearance, he is shy and comical. Small in comparison to the other monsters, Preyas makes up for it in speed. Preyas reappears in Return to New Vestroia.and in mechtanium surge when dan and drago go to New Vestroia and start training on an island they meet him and his student. In Blast From the Past, he was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was resurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. * Preyas Angelo & Preyas Diablo : :: Instead of evolving, Preyas regurgitated a mutated version of himself. The second Preyas has a split personality, one side is hotheaded and extremely rude, and the other is peaceful and overly polite. The rude side looks like demon version of Preyas and is a pyrus/aquos hybrid, called Preyas Diablo (demon); the polite side looks like an angel version of Preyas and is a haos/aquos hybrid, called Preyas Angelo (angel). Although the original Preyas has been found in New Vestroia, Preyas II hasn't even been mentioned. In Blast From the Past, he was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was resurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Elfin === Marucho's second Guardian Bakugan that resembles a frog-like humanoid in New Vestroia. Elfin is like Preyas, for she can change attributes to gain an advantage during battle. Before joining with Marucho, she protected the Bakugan from a forest in New Vestroia from the Vexos. She can shoot arrows out of its fingers. She's known to be a parody of Sailor Moon with her looks, stances and transformations. She and Preyas later started dating. * Minx Elfin : Elfin's evolution after she inherited Frosch's Elemental energy in Six Degrees of Destruction. Her hair is now twisted and she has a heart on her chest. She lost the Aquos energy when she lost a battle against Dryoid and MAC Spider. In Blast From the Past, she was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was ressurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Akwimos === Marucho's third Guardian Bakugan that resembles a Gill-man in Gundalian Invaders. He looks like Elico with swim goggles. He appeared in Phantom Data Attack, along with Aranaut, Coredem, and Hawktor. In Hostile Takeover, his real form replaced Marucho's synthetic Bakugan. His catchphrase is \\"Cool is the rule, dude!\\". He seems to have an African-American accent. His Battle Gear is Gigarth. === Trister === Marucho's fourth Guardian Bakugan in Arc 1 of Mechtanium Surge. Trister is from Gundalia and is always looking for a fight. His BakuNano is Crosstriker. In Blast From the Past, he was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was resurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Radizen === Marucho's fifth Guardian Bakugan in Arc 2 of Mechtanium Surge. He represents a kappa and very much agitated with Roxtor. His BakuFusion Combination is Betakor. === Tigrerra === A Bakugan that resembles a saber-toothed white tiger. Tigrerra is a beast with a strong bond to Runo and willing to defend her with incredible ferocity. She possesses a gigantic blade inside her body capable of cutting any substance in the human world. She has a very human like nature with a strong sense of duty. Tigrerra is kind and often protective. Runo nicknames Tigrerra \\"Tig\\". In the Japanese version, Tigrerra is a male named Tigres, nicknamed \\"Tora-chan\\" by Runo.

She is able to stand normally on two legs. In \\"Bakugan: New Vestroia\\", she was partnered up with Baron. But when they were battling Spectra and Helios, she sacrificed herself to save Nemus. She was taken back to the royal palace to be turned into a bronze trophy for Prince Hydron. She was later freed and reunited with Runo. In the second arc of Mechtanium Surge, it was revealed that she returned to New Vestroia with Preyas and Hammer Gorem and became Aerogan's master. In Blast From the Past, she was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was ressurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Aerogan === Runo's new partner in Mechtanium Surge and Blade Tigrerra's apprentice. He first appeared in Jump to Victory, when he traveled to Earth in search of a new partner and ended up teaming up with Runo to help Dan, Drago, and Reptak in a battle with Wiseman. After winning the battle, Aerogan returned to New Vestroia to keep training with Tigrerra. Despite this, he returned in Blast From the Past, where he was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was resurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Gorem === A Bakugan that resembles a large golem. Gorem is one of the largest Bakugan and its body is composed of exceptionally dense cells making it very heavy. When battling it uses its massive fist and a shield decreasing the G power of any Bakugan. Normally gentle and obedient, only Julie can calm it down when angry. It evolves into Hammer Gorem. * Hammer Gorem : Hammer Gorem is the next evolution of Gorem. It is a stronger more powerful evolution with an impressive coat of armor and bull-like horns protruding from its head. Hammer Gorem wields a highly destructive double-sided hammer to pound its enemies into the ground. He later went back to New Vestroia with Blade Tigrerra and Preyas, though this wasn't shown. In Blast From the Past, he was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was ressurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Hydranoid === Alice's guardian Bakugan (Masquerade's before). Hydranoid is one of the strongest species with a body composed of a highly intelligent, independent cell structure. It is completely controlled by Masquerade and obeys all of Masquerade's commands. This one- headed Hydra-like Bakugan has very strong armor, a dragon-like face, spines all over its body, and a sharp flail for a tail. Its mobility is extremely slow, but can battle all species with its extremely powerful and forceful strikes. Hydranoid is a mercilessly cruel and unforgiving monster, not to mention extremely violent and arrogant that feeds off the power of Bakugan sent to the Doom Dimension by Masqerade. Like his old nemesis (now close friend) Drago, Hydranoid can evolve into a more powerful monster. * Dual Hydranoid : Hydranoid's first evolution with two heads. Hydranoid now also has two tails. He seems to be partially mechanical even though his evolution was completely natural, unlike Helios who was evolved by Vestal Technology. His arrogant, merciless personality is unchanged. * Alpha Hydranoid : Hydranoid's second evolution with three heads. Even more of his body looks mechanical, and he now has three pairs of wings. The armor on the front of his body can rotate like a huge grinder after he ensnares his opponent with metal cords that erupt from chinks in his wings (this is probably a strange biological feature). He now battles as Alice's Bakugan guardian (because the Silent Core's negative energy finally leaving him and Alice, leaving Alice as just herself, without Masquerade), caring for her as much as she cares for him. He can also shoot hot fire that can melt all attributes. In Blast From the Past, he was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was ressurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe. === Wavern === A wyvern-like Bakugan who is Naga's twin sister and Drago's love interest. She obtained the Infinity Core and became Joe's Guardian. She used the power of the Infinity Core to cure Joe and get him out of the hospital. He later was able to use only her to defeat Masquerade in a battle. She and Drago had been going out on secret dates before the Infinity Core incident. It started when Drago slipped between the attributed world and he met Naga and Wavern, the White Ones, or non-attributed Bakugan with supposed no power. He kept visiting her ever since. She still has affection towards him. Her pet name for him is \\"Dragoruny\\". She has also appeared in Bakugan Mechtanium Surge. === Coredem === Jake's Guardian Bakugan resembles a King.

She wears a long, flowing robes and protects herself with the harp she carries. Sirenoid is mostly based on Sirens that lure in sailors by looks or by any devious way like how Sirenoid uses a harp. She is in love with her master Klaus Von Hertzon, and when she is living in Vestal, she lives in the fish tank of Klaus' office, albeit in her open Bakugan sphere form. This is referencing the fact that she is an Aquos Bakugan. === Fourtress === A Bakugan that resembles an Asura and is Chan Lee's Guardian Bakugan. He is a warrior bakugan that has three faces and four arms giving him an extra edge in battle. Fourtress' faces are the face of rage/phase glare (attack), the face of sadness/phase breaker (defense), the face of joy/phase driver (power up), and the face of enlightenment (enlightenment is never shown as an ability, but is the back face in ball form and is the starting face for when Fourtress appears). He became more powerful in New Vestroia. === Tentaclear === Julio's Guardian Bakugan. A Bakugan that resembles a floating eye with tentacles on the side. Tentaclear is unable to speak, perhaps because of his lack of a mouth. This proves to be a bad thing for Julio Santana because Harpus was making fun of him and Tentaclear couldn't speak for either side. === Harpus === Komba's Guardian who resembles a Harpy. She loves to make fun of any other Bakugan on the field, often calling Skyress names like 'old lady,' or 'grandma.' Her special ability card is 'Feather Storm.'

He was a rogue Bakugan who tried to control all the power in Vestroia. In order to do so, he tried to absorb the two opposite cores, but made a mistake and merged himself with the Silent Core while the Infinity Core was expelled to Earth. At the same time, Naga shot energy waves that brainwashed the Bakugan, altering the dimensional balance, and creating the Doom Beings. He also had a deep hatred for the Battle Brawlers, mainly Dan and Drago. He is Wayvern's twin brother, and he uses the Darkus attribute. * Silent Naga :: The \\"evolved/mutated\\" form of Naga after he absorbed the Silent Core into his body, having the chance to use Darkus abilities.

Helios is an evil dragon that obeys every command from the heinous Spectra. Its mammoth wings allow it to move swiftly and avoid quick attacks. Helios has poisonous tipped thorns covering its body. From its mouth, it can shoot cannonball fire blasts with rapid speed. The key point of the original Helios is that 1 he uses his abilities general quasar which is usually unused for the rest of the bakugan series. Another key point being that in this form with help from the forbidden cards he manages to defeat Drago. but for some reason Spectra doesn't use the forbidden cards ever again. * Cyborg Helios : Helios suggested that he be turned into a cyborg, since it would not have any of the weaknesses of a completely mechanical Bakugan. A computer voice can be heard when he uses his new ability FARBAS to repair himself and increase his power to match his opponents. In this form, Helios can use more cybernetical attacks like Ragnorok Cannon which soon begins to evolve into the realistic gun-like weaponry in the Bakugan series. * Helios MK2 : The power of the forbidden cards forced him to evolve artificially. Even more of his body is mechanical. Since episode 41, he was upgraded to combine with his Battle Gears, Twin Destructor (a pair of powerful cannons that attach to his back) and Zukanator (a cannon with the top appearing to look like a Castle Tower). * Infinity Helios : Helios' next evolution in Mechtanium Surge.

Since then, they have become legends and preside over Vestroia from the Doom Dimension. There is one of each Attribute. When the Battle Brawlers came to the Doom Dimension they were met by the Soldiers and a deal was struck, if all of the Brawlers could defeat the soldier that uses the same attribute as them they would take them out of the Doom Dimension and take all of the Bakugan that Masquerade and his minions sent there. They all won, so the Soldiers had to keep their end of the bargain. In New Vestroia, the Soldiers reappear conversing with Drago and giving him a body, transforming him into Neo Dragonoid, and sending him to the human world to get Dan. Then Vestroia starts to collapse without him and all they can do is wait and discuss. After Drago returns to New Vestroia the Perfect Core becomes stable again and they later appeared to send Drago and the others to Earth. The Six Ancient Warriors then battled Zenoheld after he threatened to destroy the Bakugan if they did not come. Although they had the upper hand, the tide of the battle turned quickly after Zenoheld unleashed the Assail System. They were defeated. Before they could lose their attribute energies, they transferred their power to the Resistance' Bakugan, thus giving up their lives. * Apollonir : :: He is the legendary Bakugan that resembles a dragon with four sets of wings and humanoid posture. He is the Leader of The Six Legendary Bakugan. In battle, Apollonir is the most powerful Dragonoid Bakugan. Apollonir was the most powerful Dragonoid. He was with a clown who used two Mock Dragonoid to battle against Dan and Drago. When Drago defeated the two Dragonoids, Apollonir left his disguise and prepared to battle Drago. Dan used the ability D-Strike Extreme and repeatedly did that until Drago defeated him. But when Drago still didn't evolve, he explained that he needed to defeat all of his friends to further evolve. In the first season, his wings resembled leathery insect wings. When Drago was taken by Spectra while on Earth, Apollonir appeared to Dan in a dream and offered to temporarily become Dan's Guardian Bakugan. During the battle against Spectra, Apollonir easily defeated Helios, but when Drago arrived, he and Dan were backed into a corner, and Dan used Dragon Proudia, turning Apollonir into a trident. Dan then proceeded to throw him, hitting Drago's Perfect Core diamond and freeing him from Spectra's command. Also, Apollonir is revealed to be linked to the Perfect Core, just like Drago, and as such, he has the ability to detect Drago from anywhere on New Vestroia. In Reunion, when Drago says that he can no longer leave New Vestroia due to his link with the Perfect Core, Apollonir explains to Drago that though he is linked to the Perfect Core, he had become strong enough to free himself from it. Apollonir gave his Attribute Energy to Drago just like the other Legendary Soldiers did to the Bakugan belonging to the Resistance. This forced Drago to evolve into Cross Dragonoid.

He was one of the ones who disapproved of asking the Brawlers for help.

Gorem than evolves into Hammer Gorem and Julie learns to stop comparing herself to her sister, passing Clayf's test.

She was originally disguised as an old woman who told Runo where an Illusionary Dan was the person she chose to Brawl Runo was. When she revealed herself, she outright told Runo to stop being so stubborn, but Runo would not listen. She almost won using the most powerful Haos ability card, Sagittarius Arrow. This revives all Bakugan used in the battle that can side with her and uses them to boost her power. She has a basic power level 500 Gs. She was defeated after Runo learned to stop being so stubborn and to listen to her friends, (in the Japanese version, she admitted she loved Dan), and Tigrerra evolved into Blade Tigrerra and used Velocity Fang ability to disable Sagittarius Arrow, lowering Lars Lion's power level by 100 Gs and winning the battle. During Lars Lion's and Runo's battle they don't get to see who wins because when the battle is almost over Lars Lion says that Runo has learned not to be stubborn. A noticeable fact is that Lars Lion's battle form is basically the same as her masked form except Lars Lion wears a mask in her masked form while observing Runo's battle against the fake young Dan. Lars Lion gave her Haos Energy to Mega Nemus, which forced Nemus to evolve into Saint Nemus. * Exedra : :: Exedra is the legendary Darkus Bakugan. He resembles a Lernaean Hydra and is the most powerful. He can drain power from teammates, but then turns them to stone. Exedra, the Darkus Legendary Soldier, battled Masquerade with an illusionary \\"Alice Gehabich\\" using the most powerful Darkus abilities, Demon Wizard and Final Wizard. He is defeated by Masquerade with a combo with Dual Hydranoid. This caused Dual Hydranoid to evolve to Alpha Hydranoid.

His older brother, Oscar √ñhman, was a member of parliament from 1929‚Äì1932. Gunnar √ñhman worked as sawmills in Medelpad between 1918 and 1924. He worked at the Sundsvall newspaper Norrlands-Kuriren 1924 to 1928. During these four years he was the secretary of the Young Communist League district unit in Medelpad. When the Communist Party suffered a major split in 1929, Gunnar √ñhman remained loyal to the party. His brother, Oscar, on the other hand sided with the Karl Kilbom faction. Rising in the party ranks following the split, √ñhman was one of the 'men of 1929' grouping (with Hilding Hagberg, Fritjof Lager, Gunnar Johansson) that would dominate the party affairs for several decades to come. In 1932 he moved to Norrbotten, working at Norrskensflamman and as organizer of the Communist Party district unit. In 1933 he became a Central Committee member of the party (a post he would hold until 1963). In 1934 he became secretary of the Stockholm-M√§lardalen district of the party. In 1936 he was included in the politburo of the party. √ñhman sat in the Stockholm City Council between 1942 and 1954. He also served as chairman of the Stockholm Communist Labour Commune. He was replaced by Fritjof Lager in this post in 1952. Between 1943 and 1948 he served as national party secretary. In 1953 he was appointed editor-in-chief of Ny Dag.

It follows the relationship between a college football player and his girlfriend. ==Plot== Qualifying to play in the illustrious Rose Bowl football game on New Year's Day, a Midwestern college's quarterback, Steve Davis, is not as happy as he should be because playing football does not excite him, but his teammate Bronc Buttram is thrilled. Their coach, Jim Hadley, is equally pleased because his ill wife has gone to warmer Glendale, California for her health, so he will now be able to spend more time with her. Steve perks up in Pasadena while meeting the Rose Bowl's committee and particularly the tournament's queen, Denny Burke, a beauty in a fur coat. Steve believes she is wealthy as well as beautiful and manages to get her telephone number. He cannot get through, however, because Denny's younger sister Sally is always tying up the phone. Finding her house, Steve learns she is a middle-class girl whose dad, \\"Iron Mike\\" Burke, once played in a Rose Bowl game himself. Denny takes exception to Steve's disappointment that she is not rich and to his blas√© attitude toward the Rose Bowl, a tradition her family loves. The self- involved Steve develops a guilty conscience. Agreeing to spend New Year's Eve with her family, Steve stands up Denny because he is at the hospital, where Coach Hadley's wife has taken a turn for the worse. He gets busy signals phoning because Sally's hogging it again. Next morning, Bronc explains to Denny and she is relieved. At the game, the coach announces his wife's going to be all right. Steve leads the team to victory, unselfishly letting Bronc score the winning touchdown. He and Denny are in love and plan to marry. ==Cast== * Marshall Thompson as Steve Davis * Vera Miles as Denny Burke * Richard Rober as Coach James Hadley * Natalie Wood as Sally Burke * Keith Larsen as Bronc Buttram * Tom Harmon as Himself * Ann Doran as Mrs. Addie Burke * James Dobson as Allie Bassler * Jim Backus as Michael 'Iron Mike' Burke * Clarence Kolb as 'Gramps' Burke * Barbara Woodell as Mrs. Mary Hadley * Bill Welsh as Himself ==ReferencesBibliography== * Marshall, Wendy L.

The area included a couple of villages around Junik and the Highlands of Djakovica along the Kosovo border with Albania (back then part of the Prefecture of Kosovo). The zone consisted of the villages Junik, Mulliq/Moliƒá, Batush√´/Batusa, Brovin√´/Brovina, Ponoshec/Ponosevac, Babaj i Bok√´s/Babaj Boks, Popoc/Popovc, Shishman/≈†i≈°man, and Koshare/Ko≈°are. Beside Junik, the rest correspond today to border villages of the District of Gjakova. ===Ongoing=== The area was practically autonomous, ruled by local bayraktars and the Kanun only. Despite the intention, the area served as a buffer zone for the kachak guerrillas and was a starting point for consecutive Albanian rebellions organized from 1921 to 1924 in Kosovo. Many chetas settled around Junik and launched offensives against the Serbian armies starting from there. Azem Galica and his man settled there, and a little later even Hasan Prishtina joined. Beside attacks on the Serbian army, the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo organized insurgencies against the Zog-controlled governments of Tirana, the latest being a sworn enemy of the Committee of Kosovo and Kosovar irredentists. The Committee of Kosovo leaders as Hasan Prishtina, Bajram and Hysni Curri, and Azem Galica initiated more than once attacks against the Albanian armies and authorities stationed nearby. Two main ones were the Albanian Rebellion of 1922, and the other tentative in January 1923. During the last attempt, Beqir Vokshi, a former member of the Committee who was recently enlisted as an officer of the Albanian army got killed by Galica's men. Vokshi was trying to persuade the Junik population not to support the recent guerrillas attacks upon the Krum√´ and Tropoj√´ regions. ===Dissolution=== In early January 1923, the rebels had taken an offensive over Tropoj√´, followed by a broader one on Has District. They had surrounded Krum√´ (center of the Prefecture of Kosovo), attacked the gendarme stations in Nikaj-M√´rtur and arrived by the Drin river. The most severe fighting took place near Krum√´ town, which was attacked from two sides by the guerrillas of Azem Galica and Sadik Rama. Following the events, Ahmet Zogu ordered a major offensive. After pushing the insurgents back to the Neutral Zone, in late January 1923 the Albanian army entered Junik. The Kachaks left the area and went inside Kosovo. Later, the area was handed over to the Yugoslavs, and a joint-border patrolling was established. The Yugoslav army burned down the houses which had served as kachak basis and executed around 60 people. By February 1923, the Neutral Zone stopped existing. == References == Category:1920s in Yugoslavia Category:1920s in Albania Category:1921 in Yugoslavia Category:1921 in Albania Category:1922 in Yugoslavia Category:1922 in Albania Category:1923 in Yugoslavia Category:1923 in Albania Category:Albania‚ÄìYugoslavia border Category:Demilitarized zones Category:Military history of Yugoslavia ","title":"Neutral Zone of Junik"},{"id":"41984622","text":"Kazakhstan Bandy Federation (Qazaqstan Bendƒ± Federatsƒ±ƒ±asy) is the governing body for the sport of bandy in Kazakhstan.

Scott critical of a system of beliefs he calls high modernism, that centers around confidence in the ability to design and operate society in accordance with scientific laws. It was released in March 1998, with a paperback version in February 1999. The book catalogues schemes which states impose upon populaces that are convenient for the state since they make societies \\"legible\\", but are not necessarily good for the people. For example, census data, standardized weights and measures, and uniform languages make it easier to tax and control the population. ==ReceptionBook reviews=== Stanford University political scientist David Laitin described it as \\"a magisterial book.\\" But he said there were flaws in the methodology of the book, saying the book \\"is a product of undisciplined history. For one, Scott‚Äôs evidence is selective and eclectic, with only minimal attempts to weigh disconfirming evidence... It is all too easy to select confirming evidence if the author can choose from the entire historical record and use material from all countries of the world.\\" John Gray, author of False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism, reviewed the book favorably for the New York Times, concluding: \\"Today's faith in the free market echoes the faith of earlier generations in high modernist schemes that failed at great human cost. Seeing Like a State does not tell us what it is in late modern societies that predisposes them, against all the evidence of history, to put their trust in such utopias. Sadly, no one knows enough to explain that.\\" Economist Brad DeLong wrote a detailed online review of the book. DeLong's interpretation of the book was critiqued by Henry Farrell on the Crooked Timber blog, and there was a follow-up exchange including further discussion of the book. Economist Deepak Lal reviewed the book for the Summer 2000 issue of The Independent Review, concluding: \\"Although I am in sympathy with Scott‚Äôs diagnosis of the development disasters he recounts, I conclude that he has not burrowed deep enough to discover a systematic cause of these failures. (In my view, that cause lies in the continuing attraction of various forms of 'enterprises' in what at heart remains Western Christendom.) Nor is he right in so blithely dismissing the relevance of classical liberalism in finding remedies for the ills he eloquently describes.\\" Political scientist Ulf Zimmermann reviewed the book for H-Net Online in December 1998, concluding: \\"It is important to keep in mind, as Scott likewise notes, that many of these projects replaced even worse social orders and at least occasionally introduced somewhat more egalitarian principles, never mind improving public health and such. And, in the end, many of the worst were sufficiently resisted in their absurdity, as he had shown so well in his Weapons of the Weak and as best demonstrated by the utter collapse of the soviet system. \\"Metis\\" alone is not sufficient; we need to find a way to link it felicitously with‚Äîto stick with Scott's Aristotelian vocabulary‚Äîphronesis and praxis, or, in more ordinary terms, to produce theories more profoundly grounded in actual practice so that the state may see better in implementing policies.\\" Michael Adas of Rutgers University reviewed the book for the Summer 2000 issue of the Journal of Social History. Russell Hardin, a professor of politics at New York University, reviewed the book for The Good Society in 2001, disagreeing with Scott's diagnosis somewhat. Hardin concluded: \\"The failure of collectivization was therefore a failure of incentives, not a failure to rely on local knowledge.\\" ===Discussions=== The September 2010 issue of Cato Unbound was devoted to discussing the themes of the book. Scott wrote the lead essay. Other participants were Donald Boudreaux, Timothy B. Lee, and J. Bradford DeLong.

Artists: Utagawa Yoshitora, Eisai Shigekiyo & Utagawa Kunisada. Date: 12th month of 1864. Subject: An antique Japanese Woodblock (Ukiyo-e) Print from the series Edo-no- Hana Meisho-e. Image depicts various aspects of the Tabata region, in Edo (Tokyo), Japan. Size: 24.8 cm x 36.3 cm. Origin: From the private collection of Dr Simon Henry - Australia.alt= ==The series title== The title of the Ukiyo-e print series Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e, when translated into English, reads as The Flowers of Edo: A Collection of Famous Places. The Flowers of Edo was a phrase used to describe the finest features of everyday life, as experienced in the various districts of Japan‚Äôs Tokugawa capital during the mid-nineteenth century.Henry, S. The Flowers of Edo: Aspects of the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e Japanese Woodblock Print Series. Sydney, Australia. 2010. P5. Included within the scope of the expression were select examples of incredible outdoor beauty, inspirational models of ancient cultural accomplishment and brilliant cases of contemporary creative excellence. The Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e works display images of famous Kabuki actors, illustrations of natural landscapes and important visions of celebrated Japanese myths and legends. The prints also present classical songs and poetry, advertisements for popular commercial products of the day and historical accounts that are associated with each of the locations being examined. ==A collaboration of artists== Twenty-one notable artists of the Ukiyo-e era, led by Utagawa Kunisada [Utagawa Toyokuni III], designed the full complement of prints for the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e series. It is Utagawa Kunisada's enduring commitment to the work, indicated by his Kabuki actor designs featuring on every sheet in the set, as well as the huge number of contributing illustrators, that distinguishes the project as one of the most significant artist collaborations completed within Japan‚Äôs greater art history. ==Production period and print design total== The first prints of the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e series were released by the publisher Katoya Seibei in the twelfth month of 1862, while the last sheets of the set were produced in the first month of 1865. In the two years and two months in which the works were designed and manufactured, seventy prints in total had been created, followed by an index and title page. The index and title pieces are not universally accepted as part of the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e series. Hesitation to acknowledge the extra pages is based on the reality that both were made after the picture set had ceased production, at a time when it was popular for the collected single sheet works to be assembled in string-bound albums. Additionally, Utagawa Kunisada did not contribute to the creation of the two supplementary items and inconsequentially the index page lists the works of the series in an ancient Japanese alphabetical arrangement, rather than in an order determined by date of production. ==The series unfinished== Although the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e series concluded with the substantial number of seventy prints having been created, it is likely that the set was originally planned to consist of at least one hundred pieces. This notion is supported by evidence found within the text of one of the works. In the print titled Shinkawa,Museum of Fine Arts Boston - Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e - Shinkawa. dated to the eighth month of 1863, the publisher addresses patrons directly, referring to the new edition of one hundred picture prints called Edo-no-Hana. This reference was made at a time when only thirty-three sheets in the series had been completed. It is therefore probable that the project was to continue throughout 1865, instead of finishing abruptly within the first month of that year. The reason for the sudden halt to the production of the set was that Utagawa Kunisada died on the twelfth of January 1865, thereby ending any hope of achieving the proposed one hundred print goal. With the series left unfinished and abandoned, it is significant that three of its final works, those dated to the first month of 1865, are among the very last prints to be conceived by the great Ukiyo-e master.Henry, S. The Flowers of Edo: Aspects of the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e Japanese Woodblock Print Series. Sydney, Australia. 2010. P6. ==Print format== The Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e prints were produced in a format known as Harimaze. Harimaze works were usually designed by one or two artists and featured images divided into several sections. They were generally unrelated pictures on the one page that were made to be individually cut up and used as decoration. The Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e works exhibited designs in defined section portions, each predominantly created by a specific artist, but had a different objective to standard Harimaze compositions. With up to five illustrators working on separate pieces of a single sheet, each of the image segments displayed related to the others by presenting various aspects of the one key topic area. Typically divided into five distinct parts, with some exceptions to be found, prints of the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e series contain: (1) a Title Section, (2) a portion displaying an image of the relevant location, labelled a Meisho Scene, (3) a segment that illustrates a story concerning the area, identified as a Meisho Tale, (4) a picture of a Kabuki Actor that relates to the district and (5) a Margin Information zone, which presents important data concerning the print‚Äôs production; such as the publisher‚Äôs name, a carver‚Äôs name and a government censor seal. Making use of the Harimaze-style format from beginning to end, the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e set also included some special prints produced in popular multi-sheet arrangements. Responding to public demand for such compositions at the time, the seventy works of the series came to incorporate three diptyches, one triptych and one rare four-sheet tetraptych. ==Word play== An entertaining feature of the Edo- no-Hana Meisho-e prints is the use of double meanings, which often relate to place names, within the text that accompanies many of the famous landscape scenes. It is also notable that puns and dual interpretations can be found in some of the signed alternate names used by the artists and within the title of the series itself. The Flowers of Edo was not only a metaphor for the finest aspects of the day but also a colloquial expression, used to describe the fires that often threatened an urban Edo environment constructed predominantly of wood and paper. The reference to the constant threat of flames in the city is also reinforced in each of the prints, by the display of the troop name, number and emblem of the firemen responsible for protecting the relevant Edo district pictured. Moreover, as fire-fighters were admired as great examples of enthusiasm and bravery, they were likely considered as much a Flower of Edo as any popular Kabuki actor or fashionable Ukiyo-e print artist of the period. ==The significance of the series== The Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e series is a sophisticated instrument of ancient Japanese artistic and literary display. It is a body of work that chronicles the material and intellectual concerns of late Edo period Japan, not more than a few short years before it was irreversibly changed by the extensive social reforms of the Western-influenced Meiji Restoration. Of great interest is the rare blending of all known major Ukiyo-e print subject categories within the confines of one work. Never before had Japan experienced a more successful integration of images of Kabuki actors, landscapes, warriors, myths and beautiful women, as was able to be seen in the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e series. The project is also a means to explore something of the relationships between print artists of the time and with twenty-one contributing illustrators, stands as the largest collaborative creative enterprise ever completed within Japan‚Äôs Ukiyo-e art history.Henry, S. The Flowers of Edo: Aspects of the Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e Japanese Woodblock Print Series. Sydney, Australia. 2010. P7. In particular it presents a progressive generous quality to the nature of Utagawa Kunisada and exhibits rare works created by him in his final days. Recognising Utagawa Kunisada as the senior artist of the series, it is important to note that print sections of a similar size to his own, designed by comparatively junior artists, were displayed on the same sheet as if created by equals. This was no doubt an intentional practice, either initiated or endorsed by Utagawa Kunisada, which served to validate some of his rising students and the pupils of other great print masters, as a new generation of independent artists. ==References== Category:Ukiyo-e print series ","title":"Edo-no-Hana Meisho-e"},{"id":"41984749","text":"Nodozana picturata is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

It is in length. It has a watershed area of 21.6 square miles and the watershed is in Northumberland and Lycoming Counties. The main soil series in the watershed is the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series and the main land uses are agriculture and forest. The communities of Watsontown, Turbotville, and McEwensville are all in or near the watershed. The Warrior Run watershed was inhabited by Europeans in the early 1770s. Several mills and forts were built along it. ==Course== Warrior Run begins in northeastern Delaware Township, in the Muncy Hills, not far from the border between Northumberland County and Lycoming County. It flows southwards, paralleling Interstate 180. As the stream leaves the Muncy Hills, it briefly passes through the western part of Lewis Township and goes under Pennsylvania Route 54. It flows near the Warrior Run High School and the community of Warrior Run before turning southwest and returning to Delaware Township. It then continues southwest past McEwensville, flows under Interstate 180, and continues west, paralleling Pennsylvania Route 44. The stream eventually crosses under Pennsylvania Route 44 and Pennsylvania Route 45 before emptying into the West Branch Susquehanna River near the southern edge of Watsontown. ===Tributaries=== The tributaries of Warrior Run are all unnamed tributaries. ==Geology== The Warrior Run watershed is located in the Appalachian Mountain section of the ridge-and-valley geographic region. The highest part of the watershed is the northern part, where the Muncy Hills are situated. The stream's source is higher than its mouth. Thirty-five percent of the rocks in the upper reaches of the Warrior Run watershed are interbedded sedimentary rocks. These largely consist of the Hamilton Group, the Onondaga Formation, and the Old Port Formation Undivided. The remaining 65% of the rocks are sandstone and shale, mainly belonging to the Trimmers Rock Formation and the Wills Creek Formation. The Trimmers Rock Formation occurs in the entire northern part of the watershed. The Hamilton Group occurs in the central part of the watershed. Continuing southward, the next formation is the Old Port Formation Undivided, followed by the Keyser and Tonoloway Formation Undivided and then the Wills Creek Formation. The Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation Undivided occupies the southwestern corner of the watershed. The most common soil series in the Warrior Run watershed is the Berks-Weikert-Bedington series, which is a shaly silt loam. The Watson-Berks- Alvira series and the Hagerstown-Edom-Washington series are also common within the watershed. The Berks-Weikert-Bedington series occurs throughout the northern and southern parts of the watershed and the Watson-Berks-Alvira series occurs in the northern and central parts. The Hagerstown-Edom- Washington series occurs in the central part of the watershed. The Chenango- Pope-Holly series is found in the southwestern corner of the watershed and the Leck Kill-Minersville-Calvin series is found in the eastern part of the watershed. There is significant soil erosion along the banks of Warrior Run. ==Hydrology== The total load of sediment in Warrior Run is per day. A 10% reduction of this load is required to meet the total maximum daily load as determined by the Environmental Protection Agency. A total of per day of it comes from agricultural lands and per day comes from stream banks. The daily load of sediment from hay or pastures is and the load from low-intensity development is . The load of sediment from land in transition and from unpaved roads is per day and per day. No sediment comes from wetlands. The daily load of phosphorus in the stream is .

Wetlands do not contribute any phosphorus to the stream. All of the streams in the watershed are impaired according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The annual average rainfall between 2005 and 2013 was in the Warrior Run watershed. The average annual runoff was . The boroughs of Turbotville and McEwensville both discharge treated sewage into streams in the Warrior Run watershed. ==Watershed== The area of the Warrior Run watershed is 21.6 square miles. It is located in Delaware Township and Lewis Township in Northumberland County and a small part of Muncy Creek Township, in Lycoming County. Turbotville is also partially within the boundaries of the watershed. The main highways in the watershed are Interstate 180 (running north-south) and Pennsylvania Route 54 (running east-west). There are also many township roads in the area. Agricultural land makes up 55% of the Warrior Run watershed. Forested land makes up 35% of the watershed and developed land makes up 10% of it. Most of the forested land is confined to the northern reaches of the watershed. The watershed contains 17.3 acres of wetlands. ==History== According to John Franklin Meginness, Warrior Run has been relevant to Northumberland County history since near the beginning of European habitation in the area. A historic Native American trail once ran from Northumberland to Muncy, passing by the mouth of Warrior Run and the Muncy Hills on the way. By the late 1800s, a public road occupied the course of this path. John Shikellamy, the oldest son of the Oneida chief Shikellamy, owned a hunting lodge at the mouth of Warrior Run. The lodge was known as the Warrior's Camp. Shikellamy himself lived in an area between Warrior Run and Chillisquaque Creek in around 1737. In May 1769, a lot of 609 acres, including the present-day community of Watsontown, was surveyed at the mouth of Warrior Run. Captain Daniel Piper came to own this land. European Settlers arrived at the stream, four miles (seven kilometers) upstream of the mouth, in 1772, making them the first European settlers in that area. These settlers included Jacob Freeland, John Vincent, Peter Vincent, and Cornelius Vincent. Fort Freeland was built on the site in 1775 to protect the settlers from the Indians. It was a stockaded log house with half an acre of land inside the walls. The fort provided visibility for approximately a mile upstream and downstream. It was destroyed on July 28, 1779 by 100 British troops under the command of John McDonald and 200 Indians commanded by Hiokoto, a Seneca chief. Hawkins Boone, a relative of Daniel Boone, built Fort Boone at the mouth of the stream. Fort Meninger was also located there. John Watson had the idea to build a community at the mouth of Warrior Run, which he started building in 1794. Originally known as Slabtown, its name was later changed to Watsontown. Daniel Vincent purchased 400 acres surrounding Fort Freeland and constructed a mill there. It was renovated in 1818 and remained as late as the early 1900s. Jacob Freeland constructed a gristmill on the stream in 1773. An 1891 book of Northumberland County history referred to this mill as Freeland's Mill. Daniel Vincent built another mill on Muddy Run out of logs some time before 1792. In 1792, it was replaced with a stone structure. The Wilson Mill was later also built on the stream. In the 1840s, the community of Watsontown had one or two mills on Warrior Run. ==Biology== Where Warrior Run flows through agricultural land, there is very little riparian bufferring. Livestock are also able to freely access the stream in places. ==Recreation== The Warrior Run Community Corporation plans to establish a walking trail along Warrior Run from McEwensville to the Muncy Hills. Since 2006, there has been a 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) footrace partially along Warrior Run near the Warrior Run Middle School. ==See also== *Muddy Run (West Branch Susquehanna River), next tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River going downstream *White Deer Creek, next tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River going upstream *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== Category:Rivers of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Warrior Run (West Branch Susquehanna River tributary)"},{"id":"41984845","text":"Chedighaii hutchisoni was a bothremydid turtle that lived during the Late Cretaceous.

The holotype specimen, which D. nodosa was based on, USNM 8345, consists of a partial carapace and plastron. It came from the De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation, and therefore, Denazinemys lived in the Kirtlandian land-vertebrate age. Many specimens other than the holotype have been assigned to Denazinemys. ==Distinguishing characteristics== Previously, Scabremys ornata was assigned to Denazinemys as D. ornata. Below are the features found in Denazinemys distinguishing the two genera: * a carapace that is sub- triangular with widest dimension posteriorly; * prepleurals present and touching the first vertebrae medially; * the first vertebrae an irregular hexagonal shape with the greatest width posteriorly, contacting anterior second vertebrae; * extracervicals lateral to the primary cervicals, the cervicals being sub-divided; * and carapace nodes irregular and not forming distinct ridges. ==Classification== Denazinemys is a baenodd, along with Plesiobaena, Boremys, Scabremys, Baena and Chisternon.

He is a founding employee of SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. He is best known for his engineering work on the TR-106 and SpaceX rocket engines. He is considered one of the world's leading spacecraft propulsion experts and holds several United States patents for propulsion technology. ==Early life and education== Mueller was born in St. Maries, Idaho. His father was a logger and wanted Mueller to be one as well. Mueller compares his story to that of Homer Hickam, growing up in a hard-working family and going off to be an engineer instead of following in his father's footsteps. As a kid, he would build and fly Estes model rockets. He continued to experiment with rockets, even building one out of his father's oxy-acetylene welder and discovering adding water would produce more thrust. Mueller eventually became a logger, working four summers to pay his way through school. He attended the University of Idaho where he earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. He moved to California upon graduating, turning down job offers in Idaho and Oregon. He attended a job fair upon his arrival in California and began working in satellite design and moved on to developing liquid rocket engines. Mueller went on to attend Loyola Marymount University where he obtained his master's degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1992 from the Frank R. Seaver College of Science and Engineering. ==Career== The Dragon spacecraft being launched on a Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket powered by Merlin engines engineered by Tom Mueller. For 15 years, Mueller worked for TRW Inc., a conglomerate corporation involved in aerospace, automotive, credit reporting, and electronics. He managed the propulsion and combustion products department where he was responsible for liquid rocket engine development. He worked as a lead engineer during the development of the TR-106, a thrust hydrogen engine that was one of the most powerful engines ever at the time it was constructed. During his time at TRW, Mueller felt that his ideas were being lost in a diverse corporation and as a hobby he began to build his own engines. He would attach them to airframes and launch them in the Mojave Desert along with other members of the Reaction Research Society. In late 2001, Mueller began developing a liquid- fueled rocket engine in his garage and later moved his project to a friend's warehouse in 2002. His design was the largest amateur liquid-fuel rocket engine, weighing and producing of thrust. His work caught the attention of Elon Musk, PayPal co-founder and CEO of Tesla Inc., and in 2002 Mueller joined Musk as a founding employee of SpaceX. As Vice President of Propulsion Engineering and subsequently CTO of Propulsion at SpaceX, Mueller led the team that developed the Merlin 1A and Kestrel engines for the Falcon 1, the first liquid fueled orbital rocket launched by a private company; the Merlin 1C, Merlin 1D and MVac engines for the early iterations of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle; as well as the Draco thrusters that provide the attitude control thrusters for the Dragon spacecraft, as well as the SuperDraco storable- propellant engines used to power the capsule launch escape system. Amateur Liquid Propellant Rocketry, Tom Meuller in talk for Launch Canada, 19 June 2020, accessed 16 July 2020. Dragon was the first spacecraft launched by a private company to dock at the International Space Station. In 2014, Mueller transitioned engine development to the SpaceX Propulsion Engineering team and in 2016 he moved into the Propulsion CTO (Part-Time) role. In January 2019 he became Senior Advisor (Part-Time). Outside his work at SpaceX, he was a commencement speaker for Loyola Marymount University graduate students in 2013, the year after SpaceX became the first private company to send a cargo payload to the International Space Station. He was also the feature of an article called \\"Rocket Man,\\" published by LMU Magazine in 2011. In 2014, Mueller was nominated for the Wyld Award, presented by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) for outstanding achievement in the development or application of rocket propulsion systems. ==See also== * SpaceX Mars transportation infrastructure * Spacecraft propulsion * SpaceX reusable launch system development program ==References== Category:Living people Category:Loyola Marymount University alumni Category:People from St. Maries, Idaho Category:Rocket scientists Category:SpaceX people Category:University of Idaho alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Tom Mueller"},{"id":"41985229","text":"Daniel Muzito Bagenda (born June 16, 1996) is a Swedish professional ice hockey forward.

The product is injected directly into the testicle, where the zinc gluconate destroys the sperm and causes inflammation, which leads to fibrosis and causes sterility. Sperm production continues for up to 60 days after product administration, and in some dogs does not stop completely, although the product is 99.6% effective when given to dogs aged 3-10 months of age. Following administration, the testicles atrophy; the degree of atrophy may vary noticeably between testicles. The male hormone, testosterone, is produced in limited quantities following treatment with Zeuterin, but after two years, testosterone production is similar to that in untreated dogs. The continuing presence of testosterone means that, unlike surgical castration, chemical castration does not remove the risk of testosterone-associated disease, such as prostatic disease. This method of chemical castration is contraindicated in cases of undescended testicles (cryptorchidism), or if scrotal dermatitis or testicular disease is present. If the product is not injected correctly, scrotal ulceration and swelling may occur. The manufacturer, Ark Sciences, certifies veterinarians to use Zeuterin after they have completed a 5-hour course regarding the correct location and manner to inject the drug. In the United States, this product was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003, under the trade name Neutersol, and was marketed from 2003 to 2005 by Pet Healthcare International. In 2005, Pet Healthcare International severed ties with its manufacturing partner Addison Biologicals, and production of the drug stopped. Ark Sciences acquired the intellectual property to Neutersol, rebranded it as Zeuterin, and relaunched it in 2014. In 2016, Ark Sciences suspended distribution of Zeuterin.

Born in Ayr, Scotland, he was brought up and educated in Swansea and Cardiff. After World War II he designed several major buildings in Cardiff and Swansea, and from 1971 to 1973 he served as president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1974 he summarised the needs of new architecture as 'Long life, loose fit, low energy'. ==Biography== Snelling House, Cardiff (1966) (now the Big Sleep hotel) Gordon was born in Ayr, Scotland, the son of John Tullis Gordon (b. 1884), a telegraph engineer, and Euphemia Baxter Borrowman Gordon, n√©e Simpson (1890-1942). In 1925 the family moved to Swansea. Gordon attended Swansea Grammar School, where his contemporaries included the poet Dylan Thomas, with whom he produced the school magazine, the composer Daniel Jones and the art critic Mervyn Levy. He lived in South Wales for the rest of his life, for many years at Llanblethian in the Vale of Glamorgan. He was an enthusiastic art collector, and bequeathed 32 paintings to the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea, including works by Marc Chagall, Augustus John, Kyffin Williams, Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson and Elizabeth Frink and a portrait bust of himself by Ivor Roberts-Jones. He retired in 1982, but retained a consultative role until 1988. He died in St Hilary, Vale of Glamorgan on 23 July 1999. He was unmarried. Crown Building 2, Cardiff (1979) ==Training== Gordon became a trainee architect in the Swansea Borough Architect's Department in 1935, and studied part-time for the RIBA intermediate examination, which he passed before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1936, while a trainee, he won the Lord Mayor of Cardiff's competition for the design of street decorations to celebrate the coronation. During World War II he served as a major in the Royal Engineers, serving in Palestine where he worked on large-scale construction projects. After leaving the Army, he studied at the Welsh School of Architecture in Cardiff, and was awarded a diploma with special distinction in 1948. ==Professional life== In 1949 Gordon entered into partnership with Thomas Alwyn Lloyd (1881-1960), forming T. Alwyn Lloyd and Gordon. Initially the practice worked on public housing and housing for the Forestry Commission. In 1949 he was appointed consultant architect to the Wales Gas Board, for which he designed a new headquarters, Snelling House, Cardiff (1966). This eight-story office block was the first of many large buildings that he designed. After Alwyn Lloyd's death in 1960, Gordon established Alex Gordon and Partners with Alun Roberts and David Humphreys. The business expanded, and had ten partners by 1972. Gordon was visiting professor at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London Gordon was elected president of the South Wales Institute of Architects in 1967. He was active in the RIBA and served as its president from 1971 to 1973. ===Long life, loose fit, low energy=== In 1974 he wrote a paper for the RIBA on the future shape of architecture, in which he argued that buildings should be designed for Long life, loose fit, low energy. This phrase has since become widely used by architectural practices. ==Buildings== Cardiff University School of Music (1970) Swansea Crown Court (1988) *1955 University Sports Pavilion, Cardiff (Awarded RIBA Bronze Medal) *1966 Cyncoed Methodist Chapel, Cardiff *1966 Snelling House, Cardiff.

The original CSI method makes use of the fact that 1HŒ± chemical shifts of amino acid residues in helices tends to be shifted upfield (i.e. towards the right side of an NMR spectrum) relative to their random coil values and downfield (i.e. towards the left side of an NMR spectrum) in beta strands. Similar kinds of upfield/downfiled trends are also detectable in backbone 13C chemical shifts. ==Implementation== The CSI is a graph-based technique that essentially employs an amino acid-specific digital filter to convert every assigned backbone chemical shift value into a simple three-state (-1, 0, +1) index. This approach generates a more easily understood and much more visually pleasing graph of protein chemical shift values. In particular, if the upfield 1HŒ± chemical shift (relative to an amino acid-specific random coil value) of a certain residue is > 0.1 ppm, then that amino acid residue is assigned a value of -1. Similarly, if the downfield 1HŒ± chemical shift of a certain amino acid residue is > 0.1 ppm then that residue is assigned a value of +1. If an amino acid residue‚Äôs chemical shift is not shifted downfield or upfield by a sufficient amount (i.e. <0.1 ppm), it is given a value of 0. When this 3-state index is plotted as a bar graph over the full length of the protein sequence, simple inspection can allow one to identify beta strands (clusters of +1 values), alpha helices (clusters of -1 values), and random coil segments (clusters of 0 values). A list of the amino acid-specific random coil chemical shifts for CSI calculations is given in Table 1. An example of a CSI graph for a small protein is shown in Figure 1 with the arrows located above the black bars indicating locations of the beta strands and the rectangular box indicating the location of a helix. {  +Table 1. CSI Residue-Specific 1HŒ± Random Coil Shifts ! Amino Acid !! 1HŒ± random coil shift (ppm) !! Amino Acid !! 1HŒ± RC shift random coil shift (ppm) -  Ala (A)  4.35  Met (M)  4.52 -  Cys (C)  4.65  Asn (N)  4.75 -  Asp (D)  4.76  Pro (P)  4.44 -  Glu (E)  4.29  Gln (Q)  4.37 -  Phe (F)  4.66  Arg (R)  4.38 -  Gly (G)  3.97  Ser (S)  4.50 -  His (H)  4.63  Thr (T)  4.35 -  Ile (I)  3.95  Val (V)  3.95 -  Lys (K)  4.36  Trp (W)  4.70 -  Leu (L)  4.17  Tyr (Y)  4.60 } ==Performance== Using only 1HŒ± chemical shifts and simple clustering rules (clusters of 3 or more vertical bars for beta strands and clusters of 4 or more vertical bars for alpha helices), the CSI is typically 75-80% accurate in the identification of secondary structures. This performance depends partly on the quality of the NMR data set as well as the technique (manual or programmatic) used to identify the protein secondary structures. As noted above, a consensus CSI method that filters upfield/downfield chemical shift changes in 13CŒ±, 13CŒ≤, and 13C' atoms in a similar manner to 1HŒ± shifts has also been developed. The consensus CSI combines the CSI plots from backbone 1H and 13C chemical shifts to generate a single CSI plot. It can be up to 85-90% accurate. ==History== The link between protein chemical shifts and protein secondary structure (specifically alpha helices) was first described by John Markley and colleagues in 1967. With the development of modern 2-dimensional NMR techniques, it became possible to measure more protein chemical shifts. With more peptides and proteins were being assigned in the early 1980s it soon became obvious that amino acid chemical shifts were sensitive not only to helical conformations, but also to Œ≤-strand conformations. Specifically, the secondary 1HŒ± chemical shifts of all amino acids exhibit a clear upfield trend on helix formation and an obvious downfield trend on Œ≤-sheet formation. By the early 1990s, a sufficient body of 13C and 15N chemical shift assignments for peptides and proteins had been collected to determine that similar upfield/downfield trends were evident for essentially all backbone 13CŒ±, 13CŒ≤, 13C', 1HN and 15N (weakly) chemical shifts. It was these rather striking chemical shift trends that were exploited in the development of the chemical shift index. ==Limitations== The CSI method is not without some shortcomings. In particular, its performance drops if chemical shift assignments are mis- referenced or incomplete. It is also quite sensitive to the choice of random coil shifts used to calculate the secondary shifts and it generally identifies alpha helices (>85% accuracy) better than beta strands (<75% accuracy) regardless of the choice of random coil shifts. Furthermore, the CSI method does not identify other kinds of secondary structures, such as Œ≤-turns. Because of these shortcomings, a number of alternative CSI-like approaches have been proposed. These include: 1) a prediction method that employs statistically derived chemical shift/structure potentials (PECAN); 2) a probabilistic approach to secondary structure identification (PSSI); 3) a method that combines secondary structure predictions from sequence data and chemical shift data (PsiCSI), 4) a secondary structure identification approach that uses pre-specified chemical shift patterns (PLATON) and 5) a two- dimensional cluster analysis method known as 2DCSi. The performance of these newer methods is generally slightly better (2-4%) than the original CSI method. ==Utility== Since its original description in 1992, the CSI method has been used to characterize the secondary structure of thousands of peptides and proteins. Its popularity is largely due to the fact that it is easy to understand and can be implemented without the need for specialized computer programs. Even though the CSI method can be easily performed manually, a number of commonly used NMR data processing programs such as NMRView, NMR structure generation web servers such as CS23D as well as various NMR data analysis web servers such as RCI, Preditor and PANAV have incorporated the CSI method into their software. ==See also== *Chemical Shift *Random Coil Index *Protein NMR *Protein Chemical Shift Re-Referencing *Protein secondary structure *Protein Chemical Shift Prediction *NMR *Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy *Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy *Protein ==References *CSI calculations via RCI webserver http://randomcoilindex.com *CSI calculations via Preditor webserver http://preditor.ca *Stand-alone CSI program for Linux/Unix http://www.bionmr.ualberta.ca/sykes/software/csi/latest/csi.html *Chemical shift rereferencing for CSI calculations by Shiftcor http://shiftcor.wishartlab.com/ *Chemical shift rereferencing for CSI calculations by PANAV https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150003/http://www.wishartlab.com/web_servers/panav Category:Nuclear magnetic resonance Category:Nuclear magnetic resonance software Category:Protein methods Category:Protein structure Category:Biophysics Category:Scientific techniques Category:Chemistry software ","title":"Chemical shift index"},{"id":"41985383","text":"Nyctemera latemarginata is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Arnold Pagenstecher in 1901.

In his first school years he was taught privately and afterwards he was educated in Istanbul. He was an activist of the Albanian National Awakening in the Elbasan region. He is remembered for having raised the Albanian flag in Elbasan on 26 November 1912 at the request of Ismail Qemal bey Vlora. In 1913 he was elected Prefect of Elbasan. He supported Qemal in his attempt to form a stable administration and was Minister of the Interior for a brief period in 1914 (28 March - 3 September) during the reign of Prince William of Wied. After the triumph of the Islamic Revolt in 1914 he left Albania together with Wied. He settled in Bari, Italy, and after a couple of months returned to Albania, settling in Shkod√´r since going back to Elbasan was impossible. In 1915 he joined a secret nationalist committee founded by Hoxha Kadri Prishtina in Shkod√´r, together with other patriots as Sotir Pe√ßi, Eshref Frash√´ri, Ali Shefqet Shkupi, etc. The committee was a precursor of the later Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo. Following the Montenegrin invasion of Shkod√´r in 1915, he was arrested and sent to internment for a few months together with Luigj Gurakuqi and Sotir Pe√ßi. Following an Austro-Hungarian offensive, Montenegro capitulated and Bi√ßak√ßiu and other were set free. As a pro-Austrian he propagandized between Albanians not to oppose the Austrian armies. Bi√ßak√ßiu took part in an unsuccessful congress in his native Elbasan in 1916 to restore Albanian independence, in cooperation with the Austrian authorities, specifically August Ritter von Kral. Bi√ßak√ßiu aimed at restoring the Prince Wied and the Principality of Albania. The same Austrian authorities would prohibit such an event. In this condition, he resigned from any political duty. He was not involved until the Congress of Durr√´s in December 1918. Despite the desire of participating in the event, Bi√ßak√ßiu could only send a telegram where he advised aiming at reestablishing the borders of Treaty of London, 1913 as a sign of \\"neutrality\\" of the Albania state. At the same time, the telegram positioned him against the pro-Italian spirit of the Durr√´s Congress which characterized most of the participants. Statue of Aqif Pasha in Elbasan In 1920, he chaired the Congress of Lushnje and was one of the central figures who rules the Albanian politics of that time, together with Eshref Frash√´ri and Ahmet Zogu. As a representative of the Bektashi community, he was elected to the four-member High Regency Council (K√´shilli i Lart√´ i Regjenc√´s) that ruled the Principality of Albania after the exile of Prince Wied. Bi√ßaku was a foe of Shefqet V√´rlaci and had often tenuous relations with Ahmet Zogu. Together with Dom Luigj Bum√ßi, he took part in a coup d‚Äô√©tat in December 1921 and was later relieved of his duties on the High Council by Zogu. In 1923‚Äì1924, Bi√ßaku represented Kor√ßa in the Albanian parliament as a member of a pro-Noli democratic opposition. After the suppression of the June Revolution in December 1924 and fall of the Noli government, he went into exile. Sejfi Vllamasi, another political refugee in Vienna would describe him as a \\"great patriot, but stubborn and insistent till the end\\". His son, Ibrahim Bi√ßak√ßiu, was a Balli Komb√´tar leader and served as Prime Minister of Albania during the period 29 August to 28 November 1944. He was arrested by the Communist authorities after World War II. In 1962, he was given the \\"Order for Patriotic Activity of Second Class\\" by the Albanian government. After the fall of communism in Albania, a statue of him was placed in a plaza of Elbasan. ==See also== *Lef Nosi *Albanian Declaration of Independence *Principality of Albania ==Further== *Pavar√´sia e Elbasanit 1912 : (35 firm√´tar√´t) [Independence of Elbasan 1912: (35 signatories)], Hyqmet Kotherja, Tirana, Sht√´pi Botimi \\"2 Lindje, 2 Per√´ndime\\", 2012, ==References== Category:People from Elbasan Category:19th-century Albanian politicians Category:20th-century Albanian politicians Category:Albanians of the Ottoman Empire Category:Albanian politicians Category:1861 births Category:1926 deaths Category:Activists of the Albanian National Awakening Category:Albanian Pashas Category:People from Manastir Vilayet Category:Bektashi Order Category:Bi√ßaku family Category:Albanian Sufis Category:Civil servants of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Aqif Pasha Elbasani"},{"id":"41985496","text":"Nyctemera kinibalina is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Snellen in 1899.

Once a thriving hamlet on the south shore of the Big Black River, it is today the location of a $32 million wastewater treatment plant. Nothing remains of the original settlement. ==History== Beatties Bluff was founded in the early 1800s as an outpost along the Natchez Trace. When Yazoo County was created in 1823, Beatties Bluff was made its first county seat. In 1829, the county seat was moved to Benton. When Madison County was created in 1829, it too named Beatties Bluff as its first county seat. Soon after, the county seat was moved to Livingston. Boats would ascend the Big Black River to Beatties Bluff, which had a post office, court house, and other buildings made of hewn logs. In 1835, rumors of a slave uprising were overheard on a plantation at Beatties Bluff. Slaves there were tortured to extract information, which led to the arrest and quick execution of two itinerant white men. This incident coincided with the general hysteria about slave uprisings known as the \\"Murrell Excitement\\". The loss of both county seats eventually led the town to become extinct. In 2000, Nissan Motor Company began construction of a vehicle assembly plant in nearby Canton. As part of the infrastructure, a site just west of the old town was selected in 2001 for the construction of the Beatties Bluff Wastewater Treatment Facility, capable of processing eight million gallons of water per day. ==References * Photo of Beatties Bluff site Category:Former populated places in Madison County, Mississippi Category:Former populated places in Mississippi ","title":"Beatties Bluff, Mississippi"},{"id":"41985530","text":"Nyctemera radiata is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Francis Walker in 1856.

Rusch is remembered in Japan for his role as an educator and for pioneering activities in development of American football, rural agriculture and post Second World War reconciliation. ==Background and early life== Born November 25, 1897 in Fairmount, Indiana, US, Rusch was raised in Louisville, Kentucky. He served with the US Army in France during the First World War. In Kentucky, Rusch was an active member of the congregation of Christ Church Cathedral in Louisville. ==Work in Japan== Rusch first arrived in Japan in 1925, initially to help the YMCA with reconstruction efforts after the Great Kant≈ç earthquake, and stayed to dedicate his life and energies towards youth education, post-war reconciliation and rural development in that country. Through his association with the Anglican Church in Japan he taught both Economics at Rikkyo University and was instrumental in helping Dr. Rudolf Teusler raise funds for the expansion of St. Luke's International Hospital in central Tokyo. Encouraged by Bishop Charles S. Reifsnider, Rusch was renowned as an unconventional, but highly effective lay evangelist for the Anglican Church in Japan, establishing a chapter of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew at Rikkyo University in 1927. In 1934 Rusch also established and was elected first chairman of the Intercollegiate Football League, the first college level American Football association in Japan. The Paul Rusch Cup is awarded each year to the MVP of the Rice Bowl, Japan's own American Football national championship game. Rusch was arrested in December 1941 immediately after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. He was detained at a temporary prison camp on the campus of Sumire Girls' School on the outskirts of Tokyo and eventually deported from Japan as a part of a wartime prisoner exchange in June 1942. Repatriated back to the United States, Rusch worked at the Military Intelligence Service Language School at Camp Savage, Minnesota, returning to Japan at the end of hostilities as a member of General Douglas MacArthur's General Staff. ==Kiyosato Educational Experiment Project (KEEP)== KEEP Seisen Ryo, Main BuildingKiyosato St. Andrew's Church, KiyosatoRusch is most widely known for his work in founding the rural at Kiyosato, on the slopes of Mt. Yatsugatake, Yamanashi Prefecture. The camp and farm, first opened in July 1938, served as an Anglican youth mission center prior to the Second World War and was rededicated in 1946 as the Kiyosato Educational Experiment Project (KEEP). After the war, as surrounding fields were cleared, a new Anglican church dedicated to St. Andrew was constructed using local stone. A vocational school, an experimental farm, a nursery and library facilities soon followed. In June 1948 the groundbreaking ceremonies for the Seisen Ryo rural clinic were attended by Prince Takamatsu. Other features of the mountainside site include a Yamanashi Prefecture Nature Center, the Japan American Football Hall of Fame, and an outdoor chapel and altar constructed in 1962 by students from Lenox School for Boys. The KEEP farm and mission center is an operationally independent year-round residential retreat and conference center, but retains its links with Anglican and other Christian church educational establishments throughout Japan. The original farm property and Paul Rusch Memorial Museum are the focus of the popular Yatsugatake County Fair and Paul Rusch Festival held each October. ==Recognition and awards== Among numerous awards and decorations, Rusch received honorary doctorates from Hobart and William Smith College in 1950, Lincoln University in 1955 and Rikkyo University in 1965. Rusch was awarded the Third Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese Government in 1956. The Paul Rusch Athletics Center on the main campus of Rikkyo University in Ikebukuro is named in his honour. A commemorative plaque in the University Chapel records his role as Godfather of over 500 Rikkyo Students. ==Paul Rusch Cup== The Paul Rusch Cup is an annual award, beginning in 1984, given to the top American football player in Japan. ==See also== *Anglican Church in Japan *Rikkyo University ==References * Official site of KEEP * Aiko Takeuchi-Demirci, Review of McDonald, Andrew T.; McDonald, Verlaine Stoner, Paul Rusch in Postwar Japan: Evangelism, Rural Development, and the Battle against Communism, H-Diplo, H-Net Reviews (June 2019).

Goldman (30 November 1938 ‚Äì 24 December 2013) was a British haematologist, oncologist and medical researcher. A specialist in chronic myeloid leukaemia, Goldman conducted pioneering research into leukaemia treatment ‚Äì he was instrumental in the development of bone marrow transplantation as a clinical method, and later in the development of the drug imatinib. He was also a prolific author of scientific papers, was involved with numerous medical charities and had a decades-long surgical career at Hammersmith Hospital, London. ==Early life and education== Goldman was born in London in 1938 to Carl and Berthe Goldman, both Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. Although he was briefly detained as an enemy alien, Carl Goldman served in the British Army during World War II, and established a successful medical practice in London; he later treated famous individuals such as Elizabeth Taylor and Rex Reed. John Goldman attended the Westminster School and performed in the school choir, but was barred from singing in Westminster Abbey, likely due to his Jewish background. Goldman attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied psychology and physiology despite originally applying to study classics. At one point during his Oxford years, Goldman and some friends drove across Eurasia to reach India; the Iranian authorities briefly arrested them during the journey, forcing Goldman's group to drug their guards with barbiturates to escape. After graduating from Oxford, Goldman trained in (and later taught) haematology and oncology at several medical schools and hospitals, including St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Harvard University, and the University of Miami. ==Medical career and leukaemia research== In 1971 Goldman joined the staff of Hammersmith Hospital, London, and became a specialist in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. During the 1980s, he conducted some of the first bone marrow transplants in Europe, and also developed precise molecular tests to detect residual leukaemia cells in the blood of patients. Goldman chaired the charity Leuka from its inception in 1982, launching a ¬£10 million appeal to build the Catherine Lewis Centre, a specialist leukaemia centre, at Hammersmith Hospital; the centre opened in 2002. In 1988, Goldman became a member of the blood cancer charity and bone marrow transplant register Anthony Nolan. He worked as a trustee and medical director for Anthony Nolan for over 20 years, helping the charity to expand its reach and resources worldwide. He also helped establish the World Marrow Donor Association in 1990, and served (at various different times) as the president of the International Society for Experimental Haematology, the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the European Haematology Association and several other medical and scientific organisations. From the late 1990s onwards, Goldman was instrumental in promoting the use of the anti- cancer drug imatinib, working to refine and expand its clinical usage as a targeted therapy. He retired from Hammersmith Hospital in 2004, but continued to work as an advocate and benefactor of cancer research and treatment in the developing world. During his career, he published over 700 scientific papers, and was the editor of the journal Bone Marrow Transplantation from 1985 until his death in December 2013. ==Personal life== Goldman was married to Jeannine Fuller; after divorcing her, he lived with Constance Shaw. He was survived by his three children: a daughter from his marriage to Fuller, and a daughter and son from his relationship with Shaw. Goldman was an avid reader of history and classic literature, travelled extensively overseas, and was a passionate skier. ==References * Obituary of Goldman in Bone Marrow Transplantation (PDF) Category:British oncologists Category:British medical researchers Category:British haematologists Category:British Jews Category:Alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford Category:1938 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Physicians of Hammersmith Hospital ","title":"John M.

He was one of the first settlers and founder of what is now the city of Red Deer, Alberta. ==Early life== Born in 1841 at Musquodoboit, Nova Scotia, Gaetz married Caroline Blowers Hamilton in 1865. They had a family of eleven children, six sons and five daughters. Gaetz was an ordained Methodist minister, serving the church until 1883. He left the ministry due to ill health and moved to the Red Deer Valley. He decided to homestead on the west half of a section on the Red Deer River, and one of his sons, Halley Gaetz, took up the other half section. ==Red Deer== Leonard Gaetz acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer. In 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba, at Brandon and Winnipeg. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \\"Westerner Days\\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. A Conservative, Gaetz ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta unsuccessfully in the Alberta general election, 1905 and for the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in 1894, both times for the Red Deer constituency. ==Death== He died in Red Deer in 1907, less than a year after the death of his wife in December 1906. Two sons would serve as mayor of Red Deer, Raymond Leonard Gaetz, and Halley Hamilton Gaetz. Another son, Clarence Wilberforce Gaetz would become the first mayor of Leduc, Alberta. ==Legacy== A Methodist church was built in 1892 and enlarged in 1909, when the new Methodist Church was announced by the Board of Trustees, to be known as The Leonard Gaetz Memorial Methodist Church, named after Reverend Leonard Gaetz. In 1925 the local Methodist congregation voted in favour of church union, and their building became Gaetz Memorial United Church, again named in honour of Reverend Leonard Gaetz. He is memorialized in the name of Red Deer's major thoroughfare, Gaetz Avenue. ==References * Category:1841 births Category:1907 deaths ","title":"Leonard Gaetz"},{"id":"41985854","text":"is a Japanese football player.

A. B. Coit.Sean Michael Lucas, Grace Transforms: The Story of First Presbyterian Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi (FPC Hattiesburg, 2013). It was the first church in the town and predated Hattiesburg's own incorporation by two years. In 1973 it left the Presbyterian Church in the United States to become a charter member of the more theologically conservative Presbyterian Church in America. ==HistoryFounding=== The church was first located at McDonald's Mill, a sawmill seven miles northeast of downtown, but moved to the center of Hattiesburg in 1883. The first supply pastor, Rev. H. C. Smith, also served small congregations in Jones and Perry counties. The young congregation first met in space shared with the local school; while their first building was built, they shared space with the local Methodist church and adopted the name Bouie Presbyterian. In 1886, the church called the Rev. J. M. Smith as pastor, who spent seven years ministering in Hattiesburg and other small congregations in the area. Smith had been born in Mt. Olive, Mississippi and studied at Union Presbyterian Seminary. ===Currie and McIntosh Pastorates=== In 1893, Dr. E. J. Currie was called as pastor, and his tenure saw the congregation move into its second building, white clapboard with twin spires, at 723 Main Street. Dr. Currie also served as the superintendent of schools in Perry County and eventually the first superintendent of Hattiesburg Public Schools. In 1918, he would become president of Chickasaw Female College. The church planted two still extant daughter congregations in this period, Petal Presbyterian in 1902 and Bay Street Presbyterian in 1906. When planting Bay Street, which was also in Hattiesburg, the congregation changed its name to First Presbyterian. The church's longest serving minister was Dr. W. H. McIntosh, who served from 1919 until 1954. Dr. McIntosh oversaw the 1929 move to a new building a few blocks north on Main Street, which now houses the True Light Missionary Baptist Church. He also served as moderator of the Synod of Mississippi of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, and on the board of trustees of Southwestern University and Columbia Theological Seminary. ===Civil Rights Era=== Near the end of Dr. McIntosh's ministry, the Rev. William J. Stanway was called as an assistant pastor, succeeding as senior pastor on the unexpected death of McIntosh in 1954. Stanway had been educated at Bob Jones University and Westminster Theological Seminary. Under his leadership two more churches were planted, Westminster Presbyterian and Pineview Presbyterian. Stanway also played a role in founding Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi in 1966. During the Civil Rights Movement he followed the path of other Hattiesburg clergy in remaining silent on the great upheavals of the time. Robert Patrick Rayner writes: > Reverend W. J. Stanway never mentioned the northern ministers or civil > rights protests from his pulpit. Even Newton Cox [of Westminster > Presbyterian Church], considered the most liberal of the three > [Presbyterian] ministers, refused to recognize on Sunday morning any social > unrest in his community for fear of upsetting the peace and unity of the > church. In 1964, a delegation of three pastors and two elders from Hattiesburg's Presbyterian churches traveled to First Presbyterian Church in Charleston, Illinois to protest the participation of pastors from that area in the civil rights protests in Hattiesburg. ===The Presbyterian Church in America=== In 1970, the Rev. Ed Johnson, formerly an assistant pastor at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, was called to First Presbyterian Hattiesburg. He brought with him from his time at Coral Ridge under the tutelage of D. James Kennedy the Evangelism Explosion program. Johnson's pastorate also saw the planting of Woodland Presbyterian Church and the departure of the congregation, and many of its plants, to the new Presbyterian Church in America in response to the increasing theological liberalism of the Presbyterian Church in the United States. The PCA committed itself to be, \\"faithful to the Scriptures, true to the Reformed faith, and obedient to the Great Commission.\\" Dr. L. Roy Taylor, a professor from Reformed Theological Seminary, was called as senior pastor of the church. Growth under his leadership led to the decision to build a new church in 1990 to the west of town near I-59. At the time, the area was undeveloped but the church leadership saw the steady development of the town to the west and sought to position the congregation for future growth. The church, which cost $5 million to build and stands on of land. The church has provided a leadership role in the broader PCA, with Dr. Taylor serving as the Stated Clerk in 1994, and a ruling elder, Samuel J. Duncan, serving as moderator of the General Assembly in 1998. Dr. H. Andrew Silman served as pastor from 1994 until 2006, and was succeeded in 2009, after a lengthy interim period, by Dr. Sean Michael Lucas, previously a professor of Covenant Theological Seminary (This is no longer current information. Dr. Lucas is now the senior pastor of Independent Presbyterian Church in Memphis, Tennessee. He has been succeeded by Rev. Jim McCarthy.) Recent years have seen significant expansion of the physical plant with the construction of Currie and McIntosh Halls. ==Services== First Presbyterian has three worship services on Sunday, at 8:30am, 11:00am, and 6pm. The morning worship services are designed to draw on the great traditions of the church's worship music. The evening service is intended to be more acoustic and informal, drawing both from traditional hymns as well as music developed by Reformed University Fellowship, the college ministry of the PCA. The centerpiece of each service is the Expository preaching from the Bible. == External links == *Official website == References == Category:Religious organizations established in 1882 Category:Buildings and structures in Hattiesburg, Mississippi Category:Presbyterian Church in America churches in Mississippi ","title":"First Presbyterian Church (Hattiesburg, Mississippi)"},{"id":"41985931","text":"P. exigua may refer to: * Partula exigua, an extinct snail * Parvocaulis exigua, a green algae * Parvulastra exigua, a sea star * Patella exigua, a true limpet * Pelegrina exigua, a jumping spider * Peperomia exigua, a radiator plant * Perigona exigua, a ground beetle * Phaneroptera exigua, an Old World katydid * Phasmoneura exigua, a carnivorous insect * Philine exigua, a headshield slug * Phoma exigua, a plant pathogen * Phorocera exigua, a tachina fly * Phycolepidozia exigua, a liverwort endemic to Dominica * Phyllosticta exigua, a sac fungus * Plagiolepis exigua, a formic-acid- producing ant * Platythyrea exigua, a predaceous ant * Plecopterodes exigua, an Afrotropical moth * Pleurothallis exigua, a bonnet orchid * Ponometia exigua, an American moth * Prenanthella exigua, a flowering plant * Prumnopitys exigua, a Bolivian conifer * Pseudopoda exigua, a huntsman spider * Psilogramma exigua, a hawk moth * Purpurcapsula exigua, a false cowry * Puya exigua, a plant endemic to Ecuador ","title":"P. exigua"},{"id":"41985947","text":"Xylecata ugandicola is a moth of the family Erebidae.

This makes him very forgetful and accident-prone, as a side effect. * Rokit (voiced by Phil Hayes) ‚àí The trooper of the Orbitons does everything as if his life depends on it, whether it's petting a kitten, or eating some pizza. One of Rokit's biggest pet peeves is that none of the other Mixels mimic his extreme lifestyle. =Infernite Cousins= * Meltus (voiced by Jess Harnell): a shy and nervous Mixel who is allergic to almost everything. * Flamzer (voiced by Rodger Bumpass): a dramatic and anxious Mixel who can move quickly. * Burnard (voiced by Jess Harnell): a mischievous Mixel who finds everything funny. =Glowkies= * Globert (voiced by Dave Fennoy) ‚àí Globert claims to wow and impress any audience, and with his glow- in-the-dark eye, that's not hard to do! He loves to perform, and is the tribe's ultimate exhibitionist. * Vampos (voiced by Sam Riegel) ‚àí Vampos is the ultimate sports nut. He loves any sport, from rockball to acrobatics, and he's good at all of these, too! He is also said to be very relaxed and calm. * Boogly (voiced by Dave Fennoy) ‚àí Boogly is, well, a snob. He claims to have done everything there is, so nothing impresses him. He is always complaining, and is very critical.

This is because they consider themselves far superior to the Mixels, but are only able to say quite a few words. Their white faces can pop out of their bodies and walk around (with no arms). * Major Nixel (voiced by Fred Tatasciore, later Rodger Bumpass, and currently Peter Jason) ‚àí Major Nixel is the military leader of the Nixels. Unlike the other Nixels, he is capable of speech. He treats the other Nixels like a tornado treats cars, throwing and kicking them to steal cubits. * King Nixel (voiced by Phil Hayes, later by Steve Blum) ‚àí The true leader of the Nixels. ===Other characters=== Glorp Corp * Booger (voiced by Tom Kenny) ‚àí Flexers * Teacher (voiced by Cree Summer) ‚àí Frosticons * Scrud (voiced by Richard Horvitz) ‚àí Klinkers * Principal Knave (voiced by Chris Cox) ‚àí MCPD * Sergeant (voiced by Dave Fennoy) ‚àí MCFD * Fire Chief (voiced by Peter Jason) - Medivals * King (voiced by Dave Fennoy) ‚àí Munchos * Coach (voiced by Phil Hayes) ‚àí * Zabo (voiced by Jess Harnell) ‚àí Spikels * Blip (voiced by Tom Kenny) ‚àí * Ranger Jinx (voiced by Jeff Glen Bennett) ‚àí * Gate Keeper (voiced by Rodger Bumpass) ‚àí ==EpisodesSeries overview=Season 1 (2014)=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:white;\\" ! 0ebfe9;\\"  No. in series ! 0ebfe9;\\"  No. in season ! 0ebfe9;\\"  Title ! 0ebfe9;\\"  Written and storyboarded by ! 0ebfe9;\\"  Original air date ! 0ebfe9;\\"  Production code - } ===Season 2 (2015‚Äì16)=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:white;\\" ! 00f;\\" No. in series ! 00f;\\" No. in season ! 00f;\\" Title ! 00f;\\" Written and storyboarded by ! 00f;\\" Original air date ! 00f;\\" Production code - } ==MerchandiseLEGO=== The Lego Group handles all toy merchandise for the Mixels franchise, and Cartoon Network handles all non-toy merchandising.

The San Francisco Chronicle described their work as \\"British Invasion guitar-pop with a twinge of country and roots,\\" in which \\"disparate rock influences ‚Äì '60s rock, '70s power pop, '80s college radio and indie rock ‚Äì come together for catchy, harmony-laden songs.\\" Rock critic Tris McCall wrote that the band is \\"firmly established as one of the best and hardest-working independent power-pop outfits in Northern California,\\" with songs that \\"contain monster singalong hooks.\\" ==Background== Bradley Skaught, the group's -year-old principal songwriter and frontman, was originally from Tacoma, Washington. Skaught began taking drum lessons while in second grade. He later moved to Oakland, California, where his musical career included a stint as drummer for Yuji Oniki, after which Skaught became better known as a guitarist and vocalist. His vocals have been called \\"distinctive and lovely,\\" \\"a unique drawl reminiscent of Tom Petty\\", and likened to John Lennon. Skaught was the founder of the band Belle Da Gama, which included Ian Robertson. The name Belle Da Gama was taken from the Salman Rushdie novel The Moor's Last Sigh. Belle Da Gama recorded one album, Garden Abstract, released in 2001 on 125 Records. In 2005, Skaught and Robertson disbanded Belle Da Gama and formed The Bye Bye Blackbirds. The new group was named after the 1926 jazz standard Bye Bye Blackbird. Skaught and Robertson, both guitarists, recruited drummer Lenny Gill and bass player William Duke online. In forming the new band, Skaught and Robertson decided on a \\"back-to-basics approach\\" based on \\"fundamental things we loved as listeners ‚Äì songwriting, harmony, cool guitar parts and sounds.\\" ==RecordingsHoneymoon (2006)=== The Bye Bye Blackbirds released their debut recording, an EP called Honeymoon, in 2006. Bill Swan, of the indie band Beulah, produced the seven-song EP. In a review, Richie Unterberger likened the songs to the \\"late-'70s power pop of Elvis Costello,\\" also finding similarities in approach with Badfinger and the Beatles. Skaught later referred to Honeymoon as \\"a bit embarrassing to me, although I like a couple songs and I love the sound... It works to me as a kind of statement of intent, but it makes me squirm to hear it.\\" ===Apology Accepted and Houses and Homes (2008)=== The group released their second EP, Apology Accepted, and their first full-length album, Houses and Homes, on the American Dust label in 2008. Unterberger likened Houses and Homes to British Invasion bands, with \\"tunes and the upper-register vocals [that] often echo some of the poppier Beatlesque groups of yore,\\" praising the album's sensitive lyrics and \\"upbeat guitar- oriented pop/rock with a tinge of the bittersweet.\\" In contrast to the album's dominant pop sound were the dreamy instrumental \\"Next Door,\\" and the tenser, Brian Eno-like ambient track \\"Murray Morgan's Last Dream.\\" Skaught called Houses and Homes \\"satisfyingly better than Honeymoon to me.... We experimented a lot ‚Äì goofy stuff with tape echoes and lots of layers.\\" The bluegrass-tinged song \\"The Ghosts Are All Right\\" was featured in the book Music: What Happened?, which named it as a favorite for that year, describing the song as \\"a Byrds-worthy meditation on history and responsibility in a local community.\\" Apology Accepted, a download-only EP, included \\"Monster Eyes,\\" a song written with novelist Jonathan Lethem from \\"lyrical fragments\\" of his novel You Don't Love Me Yet, and performed with Lethem at a reading. The title track of Apology Accepted was a cover of a song by The Go-Betweens. ===Fixed Hearts (2011)=== Before recording 2011's Fixed Hearts, bass player William Duke, who had previously shared songwriting responsibilities with Skaught, left the band. Skaught stated that writing all of the songs on Fixed Hearts was \\"liberating\\" and that the album benefited from his resulting confidence, and from the contributions of new bass player Aaron Rubin and producer Paul Tyler. The title is a reference to drummer Lenny Gill's then-recent heart surgery, as well as to the protagonists of the songs, who emerge from heartbreak with their own hearts repaired. Reviewing Fixed Hearts, the Aquarian Weekly cited the \\"general giddiness of the album,\\" moving from a \\"nostalgic and swinging vibe\\" through songs with a \\"country-pop sound\\" and \\"pulsing drums,\\" to the \\"peaceful\\" final tracks. AllMusic's Jack Rabid wrote that the album had the \\"brightly ringing, polished/unthreatening, anodyne\\" 1960s pop vibe of a \\"groovy guitar pop party\\" where \\"nice guys finish first and get the girl in the finale.\\" The review cited Skaught's \\"easy sincerity and the group's harmonic gifts,\\" embracing a \\"Panglossian panoply of this period from when they were pups, cutting in country-pop, folk, and‚Äîheck yeah‚Äîa horns-laden opener with bits of Memphis soul.\\" ===We Need the Rain (2013)=== Production notes The group's 2013 album, We Need the Rain, was produced by Paul Tyler, except for two tracks produced by KC Bowman (of Agony Aunts and Corner Laughers). The album marks Ian Robertson's final contributions as a member, prior to his departure to form a solo project, Black Butterfly Gang. Game Theory at memorial for Scott Miller Skaught dedicated We Need the Rain to Scott Miller, his \\"musical mentor.\\" Miller was not involved with the album, but Skaught told the San Francisco Chronicle that Miller's death in April 2013 was \\"the most painful and devastating blow,\\" leading Skaught to consider the album \\"a kind of anchor, something to channel all that chaos through ... It's the first record we've made that we couldn't take to him and get that final vote of confidence on.\\" Critical response and reviews We Need the Rain was named one of the \\"Top 20 Releases of 2013\\" by Goldmine, with critic John M. Borack citing guitars that \\"jangle, strum and get muscular when they need to.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle described the album as having \\"sweetly melancholy jingle-jangle and satisfyingly gutsy guitar and bass parts\\" with \\"soulful crunch.\\" Reviewer Bill Kopp wrote in Musoscribe that \\"chiming guitars, ear candy hooks, punchy guitar riffage, tight vocal harmonies\\" provide the emotional and \\"visceral punch\\" of power pop. In Dirty Impound, Dennis Cook wrote, \\"Every tune practically shimmies out of the speakers, cool small details etched into ceaselessly ear- snagging melodies as sweet, gently yearning voices sing about love and the weather in ways that make both seem brand new.\\" According to Tris McCall of the Newark Star-Ledger, the album took a new and \\"more aggressive approach\\" in which \\"guitars still twinkle and shimmer, on occasion, but this time around, they growl, twist, stutter and snap, too.\\" McCall wrote, \\"Although Skaught's essential optimism is always visible,\\" this \\"isn't always a happy album,\\" with songs \\"both more direct and more discontented\\" than Skaught's prior work. \\"Yet it is the deepest, gutsiest and most rewarding set in the band's discography, and it points the way forward for a project that once felt like a formal exercise in songcraft.\\" === Take Out The Poison (2017) ===  Production notes  The 2017 album Take Out The Poison was recorded primarily by Scott Evans at Antisleep and Sharkbite Studios in Oakland, CA. The line-up of the band was in flux at this time and, as a result, the album features three different drummers: Charlie Crabtree, Ian Lee and Andrew Wakefield. It is the first of the band's albums for which Lenny Gill is the full-time lead guitarist. Take Out The Poison is notable for featuring three duets, with Lindsay Paige Garfield, Julie Wakefield and Olivia Mancini being the featured duet vocalists. The album is also the first by the band to feature a string section on two songs, arranged by Bay Area musician and composer Mark Clifford. A video for the first single, \\"Duet\\", was filmed in San Francisco by Mike Tittel, who also took the cover photograph.  Critical response and reviews  Commenting on the diversity of the material and the ambition in pursuing different sounds and styles, Musoscribe critic Bill Kopp wrote \\"this album revels in those seemingly incompatible forms.\\" Tim Hiney at Dagger 'Zine wrote that songwriter Skaught \\"mines several decades of rock n‚Äô roll and up comes up with another winner\\" === Boxer At Rest (2020) ===  Production notes  Boxer At Rest was recorded at Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco by engineer Chris von Sneidern and produced by Doug Gillard. It's the first album by the band to feature drummer Jozef Becker (notably of The Loud Family and Thin White Rope). Initial tracking for the record was done in early 2019 without guitarist Lenny Gill who had undergone a heart transplant and was still hospitalized at the time. After a full recovery, Lenny returned to the studio in late 2019 to add his lead guitar parts. Longtime collaborator Bill Swan returned to arrange the horns on \\"Baby It's Still You\\" and \\"You Were All Light\\". The album features the harmony vocals of Kelly Atkins extensively alongside those of KC Bowman.  Critical response and reviews  Don Valentine, writing for I Don't Hear A Single, wrote, \\"Boxer At Rest is a magnificent album, a proper album to be listened to from start to finish. It will definitely be up there at the end of year awards.\\" Mike Baron wrote \\"If architecture is frozen music, the Blackbirds‚Äô songs are fluid Frank Lloyd Wright or Charles Haertling, beautiful, inviting designs in which you want to live.\\" Dave Franklin commented, \\"The secret of The Bye Bye Blackbirds sound seems to be that whilst they walk with the swagger of a rock band, they think with the precision of a pop outfit. And if they seem to tip their hats to a few past, pop greats, they do so whilst stepping confidently into the future...\\" In a Q&A; at the Sweet Sweet Music blog, Skaught suggests the choice of Gillard as producer was in part because \\"we knew him a bit, but also he‚Äôs got this amazing body of work for decades and is also a brilliant songwriter.\\" Speaking to Andrea Weiss at All Around Records, Skaught explains the thematic origins of the songs on the album as a combination of personal losses and struggles in society and community: \\"You know, we‚Äôve lost some really good friends and people from our musical circles, and on top of that the struggles of our times and places ‚Äì the political landscape, wealth disparity, gentrification, this feeling of things fraying around the edges. I think a lot of just living in Oakland has fed into these songs ‚Äì Ghost Ship, homeless encampments in public spaces, venues closing, people on the margins pushed even further out. I think the songs sit right where the personal and the public are the same thing.\\" ==DiscographyAlbums and EPs=== {  - !style=\\"width:40px;\\" Year !style=\\"width:150px;\\" Title !style=\\"width:325px;\\" Details !style=\\"width:40px;\\" Format !style=\\"width:80px;\\" Label - 2006 Honeymoon  EP self-released - 2008 Apology Accepted  EP American Dust (DAD-106) - 2008 Houses and Homes  CD American Dust (DAD-107) - 2011 Fixed Hearts  CD Rainbow Quartz - 2013 We Need The Rain  LP, CD self-released - 2017 Take Out the Poison  LP, CD self-released - 2019 Boxer At Rest  LP, CD self-released } ===Various artists compilations=== {  - !style=\\"width:40px;\\" Year !style=\\"width:200px;\\" Title !style=\\"width:275px;\\" Details !style=\\"width:40px;\\" Format !style=\\"width:80px;\\" Label - 2009 Crayon Angel: A Tribute to the Music of Judee Sill Track 12: \\"There's a Rugged Road\\" (4:04) CD American Dust (DAD-109) } ===Singles=== {  - !style=\\"width:40px;\\" Year !style=\\"width:200px;\\" Artist !style=\\"width:275px;\\" Title !style=\\"width:40px;\\" Format !style=\\"width:80px;\\" Label - 2014 Dr. Frank & The Bye Bye Blackbirds \\"Even Hitler Had A Girlfriend\\" b/w \\"Population: Us\\" 7\\" single Good Land Records - 2015 The Bye Bye Blackbirds \\"Let Your Hair Fall Down\\" b/w \\"These Blues\\" digital single self-released } ==Notes* Category:Indie rock musical groups from California Category:Musical groups established in 2005 Category:American power pop groups Category:Musical groups from Oakland, California Category:Indie pop groups from California Category:2005 establishments in California ","title":"The Bye Bye Blackbirds"},{"id":"41986185","text":"Jadvyga Putinienƒó (n√©e Dunauskaitƒó on 30 December 1945 or 2 October 1944) is a Lithuanian javelin thrower.

Its earliest predecessor company, the Portland Gas Light Company, was founded in Maine in 1849. The current company was set up in 1984 and is based in New Hampshire. It provides electric services to about 102,400 customers and natural gas to over 75,900 customers. The service territory of Unitil includes business districts and recreational centers as well as commercial and industrial business, such as electronic component manufacturers and education institutes. The company has an enterprise value of $766.54 million. The non- utility business is operated through the company‚Äôs subsidiary, U-source, which is a national energy brokering and consulting company. ==Background== Unitil Through The Years 1849 Portland Gas Light Company founded in Maine. 1852 Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company is organized to illuminate gas streetlights in downtown Fitchburg, Massachusetts. 1901 Concord Electric Company is founded. 1908 Exeter & Hampton Electric Company is founded. 1979 Northern Utilities is incorporated. Its predecessor companies include Portland Gas Light Company. 1984 Unitil Corporation is incorporated as a public utility holding company, with utility operating subsidiaries Concord Electric Company and Exeter & Hampton Electric Company. Unitil Service Corp. is founded to provide joint administrative services for Unitil's subsidiary companies. 1992 Unitil merges with Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company, and Fitchburg remains as one of Unitil's operating utility companies. 1993 Unitil founds Unitil Resources, Inc. as a non-utility subsidiary. Its affiliate, Usource LLC., provides energy brokerage services to large energy users throughout the northeast seeking competitive electricity or natural gas supply. 2002 Concord Electric Company and Exeter & Hampton Electric Company merge, and Unitil Energy Systems is the new name of the combined companies. 2008 Northern Utilities and Granite State Gas Transmission are acquired by Unitil. 2018 Tom Meissner was named Unitil‚Äôs Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President. http://unitil.com/company/company-profile The Company generates revenue mainly distributing utility to customers through operating the underground transmission pipeline and providing energy consulting service and real estate service. 2013, the revenue of gas operation is $170.4 million accounting for 46% of the total operation revenue, and the electricity operation revenue, $190.7 million, represents 52% of the total revenue. The company has four segments, three wholly owned distribution utilities and five subsidiaries, providing utilities and relevant advice and management service to customers. The three distribution utilities are Unitil Energy Systems, Inc., Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company and Northern Utilities, Inc. The cold weather made more and more people switch to the service of Unitil, which resulted in a gas sale increase, so the company has planned to invest $570 million to expand its distribution infrastructure to serve a larger number of customers. In winter 2014, the company has asked for a price increase to part of its customers in Greater Portland and the Lewiston-Auburn because of the high demand and harsh weather. The Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) approved its price increase but cut its request by one-third. ==References * Category:Energy in New Hampshire Category:Electric power companies of the United States Category:Natural gas companies of the United States Category:Companies based in New Hampshire Category:American companies established in 1984 Category:Energy companies established in 1984 Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in New Hampshire Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Hampton, New Hampshire ","title":"Unitil Corporation"},{"id":"41986568","text":"George Lynn (January 28, 1906 in Cumberland, Maryland ‚Äì December 3, 1967 in Los Angeles, California) was an American actor and writer.

The suburb is positioned on the delta of the Pimpama River at the southern end of Moreton Bay. At the , the suburb recorded a population of 1,839. Jacobs Well is best known for its four lane boat ramp, Volunteer Marine Rescue facility and the surrounding sugar cane fields. It is often described as \\"The Gateway to Southern Moreton Bay\\" Jacobs Well was once part of the Shire of Albert. It belongs to the Electoral district of Coomera state electorate. ==Geography== Jacobs Well is bounded to the north by Steiglitz, to the east by Moreton Bay, to the south by the Pimpama River and to the west by Norwell. ==History== In the late 1800s, the farming district located between the Pimpama River and the Logan River called Pimpama Island encompassed the modern localities of Jacobs Well, Norwell, Steiglitz and Woongoolba. It was referred to as an island because there were a number of lagoons and swamps that isolated the area during the wet season; however, this disadvantage made it good land for growing sugar cane. ==Amenities== Volunteer Marine Rescue facility, 2014 Jacobs Well offers many amenities for the boating and fishing enthusiast. It has a sandy beach facing Moreton Bay, with an enclosed swimming area, barbeque facilities and a well stocked fishing tackle & bait shop; a four-lane boat ramp, pontoon, parking for cars with trailers, and camping ground. A volunteer marine rescue service operates from Jacobs Well, providing services on Moreton Bay, the Gold Coast Broadwater and in the Coomera, Logan and Albert Rivers. The village boasts a doctors surgery, chemist, small supermarket, bakery, real estate agents, hair dressers, several cafes, takeaways & a tavern with a quality restaurant. The Gold Coast City Council operates a fortnightly mobile library service which visits the Community Centre on Bay Drive. == Calypso Bay == Calypso Bay is a canal estate at the south end of Jacobs Well. Established via the use of a converted sand mining lease, the surrounding mangrove tidal land was turned into a canal estate by using sand from the creation of the canals. The area remains surrounded by a largely pristine natural environment, providing a habitat for native birds and wildlife and continues to be an important marine sanctuary. Calypso Bay offers a range of waterfront homesites with direct boating access to The Broadwater and Moreton Bay. The GFC slowed the development of the site, with stages of land release ongoing. A promised golf course is still in the planning stage. The marina is operational, though not developed to its final stage yet. == References Category:Suburbs of the Gold Coast, Queensland Category:Coastline of Queensland ","title":"Jacobs Well, Queensland"},{"id":"41986604","text":"\\"The Heart\\" and \\"Difference Maker\\" (styled \\"The Heart + Difference Maker\\") are the two lead singles from Needtobreathe's fifth studio album Rivers in the Wasteland.

The album was recorded in two days and was produced by Loveless and engineer Joe Viers at Sonic Lounge in Columbus, Ohio. == Songwriting == Loveless scrapped an entire records' worth of songs before beginning this record. The title track, \\"Somewhere Else,\\" was written while at SXSW. \\"Really Wanna See You\\" was written at Loveless' husband's grandmother's house.

He first attended the City College of New York for two years, where he excelled in mathematics. Two years later he transferred to McGill University in Canada, there completing his B.Sc. in biochemistry in 1951 and then his M.D. in 1955. At McGill, outside of his academic work Kopin was a member of the swim team, as a member of which he became famous for a 16-meet winning streak in the 1949‚Äì1950 season which was only brought to an end by Olympian Joe Verdeur of La Salle University. It was also during his McGill years that Kopin met his wife Rita in an organic chemistry class they took together; they married on June 8, 1952. Rita went on to a career as a museum education consultant. ==Career== After his medical school graduation, Kopin did his residency at Boston City Hospital. When he was informed in his second year there that he was to be drafted, he found a government post with the United States Public Health Service, where he worked as a statistician on a tuberculosis research team, before transferring to the National Institute of Mental Health, where he worked under Seymour Kety. At the NIMH, Kopin began his research collaboration with Julius Axelrod. In 1968, Kety left NIMH for Harvard; Axelrod did not want to take on administrative responsibilities, and so Kopin took over the position of lab chief. Among his research assistants were William E. Bunney and Frederick K. Goodwin. In 1984, Kopin moved from the NIMH to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) to become scientific director of the Division of Intramural Research at the invitation of Murray Goldstein. He retired in 1994, naming Zach Hall as his successor. ==Research== By 2000, Kopin had published 710 papers, continuing his work with members of his former laboratory even after his formal retirement. At NIMH, he came up with the false neurotransmitter theory to explain the action of drugs such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and studied the relationship between the neurotoxin MPTP and Parkinson's disease.

Coined in 2008, the term was originally applied to a minority of feminists espousing sentiments that other feminists consider transphobic, such as the rejection of the assertion that trans women are women, the exclusion of trans women from women's spaces, and opposition to transgender rights legislation. The meaning has since expanded to refer more broadly to people with trans-exclusionary views who may have no involvement with radical feminism. Those referred to with the word TERF typically reject the term or consider it a slur; some identify themselves as gender critical. Critics of the word TERF say that it has been used in insults and alongside violent rhetoric. In academic discourse, there is no consensus on whether TERF constitutes a slur. ==Coinage and usage== Trans-inclusive cisgender radical feminist blogger Viv Smythe has been credited with popularizing the term in 2008 as an online shorthand. It was used to describe a minority of feminists who espouse sentiments that other feminists consider transphobic, including the rejection of the view, predominant in feminist organizations, that trans women are women, opposition to transgender rights, and the exclusion of trans women in women's spaces and organizations. On her transgender rights website, The TransAdvocate, Cristan Williams defined the term as referencing \\"a brand of 'radical feminism' that is so rooted in sex essentialism and its resulting biologism, it actively campaigns against the existence, equality, and/or inclusion of trans people.\\" Smythe has been credited with having coined the term TERF, due to a blog post she wrote reacting to the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival's policy of denying admittance to trans women. She wrote that she rejected the alignment of all radical feminists with \\"trans-exclusionary radfem (TERF) activists\\". In a 2014 interview with The TransAdvocate, Smythe said: While Smythe initially used TERF to refer to a particular type of feminist whom she characterized as \\"unwilling to recognise trans women as sisters\\", she has noted that the term has taken on additional connotations, and that it has been \\"weaponised at times\\" by both inclusionary and exclusionary groups. Though contested, the term has since become an established part of contemporary feminist speech. * Also published in Writing in The New York Times in 2019, feminist theorist Sophie Lewis noted that the term TERF had become \\"a catchall for all anti-transgender feminists, regardless of whether they are radical\\". Edie Miller, writing in The Outline, said that the term was applied to \\"most people espousing trans-exclusionary politics that follow a particular 'TERF logic', regardless of their involvement with radical feminism\\". The term TERFy has also been used to describe things \\"that queer millennials deem uncool\\" such as bangs. ==Opposition to the word== Feminists described as TERFs generally object to the term and sometimes refer to themselves as gender critical. British columnist Sarah Ditum wrote in 2017 that \\"the bar to being called a 'terf' is remarkably low.\\" Some self-described gender critical feminists say they cannot accurately be described as trans-exclusionary because they say they are inclusive of trans men. Some critics have called this reasoning \\"divisive and contradictory\\" and say that it represents \\"transmisogynist ideology\\". In a 2015 article, American feminist scholar Bonnie J. Morris argued that TERF was initially a legitimate analytical term but quickly developed into a defamatory word associated with sexist insults. She described the word as \\"emblematic of the unresolved tensions between our LGBT community's L and T factions\\" and called on scholars and journalists to stop using it. p. 13, p. 14, p. 15 British journalist Catherine Bennett has described the word as \\"a bullying tool\\" which has \\"already succeeded in repressing speech ‚Äì and maybe even research\\". Feminist author Claire Heuchan argues that the word is often used alongside \\"violent rhetoric\\". Heuchan adds that language of this type is used to \\"dehumanise women\\", often lesbians. Sociologist David Pilgrim writes that phrases like \\"Kill a TERF!\\" or \\"Punch a TERF!\\" are also posted by trolls online and there have been other depictions of violence aimed at women labeled as TERFs. The 2018 All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hate Crime received several submissions that indicated a high degree of tension between trans activists and feminist groups opposed to transgender rights legislation, with both sides detailing incidents of extreme or abusive language. The report noted that some women had submitted reports which argued that \\"women who object to the inclusion of trans women as female are being attacked both online and, in the street, with the term 'trans-exclusionary radical feminist' or (TERF) being used as a term of abuse.\\" ==Slur debate== The people at whom the word TERF is directed often characterize it as a slur or hate speech. In a July 2018 solicitation of essays regarding \\"transgender identities\\", British magazine The Economist required writers to \\"avoid all slurs, including TERF\\", stating that the word is used to try to silence opinions and sometimes incite violence. Transgender rights activist and philosophy of language professor Rachel McKinnon has maintained the word is not a slur. She argues that merely being \\"a term used to denigrate women\\" does not make a word a slur, that being \\"an absurd, nonsensical view of the nature of slurs\\". In August 2018, seven British philosophers wrote on the website Daily Nous that two articles by Rachel McKinnon and Jason Stanley published in the journal Philosophy and Phenomenological Research normalized the term. They described the term as \\"at worst a slur and at best derogatory\\", and argued that the term had been used to denigrate those \\"who disagree with the dominant narrative on trans issues\\". In response, Ernest Sosa, the journal's editor in chief, stated that scholars consulted by the journal advised that the term \\"might evolve to become a slur\\", but that its use as a denigrating term in some contexts was still \\"compatible with its having a descriptive meaning\\". In a 2020 paper published in the philosophy journal Grazer Philosophische Studien, linguists Christopher Davis and Elin McCready argue that three properties make a term a slur: it must be derogatory towards a particular group, it must be used to subordinate them within some structure of power relations, and the derogated group must be defined by an intrinsic property. Davis and McCready write that the term TERF satisfies the first condition, fails the third condition, and that the second condition is contentious, in that it depends on how each group sees itself in relation to the other group. Author Andrea Long Chu describes the claim that TERF is a slur as \\"a grievance that would be beneath contempt if it weren't also true, in the sense that all bywords for bigots are intended to be defamatory.\\" Feminist philosopher Talia Mae Bettcher argues that, regardless of whether the term is accurately classified as a slur, it \\"has at least become offensive to those designated by the term\\", which suggests it might be best to avoid \\"in case one wants to have a conversation across deep difference\\". ==See also== * Feminist theory * Feminist views on transgender topics ==References External links == * Category:Acronyms Category:Discrimination against LGBT people Category:English words Category:Feminism and transgender Category:Feminist movements and ideologies Category:Feminist terminology Category:LGBT slang Category:LGBT-related controversies Category:Radical feminism Category:Slang terms for women Category:Women-related neologisms Category:Words coined in the 2000s ","title":"TERF"},{"id":"41986676","text":"Chisocheton medusae is a tree in the family Meliaceae.

Earlier in his career, he was known for being able to take many punches without falling; despite having four defeats by knockout, these came either after taking punishment for long periods against some of the hardest hitting boxers in history, or late in his career, when his ability had waned several levels. His boxing nickname is \\"Puppy\\". ==Beginning of professional boxing career== Hernandez made his professional boxing debut on June 22, 1969, when he defeated Willie Pastrana (not to be confused with Willie Pastrano, the former light heavyweight champion) by a four-round decision at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. In his second fight, Hernandez lost for the first time, to another local prospect, Santos Luis Rivera, by a four-round decision. He avenged that loss in his very next bout, beating Rivera by a six-round decision in San Juan. After defeating Jose Rosado, he and Rivera had a rubber match, and this time Rivera won, again, on points over six rounds. After a four-round draw (tie) against Tomas Rivera in Ponce, Hernandez reeled off a streak of eleven wins in a row, three by knockout. These included a victory over veteran Jose Luis Cetina (59-18-2 coming into their fight) in what was Hernandez's first fight abroad, held at the International Amphitheater, in Chicago, Illinois, United States, when he beat Cetina with a sixth-round knockout. The streak came to an end when he traveled to Panama to fight world-ranked Gilberto Illueca, and dropped a ten-round unanimous decision. ==Fight with Wilfredo Gomez== Hernandez then started another streak of wins, this time reaching eight consecutive victories before facing another up-and-coming Puerto Rican bantamweight, Wilfredo Gomez. The pair met on Saturday, December 20, 1975, at Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan as part of a boxing program that included fights of Julian Sol√≠s, Larry Holmes and Roberto Dur√°n defending his world Lightweight title in the main event against the Mexican Leoncio Ortiz. Despite the fact that Gomez had fought only 22 rounds in his first eight bouts (he was 7-0-1 with 7 knockout wins) for an average of slightly less than 3 rounds per fight, Hernandez put up serious resistance and went into round eight before Gomez could knock him out. ==Challenge of Carlos Zarate== After the defeat to Gomez, Hernandez won four bouts in a row, including a win over future title challenger Cleo Garcia of Nicaragua. This allowed him to challenge the WBC world champion, Mexican Carlos Zarate. Zarate was another heavy puncher who came into the championship fight, held at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan on April 22, 1978, with a record of 49 wins and no losses, with 48 of those wins by knockout. The bout's referee was Richard Steele. Hernandez gave the champion a serious test, lasting until round 13 when he lost by technical knockout. ==National championship and career decline== Hernandez rebounded by outpointing future world title challenger Enrique Sanchez over ten rounds in Sanchez's home country, the Dominican Republic, but he followed that by losing by six round disqualification to Jose Jimenez, also at the Dominican Republic. He then fought Edwin Rivera (not to be confused with Edwin Luis Rivera. another local featherweight prospect of the time) for the vacant Puerto Rican bantamweight title on September 9, 1979, winning the title by a sixth-round knockout. This was, however, considered a mismatch by island boxing experts since Rivera was only 1-0 coming into that fight, compared to Hernandez's record of 29 wins, 6 losses and 1 draw (Rivera eventually retired with a record of 2 wins, 2 defeats and 1 draw). On March 29, 1980, Hernandez challenged the future world Bantamweight champion Jeff Chandler for Chandler's NABF and USBA bantamweight titles at Resorts International hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey Despite going the distance with Chandler, Hernandez lost a 12-round points decision in his last fight of major significance. He then went to South Africa to fight Bashew Sibaca at East London, Eastern Cape, but he would lose that bout by ten-round decision, before returning to the Dominican Republic to fight Sanchez in a rematch, this time being knocked out in three rounds. Hernandez kept fighting, having bouts in Yauco, Puerto Rico and in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, Miami, Florida, Reno, Nevada, and Sacramento, California, where he suffered a first-round knockout at the hands of Henry Rodriguez, on December 18, 1985, after which he retired. He never again sought to fight on as a professional boxer, being able to stay in retirement. Three of Hernandez's conquerors, Chandler, Gomez and Zarate, are members of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Apart from those three world champions, Hernandez also faced 5 other boxers who participated in world title fights, these being Illueca, Garcia, Sanchez, Sibaca and Fred Jackson. Hernandez had a record of 31 wins, 13 losses and 3 draws, 12 wins by way of knockout. ==See also== *Juan Carazo, another Puerto Rican who was close to winning a world boxing title *Josue Marquez, another Puerto Rican world boxing title challenger of the same era *List of Puerto Ricans ==External links== * -Hernandez's record Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Bantamweight boxers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Puerto Rican male boxers ","title":"Andres Hern√°ndez"},{"id":"41986745","text":"\\"Reflections\\" is a song by Australian hip hop trio Bliss n Eso.

It is considered an important virtue in Indian philosophy.Mohapatra (1993), Hinduism: Analytical Study, South Asian Books, , page 40 ==Etymology== Akrodha is a fusion word a (‡§Ö, without, non) and krodha (‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß, anger),krodha Sanskrit- English Dictionary, Koeln, Germany or 'without anger'. A related word is Akrodhah (Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß:), which also means 'absence of anger'. ==Discussion== Akrodha is considered a virtue and desirable ethical value in Hinduism. When there is cause of getting angry but even then there is absence of anger, it is non-anger or akrodha. Absence of anger (akrodha) means being calm even when insulted, rebuked or despite great provocation. Akrodha does not mean absence of causes of anger, it means not getting angry and keeping an even, calm temper despite the circumstances. Krodha ('anger') is excessive mental turmoil on account of the obstacles in the gratification of some desire; it is manifestation of the quality of tamas (dark, negative, destructive), an undesirable psychological state. The opposite of Krodha is Akrodha, and this is a productive, positive and constructive state. Bhawuk states that akrodha is necessary to any process of peace. Peace and happiness is a state of contentment (santustah), where there is absence of spite or envy (advestah), absence of anger (akrodhah), and absence of violence (ahimsa).DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology, Springer, , page 138 Dharma relies on Akrodha, because it creates an environment of serenity, a rational principle of life, and because it is a moral virtue inspired by love. ==Literature== According to Vedic sages, when work becomes akin to a yajna (a worship ceremony), the effect of that work is transformed into apurva, that is, it becomes something unique, unprecedented and empowering. In contrast, anger clouds reason, which results in the loss of discrimination between right and wrong and virtue and vice. When the discriminating faculty is ruined, the person loses self-identity and the inner good perishes. With freedom from anger, a person reaches an apurva state. ===The Upanishads=== Narada Parivrajaka Upanishad states the nature of akrodha for a person who seeks self-knowledge and liberation (kaivalya) as follows, Akrodha, states Manickam,L. Sam S. Manickam, Sahya: The Concept in Indian Philosophical Psychology and Its Contemporary Relevance, in Yoga and Indian Approaches to Psychology, (Editors: Joshi, Cornelissen et al.) Centre for the Study of Civilizations, pages 426‚Äì435, is related to the concept Sahya (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø) in the Upanishads. Sahya means, depending on the context, to bear, endure, suffer, and put up with. The quality to Sahya is considered an ethical value in Hinduism, not out of weakness to react, but for the cause of the ultimate \\"Truth\\". It is the attribute by which a person willingly bears negative cognitive inputs in order to \\"win over\\" the opponent or whatever is offensive, in the pursuit of holding on to Truth, in order to achieve oneness with Brahman, the ultimate Truth. This endurance, this strive to overcome the adversaries, through akrodha and ahimsa, is recommended as the constructive way in one's pursuit of \\"Truth\\". ===The Epics=== The Hindu epic Mahabharata repeatedly emphasizes the virtue of akrodha. For example, in Adi Parva, it states In Vana Parva, the Mahabharata states In Shanti Parva, the Mahabharata states The Bhagavad Gita (Slokas XVI.1‚Äì3), in the Mahabharata, gives a list of twenty-six divine attributes beginning with abhayam ('fearlessness') and sattva sansuddhih ('purity of mind'), ending with adroha ('bearing enmity to none') and naatimaanita ('absence of arrogance'):‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§ø‡§®‡•ç Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany :‡§Ö‡§≠‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∂‡•Å‡§ß‡•ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡§ø‡§É :‡§¶‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§Æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§™ ‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§µ‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§Ö‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ó‡§É ‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡§™‡•à‡§∂‡•Å‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§¶‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡•ç‡§µ‡§≤‡•ã‡§≤‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§∞‡§ö‡§æ‡§™‡§≤‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§§‡•á‡§ú‡§É ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§ß‡•É‡§§‡§ø‡§É ‡§∂‡•å‡§ö‡§Æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§π‡•ã ‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡§æ  :‡§≠‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•à‡§µ‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§  Akrodha is one of the twenty six divine attributes a person can have, states Bhagavad Gita. ===Dharmasastra=== Manu has listed Akrodha ('absence of anger') among the ten primary virtues. The Apastambhadharmasutra (I.iii.22) rules that a student be not given to anger, and that a house-holder is required to abstain from anger and abstain from action or words that would provoke someone else to anger (II.xviii.2). The Baudhayanadharmasutra (I.xv.30) requires a house-holder never to be angry, and the Gautamdharmasutra (II.13) advises that he must not feel angry. The Vashisthadharmasutra (IV.4) avers that refraining from anger is a virtue like truthfulness, charity among others. Manu mentions ten Dharma Lakshanas, akrodha is one of these lakshana (attribute, sign of a dharmic person). The other nine are: Dhriti (patience), Kshama (forgiveness), Damah (temperance), Asteya (non-stealing), Shaucham (purity), Indriyaigraha (freedom from sensual craving), Dhi (reason), Vidya (knowledge), and Satyam (truth).Karanam Nagaraja Rao and Krishna Kishore, Electronic Journal of Business Ethics and Organization Studies, Vol. 19, No. 2 (2014), pages 4‚Äì8 ===Shaivism=== The Shaivite doctrine considers four yamas for the Pashupata ascetic who smears on his body bhasam; the four yamas are ‚Äì non-injury, celibacy, truthfulness and non-stealing; the niyamas consist of non-irritability (akrodha), attendance on the teachers, purity, lightness of diet and carefulness (apramada). Akrodha is a virtue. ==Universalism== Hinduism and Buddhism both suggest ten freedoms needed for good life. These are ‚Äì Ahimsa ('freedom from violence'), Asteya ('freedom from want, stealing'), Aparigraha ('freedom from exploitation'), Amritava ('freedom from early death') and Arogya ('freedom from disease'), Akrodha ('freedom of anger'), Jnana or Vidya (\\"freedom from ignorance\\"), Pravrtti (\\"freedom of conscience\\"), Abhaya ('freedom from fear') and Dhrti ('freedom from frustration and despair'). ==See also== *Ahi·πÉsƒÅ *Satya *Asteya *Brahmacharya *K·π£amƒÅ *Dh·πõti *DayƒÅ *Mitahara *ƒÄrjava *Shaucha *DƒÅna ==References== Category:Upanishads Category:Vedas Category:Hindu philosophical concepts Category:Buddhist philosophical concepts Category:Religious ethics Category:Hindu ethics Category:Yoga concepts ","title":"Akrodha"},{"id":"41986765","text":"Yang Fang (17701846) was a Han Chinese general and diplomat during the Qing dynasty (16441911). Born in Songtao, Guizhou Province (modern day Songtao Miao Autonomous County), he joined the military as a young man and became a secretary, where he came to the attention of General Yang Yuchun (/ 17601837), who recommended him for military school. == Career == After completing his military training, Yang was involved in the suppression of the White Lotus Rebellion (17941804). In 1826, the sixth year of the reign of the Daoguang Emperor, Yang joined an army that marched north to Xinjiang to suppress a rebellion led by Altishahri warlord Jahangir Khoja. For his outstanding service during the mission he was rewarded with the title of Grand Tutor to the Heir Apparent (T√†iz«ê T√†if√π, ). Promotions piled up and by 1839 Yang had held titles including Military Commander of Guangdong and Guangxi as well as Governor-general of Gansu, Zhili, Hunan and Sichuan. When the First Opium War broke out (from the Chinese perspective) in June 1840, Qing Special Commissioners Lin Zexu and Deng Tingzhen were resolute in their opposition to the British but their successor Qishan instead sought compromise. In January the following year, Daoguang declared war on Great Britain. He appointed \\"Qishan Pacifier of the Rebellious\\" (J√¨ngn√¨, ) and made Yang Fang and Long Wen () ministerial attaches (CƒÅnz√†n D√†ch√©n, ÂèÉË¥äÂ§ßËá£). Yang Fang disagreed with the terms of the Convention of Chuenpi signed by Qishan and British Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot in January 1841 and on March5, he arrived in Canton with a thousand troops from Hunan Province. Aged 71 and so deaf that communication with him had to be in writing, Fang led Chinese troops in an attack at the Second Battle of Canton, which ended when further negotiations between the two sides temporarily terminated hostilities. Yang Fang was subsequently reprimanded by the emperor for agreeing to a truce instead of resisting. A disappointed Yang Fang remained in Canton until a fall from his horse forced him to return to Hunan to recuperate. In 1843 he received his retirement orders from Daoguang. His career had spanned over 50 years and aside from his military exploits he had remained an indefatigable writer, poet and calligrapher. == References == ;Bibliography * * Category:Qing dynasty generals Category:Qing dynasty diplomats Category:1846 deaths Category:1770 births Category:People from Tongren Category:Generals from Guizhou ","title":"Yang Fang (general)"},{"id":"41986769","text":"The Boys' Doubles tournament of the 2014 Asian Junior Badminton Championships was held from February 19‚Äì23 in Taipei, Taiwan.

Kim has been a fellow of the AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) since 2010 and the Institute of Physics since 2004. ==Background== Kim completed his bachelor's degree in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Seoul National University in 1973. After graduation, he started his mandatory military service as a Republic of Korea Air Force officer specializing in aircraft maintenance. In 1974, he moved from that position to a military research organization, the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), and worked as an experimental aerodynamicist in the trisonic wind tunnel test facility at ADD. He continued working in ADD after his retirement from the Air Force until 1979. He was promoted to senior researcher with the development of the six component sting balance for the trisonic wind tunnel. In 1979, he went to the University of Texas for graduate school. He finished M.S. (1981) and Ph.D. (1985) degrees on the finite element analysis of solids and structures, and Professor J. T. Oden was his supervisor. After seven months of post-doctoral work under Professor Oden, he came back to be an assistant professor at his alma mater, Seoul National University. ==Academic career== In the department of Aerospace Engineering of Seoul National University, from 1986 to 2011 Kim taught the mechanics of aircraft structures, nonlinear continuum mechanics and other subjects while doing research on the finite element methods, numerical analyses of composite structures, dynamics of helicopter rotor blades, optimal design of satellite structures, smart structures, and other fields. Kim also worked as the Departmental Chair of Aerospace Engineering and as Director of Engineering Computation Center for four years. He was the director of Institute of Advanced Aerospace Technologies in Seoul National University after making major contributions to create the institute. He has been on the editorial boards of three international journals, Smart Materials and Structures by IOP Publishing, Computer Modeling in Engineering and Sciences, and Smart Structures and Systems. He has also served as the executive editor for the Journal of Korean Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences (KSAS) for eight years. He had been serving as the president of the Korean Society of Composite Materials, Korea Unmanned Vehicle Systems Association, the Korean Society of Industrial, Applied Mathematics, and the KSAS. Kim has served on many South Korean national committees for national research and development programs, especially in aerospace area for last twenty years. He had been a member of evaluation committees for the development of Scientific Satellites, multipurpose LEO satellites, and rocket launch vehicles of the Ministry of Science and Technology as well as midsize passenger airplanes, high-altitude airships, Smart UAV, the Korean Helicopter Program, and small size airplanes. Kim has published more than 240 papers in international journals and conferences and 320 papers in South Korean journals and conferences. Kim has also applied for 5 patents including a patent related to vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Kim was chosen as the Distinguished Professor by the College of Engineering of Seoul National University in 2007 and the inaugural Seoul National University Academic Research Award as the only engineering college in 2008. He also received one of the best teaching awards in 2008. ===Diamond/IPSAP=== Kim developed the general purpose parallel finite element code, IPSAP (Internet Parallel Structural Analysis Program) in the mid-1990s, which can be run efficiently not only on an ordinary SMP supercomputer but also in the distributed computing environment like clusters and PCs connected through the Internet. Due to these research achievements, his research team was designated as the National Research Laboratory (NRL) by the South Korean government. This designation awarded to him a five-year (1999~2004) commitment of about one million dollars for research on aerospace structures and materials. He carried out three more years (2006~2009) of NRL research after receiving one of the best evaluations on the achievement of his first five years of NRL research. Since 2006, Kim has been distributing the developed code, IPSAP, to structural engineers around the world free of charge through the website, https://web.archive.org/web/20081216044155/http://teragate.snu.ac.kr/. He also developed a GUI (Graphic User Interface), DIAMOND, as Pre-Post Processor for the IPSAP. It is also being distributed as free software. These activities attracted Microsoft and he was able to have a 3-year research contract with Microsoft under the title of \\"Development of High Performance/Friendlier FE Software IPSAP for Windows Cluster OS.\\" Related to this work, he also received \\"Leadership Award for Technical Computing\\" from Microsoft in March 2007. ===Cluster Super-Computer, PEGASUS=== Kim led the Seoul National University's conclusion of an MOU on developing a high performance super-computer with Microsoft, Intel and Samsung Electronics in 2002. Based on this MOU, a 1 Tera flop super-computer, PEGASUS was developed in November 2002. PEGASUS is composed of 520 CPUs and 260 calculation nodes. It was 56th highest performance super-computer in the world at that time. ===Cyclocopter=== Since 2000 Kim has been doing research on the cyclocopter with 4 rotors. In 2012 he held an outdoor flight demonstration of the cyclocopter for the first time in the world. The cyclocopter is a new VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) air vehicle that employs a unique propulsion system of cycloidal blades to generate the propulsion and lift for a VTOL maneuver. The rotor system consists of several blades rotating about a horizontal axis that is perpendicular to the direction of normal flight. The cycloidal propeller offers powerful thrust levels, and a unique ability to change the direction of the thrust almost instantly. ==KARI President== Since his inauguration in 2011 as KARI President, Kim has led the successes of the national aerospace R&D; programs such as Naro, KOMPSAT-3 & 5, STSAT-3 and Smart UAV with leadership and scientific and technological competence. Kim also constructed the foundation of aerospace technology growth and contributed to the enhancement of national science and technology development. ===KOMPSAT-3=== Kim was the leader of the planning research on the KOMPSAT-3. Kim led the final development, launch, and early operation of the KOMPSAT-3 which was launched on May 18, 2012. The KOMPSAT-3 is a high resolution earth observation satellite equipped with a 0.7m resolution optical camera in order to fulfill the national demand for sub-metric resolution satellite imagery. KOMPSAT-3 was developed independently from design to final assembly. With KOMPSAT-3, South Korea became the fourth country to have a sub-metric resolution satellite. ===Smart UAV=== Kim participated in setting up the organization of the smart UAV development program which was started in July 2002 as one of the Frontier R&D; Programs supported by the South Korean government. After his inauguration, Kim led the completion of transition flight and test flew the smart UAV. Thus, South Korea became the second country which indigenously developed the core technologies for tilt-rotor aircraft. With the Smart UAV program KARI acquired original technologies of future PAV (Personal Aerial Vehicle) and is now working with industries to put the tilt-rotor UAV system to practical uses and to generate subsequent programs for production. ===Korea Space Launch Vehicle, Naro=== KARI has been developing South Korea's first space launch vehicle KSLV-I or NARO, since 2002 to deliver a 100 kg-class satellite into a Low Earth Orbit. Kim was a member of the advisory committee of Naro development and a member of the accident investigation board after the failure of the 1st Naro launch. After his inauguration, Kim played a leading role in investigating the causes of launch delays and solved related problems. Eventually, Naro was successfully launched on Jan 30 2013. Now Kim is guiding the development of the KSLV-II which can put a 1.5 ton-class application satellite into a 600~800 km sun-synchronous orbit on the basis of the technical achievements and experiences of KSLV-I. Kim hopes that the KSLV program will be a cornerstone for South Korea‚Äôs entrance into the global launch service market. ===KOMPSAT-5=== Kim completed the launch (Aug 22, 2013) of the KOMPSAT-5 which is equipped with a SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) instrument. KOMPSAT-5 is being operated at a mean altitude of 550 km in a Dawn-Dusk orbit and will conduct all weather and all day observation of the earth during its five-year mission period. ===STSAT-3=== The STSAT-3 project was initiated in December 2006 and the flight model of the STSAT-3 was launched into a sun-synchronous orbit at a nominal altitude of 600 km on 21 November 2013. Kim led the final development of the STSAT-3 whose mass is about 170 kg. The STSAT-3 carried an infrared (IR) camera for space observation and an imaging spectrometer for earth observation. STSAT-3 will analyze near-infrared radiation from space, observe the atmosphere of the earth and detect forest fires during its 2-year mission lifetime. ===KSDS (KARI Satellite Design System)=== Kim has been leading the development of KSDS since August 2012 in order to increase the efficiency of satellite design and analysis along with reducing development cost and time. The KSDS is capable of performing solar cell degradation, AOCS (Attitude & Orbit Control Subsystem) disturbance, thermal, radiation, link budget, power budget, radiation dose, and contamination analysis. These solvers are all integrated into a framework providing user-friendly pre-post processing. The KSDS thermal analysis is based on the finite element method and has functions of importing and post- processing the structure model of NASTRAN and IPSAP. KSDS will be a useful tool in not only designing satellites, but also educating future space engineers in South Korea. ==Awards== * 2001 Gordon Bell Prize (SC2001, Denver, USA) * 2004 Fellow, Institute of Physics, UK * 2007 Leadership Award for Technical Computing, Microsoft * 2008 The Research Award of Seoul National University * 2010 Fellow, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics * 2013 Medal of Innovation in Science by the South Korean government * 2013 '21st Century Award of the Year' in Science & Technology ==External links== * Aerospace Structures Laboratory * Seoul National University homepage * Korea Aerospace Research Institute homepage * Eng.ksas.or.kr * Kscm.re.kr * Astl.snu.ac.kr * English.etnews.com Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Seoul National University alumni Category:South Korean engineers ","title":"Seung Jo Kim"},{"id":"41986839","text":"Jean-Louis Arcand (born 1964) is a Canadian economist.

Private companies also located landfills in black neighborhoods. Between the early 1920s and the late 1970s the five municipal sanitary landfills were in black neighborhoods. During the same period, six of the eight municipal solid waste incinerators resided in mostly black neighborhoods. From 1970 to 1978 three of the four private landfills established during that period were located in Houston black neighborhoods. Around that era African Americans made up around 25% of the city's population. Houston City Council, which decided where the landfills would be located, was entirely composed of white residents until 1972.Gaventa, John, Barbara E. Smith, and Alex W. Willingham.

As of 1987 most African Americans in Houston continued to live in inner-city black neighborhoods, even though they gained the legal right to move to any neighborhood. According to research at the University of Chicago, many African Americans choose to live in neighborhoods where they were raised.Greene, Andrea D. \\"Residents of black areas cite reasons for not moving out.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Sunday April 15, 2001. Retrieved on August 5, 2016. In 2004, some African- Americans who had lived in the suburbs had returned to the inner city area due to their previous ties to those communities. By 2005 the outflow from traditional black neighborhoods, such as the Third Ward, Sunnyside, Kashmere Gardens, and the Fifth Ward continued, with blacks moving to Alief, other parts of Southwest Houston, Fresno Missouri City, and northwestern suburbs. Around 2005, African Americans began to move to an area around Farm to Market Road 1960, in an unincorporated area in Harris County. In many traditional inner-city black neighborhoods, Mexican and Latino residents moved in. In addition to the New Great Migration, many African Americans in the US have moved to Houston for lower cost of living and more job opportunities. Houston gained approximately 233,000 African-Americans between 2000 and 2010. Having the largest black population west of the Mississippi River, Houston is known as a center of African-American political power, education, economic prosperity, and culture, often called an emerging black mecca. An additional 150,000 to 250,000 mostly black evacuees arrived in 2005 from the New Orleans metro after Hurricane Katrina, with many of them deciding to stay in Houston. ==Commerce== The African American community in Houston had a rich diverse economic history. Throughout the communities, many businesses flourished. The Wards, 3rd, 4th and 5th had many restaurants, theaters, clubs, boarding houses, carriage delivery services, millinery shops (hat shops), stationery shops, newspaper publishers, dry goods stores, banks-savings and loans, insurance companies, seamstresses and tailor shops just to name a few. There were two major office buildings that housed many African American businesses, the Pilgrims Building https://www.stoppingpoints.com/texas/sights.cgi?marker=Ancient+Order+of+Pilgrims&cnty;=harris) and the Odd Fellows Building (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eeh10). The agricultural history included a host of farmers and ranchers.(Red Book of Houston,https://woodsononline.wordpress.com/2019/02/25/the-red-book-of- houston/ ) As a matter of fact one of the largest ranches (still owned by the original family-The Taylor-Stevenson Ranch, 100 acres-http://www.airfields- freeman.com/TX/Airfields_TX_HoustonS.htm) was home to Sky Ranch the African American airport/air transport service, started by Tuskeegee Airmen in the mid 1900s. In the early 1900s the community celebrated DeRoLoc which helped to promote the economic development of the community. This week long event was celebrated by an Agricultural/Industrial Exhibition, Ball, and Carnival. Many of the businesses benefited by all the people that attended from the region. The first Official DeRoLoc Event in Emancipation Park (Oldest park in Texas- donated by Freed Slaves) hosted 4,000 people (Fall 1901-some people say it was 1909), the event stopped in 1929 and was recently revived by a local business (NuWaters Co-op) in Houston. In Acres homes, there was the first African American Bus Company that made many runs to/from downtown Houston, to Acres homes providing transportation to many African Americans. (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dgama - annexed 1960s). ==Cuisine== The Louisiana Creole people who settled Houston around the 1920s brought their cuisine with them. The Creole and Cajun cuisine style spread in Houston in the post-World War II era,Pruitt, p. 78. which led to various Creole food chains such as Frenchy's Chicken, Pappadeaux, and Popeyes.Pruitt, p. 78. Creole dishes include boudin, black rice and shrimp creole, crawfish, gumbo, and jambalaya. Bernadette Pruitt, author of The Other Great Migration: The Movement of Rural African Americans to Houston, 1900-1941, wrote that Creole cooking became \\"an important cultural bridge\\" in the city and in its African American community, and that, \\"As cooks, Creole housewives transformed Houston's typical southern cuisine.\\" ==Demographics== From the 1870s to the 1890s, African Americans made up almost 40% of Houston's population. Between 1910 and 1970 the African American population ranged from 21% to 32.7%. In 1870 36% of the African-Americans in Houston lived in the Fourth Ward, 29% lived in the Third Ward, 16% lived in the Fifth Ward, and 19% lived in other areas. In 1910 the plurality now lived in the Third Ward, with 32%; the Fourth Ward, Fifth Ward, and other areas had 27%, 21%, and 20% respectively. There were about 34,000 African-Americans in Houston in the 1920s, and in the 1930s there were about 63,000 African-Americans.Steptoe, Dixie West, p. 211. In 1920, 20% of the people classified as \\"black\\" were subclassified as \\"mulatto\\"; the census stopped taking statistics on \\"mulatto\\" people after 1920. In the racial segregation era people of Louisiana Creole origin with African heritage attended black institutions such as schools even though they often considered themselves racially distinct from non-Creole African Americans.Steptoe, Houston Bound, p. 73, 75. Creoles spoke Louisiana Creole French, making them linguistically distinct. Creoles also had different musical practices as they performed Southwest Louisiana-style \\"la-la\\". In the 1920s the \\"San Felipe districts\\" had the largest group of African-Americans, the Third and Fifth wards had other significant communities.Kaplan, Barry J.

In 1940 the African-American population numbered 86,302, 21.4% of the number of people in Houston. The same population increased to 125,400, 21% of the city population, in 1950. 87.9% of the population increase from 1940 to 1950 was due to African-Americans moving from other parts of the United States, mostly Louisiana and Texas; most of the migrating African-Americans from rural areas and small towns. 1960 the African-American population numbered 215,037, 25.7% of the city population. In the central city, from 1950 to 1960, the African-American population increased by 20,299. Their percentage of the total population increased during that period from 23.4% to 31.1% because large numbers of white people left the central city. In 1970 the African-American population numbered 316,922, 25.7% of the city population. By 1980, Houston had 440,257 African American residents, making it one of the largest black populations in the country. In 2004 55% of the African American population born in Harris County originated from the Houston area either by birth or through growing up there as children.

President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and published it on January 1, 1863, but it did not reach Texas until June 19, 1865.

In Houston, the effort was led by the Reverend Jack Yates, a Baptist minister and former slave. His church, Antioch Baptist, and Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church formed the Colored People's Festival and Emancipation Park Association. In 1872, they pooled $800 to put down on ten acres of open land as home for their Juneteenth celebration. In honor of their freedom, they named it Emancipation Park.. There are several events throughout Houston commemorating this occasion. The Friends of Emancipation Park (FEP), a non-profit group of volunteers, was founded in 2007 by Dorris Ellis and Lonal Robinson to preserve and protect the interest and legacy of Emancipation Park. The FEP picked up the parade and keeps it going along with other exemplary programs.

It did not have a fixed regularity regarding the publication, but in general one number was published every month. The main editor was Francesc Ra√ºll. It was printed in the printing house Jacint Verdaguer until 1836 and later on, in the printing house Ignasi Estivill. Each number had 30-40 pages and a measurement of 23 cm. ==Themes and collaborators== The magazine‚Äôs objective was to extend widely among rural people the ideas and the liberal institutions. Moreover, it wanted to spread some notions about Legislation, History, technical discoveries and Geography. Furthermore, it disseminated a certain utopian socialism influenced by Saint- Simon. Another theme was Literature and this magazine is one of the few samples from the liberal Catalan Romanticism. ‚ÄúEl Propagador de la libertad‚Äù defended the social function of literature and it fight against Classicism like a movement that had been overcome. It spread the works of Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo and Heine. The collaborators of the magazine were A. Fontcuberta, Pere Mata, F. Alt√©s i Gurena, A. Ribot, Gener i Solanes, Antoni Gironella, J. Eydoux and J. Strozzi. This staff changed as a consequence of the revolutionary successes from 1836 because a lot of the writers were arrested and exiled. As a result, A. Fontcuberta, who used the pseudonym of Josep Andreu Covert-Spring started directing the magazine. Some of the collaborators changed too and in this period we can find Pau Piferrer, Manuel Mil√† i Fontanals and Joaquim M. Bover. The objective of spreading the new ideas among the farmers was not achieved due to the high intellectual level of the magazine, which was a barrier for this social group. At the end, ‚ÄúEl Propagador de la libertad‚Äù was one of the most important literary, cultural and scientific magazines of its period due to its connections with the progressive current of thought. ==References * Digitalization available in the ARCA Portal (archive of antique Catalan magazines) Category:Magazines published in Catalonia Category:Spanish-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1835 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1838 Category:Magazines published in Barcelona Category:Defunct magazines published in Spain Category:Defunct political magazines Category:Political magazines published in Spain Category:Monthly magazines published in Spain Category:Irregularly published magazines ","title":"El Propagador de la libertad"},{"id":"41987101","text":"Jankuhn is a German surname and may refer to: * Herbert Jankuhn (1905‚Äì1990) German archaeologist * Klaus Jankuhn (born 1965), German record producer and musician * Walter Jankuhn (1888‚Äì1953), German tenor singer and actor, performed e.g. in Lotte ","title":"Jankuhn"},{"id":"41987114","text":"Kurt Lesher Noll, also known as K.

After tending to sheep and cattle up to age twelve, he learned the craft of stone masonry, carving, stuccowork and sculpting at a chiseler in Leutkirch im Allg√§u. On his journeyman years he came to Stuttgart, where he visited the fine arts school. From November 1872 he continued his artistic education at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich under Max von Widnmann and Joseph Knabl. Pirithous' fight for Helena. Woodcut by Richard Brend‚Äôamour after the sculpture by Joseph Echteler. In Munich he first became known as a portrait artist who created medaillons, reliefs and busts of famous stage artists, singers, artists, scholars, councillors, church dignitaries, diplomats, and royalty, after photographs. His work impressed by their great lifelikeness and careful execution. Soon he also executed tomb sculptures, religious and mythological sculptures, animals and group works. In May 1884 Echteler left his Munich studio and moved together with his family to the U.S. where he worked primarily as a portrait artist. After President Grant died in 1885, it was decided to erect a monument and mausoleum to his memory in New York City. Echteler worked out and submitted a design, which was among the finalists in February 1887.Scientific American Building Edition (1885‚Äì1901); 1 February 1887; 3, 2; American Periodicals pg. 31 He did not win the contest for the memorial however. In Autumn 1887 he returned to Munich. He created busts and badges of Europe's highest royalty and received numerous honors and awards. His total work comprises about 200 busts, among these Emperor Wilhelm, Franz Joseph, Alexander II and the kings of Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg. Echteler was awarded the honorary title professor by Heinrich XXII, Prince Reuss of Greiz for his artistic work. As the Kingdom of Bavaria would not at first permit him to use the title because of its origin, the artist's complaints nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between Bavaria and the Principality of Reuss-Greiz in 1899. The matter was resolved by Echteler changing his citizenship to that of the Principality, which made it legally possible for him to use the title professor.Der Deutsche Correspondent, 3 April 1899, page 3Wer ist's, 1905, page 298 Among Echteler's best known students is Emil von Schlitz. == Marriages and children == Echteler, a Catholic was married three times.

The federation after a humble start achieved a substantial number of members and kept on growing with an impressive membership of 123 affiliated styles. The federation in its initial years was headed by Don Cameron MP as President. The federation in its early years thrived under the able and strong leadership of Don, who initiated the first two National Teams and also paving a way for further development of the sport in Australia. Following in his footsteps, his successor John Newman further worked hard to uplift the Federation and further strengthened its foundation. The Federation gained further impetus from subsequent Presidents like John Halpin(1993 ‚Äì 2007), and Michael Kassis(2007). The federation grew on under them with more sophistication, professionalism and things like administrative coaching and refereeing were introduced. A member of the World Karate Federation (WKF), the Australian Karate Federation Inc. is affiliated with 170 countries all over the globe with access to both Junior/Cadet and Senior World Championships. Although relatively new, the federation also expects to be inducted into the Olympics. The federation also enjoys the Continental Union membership with ties with the Oceania Karate Federation, which currently has 10 countries as members. Regional development of the sports is the current goal of the Australian Karate Federation. ==Structure== The national body has eight state member associations. ==See alsoReferencesCategory:Sports governing bodies in Australia Category:Karate organizations Category:1970 establishments in Australia Category:Sports organizations established in 1970 Category:Karate in Australia ","title":"Australian Karate Federation"},{"id":"41987245","text":"Site 41 was a complex of three launch pads at the Baikonur Cosmodrome originally built for flight testing of Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) using storable propellant.

The massacre occurred after an official party, including Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse, along with police, was sent out by the Governor of South Australia, George Grey. ==Background== The Rufus River is a small tributary which runs into the Murray River near Lake Victoria, New South Wales, very close to both the current borders with Victoria to the south and South Australia to the west,\\"\\", Wentworth Shire Council, retrieved 26 September 2018. in the area known as the Central Murray region. The local Maraura people probably had their first encounter with Europeans when Charles Sturt travelled down the river in 1830. There is no record of other Europeans in the region until the overland stock route was opened between Sydney and Adelaide in 1838, and Joseph Hawdon and Charles Bonney made the first trip, taking 335 cattle to the Adelaide market. Edward Eyre and Sturt followed, and by April 1841 at least 36 parties had travelled the track, bringing with them about 480 people, 90,000 sheep and 15,000 cattle, as well as horses, bullocks, drays and goods into Aboriginal territories. The route followed much older Aboriginal pathways, and various skirmishes were reported as the new settlers travelled through the Central Murray region.Burke H., Roberts A., Morrison M., Sullivan V., The River Murray and Mallee Aboriginal Corporation (2016), \\"The space of conflict: Aboriginal/European interactions and frontier violence on the western Central Murray, South Australia, 1830‚Äì41\\", Aboriginal History, 40: 145-179. ==Conflicts== On 16 April 1841 a group of 11 overlanders, led by Henry Inman, with 5,000 sheep, was attacked on the banks of the river about east of Lake Bonney. Two of the party were killed and one injured. A group of volunteers, including a member of the original party, Henry Field, set out to recover the sheep on 7 May. They too were attacked. Governor Grey swore in a batch of special constables under the jurisdiction of Major Thomas O‚ÄôHalloran and the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse. A large party of men, including police under the command of James Rigby Beevor, left Adelaide on 31 May. They met up with another group of overlanders, led by Alfred Langhorne, on 22 June, who had been attacked two days earlier at the Rufus River. Four Europeans and five Aboriginal people had been killed, with two and about ten injured in each group respectively. ==Massacre== A memorial on the embankment at Lake Victoria. Another official party, including police, three Aboriginal people and Moorhouse, again left for the Murray in July 1841, meeting up in August with another group of overlanders, led by William Robinson, who had earlier been attacked. In that conflict, no Europeans had been hurt, but five Aboriginal men had been killed and 10 wounded. Coming across a large group of local men and women near Lake Victoria, Moorhouse and two others became involved in another clash, despite Moorhouse‚Äôs attempts to negotiate through interpreters. According to Moorhouse's report later sent to Grey, \\"nearly 30\\" Aboriginal people were killed, \\"about 10\\" wounded and four captured and four (one man, one boy, and two females) taken prisoner.Tolmer A. (1882), Reminiscences of an Adventurous and Chequered Career at Home and at the Antipodes‚ÄîVol. I, chap. 20 (London: Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, & Rivington). A large majority of the wounded would be expected to die from their wounds, because Aboriginal medicine was ill-equipped to deal with gunshot wounds.\\"The Rufus River Massacre\\", Sovereign Union of First Nations and Peoples in Australia. Only one European was wounded. A subsequent enquiry headed by Sturt questioned the participants, including the Aboriginal interpreter and one of the captives, but eventually declared that the actions of the European parties had been justifiable. It determined original cause of much of the trouble with the Robinson group was the Europeans engaging in sexual relations with the women without giving the food and clothing promised first. That initiated an escalating cycle of conflicts, which eventually included the Aboriginal groups stealing thousands of European sheep.Coulthard- Clark C. (2001), \\"Rufus River\\", Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles (Allen & Unwin).Foster R., Nettelbeck A. (2011), Out of the Silence, p. 32-39 (Wakefield Press). Moorhouse testified that about 150 Aborigines appeared to be readying to attack, and that the massacre was committed to pre-empt such an attack. Moorhouse's report was disputed by Robinson, who stated that \\"thirty to forty were killed, and as many wounded\\",\\"Fatal Affray With The Natives In South Australia: Report of Mr. Moorhouse to His Excellency the Governor\\", Port Phillip Patriot and Melbourne Advertiser, 14 October 1841, p. 2 - via Trove. and later by James Collins Hawker, who wrote in his book Early Experiences in South Australia (1899: p. 79): \\"The firing lasted about fifteen minutes, 30 natives were killed, 10 wounded and 4 taken prisoner ...

After seeing a free kick go against a teammate, Port Melbourne full forward John Peck approached and argued with umpire David Jackson. Jackson reported Peck for using abusive language and for disputing his decisions, and Peck repeatedly turned away from Jackson to prevent him from seeing his guernsey number to report him. Port Melbourne was already unhappy with the lopsided free kick count against it; and, after seeing this incident, Port Melbourne captain-coach Brian Buckley assembled his team to walk off the ground and forfeit the match in protest at Jackson's performance; much of the team had already reached the sidelines before Port Melbourne club officials ordered them to return to the ground. The rest of the game was played without incident, and Dandenong went on to win by 25 points. ===Awards=== *The leading goalkicker for the season was Johnny Walker (Preston), who kicked 80 goals during the home-and-home season. *The J. J. Liston Trophy was won by Jim Sullivan (Coburg), who polled 38 votes. Sullivan finished comfortably ahead of Paul Ladds (Sandringham), who finished second with 27 votes; Denis Dalton (Preston) and Rod Evans (Dandenong) were equal third with 22 votes. *Waverley won the seconds premiership. Waverley 13.19 (97) defeated Preston 11.4 (70) in the Grand Final, played as a stand- alone match on Saturday 23 September at Skinner Reserve before a crowd of 300. ==Division 2== The Division 2 home-and-home season was played over eighteen rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system. All finals were played on Sundays at Coburg Oval, after having been played at Toorak Park from 1961 until 1966; crowds at Coburg were much lower than they had been at Toorak Park, and finals returned to Toorak Park in 1968. ===Ladder=== {  style=\\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; width: 60%\\" - ! colspan=11 style=\\"background: #EBEBEB; font-size: 115%;\\"  1967 VFA Division 2 Ladder - style=\\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%;\\" ! !!

In the Grand Final on Saturday 9 September, Northcote 13.11 (89) drew Sunshine 13.11 (89); in the Grand Final Replay on Sunday 17 September, Northcote 13.12 (90) defeated Sunshine 10.8 (68). Both matches were stand-alone games played at Skinner Reserve. ==Notable eventsTransfer fees=== In early April, shortly before the start of the season, the Association Board on Management agreed by a 25‚Äì14 majority to impose a minimum transfer fee of $3,000 for any of its players. The fee was an attempt to stem the flow of young Association players to the Victorian Football League, and also to increase the financial reward to Association clubs for developing League-standard players if they did leave. There were several problems which made the Association's move impractical. Outside the Association and among many clubs who had voted against the motion, the $3,000 price tag was considered to be outrageously and unrealistically high, considering that most of the players involved were young players being rated solely on their potential. Additionally, while transfer fees were an established practice in British and American football, there was not yet a formal transfer fee system within Australian football. Finally, the Victorian Football League's player payment laws (the \\"Coulter Laws\\") specifically prohibited the \\"buying\\" of players from other clubs ‚Äì and therefore any club which paid a transfer fee to the Association would be in breach of League rules. Shortly after the fee was imposed, the dissenting Association clubs led a campaign to repeal it, fearing reprisal from the League. True to these fears, the League Board of Management voted in late April to end its 1949 reciprocity agreement with the Association, allowing Association players to transfer directly to the League without a clearance; players who did so were suspended from the Association for five years, but the suspension was not recognised in the League. There were few such transfers over the following years, in part because players were reluctant to risk a five-year ban from the Association if they were never able to forge a successful League career. The highest profile move before the 1967 season was that of young Prahran centreman Kevin Sheedy, who went to without a clearance and without Prahran receiving any of the $5,000 transfer fee which was set for him. On 5 May, the Association Board of Management agreed by an overwhelming majority to reduce the minimum transfer fee to $500 per player (with a maximum of $5,000), after an earlier motion to rescind the minimum transfer fee entirely failed to gain the two-thirds majority it required. Despite the change, its reciprocity agreement with the League was not reinstated. The transfer fee rule remained in place until April 1969. ===Other notable events=== *Starting from 1967, television channel ATV-0 (part of modern-day Network Ten) began to telecast Association games as part of its weekend sports coverage, in conjunction with its horse racing coverage. ATV-0 broadcast one live game on each Saturday and Sunday through the season, at a time when League games were generally televised only as partial replays. Over the following decade, the higher profile brought by television coverage resulted in a marked increase in the popularity of the Association, and attendances more than doubled between 1967 and 1975. *On 30 July, in a rematch of the previous two Grand Finals, Port Melbourne 16.14 (110) defeated Waverley 14.16 (100) at Central Reserve, after having trailed 8.6 (54) to 13.15 (93) by 39 points at three-quarter time. ==External links== *List of VFA/VFL Premiers ==References== Category:Victorian Football League seasons VFL ","title":"1967 VFA season"},{"id":"41987344","text":"Bolawatta is a populated place located in Sri Lanka.

It was one in which the settlers were routed by a group of local Aboriginal men under the warrior Multuggerah, a rare event both in its form, as pitched battles between the two groups, and in its outcome. ==Background== Settlers were trying to occupy land in and near the Lockyer Valley, Darling Downs and upper Brisbane areas, but met resistance from the local alliance of \\"mountain tribes\\" united under Jagera warrior, strategist and diplomat Multuggerah. Note: Dr Ray Kerkhove, owner of this site, is a reputable historian. See here and here. After the 1842 deliberate poisoning of 50 or 60 Aboriginal people on Killcoy Station, the resistance gathered momentum, and an uprising was planned. Multuggerah and his men began ambushing the mountain road that was the only route for bringing supplies from Brisbane to the Downs. The road had been built about two years earlier and was the only way of keeping both commerce and communication open between the Moreton Bay and Downs areas. ==The battlesAmbush=== In September 1843, a large group of squatters organised a \\"cavalcade\\" consisting of 18 armed men, three drays being pulled by about 50 bullocks. At a location known as One Tree Hill, (now known as Tabletop Mountain, Queensland), near Toowoomba, the group was ambushed by Multuggerah and about 100 men, having been forced to stop at barricades previously erected by the attackers. The squatters fled back to Bonifant's Inn, their starting point for that trip, about away. The warriors held a corroborree after sacking the drays, feasting on bullock meat. ===Retaliation attempt=== The squatters organised a revenge party, comprising all of the men at the Inn, including servants, numbering between 35 and 50 men. At nightfall on 12 September they arrived near what was left of the drays, and camped about from Mt Tabletop. They managed to surprise the group of Aboriginal people by arriving at their camp very early the next morning, and the two groups engaged in a full-on battle. Quite a number of Aboriginal people were wounded or killed, but the settlers were hindered by getting bogged in the mud, and one was wounded in the buttocks with a spear thrown by a woman. The majority of the remaining warriors staged a retreat up the steep slopes of the mountain, where they had stored heaps of boulders. They were then able to throw spears and stones and roll boulders down the slopes, wounding some of the squatters and shattering many of their muskets, until they were forced to retreat. The squatters awaited the border police of Dr Simpson, but when the six men found the road barricaded again, decided not to attempt an attack on the warriors. ===Aftermath=== Following this defeat, there was an unusually large-scale response to the Battle of One Tree Hill. A campaign began to remove Multuggerah‚Äôs warriors out of the area. Dr Simpson gathered forces from Brisbane and Ipswich until he had a total of 35‚Äì45 men. The 16 station owners and overseers sent out a call, gathering 40 to 60 men. Eventually, about 75 to 100 settlers, including most of Moreton Bay‚Äôs soldiers and police, chased the warriors from the pass. Many were killed in the Lockyer Valley area. Conflicts continued as the warriors camped in the Rosewood Scrub and Helidon Scrub areas and mounted raids on the settlers. In October 1843, using an Aboriginal tracker, the squatters found and stormed the camp, killing leaders (although apparently not Multuggerah) and many others. Attacks and raids in the area continued for another five years. ==Legacy and memorials== A monument recording the battle was established in 2005.Multuggerah at Monument Australia accessed 23 Feb 2014 An Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) was signed over the site, between Toowoomba City Council and a body representing the Jagera, Yuggera and Ugarapul people as the traditional owners of the area, in 2008. In 2010, the National Library of Australia acquired a sketch by local Thomas John Domville Taylor (the origin of the name Domville for the locality and mountain near Millmerran) for which is believed to be an eyewitness account of the aftermath of the battle. This made it one of fewer than ten visual eyewitness accounts of attacks by European settlers on Indigenous Australians. It depicts \\"11 squatters firing on a group of 25 Indigenous people of whom three appear to have been shot\\". ==References== Category:History of Indigenous Australians Category:Darling Downs Category:History of Queensland Category:1843 in Australia Category:Conflicts in 1843 Category:September 1843 events ","title":"Battle of One Tree Hill"},{"id":"41987352","text":" } Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) is a freight specific railway under construction in northern to eastern India by Indian Railways.

However, the final round at Montmel√≥ was replaced by another Imola round, and thus, all rounds were held in Italy. {  style=\\"font-size: 85%\\" !colspan=2 Round ! Circuit ! Date ! Pole Position !

It is a semideciduous tree with large white fragrant flowers. ==Hybrid origin== Magnolia √ó thompsoniana arose as a spontaneous seedling from a batch of seed taken and grown from an old tree of Magnolia virginiana in 1808 in the nursery of Archibald Thompson in Mile End in London. Nearby grew a specimen of M. tripetala. One seedling was more vigorous, with larger leaves and flowers. Thompson and later Sabine held it to be a form of the presumed parent plant and it was named M. virginiana var. major, however Jaume Saint- Hilaire ascertained its hybrid status in 1832, giving it its current name. It was the first magnolia hybrid bred, antedating the more famous Magnolia √ó soulangeana by twelve years. The sprawling growth of Magnolia √ó thompsoniana precludes its use in smaller gardens and has likely impacted on its use in Europe. It was an uncommon plant in American gardens due to its lack of hardiness in the North American climate. It was grown at historical Camden Park in the early 19th century. In the 1960s, Professor Joe McDaniel of the University of Illinois crossbred hardier forms of the parent species and then bred with existing original stock of Magnolia √ó thompsoniana to improve the hardiness. He registered the resulting clone \\"Urbana\\" in 1969. Magnolia √ó thompsoniana ‚ÄòCairn Croft‚Äô is a hybrid, the original plant of which was found on an estate in Westwood, Massachusetts. Its flowers are double or triple the size of M. virginiana. It has large glossy green elliptical leaves 16‚Äì21 cm (6‚Äì8 in) long by 5‚Äì8.5 cm (2‚Äì3.3 in) wide with wavy margins. It can reach 4.6 m high, and appears to set no seed. Magnolia √ó thompsoniana ‚ÄòOlmenhof‚Äô arose in a garden ‚ÄòOlmenhof‚Äô in Herk de Stad, Belgium. It has larger flowers and a longer flowering season than other forms of M. thompsoniana. The elliptical to obovate leaves are 20‚Äì25 cm (8‚Äì10 in) in length, by 8‚Äì11 cm (3.2‚Äì4.2 in) wide. == Gallery == File:Magnolia x thompsoniana flower 2.jpgMagnolia x thompsoniana ‚ÄòCairn Croft‚Äô, flower File:Magnolia x thompsoniana flower.jpgMagnolia x thompsoniana ‚ÄòCairn Croft‚Äô flower detail File:Magnolia x thompsoniana fruit.jpgMagnolia x thompsoniana ‚ÄòCairn Croft‚Äô, immature fruit ==References External Links == * Magnolia x thompsoniana images at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Plant Image Database thompsoniana Category:Hybrid plants Category:Ornamental trees ","title":"Magnolia √ó thompsoniana"},{"id":"41987438","text":"Aiday Isaeva (Kazakh: –ê–π–¥–∞–π –ò—Å–∞–µ–≤–∞, born 19 April 1989 in Almaty) is a Kazakh beauty pageant titleholder.

He received piano and violin instruction already as a child. In the final phase of World War II, Graf was drafted as a high school student to serve in an anti-aircraft defense unit where he served in Langenzersdorf as well as in the 6th district of Vienna (Esterh√°zypark). He passed his high school graduation exam in 1946 and began to study architecture at the Vienna University of Technology. As a trumpeter, he became a member of the ‚ÄûTechnische Tanz-Band‚Äú(Technical Dance Band, TTB), the dance orchestra of the University of Technology, as an extracurricular activity. In 1947 he passed the entrance exam in piano at what was known at the time as the Vienna Academy of Music and is known today as the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, where he became a student of Bruno Seidlhofer. Subsequently, Graf terminated his study of architecture in order to devote himself entirely to music. Aside from his studies with Seidlhofer he took counterpoint and composition classes with Alfred Uhl. 1949 he passed the First State Examination and became a finalist in the 1950 Geneva International Music Competition. Having also passed the Diploma Examination in piano in 1951, Graf gave his debut that same year as a soloist at Konzerthaus, Vienna. In the following year he performed several concerts: 1952 at the 4th Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in Brussels, 1953 at the very first International ARD Music Competition in Munich, 1954 he participated for the second time in the Geneva International Music Competition, where he was awarded second place, and again in Brussels at the 1956 Queen Elisabeth Music Competition, where was among the finalists along with Vladimir Ashkenazy, Lazar Berman, Andr√© Tchaikowsky, John Browning and Tam√°s Vasary. In the meantime Graf had married in 1953 the Brazilian pianist Carmen Vitis Adnet. 1955 he moved with her to Rio de Janeiro, where their daughters Maria Beatriz and Clarissa were born in 1955 and 1958. In 1957 he founded Semin√°rios de M√∫sica Pro-Arte do Rio de Janeiro along with Hans-Joachim Koellreutter and others. In 1958 he followed an invitation by Hans Sittner to return to Vienna, where he taught a piano class at the Academy of Music (now University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna) until his retirement in 1991. Starting in 1963 Graf frequently taught as an instructor at similar institutions in Europe (Seville, Bilbao, Porto), South America and Japan. He also acted as a juror for international piano competitions such as the Arthur Rubinstein International Master Piano Competition and also joined in the design of the Vienna Beethoven Competition initiated by Josef Dichler and Richard Hauser. Graf interrupted his teaching career in Vienna twice (1971/72 and 1974/75) to accept a visiting professorship at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University at Bloomington. After heart surgery in 1985 he was forced to limit his concert appearances. But in 1989 another recording was made that was later published as a CD. It contained an interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Art of Fugue‚Äù in Bruno Seidlhofer‚Äôs adaptation for four hands, performed with his daughter Clarissa Graf Costa.

The grave of Rev William Hanna, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh ==Life== Born in Belfast on 26 November 1808, he was the son of Rev Prof Samuel Hanna, a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Ireland. He studied at the University of Glasgow, going on to the University of Edinburgh where he studied under Thomas Chalmers. In 1834 Hanna was licensed to preach the Church of Scotland. He was ordained at East Kilbride, a parish near Glasgow, on 17 September 1835. In 1837 he was translated to the parish of Skirling in Peebles-shire, near Biggar. During the ten year controversy that preceded the Disruption of 1843, he took an active part on the side of Chalmers and his allies. He left the established Church of Scotland in 1843, joining the Free Church of Scotland, taking most of his congregation with him. Having resigned his charge at Skirling in 1838, Hanna removed permanently to Edinburgh, where in 1850 he was called to be assistant to Thomas Guthrie, as minister of St. John's Free Church on Johnstone Terrace near Edinburgh Castle. In 1852 he received an honorary doctorate of LL.D. from the University of Glasgow and in 1864 an honorary doctorate D.D. from the University of Edinburgh. In 1855 he was living at 4 Castle Terrace facing Edinburgh Castle.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1855 During his time in Edinburgh he founded the Mission Church at the Pleasance. In 1866 he retired from the active duties of the ministry, being replaced by Rev George Philip.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church He died in London, 24 May 1882. He is buried in the Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh in the plot of his father-in-law, Thomas Chalmers (against the north wall). ==Works== On the death of Thomas Chalmers in 1847, Hanna was asked to write his biography, and arranged a temporary exchange so he could reside for a time in Edinburgh. The Life of Chalmers came out in four volumes (1849‚Äì52), to which was added a fifth, containing extracts of Correspondence. Hanna also edited the Posthumous Works of Dr. Chalmers, in nine volumes. In 1847 he was appointed editor of the North British Review, but did not hold the post long. Hanna published (among other books): * Wycliffe and the Huguenots, 1860 (originally two series of lectures at the Philosophical Institution, Edinburgh). * Martyrs of the Scottish Reformation. * Last Day of our Lord's Passion, 1862 (this volume reached a circulation of fifty thousand). * The Forty Days after the Resurrection, 1863. * The Earlier Years of our Lord, 1864. * The Passion Week, 1866. * Our Lord's Ministry in Galilee, 1868. * The Close of our Lord's Ministry, 1869. * The Resurrection of the Dead, 1872. Hanna edited in 1858 a volume of Essays by Ministers of the Free Church of Scotland, Charles Hodge's Idea of the Church in 1860, and in 1877 the Letters of Thomas Erskine of Linlathen. He circulated privately a memoir of Alexander Keith Johnston. Hanna was also a contributor to the Sunday Magazine, Good Words, The Quiver, and other periodicals. ==Family== While at East Kirkbride, Hanna married Anne Simson Chalmers (1813-1891), eldest daughter of Thomas Chalmers. They had a daughter, Matilda Grace Hanna (d.1930), who married Alexander Watt Blackie. Their son Thomas Chalmers Hanna (1837-1910) was a chartered accountant. ==Notes== ;Attribution * ==References== * Category:1808 births Category:1882 deaths Category:Ministers of the Church of Scotland Category:Ministers of the Free Church of Scotland Category:Scottish Christian theologians Category:Scottish biographers Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh ","title":"William Hanna (minister)"},{"id":"41987736","text":"Badminton at the 2015 European Games in Baku took place from 22 to 28 June 2015 at Baku Sports Hall. The competition was held over a seven-day period and include five medal events in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs singles, men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs doubles and mixed doubles. Approximately 160 athletes competed. ==Qualification== 32 quota places are available for each singles event, and 16 places (involving 32 players) are available for each pairs event. The Badminton World Federation (BWF) ranking list of 26 March 2015 will be used for deciding eligibility for the event. There will be no separate qualification event. The BWF ranking list on that date will be used to form a European ranking list by removing all players who are not qualified to represent any European NOC and this European ranking list will then be used to allocate places. Singles players ranked 1 to 8 in the European ranking list for each singles event will be considered in turn and are eligible to enter, to a maximum of two per nation in each event. Singles players ranked 9 and lower in the European ranking list for each singles event will be considered in turn and are eligible to enter to a maximum of one per nation in that event. Therefore, for example, if an NOC has players ranked 1,4 and 7 in the European rankings, they will be eligible to enter two players; if they have players ranked 2 and 10, they will be eligible to enter one player. Doubles pairs ranked 1 to 4 in the European ranking list for each doubles event will be considered in turn and are eligible to enter to a maximum of two pairs per nation in each event. Doubles pairs ranked 5 and lower in the European ranking list for each doubles event will be considered in turn and are eligible to enter one pair per nation in that event. Therefore, for example, if an NOC has pairs ranked 1 and 4 in the European rankings, they will be eligible to enter two pairs; if they have pairs ranked 3 and 12, they will be eligible to enter one pair. Azerbaijan, as host, is entitled to enter two players; a maximum of one player/pair per event will be allowed. If additional Azeri players qualify under the regulations, they may also be entered. A number of 'universality' places will also be awarded to ensure a larger number of nations can compete in the event. ==Medal tableMedalists== { - rowspan=2 Men's singles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - rowspan=2 Men's doubles rowspan=2 Mathias Boe Carsten Mogensen rowspan=2 Vladimir Ivanov Ivan Sozonov  Raphael Beck Andreas Heinz -  Joshua Magee Sam Magee - rowspan=2 Women's singles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - rowspan=2 Women's doubles rowspan=2 Gabriela Stoeva Stefani Stoeva rowspan=2 Ekaterina Bolotova Evgeniya Kosetskaya  Lena Grebak Maria Helsb√∏l -  √ñzge Bayrak Neslihan Yiƒüit - rowspan=2 Mixed doubles rowspan=2 Niclas N√∏hr Sara Thygesen rowspan=2 Gaetan Mittelheisser Audrey Fontaine  Raphael Beck Kira Kattenbeck -  Sam Magee Chloe Magee } ==References== Badminton Category:2015 in badminton Category:Badminton in Azerbaijan 2015 ","title":"Badminton at the 2015 European Games"},{"id":"41987742","text":"Jaltomata grandiflora is a rare plant species native to the Mexican State of Michoac√°n.Muestras Neotropicales de Herbario, Field Museum, Chicagophoto of specimen at New York Botanical Garden Jaltomata grandiflora is a perennial herb to subshrub, up to 100 cm tall.

Through Union Pro's working relationship, Kodaka also began working for Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW), where he adopted his current, hardcore wrestling-based style. Kodaka remained affiliated with Union Pro until the promotion folded in October 2015, after which he became a founding member of Pro-Wrestling Basara. Kodaka is currently in his fourth reign as the Union Max Champion, and his second reign as BJW Deathmatch Heavyweight Champion, while also being a former one-time KO-D Openweight Champion and three-time DDT Extreme Division Champion.

Through Union Pro's working relationship with the Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) promotion, Isami also made appearances for BJW, where he started a storyline with Jaki Numazawa and Mad Man Pondo, which led to him evolving his mixed martial arts-based wrestling style into a more deathmatch-based style. He was trained in the deathmatch style by Numazawa and Jun Kasai at their BJW affiliated School of Death training school. He made his deathmatch debut in 2006 and has retained the style ever since.

After having received his Ph.D. in 1972 and the following habilitation at the Ruhr University Bochum in 1977, Arndt conducted research and teaching at the University of Konstanz until 1983. In late 1982, the University of Mannheim (UMA) proposed Arndt a position as chaired professor at the Department of Tax and Public Law, a proposal that he accepted in 1983. In 2001 Arndt succeeded Peter Frankenberg in his role as rector of the university. During his time as rector Arndt changed UMA's academic profile from a university with a broad subject offering to a university with a strong focus on interdisciplinary social sciences, business administration, economics, law and computer science research. This process called Profilsch√§rfung (profile sharpening) took place between 2001-2008 and decreased the number of departments as well as offered subjects tremendously. Furthermore, Arndt pushed the development and introduction of an international business school at the University of Mannheim - the Mannheim Business School, that since its opening in 2005 has gained international reputation and a place among the best global business schools.

The organization is dedicated to the promotion of the sport of savate and canne de combat. It currently has 63 member countries. The organization holds biannual World and Continental championships, while their member countries hold national competitions. ==History== During the 1880s and 1890s Joseph Charlemont and Lois Albert synthesized the various savate methods and moves and created the ‚Äûacademic style‚Äú of the sports, but were opposed to adjusting it to fit the modern demands of the sport. By 1944 there were two separate views of the sport of savate: the white collar practitioners who were in favor of full contact ring fighting, and the academically oriented practitioners who opposed this. In 1965 the ‚ÄûComit√© National de Boxe Francais√©‚Äú was founded. The two philosophies competed for control of the organization. In 1973 CNBF became the ‚ÄûF√©d√©eration Nationale de Boxe Francaise‚Äú under the control of the academic camp. Their opponents founded a new organization, the ‚ÄûF√©d√©eration Nationale de Savate-Boxe-Francaise‚Äú. In 1976 the French government gave the official teaching rights to the academic camp. In March of 1985 the two camps came together to found the ‚ÄúF√©d√©ration Internationale de Boxe Fran√ßaise Savate\\", which was renamed to F√©d√©ration Internationale de Savate in October of 1999. ==Structure== All 63 member countries affiliated with Federation Internationale de Savate hold voting power in the General Assembly, which is held every two years. An extraordinary meeting of the general assembly may be called by the board of directors or it may be requested by 3/4 of the member countries.

Video Game shows a relentless, complex post-modern intelligence as it processes everything within its view, within its memory, within its wide range of cultural references. Its title is an index to this complexity, as it evokes not only digital game space as an aspect of the real, but the pursuit of video within the understanding of a game, replete with strategies, movements, and countermovements.

She established her own school in Berlin, combining gymnastics with nudism and dance. In the 1930s, her ambitions were seriously curtailed by the Nazis. ==Biography== Born in Berlin, Feist first studied with √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze in Hellerau, Dresden, in 1914 before moving back to Berlin in 1917 to study under Olga Desmond. Thereafter she joined Rudolf von Laban, following him to various locations in the north of Germany and participating in his majestic Tanzb√ºhne productions. In 1923, she established her own school in Berlin and also taught at Carl Diem's sports academy, successfully combining gymnastics with nudism and dance. She continued to dance in Laban's productions, starring as Donna Elvira in his Don Juan (1926). Her school's freestyle movements were pictured at the Berlin Stadium. In 1927 she appeared in the only film made by the American Stella Simon. The avant-garde film entitled Hands: The Life and Love of a Gentle Sex had its own score by Marc Blitzstein and it tells of an eternal triangle story using just the hands and forearms of the dancers. In 1928, Feist toured with the Novembergruppe, presenting her Der Berufung in Germany, Poland, Switzerland and England. Her last major production was Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Aulide performed on the steps of the Pergamon Museum in May 1933. Her ambitions were then curtailed by the Nazis who closed her school and forced her to move into smaller quarters although she continued to attract many students. After the war, she taught at the Volkshochschule Hannover from 1952 to 1965. Her last dance was performed for the inauguration of the Golden Rosenkreuz Temple at Bad M√ºnder in 1965 where she lived at the time. From 1983, she returned to live in Hannover where she died on 9 July 1990. ==See also== *Women in dance *Olga Desmond ==ReferencesLiterature== *Peter, Frank-Manuel: Hertha Feist.

Its members are Brian Tanchanco, JP Tanchanco, Jade Justine, and Andrew Contreras. ==History== KALA's first full- length album came on the music scene in 2005 with their debut album under Sony BMG entitled Manila High. The group is most noted for its hit single ‚ÄúJeepney‚Äù and is credited for resurging a distinct and defining genre of Filipino music known as ‚ÄúManila sound‚Äù. The name ‚ÄúKala‚Äù originates from the original members‚Äô college cake-making venture called the ‚ÄúKala Cake Project‚Äù. Kalaman In 2008, KALA underwent a self-imposed hiatus following the departures of bassist Lyle Pasco, lead guitarist JP Tanchanco and lead vocalist Mike Grape from the band. In 2011, KALA resurfaced with new members Jade Justine and Voopee Elvi√±a. Following their come back, KALA performed in Jack Daniel's third Philippine tour entitled ‚ÄúJack Daniel‚Äôs On Stage: Scouting Gigs‚Äù on November 22, 2013. Lead guitarist Voopee Elvi√±a died on December 4, 2015 after a battle with nasopharyngeal cancer. ===KALAMAN=== During a summer vacation in Boracay last 2004, some of the old band members had a picture posing in silhouette against the sunset. Various poses were made which represented each of the band members. Brian decided to combine prominent elements of each pose in order to blend it in one unifying image. This became the official logo of KALA. It represents convergence and harmony with the sharing of friendship, talents and passion from each of the band members. ==Advocacy== In 2004, KALA started performing for Rock Ed Philippines, a nationwide volunteer group that offers alternative education to underprivileged Filipino youth through art, music, poetry, and the like. In the same year, the band released an EP entitled ‚ÄúRockEdition: For the Benefit of the Filipino Youth‚Äù by way of support for the UN's ‚ÄúMillennium Development Goals‚Äù and ‚ÄúGlobal Call to Action Against Poverty.‚Äù In 2011, KALA performed for Rock Ed once again in their ‚ÄúRock the Riles: Rocking for Education‚Äù tour. ==Awards and nominations== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - 75b2dd; text-align:center;\\" - ccc; text-align:center;\\" !

Born a year after the Great Leap Forward, his art is heavily influenced by the last fifty years of political upheaval and violence in China, a period that included the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 70s, the Sino Vietnamese war in the early 1980s, and the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.World Socialist Web Site (21 November 1998) http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1998/11/guji-n21.html, by Richard Phillips, Retrieved 14 February 2014 At age seventeen, he enlisted in China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) during a recruitment drive to support the Sino-Vietnamese war, initiated by the country‚Äôs then leader Deng Xiaoping. A central theme to Guo Jian‚Äôs art derives from his observations of the application of propaganda and the arts to both motivate soldiers and sway public opinion. His perspective comes from his experiences as a propaganda poster painter in the PLA and propaganda officer in a transport company, then later from the outside looking back in as a student demonstrator during the Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. His art also explores common themes and approaches in both Chinese propaganda and Western propaganda. ==Art & Influences== Stylistically, Guo Jian‚Äôs work falls within the Cynical Realism grouping that has been attached to many contemporary Chinese artists who draw from their experiences over the last four decades in China. Their work is broadly a response to the dominant government driven form of propaganda-laden art known as Socialist Realism.

He delves into the sexualisation of propaganda, heroism, patriotism and persuasion. What first appears as humour is a lament at the use of sex to seduce men to war. Guo‚Äôs continual references in his paintings to his time in the P.L.A. derive from the traumatic nature of the experience. Gou recalls: > ‚ÄòI used to have nightmares all the time...

Guizhou borders Guangxi, Yunnan, Hunan and Sichuan provinces. At 176,000 km2 (68,000 sq. ml) Guizhou is approximately the size Florida or two thirds the size of the United Kingdom. One of China's most ethnically diverse provinces; minority groups make up almost 40% of Guizhou‚Äôs population of 35 million people. Guo Jian‚Äôs family is from the Buyei Â∏É‰æùÊóè ethnic minority group. Growing up during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) had a significant impact on Guo Jian‚Äôs generation. This was a period of China‚Äôs history characterized as the ‚ÄúLost Decade‚Äù when the country was victim to the internal political power struggles between Mao Zedong and his more moderate opponents. The populace were subjected to a perpetual climate of intense and relentless political indoctrination, struggle sessions and community violence which created a climate of general mistrust even of neighbours and one‚Äôs own family members. More broadly, millennia of traditions, culture, society and beliefs were abandoned or destroyed as part of the Four Olds campaign. > ‚ÄúThe depiction of soldiers has personal and political symbolism for Guo; not > only was he a People‚Äôs Liberation Army soldier, but, as he has said: ‚ÄòMy > grandmother told me that the People‚Äôs Liberation Army had executed my > grandfather.... I was shocked.... My father was a soldier. He had to > denounce his own father, knowing he‚Äôd be killed too if he tried to defend > him. And then in 1989, there I was, a former soldier, nearly killed by the > P.L.A. myself on Tiananmen Square‚Äù During the 60s and 70s, as most people in China did not have access to radio information, news and government propaganda were disseminated by village big character posters loudspeakers and political posters. Emerging from this period as a young man, Guo Jian joined the PLA to escape from his country town, find his independence, and serve his country. Already an aspiring artist, he hoped to join the PLA and study at one of the army‚Äôs art colleges. ===Military Experience (1979-82)=== In 1978, Guo Jian was approached by the Minzu University of China, the national level university designated for ethnic minorities, but was told to wait one more year to enrol in the art department. Shortly after, PLA recruiters came to Guo Jian‚Äôs town and told him he could enter the army‚Äôs art college if he enlisted. Guo Jian joined the PLA in 1979. One month after enlisting, he was informed that the army‚Äôs art college entry policies had changed and he could no longer automatically enter the college. As part of Deng Xiaoping‚Äôs reform policies, soldiers now had to undertake a formal entrance application process to enter military college. Guo Jian was initially assigned to the Telegraph Corps, 41st Division, 14th Corps, Yunnan Direction (the West Front) commanded by the Front Headquarter of Kunming Military Region in Kaiyuan ÂºÄËøúcity. He was also given responsibility overseeing the armoury, and was promoted to squad leader. His artistic interests and talents were recognised and he was assigned to a squad of ‚ÄúEntertainment Soldiers‚Äù as a propaganda poster artist. During this time, (and even to the present day ) the military took visual arts, theatre and performing arts as important tools for political indoctrination, propaganda, to promote and communicate the communist party‚Äôs ideology as well as boost morale. In 1982 Guo Jian resigned from the army and returned to his home town and worked as a propaganda officer in a local transportation company. For a period he also worked as a long-haul truck driver. ===University and after (1985-92)=== In 1985 Guo Jian was one of just three students accepted into Minzu University of China art department in Beijing, out of 6000 applicants who sat the entrance exam from his province alone. He initially studied traditional Chinese painting, calligraphy, and ink wash painting focussing on figurative art and eventually graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese painting and literature.Miami University Libraries (2007), Breakout : Chinese Art Outside China, by Melissa Chiu, , Retrieved 14 February 2014 The same year, China began to open up to the world, and with it China‚Äôs ‚Äú85 New Wave Movement‚Äù of modern art began. For the first time new opportunities arose to see and study modern foreign art trends, as well as foreign political theories and philosophies. The American artist, Robert Rauschenberg held the first officially sanctioned American art show The Atlantic (14 August 2013) https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/08/who-are-chinas- entertainment-soldiers-and-why-are-people-mad-at-them/278668/ By Lotus Yuen, Retrieved 14 February 2014 in China in fifty years, held at Beijing‚Äôs National Art Museum of China. Rauschenberg's installation works inspired many young artists at the time. In April 1989 the liberal ex-communist party leader Hu Yaobang died. Initially a small group of students began to commemorate his death and called for his legacy to be reassessed. Over the next few months the protesters numbers grew. Like many students at the time, Guo Jian took part in the student protests and hunger strikes.School of Art Institute Chicago (2010) http://blogs.saic.edu/emerge/2010/05/18/the-values-and-policy-system/ Retrieved 14 February 2014 Facing the soldiers together with the other students, he saw himself on both sides of the divide, both as a student and as the soldier. Guo Jian survived and graduated from university in July 1989, but his participation in the protest movement meant he was banned from being given employment through the formal job placement system for graduates at that time. Guo Jian was part of the initial group of artists who moved to the outskirts of Beijing to Yuanmingyuan (the site of The Old Summer Palace ruins) and formed the Yuanmingyuan artists‚Äô community. The artists‚Äô move was motivated by a desire to get away from Beijing‚Äôs post 1989 restrictive environment, while being close to what was at that time a still liberal Beijing University campus. In Yuanmingyuan Guo Jian began his professional painting career. ===Leaving China (1992)=== Following the Tiananmen protests and subsequent crackdown of 1989, the art sector and the overall social and political environment in Beijing and across China, remained restrictive, and conservative. As a result of pressure from the authorities, Guo Jian decided to leave China. In 1992 he immigrated to Australia. After arriving in Sydney, Guo Jian took up labouring jobs to finance himself and painted at night. His artwork gained the attention of curators and critics and his reputation grew. In 2006, one of Australia‚Äôs leading portrait artists, Chinese Australian Shen Jiawei, included a portrait of Guo Jian entitled ‚ÄòGuo Jian and Elly‚Äô1998,Australian Portrait Gallery, (November 2006) http://www.portrait.gov.au/exhibit/truth/shen.html, by Shen Jiawei Retrieved 14 February 2014 in a group exhibition at the Australian Portrait Gallery in Canberra. ===Back To China (2005)=== Guo Jian returned China in 2005 to explore production techniques options for developing his sculpture ‚ÄòOne World One Dream‚Äô (aka ‚ÄúDirty Mind‚Äù). He resides in Songzhuang art colony East of Beijing. In 2014 Guo Jian was interviewed on the Australian TV series \\"Two Men In China\\" about his art and his sculpture of Tianianmen Square. Subsequently, on June 2, 2014 he gave an interview to FT FT, 30 May 2014 http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8f280a54-e5b5-11e3-a7f5-00144feabdc0.html#slide0 and the next day was arrested by Chinese authorities citing \\"visa issues\\".The Guardian, 02 June 2014 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/02/australian-artist-guo-jian- arrested-tiananmen-anniversary ==Analysis & Themes== The subjects and themes in Guo Jian‚Äôs work largely revolve around the relationship between entertainment and violence, aggression and lust, glamour and vice, corruption and destruction.

Lonsdale began skiing at the age of 2, and soon became amongst the members of the Kendal Snowsports club. Her secondary school was Settle High School. She (in addition to the majority of the GB skiing team) learned how to ski on Snowflex, which has led to the team being called the \\"fridge kids\\". == Skiing career == Lonsdale competed in alpine skiing for 16 years. However, she switched sports to freestyle skiing, where she trialled several disciplines: mogul, aerial, and skiercross. She eventually decided to participate in halfpipe skiing. At the 2008 X Games, Lonsdale finished in ninth place in halfpipe, and at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 2011 she finished in 11th place. She has won the halfpipe at the British Championships every year from 2003 to 2011. She has also worked as a lifeguard. === Olympics === Lonsdale's debut in the Olympics was the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, where she competed at the halfpipe for Team GB. She was confirmed as in the squad in late January. Her first action is in the qualifying round on 20 February 2014. Her aim is to win a medal. At the Olympics, she was due to compete with Rowan Cheshire, James Machon and Murray Buchan, but Cheshire was forced to withdraw due to an accident in training at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, leaving Lonsdale as Britain's only competitor in the women's halfpipe.

She is considered to fall within the alternative and English-folk genres, and is noted for her dark, melancholic lyrics. As of August 2019, Hackman has released a mini-album, That Iron Taste (2013), and three full-length albums: We Slept at Last (2015); I'm Not Your Man (2017); and Any Human Friend (2019). She has also released four EPs: Free Covers (2012), Sugar Blind (2013), Deaf Heat (2014), and Wonderland (2016). ==Early life== Hackman was born in Hampshire, England and raised in Selborne and Devon. Her mother and Finnish father met during their work as animators. Hackman watched little television as a child.

She received a scholarship to attend Bedales School as a day pupil from ages 11 to 17, where she met and befriended model Cara Delevingne.

Hackman performed at Mulberry's Park Lane launch dinner, celebrating the release of Delevingne's collection in February 2014. At 18, she moved to Brighton, England, where she studied art foundation for a year and planned on earning a degree in fine arts. Instead, she later chose to pursue music full-time. ==Music careerEarly career (2012‚Äì2013)=== Marika Hackman at Rough Trade Hackman's first release was an EP of covers, which was available for digital download in October 2012.

The music video for her song \\"Cannibal\\" was filmed at Bedales School in March 2013. She later released two more EPs, Sugar Blind on 9 December 2013 and Deaf Heat on 4 April 2014, via iTunes. Both EPs contain songs written by Hackman as well as one cover song. ===Debut album: We Slept at Last (2014‚Äì2017)=== Hackman began recording her full-length debut album in 2014 with producer Charlie Andrew. She debuted new material from the album, including the songs \\"Skin\\" and \\"Ophelia\\", while on tour in 2013 with Laura Marling. In late September 2014, the album's title was announced as We Slept at Last and was released on 16 February 2015. The album features 12 new songs written by Hackman and does not feature any material from her previous EPs. Hackman embarked on a headlining solo tour throughout the UK in support of the album in November 2014. The album's lead single, \\"Drown\\", premiered in mid-October and was officially released on 8 December 2014. On 17 November 2014, \\"Drown\\" was announced as a shortlisted contender for DJ Zane Lowe's \\"Hottest Record of 2014\\" on BBC Radio 1. It ranked #89 out of 100 songs. She also appeared as a featured vocalist on alt-J's song \\"Warm Foothills\\", from their second album \\"This Is All Yours\\". On 8 January 2015 she premiered the album's second single, \\"Animal Fear\\", for DIY Magazine. On 13 January 2015, \\"Before I Sleep\\", another track from her debut album, was streamed exclusively on the website Earmilk, as well as her SoundCloud account. Hackman previewed material from the album in the days leading up to its release. The album is available to stream in its entirely on her official SoundCloud account. The deluxe edition of the album includes all of the songs from Hackman's EPs. \\"Animal Fear\\" was released as the album's second single on 16 February 2015, the same day as the release of We Slept at Last. On 18 February 2015, Hackman played material from her debut album at The Cob Gallery in Camden, London. An art exhibit, featuring the album's artwork of 24 photographs, was displayed during the show. She embarked on a solo headlining tour throughout the UK during March and April 2015. Fenne Lily provided support to Marika during these dates, which were generally well-received by the press . The tour continued with shows throughout Europe during the spring and summer of 2015.. On 25 June 2015, Laura Marling announced that Hackman and Johnny Flynn would join her on tour for a series of concerts in North America during July and August 2015. The concerts would be Hackman's first time performing material in North America. Hackman's fourth single, \\"Next Year\\", was released on 14 August 2015. The album was generally well-received, with The Guardians review rating it four out of five stars, and calling Hackman's work \\"superbly understated and atmospheric\\", noting that the \\"unsettling quality\\" was a distinguishing factor. ===Second album: I'm Not Your Man (2017)=== Hackman signed with Sub Pop for her second album, I'm Not Your Man. \\"Boyfriend\\", the first single from the album, debuted on Hackman's VEVO channel on 22 February 2017 in the form of a music video. The album features the London band The Big Moon as backing vocalists and instrumentalists. The cover art was designed by Tristan Pigott. The album was released 2 June 2017. The Guardians four-star (out of five) review praised Hackman's \\"sweetly sung cut-glass vocals\\" and for having \\"risen from the alt-folk scene\\". The Observer's review (rating 3/5 stars) called the album \\"witty, raucous and honest\\", noting that Hackman, despite a new sound, \\"keeps the best of her former incarnation\\", adding to the \\"balance and variety\\" of the album. Pitchfork declared the album \\"bracing\\" and \\"darkly funny\\", \\"melodically strong\\" and \\"full of surprises\\", giving a rating of 7.5/10. ===Third album: Any Human Friend (2019)=== On 23 April 2019, Hackman shared a teaser video with the caption \\"A _ _ H _ _ _ _ F _ _ _ _ _\\", hinting at the title of her upcoming third album. The following day, she released the lead single, \\"I'm Not Where You Are\\". On 22 May, the album's title was revealed to be \\"Any Human Friend\\", and it was made available to pre-order. It was released on 9 August 2019. The album was produced by Hackman and David Wrench, and significantly features synthesizers. Hackman has described the lyrical content of the album as \\"quite sexual\\" and \\"blunt, but not offensive\\". She wanted to write about sexuality in a \\"unifying and sexy\\" way, in contrast to sexual lyrics that objectify the subject. The second single from the album, \\"The One\\", was released on 13 June 2019. Hackman has described it as \\"probably the poppiest song I‚Äôve ever written\\". The Guardian, in a four-star review, observed that, on Hackman's \\"most accomplished record to date\\", she \\"flits between self- reflection and self-loathing\\" in \\"glorious songs\\" characterised by \\"a general wry frankness\\". Pitchfork called the album \\"a singular, extraordinarily horny, and occasionally bleak pop record\\", about \\"those quiet moments of reckoning with what it means to be alive, young, and cautiously enamoured of it all\\", also observing Hackman, with her \\"coolly unimpressed alto\\" as \\"not interested in being coy or mincing words\\". The Independent's review calls the album \\"blunt and bold\\" with a \\"dark sexual energy\\" on which \\"Hackman‚Äôs beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals\\". ==Personal life== Hackman currently resides in the East End of London. She was in a four-year relationship with fellow musician Amber Bain (The Japanese House) until 2018. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Title !

Alexander's most significant reform as emperor was emancipation of Russia's serfs in 1861, for which he is known as Alexander the Liberator (). The tsar was responsible for other reforms, including reorganizing the judicial system, setting up elected local judges, abolishing corporal punishment, promoting local self-government through the zemstvo system, imposing universal military service, ending some privileges of the nobility, and promoting university education. After an assassination attempt in 1866, Alexander adopted a somewhat more reactionary stance until his death. Alexander pivoted towards foreign policy and sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there were another war. He sought peace, moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871, and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. Despite his otherwise pacifist foreign policy, he fought a brief war with the Ottoman Empire in 1877‚Äì78, pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Although disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Alexander abided by that agreement. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia. Alexander was proposing additional parliamentary reforms to counter the rise of nascent revolutionary and anarchistic movements when he was assassinated in 1881. ==Early life== Alexander II as a boy (George Dawe, 1827) Born in Moscow, Alexander Nikolaevich was the eldest son of Nicholas I of Russia and Charlotte of Prussia (daughter of Frederick William III of Prussia and of Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz). His early life gave little indication of his ultimate potential; until the time of his accession in 1855, aged 37, few imagined that posterity would know him for implementing the most challenging reforms undertaken in Russia since the reign of Peter the Great. In the period of his life as heir apparent (1825 to 1855), the intellectual atmosphere of Saint Petersburg did not favour any kind of change: freedom of thought and all forms of private initiative were suppressed vigorously by the order of his father. Personal and official censorship was rife; criticism of the authorities was regarded as a serious offence. The education of the Tsesarevich as future emperor took place under the supervision of the liberal romantic poet and gifted translator Vasily Zhukovsky, grasping a smattering of a great many subjects and becoming familiar with the chief modern European languages. Alexander's alleged lack of interest in military affairs (as detected by later historians) resulted from his reaction to the effects of the unsavoury Crimean War of 1853‚Äì1856 on his own family and on the whole country. Unusually for the time, the young Alexander was taken on a six-month tour of Russia (1837), visiting 20 provinces in the country.Edvard Radzinsky, Alexander II: the Last Great Tsar, p. 63. He also visited many prominent Western European countriesEdvard Radzinsky, Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar, pp. 65‚Äì69, 190‚Äì91 & 199‚Äì200. in 1838 and 1839. As Tsesarevich, Alexander became the first Romanov heir to visit Siberia (1837). While touring Russia, he also befriended the then exiled poet Alexander Herzen and pardoned him. It was through Herzen's influence that the tsarevich later abolished serfdom in Russia. In 1839, when his parents sent him on a tour of Europe, he met twenty- year-old Queen Victoria and both were enamored of each other. Simon Sebag Montefiore speculates that a small romance emerged. Such a marriage, however, would not work, as Alexander was not a minor prince of Europe and was in line to inherit a throne himself.Sebag Montefiore, p. 512 In 1847, Alexander donated money to Ireland during the Great Famine. He has been described as looking like a German, somewhat of a pacifist, a heavy smoker and card player.The Advocate: or, Irish Industrial Journal, 7 March 1855, page 3, column 2 ==Reign== Dormition Cathedral from the Red Porch during his coronation The coronation of Emperor Alexander II and Empress Maria Alexandrovna on 26 August/7 September 1856 at the Dormition Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin, painting by Mih√°ly Zichy. The painting depicts the moment when the Emperor crowned the Empress. ===Reforms=== Encouraged by public opinion, Alexander began a period of radical reforms, including an attempt not to depend on landed aristocracy controlling the poor, an effort to develop Russia's natural resources, and to reform all branches of the administration. Boris Chicherin (1828-1904) was a political philosopher who believed that Russia needed a strong, authoritative government by Alexander to make possible his reforms. He praised Alexander for the range of his fundamental reforms, arguing that the tsar was: :called upon to execute one of the hardest tasks which can confront an autocratic ruler: to completely remodel the enormous state which had been entrusted to his care, to abolish an age-old order founded on slavery, to replace it with civic decency and freedom, to establish justice in a country which it never known the meaning of legality, to redesign the entire administration, to introduce freedom of the press in the context of untrammeled authority, to call new forces to life at every turn and set them on firm legal foundations, to put a repressed and humiliated society on its feet and to give at the chance to flex its muscles.Quoted in David Saunders, Russia in the Age of Reaction and Reform: 1801‚Äì1881. London: Longman, 1992. p. 213. .  Emancipation of the serfs  Alexander II succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father in 1855. As Tsarevich, he had been an enthusiastic supporter of his father's reactionary policies. That is, he always obeyed the autocratic ruler. But now he was the autocratic ruler himself, and fully intended to rule according to what he thought best. He rejected any moves to set up a parliamentary system that would curb his powers. He inherited a large mess that had been wrought by his father's fear of progress during his reign. Many of the other royal families of Europe had also disliked Nicholas I, which extended to distrust of the Romanov dynasty itself. Even so, there was no one more prepared to bring the country around than Alexander II.Sebag Montefiore, pp. 541‚Äì42 The first year of his reign was devoted to the prosecution of the Crimean War and, after the fall of Sevastopol, to negotiations for peace led by his trusted counsellor, Prince Alexander Gorchakov. The country had been exhausted and humiliated by the war.Edvard Radzinsky, Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar, p. 107. Bribe-taking, theft and corruption were rampant.Edvard, Radzinsky, Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar p. 107. The Emancipation Reform of 1861 abolished serfdom on private estates throughout the Russian Empire. Serfs gained the full rights of free citizens, including rights to marry without having to gain consent, to own property and to own a business. The measure was the first and most important of the liberal reforms made by Alexander II. Polish landed proprietors of the Lithuanian provinces presented a petition hoping that their relations with the serfs might be regulated in a more satisfactory way (meaning in a way more satisfactory for the proprietors). Alexander II authorized the formation of committees \\"for ameliorating the condition of the peasants,\\" and laid down the principles on which the amelioration was to be effected. Without consulting his ordinary advisers, Alexander ordered the Minister of the Interior to send a circular to the provincial governors of European Russia (serfdom was rare in other parts) containing a copy of the instructions forwarded to the Governor-General of Lithuania, praising the supposed generous, patriotic intentions of the Lithuanian landed proprietors, and suggesting that perhaps the landed proprietors of other provinces might express a similar desire. The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed. Leaving church in Pskov, 1864 Emancipation was not a simple goal capable of being achieved instantaneously by imperial decree. It contained complicated problems, deeply affecting the economic, social and political future of the nation. Alexander had to choose between the different measures recommended to him and decide if the serfs would become agricultural laborers dependent economically and administratively on the landlords or if the serfs would be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors. The emperor gave his support to the latter project, and the Russian peasantry became one of the last groups of peasants in Europe to shake off serfdom. The architects of the emancipation manifesto were Alexander's brother Konstantin, Yakov Rostovtsev, and Nikolay Milyutin. On 3 March 1861, six years after his accession, the emancipation law was signed and published.  Additional reforms  pay for Russian Alaska in 1867 A host of new reforms followed in diverse areas.W. Bruce Lincoln, The great reforms: Autocracy, bureaucracy, and the politics of change in imperial Russia (Northern Illinois UP, 1990.Ben Eklof, , John Bushnell, and Larisa Georgievna Zakharova, eds. Russia's great reforms, 1855-1881 (Indiana UP, 1994. The tsar appointed Dmitry Milyutin to carry out significant reforms in the Russian armed forces. Further important changes were made concerning industry and commerce, and the new freedom thus afforded produced a large number of limited liability companies. Plans were formed for building a great network of railways, partly to develop the natural resources of the country, and partly to increase its power for defense and attack.Donald Mackenzie Wallace, \\"Alexander II (1818‚Äì1881)\\". The Encyclopaedia Britannica (1910). 1:pp. 559‚Äì61 Military reforms included universal conscription, introduced for all social classes on 1 January 1874.Edvard Radzinsky, Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar p. 150. Prior to the new regulation, as of 1861, conscription was compulsorily enforced only for the peasantry. Conscription had been 25 years for serfs that were drafted by their landowners, which was widely considered to be a life sentence.Jonathon Bromley, \\"Russia 1848‚Äì1917\\" Other military reforms included extending the reserve forces and the military district system, which split the Russian states into 15 military districts, a system still in use over a hundred years later. The building of strategic railways and an emphasis on the military education of the officer corps comprised further reforms. Corporal punishment in the military and branding of soldiers as punishment were banned.Edvard Radzinsky, Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar, pp. 150‚Äì51. The bulk of important military reforms were enacted as a result of the poor showing in the Crimean War. A new judicial administration (1864), based on the French model, introduced security of tenure.An Introduction to Russian History (1976), edited by Robert Auty and Dimitri Obolensky, chapter by John Keep, p. 238 A new penal code and a greatly simplified system of civil and criminal procedure also came into operation.Wallace, \\"Alexander II\\" (1910) pp. 559‚Äì61. Reorganisation of the judiciary occurred to include trial in open court, with judges appointed for life, a jury system and the creation of justices of the peace to deal with minor offences at local level. Legal historian Sir Henry Maine credited Alexander II with the first great attempt since the time of Grotius to codify and humanise the usages of war. Alexander's bureaucracy instituted an elaborate scheme of local self- government (zemstvo) for the rural districts (1864) and the large towns (1870), with elective assemblies possessing a restricted right of taxation, and a new rural and municipal police under the direction of the Minister of the Interior.Wallace, \\"Alexander II\\" (1910) pp. 559‚Äì61. The Alaska colony was losing money, and would be impossible to defend in wartime against Britain, so in 1867 Russia sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars). The Russian administrators, soldiers, settlers, and some of the priests returned home. Others stayed to minister to their native parishioners, who remain members of the Russian Orthodox Church into the 21st century.James R. Gibson, \\"Why the Russians Sold Alaska.\\" Wilson Quarterly 3.3 (1979): 179-188. Online ===Reaction after 1866 === Alexander maintained a generally liberal course.Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs: 1613‚Äì1918 (2016), pp. 392ff. Radicals complained he did not go far enough, and he became a target for numerous assassination plots. He survived attempts that took place in 1866, 1879, and 1880. Finally , assassins organized by the Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) party killed him with a bomb. The Emperor had earlier in the day signed the Loris-Melikov constitution, which would have created two legislative commissions made up of indirectly elected representatives, had it not been repealed by his reactionary successor Alexander III. An attempted assassination in 1866 started a more reactionary period that lasted until his death. The Tsar made a series of new appointments, replacing liberal ministers with conservatives. Under Minister of Education Dmitry Tolstoy, liberal university courses and subjects that encouraged critical thinking were replaced by a more traditional curriculum, and from 1871 onwards only students from gimnaziya schools could progress to university. In 1879, governor- generals were established with powers to prosecute in military courts and exile political offenders. The government also held show trials with the intention of deterring others from revolutionary activity, but after cases such as the Trial of the 193 where sympathetic juries acquitted many of the defendants,Hingley, Ronald, Nihilists: Russian Radicals and Revolutionaries in the Reign of Alexander II 1855‚Äì81 (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1967) p. 79 this was abandoned. ===Suppression of separatist movements=== Battle of Mrzyg≈Ç√≥d during the January Uprising in 1863 In 1856, at the beginning of his reign, Alexander made a memorable speech to the deputies of the Polish nobility who inhabited Congress Poland, Western Ukraine, Lithuania, Livonia and Belarus, in which he admonished, \\"Gentlemen, let us have no dreams!\\" This served as a warning to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The territories of the former Poland-Lithuania were excluded from liberal policies introduced by Alexander. The result was the January Uprising of 1863‚Äì1864 that was suppressed after eighteen months of fighting. Hundreds of Poles were executed, and thousands were deported to Siberia. The price of suppression was Russian support for the unification of Germany. The martial law in Lithuania, introduced in 1863, lasted for the next 40 years. Native languages, Lithuanian, Ukrainian and Belarussian, were completely banned from printed texts, the Ems Ukase being an example. The Polish language was banned in both oral and written form from all provinces except Congress Poland, where it was allowed in private conversations only. ===Encouraging Finnish nationalism=== Senate Square in Helsinki, by sculptor Walter Runeberg. Erected in 1894, when Finland was still a Russian grand duchy. In 1863, Alexander II re-convened the Diet of Finland and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy within the Russian Empire, including establishment of its own currency, the Finnish markka. Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of Finnish society. Alexander II is still regarded as \\"The Good Tsar\\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country than in the whole of Russia. They may also be seen as a reward for the loyalty of its relatively western-oriented population during the Crimean War and during the Polish uprising. Encouraging Finnish nationalism and language can also be seen as an attempt to dilute ties with Sweden. ===Rule during the Caucasian War=== Imam Shamil surrendered to Count Baryatinsky on 25 August 1859. The Caucasian War (1817‚Äì1864) concluded as a Russian victory during Alexander II's rule. Just before the conclusion of the war the Russian Army, under the emperor's order, sought to eliminate the Circassian \\"mountaineers\\" in what would be often referred to as \\"cleansing\\" in several historic dialogues.Y. Abramov,Caucasian Mountaineers, Materials For the History of Circassian People , 1990Justin McCarthy, Death and Exile, the Ethnic Cleansing of Ottoman Muslims, 1821‚Äì1922, Princeton, NJ, 1995 ===Liberation of Bulgaria=== In April 1876 the Bulgarian population in the Balkans rebelled against Ottoman rule. The Ottoman authorities suppressed the April Uprising, causing a general outcry throughout Europe. Some of the most prominent intellectuals and politicians on the Continent, most notably Victor Hugo and William Gladstone, sought to raise awareness about the atrocities that the Turks imposed on the Bulgarian population. To solve this new crisis in the \\"Eastern question\\" a Constantinople Conference was convened in Constantinople at the end of the year. The participants in the Conference failed to reach a final agreement. After the failure of the Constantinople Conference, at the beginning of 1877 Emperor Alexander II started diplomatic preparations with the other Great Powers to secure their neutrality in case of a war between Russia and the Ottomans. Alexander II considered such agreements paramount in avoiding the possibility of causing his country a disaster similar to the Crimean War. In 1877, Russian general Iosif Gurko liberated Veliko Tarnovo, ending the 480-year rule of the Ottoman Empire. The Russian Emperor succeeded in his diplomatic endeavours. Having secured agreement as to non-involvement by the other Great Powers, on 17 April 1877 Russia declared war upon the Ottoman Empire. The Russians, helped by the Romanian Army under its supreme commander, King Carol I (then Prince of Romania), who sought to obtain Romanian independence from the Ottomans as well, were successful against the Turks and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878 ended with the signing of the preliminary peace Treaty of San Stefano on 19 February (3 March N.S.) 1878. The treaty and the subsequent Congress of Berlin (June‚ÄìJuly 1878) secured the emergence of an independent Bulgarian state for the first time since 1396, and Bulgarian parliamentarians elected the tsar's nephew, Prince Alexander of Battenberg, as the Bulgarians' first ruler. For his social reforms in Russia and his role in the liberation of Bulgaria, Alexander II became known in Bulgaria as the \\"Tsar-Liberator of Russians and Bulgarians\\". A monument to Alexander II was erected in 1907 in Sofia in the \\"National Assembly\\" square, opposite to the Parliament building. The monument underwent a complete reconstruction in 2012, funded by the Sofia Municipality and some Russian foundations. The inscription on the monument reads in Old-Bulgarian style: \\"To the Tsar-Liberator from grateful Bulgaria\\". There is a museum dedicated to Alexander in the Bulgarian city of Pleven. ===Assassination attempts=== In April 1866, there was an attempt on the emperor's life in St. Petersburg by Dmitry Karakozov. To commemorate his narrow escape from death (which he himself referred to only as \\"the event of 4 April 1866\\"), a number of churches and chapels were built in many Russian cities. Viktor Hartmann, a Russian architect, even sketched a design of a monumental gate (which was never built) to commemorate the event. Modest Mussorgsky later wrote his Pictures at an Exhibition; the last movement of which, \\"The Great Gate of Kiev\\", is based on Hartmann's sketches. During the 1867 World Fair Polish immigrant Antoni Berezowski attacked the carriage containing Alexander, his two sons and Napoleon III. His self-modified, double-barreled pistol misfired and struck a horse of an escorting cavalryman. On the morning of 20 April 1879, Alexander was briskly walking towards the Square of the Guards Staff and faced Alexander Soloviev, a 33-year-old former student. Having seen a menacing revolver in his hands, the Emperor fled in a zigzag pattern. Soloviev fired five times but missed; he was hanged on 28 May, after being sentenced to death. The student acted on his own, but other revolutionaries were keen to murder Alexander. In December 1879, the Narodnaya Volya (People's Will), a radical revolutionary group which hoped to ignite a social revolution, organised an explosion on the railway from Livadia to Moscow, but they missed the emperor's train. On the evening of 5 February 1880 Stephan Khalturin, also from Narodnaya Volya, set off a timed charge under the dining room of the Winter Palace, right in the resting room of the guards a story below, killing 11 people and wounding 30 others. The New York Times (4 March 1880) reported \\"the dynamite used was enclosed in an iron box, and exploded by a system of clockwork used by the man Thomas in Bremen some years ago.\\"Quoted in , p. 194 However, dinner had been delayed by the late arrival of the tsar's nephew, the Prince of Bulgaria, so the tsar and his family were not in the dining room at the time of the explosion and were unharmed. === Life in the ruling family === Alexander II and Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna By his empress consort, Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna, Alexander II had eight children, seven of whom survived into adulthood. He particularly placed hope in his eldest son, Tsarevich Nicholas. In 1864, Alexander II found Nicholas a bride, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, second daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and younger sister to Alexandra, Princess of Wales and King George I of Greece. However, in 1865, during the engagement, Nicholas died and the tsar's second son, Grand Duke Alexander, not only inherited his brother's position of tsarevich, but also his fianc√©e. The couple married in November 1866, with Dagmar converting to Orthodoxy and taking the name Maria Feodorovna. In time, political differences, and other disagreements, led to estrangement between the two Alexanders.Van Der Kiste, p. 94 Amongst his children, he remained particularly close with his second, and only surviving daughter, Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna. In 1873, a quarrel broke out between the courts of Queen Victoria and Alexander II, when Victoria's second son, Prince Alfred, made it known that he wished to marry the Grand Duchess. The tsar objected to the queen's request to have his daughter come to England in order to meet her,Van Der Kiste, John The Romanovs: 1818‚Äì1959 (Sutton Publishing, 2004) p. 71 and after the January 1874 wedding in St. Petersburg, the tsar insisted that his daughter be granted precedence over the Princess of Wales, which the queen rebuffed.Van Der Kiste p. 74 Later that year, after attending the engagement ceremonies of his second surviving son, Vladimir, to Marie of Mecklenburg- Schwerin in Berlin, Alexander II, with his third son, Alexei, accompanying him, made a visit to England.Der Kiste, p. 74 While not a state visit, but simply a trip to see his daughter, he nevertheless partook in receptions at Buckingham Palace and Marlborough House, inspected the artillery at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, reviewed troops at Aldershot and met both Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli and the leader of the opposition, William Gladstone.Van Der Kiste, p. 75 Disraeli observed of the tsar that \\"his mien and manners are gracious and graceful, but the expression of his countenance, which I could now very closely examine, is sad. Whether it is satiety, or the loneliness of despotism, or fear of a violent death, I know not, but it was a visage of, I should think, habitual mournfulness.\\" At home, Tsarina Marie Alexandrovna was suffering from tuberculosis and was spending increasing time abroad. In 1866, Alexander II took a mistress, Princess Catherine Dolgorukaya, with whom he would father three surviving children. The affair, in the face of the tsarina's declining health, served to alienate the rest of his adult children, save his son Alexei and his daughter, who, like Alexander II's brothers, believed that the tsar was beyond criticism.Van Der Kiste, p. 67 In 1880, however, following threats on Catherine's life, the tsar moved his mistress and their children into the Winter Palace. Courtiers spread stories that the dying Tsarina was forced to hear the noise of Catherine's children moving about overhead, but her rooms were actually far away from those occupied by the Empress.Radzinsky, Edvard (2005). Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar. Free Press, a division of Simon and Schuster, Inc. p. 300. When Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna made a visit in May 1880, being warned that her mother was dying, she was horrified to learn of his father's mistress' living arrangements and confronted her father.Van Der Kiste, p. 97 Shocked by the loss of support from his daughter, he quietly retreated to Gatchina Palace for military reviews. The quarrel, however, evidently, jolted his conscience enough to lead him to return to St. Petersburg each morning to ask after his wife's health. The tsarina, however, had not much longer to live, dying on . On , Alexander II and Catherine were married in a secret ceremony at Tsarskoe Selo.Van Der Kiste, pp. 97 & 98 The action scandalized both his family and the court, also violating Orthodox custom which required a minimum period of 40 days mourning between the death of a spouse and the remarriage of a surviving spouse, eliciting criticism in foreign courts.Van Der Kiste, p. 98 Alexander also bestowed on Catherine the title of Princess Yurievskaya and legitimized their children. ==Assassination== The explosion killed one of the Cossacks and wounded the driver. The assassination of Alexander II, drawing by G. Broling, 1881 After the last assassination attempt in February 1880, Count Loris- Melikov was appointed the head of the Supreme Executive Commission and given extraordinary powers to fight the revolutionaries. Loris-Melikov's proposals called for some form of parliamentary body, and the Emperor seemed to agree; these plans were never realised. On , Alexander fell victim to an assassination plot in Saint Petersburg. As he was known to do every Sunday for many years, the emperor went to the Mikhailovsky Man√®ge for the military roll call. He travelled both to and from the Man√®ge in a closed carriage accompanied by five Cossacks and Frank (Franciszek) Joseph Jackowski, a Polish noble, with a sixth Cossack sitting on the coachman's left. The emperor's carriage was followed by two sleighs carrying, among others, the chief of police and the chief of the emperor's guards. The route, as always, was via the Catherine Canal and over the Pevchesky Bridge. The street was flanked by narrow pavements for the public. A young member of the Narodnaya Volya (\\"People's Will\\") movement, Nikolai Rysakov, was carrying a small white package wrapped in a handkerchief. He later said of his attempt to kill the Tsar: The explosion, while killing one of the Cossacks and seriously wounding the driver and people on the sidewalk, had only damaged the bulletproof carriage, a gift from Napoleon III of France. The emperor emerged shaken but unhurt. Rysakov was captured almost immediately. Police Chief Dvorzhitsky heard Rysakov shout out to someone else in the gathering crowd. The surrounding guards and the Cossacks urged the emperor to leave the area at once rather than being shown the site of the explosion. Nevertheless, a second young member of the Narodnaya Volya, Ignacy Hryniewiecki, standing by the canal fence, raised both arms and threw something at the emperor's feet. He was alleged to have shouted, \\"It is too early to thank God\\".Robert K. Massie, Nicholas and Alexandra, Dell Publishing Company, New York, p. 16 Dvorzhitsky was later to write: Later, it was learned there was a third bomber in the crowd. Ivan Emelyanov stood ready, clutching a briefcase containing a bomb that would be used if the other two bombers failed. Alexander was carried by sleigh to the Winter Palace to his study where almost the same day twenty years earlier, he had signed the Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs. Alexander was bleeding to death, with his legs torn away, his stomach ripped open, and his face mutilated.Massie, p. 16 Members of the Romanov family came rushing to the scene. The dying emperor was given Communion and Last Rites. When the attending physician, Sergey Botkin, was asked how long it would be, he replied, \\"Up to fifteen minutes.\\"Radzinsky, (2005) p. 419 At 3:30 that day, the standard of Alexander II (his personal flag) was lowered for the last time. ==Aftermath== The Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander II's assassination. Alexander II, also known as the Grand Duke of Finland, was well regarded among the majority of Finns.YLE: The statue of the Russian emperor arouses wonder among tourists ‚Äì Why is it still in the middle of Helsinki? - Ven√§j√§n keisarin patsas her√§tt√§√§ turisteissa ihmetyst√§ ‚Äì Miksi se on yh√§ keskell√§ Helsinki√§? (in Finnish) Statue of Alexander II at the Senate Square in Helsinki, Finland, flowered on March 13, 1899, the day of the commemoration of the emperor's death. Alexander II's death caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of his last acts was the approval of Mikhail Loris-Melikov's constitutional reforms.Heilbronner, Hans, 'Alexander III and the Reform Plan of Loris-Melikov', The Journal of Modern History, 33:4 (1961) 384‚Äì97 [386] Though the reforms were conservative in practice, their significance lay in the value Alexander II attributed to them: \\"I have given my approval, but I do not hide from myself the fact that it is the first step towards a constitution.\\"Venturi, Franco, Roots of Revolution: A History of the Populist and Socialist Movements in Nineteenth Century Russia, trans. by Francis Haskell (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1960) In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release these plans to the Russian people. Instead, following his succession, Alexander III, under the advice of Konstantin Pobedonostsev, chose to abandon these reforms and went on to pursue a policy of greater autocratic power.Heilbronner, pp. 390‚Äì96 The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'‚Äîthe use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\"Palmer, Brian (29 December 2010) What do anarchists want from us?, Slate.com With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory. ==Marriages and childrenFirst marriage=== Emperor Alexander II and his wife, Empress Maria, with their son, the future Alexander III by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky 1870 In 1838‚Äì39, as a young bachelor, Alexander made the Grand Tour of Europe which was standard for young men of his class at that time. One of the purposes of the tour was to select a suitable bride for himself. He stayed for three days with the maiden Queen Victoria, who was already Queen although she was one year younger than him. The two got along well, but there was no question of marriage between two major monarchs. Alexander went on to Germany, and in Darmstadt, he met and was charmed by Princess Marie, the 15-year-old daughter of Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse. On 16 April 1841, aged 23, Tsarevitch Alexander married Marie in St. Petersburg; the bride had previously been received into the Russian Orthodox Church, taking the new name of Maria Alexandrovna. (Marie was the legal daughter of Ludwig II, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine and Princess Wilhelmina of Baden, although some gossiping questioned whether the Grand Duke Ludwig or Wilhelmina's lover, Baron August von Senarclens de Grancy, was her biological father. Alexander was aware of the question of her paternity.) The marriage produced six sons and two daughters: *Grand Duchess Alexandra Alexandrovna of Russia (30 August 1842 ‚Äì 10 July 1849), nicknamed Lina, died of infant meningitis in St. Petersburg at the age of six *Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia (20 September 1843 ‚Äì 24 April 1865), engaged to Princess Dagmar of Denmark *Emperor Alexander III (10 March 1845 ‚Äì 1 November 1894) he married Princess Dagmar of Denmark on 9 November 1866. They had six children. *Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia (22 April 1847 ‚Äì 17 February 1909) he married Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on 28 August 1874. They had five children. *Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich (14 January 1850 ‚Äì 14 November 1908) he married Alexandra Zhukovskaya in 1870. They had one son. *Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia (17 October 1853 ‚Äì 24 October 1920) she married Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on 23 January 1874. They had six children. *Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia (11 May 1857 ‚Äì 17 February 1905) he married Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine on 15 June 1884. *Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia (3 October 1860 ‚Äì 24 January 1919) he married Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark on 17 June 1889. They had two children. He remarried Olga Karnovich on 10 October 1902. They had three children. Empress Maria Alexandrovna died of tuberculosis on 3 June 1880, at the age of fifty-five. ===Mistress=== Tsar Alexander II, photo by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky, 1881 (The Di Rocco Wieler Private Collection, Toronto, Canada) On 18 July 1880, less than a month after Empress Maria's death, Alexander married morganatically his mistress Princess Catherine Dolgorukov, with whom he already had four children: *Prince George Alexandrovich Yuryevsky (12 May 1872 ‚Äì 13 September 1913) he married Countess Alexandra von Zarnekau on 11 February 1900 and they were divorced in 1908. They had one son. *Princess Olga Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (7 November 1873 ‚Äì 10 August 1925) she married Count Georg of Merenberg on 12 May 1895. They had three children. *Prince Boris Alexandrovich Yurievsky (23 February ‚Äì 11 April 1876) *Princess Catherine Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (9 September 1878 ‚Äì 22 December 1959) she married Prince Alexander Vladimirovich Baryatinsky (1870‚Äì1910) on 18 October 1901. They had two sons. She remarried Prince Sergei Platonovich Obolensky on 6 October 1916 and they were divorced in 1924. ==In fiction== Alexander II appears prominently in the opening two chapters of Jules Verne's Michael Strogoff (published in 1876 during Alexander's own lifetime). The Emperor sets the book's plot in motion and sends its eponymous protagonist on the dangerous and vital mission which would occupy the rest of the book. Verne presents Alexander II in a highly positive light, as an enlightened yet firm monarch, dealing confidently and decisively with a rebellion. Alexander's liberalism shows in a dialogue with the chief of police, who says \\"There was a time, sire, when NONE returned from Siberia\\", to be immediately rebuked by the Emperor who answers: \\"Well, whilst I live, Siberia is and shall be a country whence men CAN return.\\"Jules Verne, \\"Michael Strogoff\\", Ch. 2 The films Katia (1938) and Magnificent Sinner (1959) depict a highly fictionalized account of the Tsar's romance with the woman who became his second wife. In The Tiger in the Well, Philip Pullman refers to the assassination ‚Äì though he never names Alexander ‚Äì and to the pogroms that followed. The anti-Jewish attacks play an important role in the novel's plot. Andrew Williams's historical thriller, To Kill A Tsar, tells the story of The People's Will revolutionaries and the assassination through the eyes of an Anglo-Russian doctor living in St Petersburg. Oscar Wilde's first play Vera; or, The Nihilists, written in 1880Alexander II's last yearfeatures Russian revolutionaries who seek to assassinate a reform-minded Emperor (and who, in the play, ultimately fail in their plot). Though Wilde's fictional Emperor differs from the actual Alexander, contemporary events in Russia ‚Äì as published in the British press of the time ‚Äì clearly influenced Wilde. ==In nonfiction== Mark Twain describes a short visit with Alexander II in Chapter 37 of The Innocents Abroad, describing him as \\"very tall and spare, and a determined-looking man, though a very pleasant-looking one nevertheless. It is easy to see that he is kind and affectionate. There is something very noble in his expression when his cap is off.\\" ==AncestorsTitles, styles, honours and armsTitles and styles=== * 29 April 18181 December 1825: His Imperial Highness Grand Duke Alexander Nikolaevich of Russia * 1 December 18252 March 1855: His Imperial Highness The Tsesarevich of Russia * 2 March 185513 March 1881: His Imperial Majesty The Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias ===Honours=== ;Domestic orders and decorationsRussian Imperial Army - Emperor Alexander II of Russia (In Russian) * Knight of St. Andrew, 29 April 1818 * Knight of St. Alexander Nevsky, 29 April 1818 * Knight of St. Anna, 1st Class, 29 April 1818 * Knight of St. Vladimir, 1st Class, 1 January 1846 * Knight of St. George, 4th Class, 10 November 1850; 1st Class, 26 November 1869 * Knight of St. Stanislaus, 1st Class, 11 June 1865 * Golden Sword \\"For Bravery\\", 28 November 1877 * Poland: Knight of the White Eagle, 12 July 1829Kawalerowie i statuty Orderu Or≈Ça Bia≈Çego 1705-2008 (2008), p. 289 ;Foreign orders and decorations ===Arms=== Lesser Coat of Arms of the Russian Empire ==Gallery== File:Alexander II by E.Botman (1856, Russian museum).jpgPortrait of Alexander II, 1856 File:Alexander_II_of_Russia_by_Monogrammist_V.G._(1888,_Hermitage)_detail.jpgPortrait of Emperor Alexander II wearing the greatcoat and cap of the Imperial Horse- Guards Regiment. c. 1865 File:Alexander_II_S_L_Levitsky.JPGAlexander II, by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky, 1860 (The Di Rocco Wieler Private Collection, Toronto, Canada) File:Alexander II of Russia by K.Makovskiy (1881, GTG).jpgAlexander II, portrait by Konstantin Makovsky. 1881 File:Tsar- liberator-imagesfrombulgaria.jpgThe Monument to the Tsar Liberator in Sofia commemorates Alexander II's decisive role in the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78.
