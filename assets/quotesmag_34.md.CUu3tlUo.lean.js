The piece first took shape around 1892-1896, but achieved its final orchestrated form in 1902-1903. Dedicated to Gabriel Faur√©, it served as an inspiration for Ernest Chausson's own Po√®me, Op. 25. == The Birth of Ysa√øe's Poems == By the time of Ysa√øe's second stay in Paris around 1885, he had prided himself on having written several polonaises, mazurkas, and concertos without ever having taken harmony and musical composition lessons. He never stopped composing, even when his career as a traveling virtuoso gave him respite. However, from the 1890s on, Ysa√øe reflected on his youthful compositions and felt that they were devoid of any originality or value. He then turned to the poem for string instruments, a genre in which it seems he created himself. Without any real formal constraints, this genre usually consists of a single movement, alternating different sections with clearly contrasted characters, sometimes melancholy, sometimes turbulent, but always of a basically lyrical nature (even sentimental at times). Combining aesthetic considerations and virtuosity, Ysa√øe's poems become a special place for the evocation of different images and emotions, without ever turning into program music. Ysa√øe had always been attracted to the 'poem' form and states himself that \\"it is more receptive to emotion and is not constrained by the restrictions imposed by the hallowed form of the concerto; it can be dramatic and lyrical; it is essentially romantic and impressionistic...\\" He continues by explaining that \\"(the poem) weeps and sings, it is shadow and light and has a changing prism; it is free and needs only its title to guide the composer and make him paint feelings, images, abstractions without a literary canvas; in a word, it is a picture painted without a model.\\" To Ysa√øe, the poem is a progression in his musical writing and an experiment to associate musical interest with that of true and great virtuosity, which he felt had been neglected by instrumental players. Throughout his life, Ysa√øe wrote nine poems: Po√®me √©l√©giaque in D minor, Op. 12 for violin and orchestra; Au rotet, Op. 13 for violin and orchestra, Chant d'hiver in B minor, Op. 15 for violin and orchestra; M√©ditation, Op. 16 for cello and orchestra; Extase, Op. 21 for violin and orchestra; Les neiges d'antan, Op. 23 for violin and orchestra; Amiti√©, Op. 26 for two violins and orchestra, Po√®me nocturne, Op. 29 for violin, cello, and orchestra; Harmonies du soir, Op. 31 for string quartet and string orchestra. == Po√®me √©l√©giaque == This crucial work of Ysa√øe's, which ignited his passion for poem compositions, was inspired by Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Ysa√øe builds on the virtuoso pieces of the 19th century and utilizes devices such as scordatura, in which the violin's lowest string is tuned down to give it a darker, warmer timbre. The beginning of this piece, marked soutenu et calme, opens with a very lyrical theme from the solo violin in D minor which steadily gains in animation and attains a high degree of intensity. This section is a setting for the moment after Romeo and Juliet's death. Ysa√øe marks this with accents, syncopations, and a triple fortissimo. Following the end of this introduction, a new theme in B-flat minor, is introduced. This section is titled Sc√®ne fun√®bre (funeral scene) and is solemn and deeply felt, to be played in a very sustained manner. The piece then becomes more agitated, with more syncopated rhythms and interplay between the violinist and orchestra. As the piece reaches its climax, the funeral theme returns, marked triple forte and this time played by the orchestra and violinist. As the music settles, the final section begins with the superposition of both the opening theme and the funeral theme. As the piece ends, the violin plays sublime trills which can also be heard in Chausson's Po√®me. Po√®me √©l√©giaque shows a mixture of influences including elements of Wagner and the Franckist group of composers, especially Faur√©. This poem provided Ysa√øe with a new freedom of expression and is one of the absolute high points of the repertoire. == References == Category:Compositions by Eug√®ne Ysa√øe Category:Compositions for violin and orchestra Category:1892 compositions ","title":"Po√®me √©l√©giaque in D minor, Op.12 (Ysa√øe)"},{"id":"54217986","text":"Microbacterium yannicii is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, microaerophilic and non-motile bacterium from the genus of Microbacterium which has been isolated from roots of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in Golm in Germany. == References == Category:Bacteria described in 2012 Category:Micrococcineae ","title":"Microbacterium yannicii"},{"id":"54218011","text":"Door (Urdu: ÿØŸàÿ±, literal English translation: \\"far\\") is the eighth studio album and twentieth overall album by the Pakistani rock band Junoon.

Three people died as a result of the incident, and at least 1,672 people were injured. ==Stampede== The incident occurred at approximately 10:30 p.m. local time, about 10 minutes before the end of the match, when panic erupted among those at Piazza San Carlo, leading to a stampede. During the panic, a railing of stairs leading to an underground parking garage gave way, causing additional injuries. Although the panic was initially thought to be caused by the noise of firecrackers, it was later determined to be caused by a robbery attempt of shooting pepper spray into the crowd to steal valuables among the public, and someone shouting that a bomb had gone off may have fueled the panic. ==Casualties== At least 1,672 people were injured, including seven who were seriously injured. On 15 June, less than two weeks after the stampede, a 38-year-old woman, Erika Pioletti, died in hospital of her sustained injuries. Another woman, Marisa Amato, became tetraplegic and eventually died in hospital on 25 January 2019. A man, Anthony Bucci, died on 31 January 2020, in hospital after two years of battling with an amputated foot. ==Reactions and investigations== Some older Juventus fans said the stampede had evoked painful memories of the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, when 39 fans, mostly Juventus supporters from Italy, were crushed against a collapsing wall in Brussels, Belgium, before the start of the 1985 European Cup Final between Juventus and Liverpool. In November 2017, the Prosecutor Office of Turin started a formal investigation involving around twenty suspects, included the mayor Chiara Appendino and the police chief Angelo Sanna. On 13 April 2018, eight people were arrested on charges of triggering mass panic to commit a robbery using pepper spray. One of them confessed the crime. The suspects were identified by telephone interceptions, in one of which a gold necklace stolen in the event was mentioned. On 14 May 2019, the victims of the tragedy were commemorated with a plaque in the piazza.

He was the 38th hereditary chieftain of the Nanbu clan. His courtesy title was Shinano-no-kami (later Sash≈çsh≈ç), and his Court rank was Junior 4th Rank, Lower Grade. ==Biography== Toshitada was the second son of the disinherited Nanbu Toshinori, the eldest son of the 8th daimy≈ç of Morioka, Nanbu Toshikatsu. His mother was a commoner and a widow, and there were later allegations that he may not have been of Nanbu blood at all. In any event, on the death of his father in 1814, he went into the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ Buddhist priesthood. He returned to secular life in 1820 by order of the domain government and served as advisor to the young Nanbu Toshimochi, who subsequently appointed him as heir. Toshimochi was of poor health and died in 1825, so in accordance with his wishes, Toshitada became daimy≈ç of Morioka. He was received in formal audience by Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienari who awarded him with the courtesy title of Shinano-no-kami and junior 4th court rank, lower grade. In 1827, he was promoted to the honorary title of Jij≈´ (Chamberlain). Toshitada implemented a wide range of fiscal improvements, sponsored new industries and took steps to improve the domain's military forces. His quick actions and the poor state of the domain's finances caused much disaffection among his retainers and also led to a peasant revolt in 1836. In 1839, he was promoted to the higher courtesy title of Sash≈çsh≈ç and in 1841 opened a han school. However, the domain erupted into widespread revolt against his rule in 1847. In 1848, he stepped down in favor of his son Nanbu Toshitomo; however, relations between father and son were very strained at best, and Toshitada continued to intervene and interfere in domain politics after his retirement. He then forced his son aside in 1848, making Toshitomo‚Äôs younger brother Nanbu Toshihisa nominal daimy≈ç while he continued to rule in all but name. This led to another widespread revolt in 1854, which caused the Tokugawa shogunate to intervene. He was placed under house arrest at the clan‚Äôs Edo shimoyashiki, where he died a few months later on 29 May 1855. ==Family== * Father: Nanbu Toshinori * Mother: Oyone no Kata (Seikan-in) * Wife: Masako, adopted daughter of Nanbu Toshitaka, daughter of Matsudaira Terunobu of Takasaki Domain * Concubine: Retsuko (from the Narayama clan) **1st son; Nanbu Toshitomo, daimy≈ç of Morioka **3rd son: Nanbu Toshihisa, daimy≈ç of Morioka ==NotesReferences== *Papinot, Edmond (1948).

Pachlingeshwara Temple ==Tourism== Panchalingeshwara Temple (also spelt Panchalingeshvara) in Govindanahalli, Mandya district, Karnataka state, India, was constructed around 1238 A.D. during the reign of the Hoysala empire King Vira Someshwara. The name \\"Panchalingeshwara\\" literally means \\"five linga\\" (pancha - five and linga - the universal symbol of the god Shiva). The temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. The famous sculptor of Hoysala times, Ruvari Mallitamma, is known to have made contributions to the temple. According to art historian Gerard Foekema, the Panchalingeshwara temple is a rare example of a panchakuta (lit, five shrines with five towers) construction in Hoysala architecture.Foekema (1996), p.25 The five shrines are built on a north-south axial plan with the sanctums face east. In each shrine, the sanctum (garbhagriha) is connected to a hall (mantapa or navaranga) by a vestibule (sukanasi). A long pillared hall on the east connects the individual mantapa together. The entrance to the temple complex is via two porched entrances whose ceiling are supported by lathe turned pillars. Irrespective of the number of shrines in the complex, these are standard features in Hoysala temples.Foekema (1996), pp.21-25Brown in Kamath (2001), pp.134-136 The porches are located in front of the second and third shrines. The decoration (articulation) on the outer walls of the shrines (vimana) is modest and comprises miniature decorative towers (aedicula) on pilasters. The wall panel of images between the eave and the base moldings (adhisthana) include some depictions from the Hindu epics. According to Gerard Foekema, this form of treatment is common to Hoysala art.Foekema (1996), pp.28-29 The tower over each shrine (shikhara) comprises the standard three tiers of roofs with each vertically ascending tier diminishing in height. Above this is a structure called the stupi that holds the finial, a decorative water-pot like structure called the Kalasha.Foekema (2001), pp.27-28 The vestibule of each shrine has a low protruding tower (also called sukanasi). This tower is shorter than the main tower over the shrine and hence appears like an extension of it. Gerard Foekema calls it the \\"nose\\" of the main tower.Foekema (1996), p.22 The inner walls of the each mantapa have seventeen niches many of which house sculptures of merit. ==Image gallery== File:Govindanahalli (2).jpgThe village main road File:Govindanahalli (1).jpgGovernment School File:Govindanahalli (8).jpgGovindanahalli Village File:Govindanahalli (7).jpgThe second temple File:Govindanahalli (5).jpgView of the temple from the east File:Govindanahalli (6).jpgVillage vegetation == See also == * Kikkeri * Panchalingeshwara Temple, Govindanahalli * Holenarasipura ==References== *Gerard Foekema, A Complete Guide to Hoysala Temples, Abhinav, 1996 ** * *Adam Hardy, Indian Temple Architecture: Form and Transformation : the Kar·πáƒÅ·π≠a DrƒÅvi·∏ça Tradition, 7th to 13th Centuries, Abhinav, 1995 . * * Category:Villages in Mandya district ","title":"Govindanahalli"},{"id":"54218073","text":"Arthur LaRue Parker (November 16, 1885 ‚Äì January 1, 1945) was an American businessman and inventor, known for founding Parker Hannifin Corporation (then known as Parker Appliance Company).

The scholiasts credit Dymas with another son, named Otreus, who fought the Amazons a generation before the Trojan War. The father of Phrygian Dymas is given as one Eioneus, son of Proteus, by some ancient mythographersScholia on Euripides, Hecuba 3. Dymas's wife is given as Euno√´, a daughter of the river god Sangarius.Scholia on Homer's Iliad 16. 718 with Pherecydes as the authority In fact, Dymas and his Phrygian subjects are closely connected to the River Sangarius, which empties into the Black Sea. According to Dictys, he was a descendant of Phoenix, son of Agenor, as recounted by Helen to Hecuba to prove their kinship.Dictys Cretensis. Trojan War Chronicle 1.9 The etymology of the name Dymas is obscure, although it is probably non-Hellenic.

It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ==Acquisition== This work was acquired as part of the initial purchase in 1871 of 174 paintings bought in Europe by William Tilden Blodgett, one of the museum's initial donors and trustees. It is signed and dated Margareta Haverman fecit / A 1716.Cat. no. 72 in Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art Volume I, by Walter Liedtke, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2007 Little is known of Haverman besides the biography of her written by Jan van Gool. The only other work signed by her is in the Statens Museum for Kunst. In 1997 Delia Gaze remarked that this work was sold for 2100 francs to the MET and its pendant (now lost) was sold for 2050 francs.Haverman's MET painting in Delia Gaze's Dictionary of Women Artists Blodgett must be credited with investing in the art of a woman, even if he let the pendant get away. Later curators must also be credited with keeping it, as only half of the 174 paintings are still in the collection. ==Description and interpretation== The work shows blooms of rosa √ó centifolia, dianthus, alcea rosea, calendula officinalis, passiflora, primula, poppy, tulip, forget-me-nots, the fruits peach and grape, and various insects such as a Red Admiral, fly, ants, and a snail. The vase itself is an object showing a baroque relief. The painting follows in a tradition of Dutch and Flemish flower still life paintings showing flowers in a vase with insects. This was popular among Dutch women painters of Haverman's time whose works she would have been familiar with, as evidenced by the forged signature of Rachel Ruysch on a painting by Ottmar Elliger in the popular flowers in a vase on a ledge with insects style. This painting had been in the famous collection of Josephus Augustinus Brentano and was later purchased by Adriaan van der Hoop as by Ruysch.Stilleven met bloemen, 1673, Amsterdam Museum catalog The painting illustrates the model the women worked from, as well as the relative value of Ruysch's work over that of Elliger later in the 18th-century. Haverman was registered as a pupil of the flower painter Jan van Huysum, who was known for guarding his secrets and keeping his painting knowledge in the family. This work shows the influence of Van Huysum in its \\"niche\\" setting.

The government has proposed to build the port on the coast of the Bay of Bengal near Tajpur. ==History == West Bengal's main port is Kolkata Port (including Haldia Port), but because of the shallow depth of the Hooghly river, it is impossible to anchor ocean-going vessels there. As a result, shipping growth is declining. Commodities in Kolkata and Asansol-Durgapur industrial region are instead taken to Paradip port. The future of the state's port industry and the Haldia industrial region is uncertain and, for this reason, the state government decided to act. == Design == The Tajpur Port is proposed to be a large deep sea port. Land for the port will be created by plowing along the sea coast. The depth of the harbor will be 15 meters, which will accommodate large ships. An 18-kilometer channel will be constructed from the sea. Six berths are to be built in the first phase followed by an additional nine berths. By separating it from the coast, beaches are not expected to be impacted. Each terminal will be multipurpose. It is estimated that the construction of the guntor will require 16 thousands crores. The first phase is 10 thousand crore and the second phase is 6 thousand crores. Construction is expected to provide 10 thousand jobs. In January 2019, the state decided to develop the port on its own, as the Centre had done \\"nothing\\" to start work on the project in the prior three years. ==References == Category:Ports and harbours of West Bengal Category:Purba Medinipur district Category:Proposed ports in India ","title":"Tajpur Port"},{"id":"54218594","text":"kabel eins classics is a German pay-tv channel owned by ProSiebenSat.1 Media.

The series features Martin Shaw as the eponymous Inspector, Lee Ingleby as Detective Sergeant John Bacchus, and Simon Hubbard and Lisa McGrillis in supporting roles as police constables for the fictitious North East Police Constabulary. The series is notable for moving the setting of the stories to North East England, centering on Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland and County Durham, as opposed to the Norfolk, as portrayed in the books. As the series begins, the death penalty is still in effect in Britain, and is used as a plot feature in some early episodes. The abolition of the penalty in 1965 is a change that is noted in the series. The earliest episodes are set in 1964, and the series progresses in approximately real time, with the closing scenes of the eighth series taking place in 1970. ==Series 1 (2007)1 \\"Gently Go Man\\" Euros Lyn.

Its formation was announced on 31 March 2017. According to the group, their goals were to defend the social revolution in Rojava in northern Syria, and spread anarchism. The group announced its dissolution on 24 September 2018.https://twitter.com/IRPGF/status/1044124788833353728 The IRPGF are part of the International Freedom Battalion since April 2017. Turkish media have described them as a terrorist organization and part of the network of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party. == Formation == The IRPGF were created on 31 March 2017 with the purpose of defending the Revolution of Rojava and collaborating with the People's Protection Units and the Kurdistan Workers' Party against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. They also intend to advance anarchism in the Syrian region of Rojava and, according to them, to defend \\"social revolutions and social struggles\\" all over the world. The announcement was broadcast on video by the IRPGF in social networks along with a written statement specifying their objectives. In the video one can see several guerrilla fighters with their faces covered, carrying AK-47 rifles, RPG-7 rocket launchers, Soviet PK machine guns and explosives. In the same video a fighter reads a statement; behind him are flags of the IFB. A black flag with the enclosed A, an Antifascist Action flag and the Red and Black flag.  Ideology  The guerrillas' ideology was anarchist communism. Among its objectives was to defend the Rojava Revolution against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the different jihadist groups of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army, and the Turkish occupation in Syria. The fighters say that their objectives are not constrained to Rojava, but they also have intentions to help in the struggles and social revolutions around the world. They also adhere to horizontal principles in their organization and \\"the struggle against all kinds of oppression\\" such as sexism, racism and classism, abolition of the State, capitalism and patriarchy. == Affiliation == The group was a part of the International Freedom Battalion since April 2017, and they are the second anarchist group to join after the Greek unit RUIS. They participate frequently in the campaign activities of the brigade in social networks. On 29 May, the IRPGF issued a statement in tribute to the commander of the United Freedom Forces Mehmet Kurnaz (Ula≈ü Bayraktaroglu), who was killed in combat on the Raqqa Front while fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. They define him as a true friend of IRPGF. On the 31st of the same month, the IRPGF sent representatives and speakers to the City of Derek (Canton of Ciz√Ær√™) at the funeral ceremony to four martyrs of the International Freedom Battalion and the People's Protection Units, Mehmet Kurnaz (Ula≈ü Bayraktaroglu) commander of the United Freedom Forces, Muzaffer Kandemir (fighter) of the United Freedom Forces, El√Æ Mihemed Mizil (≈û√™r Zagros) and Nimet T√ªr√ªg (Baran Cudi) of the People's Protection Units. == Armed struggle and involvement in the Syrian Civil War== Their public presence was confirmed at multiple martyr ceremonies in Rojava over 2017. Having fought alongside with the three most recent martyrs of the International Freedom Battalion, they were present at the funeral ceremonies for DKP leader and United Freedom Forces (B√ñG) commander Ula≈ü Bayraktaroƒülu, Tufan Eroƒüluer (Hasan Ali) from B√ñG and Ay≈üe Deniz Karacagil (Destan Temmuz) from MLKP. == The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army == TQILA in Raqqa On 24 July 2017, the IRPGF announced from Raqqa City the formation of The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army (TQILA), along with a statement explaining the purposes of its formation in which the response to persecution of LGBT persons by ISIL is highlighted as one of the main motivations of the group. The testimonial image of its formation, in which fighters posed alongside a sign with the motto \\"These faggots kill fascists\\" and two flags ‚Äì one belonging to the recent group and an LGBT flag ‚Äì that was quickly made viral by several western media that, surprised by the unit's creation, echoed the event with large repercussions. The recent unit, like the rest of the IRPGF, was a member of the International Freedom Battalion, in one of the testimonial photos is sighted Heval Mahirnota, commander of the International Freedom Battalion, and the Marxist-Leninist guerrilla TKP/ML Tƒ∞KKO, holding the LGBT flag. Despite being part of the International Freedom Battalion several media erroneously reported that TQILA could be an official unit of the Syrian Democratic Forces which caused confusion. Following the impact of this mistaken information Mustafa Bali, media director of the SDF, denied such information alleging that there is an LGBT brigade within the coalition, but does not deny the existence of the same which, indeed, belongs to the International Freedom Battalion. == Interviews == The IRPGF has conducted major interviews with Middle East Eye, CrimethInc., Enough is Enough, Insurrection News and Rojava Solidarity NYC == Gallery == IRPGF in Raqqa city 1.pngAnother photo of IRPGF fighters in the Raqqa campaign IFB members at Destan Temmuz burial in Koban√™.pngFighters of IRPGF and IFB at the burial of Destan Temmuz, an MLKP fighter.

An extension exhibiting the same architectural features was opened by the Duke of Connaught in November 1907. The 8th Lancashire Rifle Volunteer Corps evolved to become the 1st Volunteer Battalion, the Lancashire Fusiliers in 1883 and the 5th Battalion, the Lancashire Fusiliers in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at the armoury in September 1914 before being deployed to the Suez Canal, then to Gallipoli and ultimately to the Western Front. The armoury remained the home of the 5th battalion, the Lancashire Fusiliers through the inter-war period. A major fire took hold at the armoury in January 1943 during the Second World War, in which a fireman died and the building was seriously damaged, and it was not until summer 1952 that the restoration was complete. After the war the armoury continued to be used by the 5th battalion the Lancashire Fusiliers until the battalion was disbanded in 1967. The armoury was then used by a company of the 5th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, a unit which evolved following amalgamations to become the Lancastrian and Cumbrian Volunteers in July 1999 and 4th Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment in July 2006. The armoury remains an active Army Reserve Centre for use by a detachment of 207 Field Hospital and a small contingent from the now reformed 5th Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, alongside Bury Detachment of the Army Cadet Force and 1036 (Bury) Squadron of the Air Training Corps.

Alights on the Cloud was in the leading party of warriors in an attack on a hunting camp of Pawnee foes in what is now Kansas. He is known for riding into battle in an unusual sort of metal armor hidden under his war shirt, which stopped the arrows of the Pawnee. Alights on the Cloud developed a reputation of being safe from all harm, until one of the Pawnee (Shield Chief) took out an old, sacred bow and arrow and managed to shoot him in the eye. The killing of Alights on the Cloud was a serious loss to the Cheyenne, and one of the factors leading to the war with the Pawnee the next summer, which was one of only six such all-out campaigns during the 19th century. Some of the Kiowa people who fought alongside the Cheyenne recorded the killing of Alights on the Cloud in their winter count. The Pawnee remembered and passed on the story of the defeat in a song. Cheyenne warrior Alights on the Cloud in his armor. Many Kiowa people joined the Cheyenne in an attack on the Pawnee in 1852. The branch with leaves over his head indicates that this took place in summer. ==Alights on the Cloud and his armor== Alights on the Cloud received his armor from his father, Medicine Water. Many years before, Medicine Water had bought it from a young Arapaho for a number of horses. This Arapaho had some time earlier exchanged a mule for the armor during a trading expedition to Mexico.Hyde, George E. (1987): Life of George Bent. Written From His Letters. Norman. The origin of the armor is unknown. Many small iron scales, the size of a half-dollar, protected the wearer of this seemingly otherwise regular leather shirt against arrows and maybe even bullets. An iron cap with a flap covered the neck. Medicine Water himself had used the mailed shirt during a large-scale attack on the Kiowa, the Kiowa Apache and the Comanche at Wolf Creek in Oklahoma in 1838. Alights on the Cloud bore it covered by a scarlet blanket during an open fight with some well-armed Delaware Indians in 1844 and turned the battle into victory. ==The attack on the Pawnee hunters== Map with the 1851 Cheyenne and Arapaho territory, the settlements by the Pawnee and the possible area of the battlefield in 1852. The Pawnee were in camp somewhere in what is now western Kansas on their summer bison hunt.Murie, James R. (1981): Ceremonies of the Pawnee. Part II. The South Bands. Washington. A combined force of Cheyennes and invited Kiowa and Kiowa Apaches attacked a large contingent of Pawnee hunters to achieve war honors and capture horses. Some Arapaho and Lakota friends of the Cheyenne may have joined.Mooney, James (1898): \\"Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians\\". Seventeenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology. Part I. Washington. Alights on the Cloud rode in the advanced party of warriors. Protected by his covered armor he charged the Pawnee. According to the Pawnee, he attacked with a sword. The stiffness of the armor prevented him from using other weapons.Densmore, Frances (1929): Pawnee Music. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 93. Washington The hunters retreated, recklessly followed by Alights on the Cloud. \\"The Pawnee were unable to explain the fearlessness of this man and talked of it among themselves.\\" A young Pitahawirata Pawnee, named variously Shield Chief and Carrying the Shield, was the keeper of a sacred bundle with an old bow and a red arrow. His father had told him to use them in times of great danger. Armed with the sacred weapons from the bundle he went to the battlefield on foot. The Pawnee fled from the enemies, while Shield Chief advanced. When Alights on the Cloud attacked him, he released the arrow and hit the Cheyenne in the eye. The Pawnee rushed forward to Alights on the Cloud. They cut up his body and discovered the armor. Consequently, the Pawnees know Alights on the Cloud as Iron Shirt. During the fight a number of Pawnee were also killed, along with six more Cheyenne and one of the Kiowa Apache. ==After the battle== The Pawnee captured a part of the armored shirt. The Cheyenne secured the remainder and kept it for many years until they hid it in a hole in the ground. To avenge the killing of Alights on the Cloud and the other warriors, the Cheyenne carried their Sacred Arrows against the Pawnee the next year. The arrows are known as the Mahuts, and they are four and sacred arrows used in ceremonies where political decisions are made. Only six such \\"moves of the Sacred Arrows\\" or campaigns of all-out war are recorded in the entire history of the Cheyenne. They \\"were defeated with great loss.\\"Grinnell, George Bird: \\"The Great Mysteries of the Cheyenne.\\" American Anthropologist. New Series. Vol. 12, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec. 1910), pp. 542-575.

The modification allowed the gun to shoot from Koekelare to Dunkirk, which is about 50 km away. ==Location== Batterie Pommern is located in Koekelare in the neighborhood called Leugenboom. It is part of Site Lange Max, next to the Lange Max Museum. Today, the immense artillery platform can still be visited. ==Construction== The 15inch (38 cm) long range gun, protected by armour, was mounted on a steel bridge having a pivot in front. The rear part of the gun travelled along a circular rail-track in a concrete pit of about 70 feet in diameter. The gun was manoeuvred by means of electric motors. On either side were large shelters in reinforced concrete. In front of and below the platform there was an electric generator group. A large shelter of reinforced concrete on the right was probably the Post of Commandment. There was a dummy gun emplacement further on. ==History== On 27 June 1917 the gun fired for the first time. Its target was Dunkirk where the first shot was a direct hit. Dunkirk and Ypres were the main targets of the gun.

[Lawyer-Soldier: Memories of the War.] Amsterdam: Van Soeren & Co.  1946-1947 Prosecutor of Japanese war criminals  After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, Damst√© was reunited with his family in Jakarta in November 1945. He became administrator of the Cikini Hospital in Jakarta until May 1946. The Dutch colonial government selected him in March 1946 for the position of assistant prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo, which prosecuted Japanese war criminals.Het Dagblad (30 March 1946). For that purpose Damst√© was appointed lieutenant colonel in the colonial army (Royal Netherlands East Indies Army). His task was to research and coordinate the Dutch indictment against Japanese war crimes in Indonesia, together with lawyer Klaas Abel de Weerd (1904‚Äì1987).NIOD-Instituut voor Oorlogs-, Holocaust- en Genocidestudies (Amsterdam), 402 International Military Tribunal for the Far East, 1.1.2. Nederlandse delegatie ‚Äì interne en externe contacten, https://www.archieven.nl/ The tribunal lasted until November 1948, but Damst√©‚Äôs tenure ended in February 1947 after the Dutch indictment had been delivered.  1947‚Äì1954 President of business associations  Upon his return to Jakarta, Damst√© was demobilised and appointed President of the General Agricultural Syndicate (Algemeen Landbouw Syndicaat, ALS), an organisation of large agricultural companies in Indonesia.Het Dagblad (20 February 1947). One of the pressing issues he dealt with was the unsafety that plantation managers in rural areas experienced after estates resumed operations following the first Dutch military action in July 1947. The plantations were under regular attack from gangs of Indonesian nationalists and also outright criminals. As police and military were unable ‚Äì or unwilling, according to Damst√© ‚Äì to prevent the killings of Indonesian plantation personnel, he worked to organise a solution that took the form of armed enterprise militia.Sinninghe Damst√© 1999: 238; Frakking, Roel (2011) Het Middel Erger dan de Kwaal: De Opkomst en Ondergang van de Ondernemingswacht in Nederlands-Indi√´, 1946‚Äì1950 [A cure worse than the Ailment: The rise and decline of the enterprise militia in the Netherlands Indies, 1946‚Äì1950]. MA sub-thesis, University of Utrecht. As ALS President, Damst√© took a seat on the board of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Indonesia (Ondernemersbond voor Indonesi√´, OBI), which had been without an executive President and Chairman since the resignation of Carel de Villeneuve in January 1947. After establishing his reputation as ALS President, Damst√© was appointed interim OBI President in April 1948, and then full-time OBI President and chairman of the OBI board in September 1948. Unlike his predecessor as OBI President, Damst√© did not have a public profile and remained somewhat of an enigma to outsiders. The difference between the two was that Damst√© had been a practising lawyer in the 1930s, while De Villeneuve had been a representative of the private sector during the 1930s and an outspoken member of parliament (Volksraad) during 1938‚Äì1942. The OBI records reveal that Damst√© was diligent and meticulous in carrying out the duties of OBI President, in terms of his communications to OBI members and representing the views of private enterprise on policy matters to governments in Indonesia and to government departments.Nationaal Archief (The Hague), 2.21.308 Inventaris van het archief van J.S. Sinninghe Damst√© [voorzitter Ondernemersbond voor Nederlands-Indi√´, later Indonesi√´], (1947) 1949‚Äì1955. As OBI President, he secured OBI‚Äôs material support for the enterprise militia that he had helped to create in 1947. Like his predecessor De Villeneuve, Damst√© was supportive of the Indonesian call for independence, understanding that the tide of history was on the side of Indonesian people.Sinninghe Damst√© 1999: 238‚Äì241. His understanding of his task as OBI President was to safeguard the interests of private enterprise, both in the interest of the Indonesian economy, as well as the companies themselves. Nevertheless, in 1948 Damst√© was appointed chairman of the committee for financial-economic issues of the association of Indonesian states.Sinninghe Damst√© 1999: 242‚Äì243. It prepared the blueprint for the Financial-Economic Agreement between the Netherlands and Indonesia that was signed in December 1949. In essence, Damst√©‚Äôs perception of OBI‚Äôs role continued to be that the private sector had to be loyal to Indonesia‚Äôs government, but not uncritical, and that OBI‚Äôs purpose continued to be to safeguard private sector interests, both in the interest of the Indonesian economy and society, and the companies themselves.Sinninghe Damst√© 1999: 247, 250. On occasion, Damst√© aired views in public as OBI President during public speeches or press conferences. For example, in a speech in the Netherlands in 1952, he pointed to reservations among companies in Indonesia about the capabilities of new Indonesian government, and mentioned that the recovery plans of Minister of Finance Sumitro had come under criticism.De Vrije Pers (19 September 1952); De Nieuwsgier (24 September 1952); Sinninghe Damst√©, J.S. (1952) ‚ÄòDe positie van de ondernemer in Indonesi√´‚Äô [The position of the entrepreneur in Indonesia], Maatschappijbelangen: Maandblad van de Nederlandsche Maatschappij voor Nijverheid en Handel, 116: 257‚Äì261. Indonesian newspaper Pedoman rebuked his views, noting that recent government policies were directed against the ‚Äòmonopoly position‚Äô of Dutch enterprises in the Indonesian economy.De Vrije Pers (24 September 1952). Damst√© organised and chaired the Foundation for Dutch Education (Stichting voor het Nederlands Onderwijs) in Jakarta.Sinninghe Damst√© 1999: 248‚Äì249. It was established in 1950 to sustain Dutch-language education at 110 private schools across Indonesia, in order to encourage Dutch expatriates to continue to work in private enterprise in Indonesia.De Tijd (16 February 1955); Meijer, Hans (2006) ‚Äò‚ÄúDweilen met de kraan open‚Äù: De Stichting Nederlands Onderwijs in Indonesi√´, 1950‚Äì1961‚Äô [Mopping up with the tap running: The Foundation for Dutch Language Education in Indonesia, 1950‚Äì1961], Leidschrift, 21(2) 109‚Äì135. No interviews with Damst√© were published that provided public insights in his activities and his motivation during his OBI Presidency. Even at his farewell in June 1955, newspapers could only report the barest minimum of Damst√©‚Äôs biographical information.Java Bode (4 June 1955). This lack of public profile suited Damst√©‚Äôs next career choice after OBI members dissolve the association in 1954 in favour of a new Dutch Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia.  1955‚Äì1967 (Deputy) Head of the Netherlands Security Service  In April 1955 Damst√© accepted an offer to become deputy head of the Netherlands Security Service (Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst, BVD) and he returned to the Netherlands. In April 1961 he succeeded Louis Einthoven as Head of the BVD. Little is known about Dams's work at the BVD, as the organisation eschewed public interaction about its work. Much of it was in the 1950s and 1960s focused on monitoring and analysing political operations at both far ends of the Dutch political spectrum. Following the internationalisation of the interests of the Communist Party of the Netherlands (Communistische Partij Nederland, CPN), particularly CPN support for the Soviet Union during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Damst√© arranged in the early 1960s for the BVD to develop a better understanding of the international dimensions of communism.Braat, Eleni (2012) Van Oude Jongens, De Dingen die Voorbij Gaan... Een Sociale Geschiedenis van de Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst 1945-1998 [Of old fellows, the matters that pass... A social history of the Dutch Internal Security Service 1945-1998]. (Zoetermeer: Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst) 112-113. Internally, Damst√© sought to lower the existing thresholds in the BVD between superiors and subordinates in order to encourage more constructive contributions from subordinates in the security service.Braat 2012: 175. Externally, the BVD experienced increasing criticism in Dutch newspapers and parliament for its secrecy, covert monitoring of Dutch citizens and intransparent involvement in screening public service appointments.E.g. De Telegraaf (30 March 1962). Damst√©‚Äôs response was: ‚ÄòThe dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.‚ÄôBraat 2012: 187, 192-193. In other words, his view was that the BVD had to focus on its operations, and that there was no need for concern or response. One of the secret investigations that Damst√© was in 1965 into the antecedents of the future fianc√© of the Dutch crown princess Beatrix, the German Claus Georg von Amsberg.Trouw (23 March 2003); Brouwer, Jan Willem (2013) ‚ÄòRondom ‚ÄòHet Huwelijk‚Äô: Uit het dagboek van premier Cals, 1965-1966‚Äô [About ‚ÄòThe Wedding‚Äô: From the diary of prime minister Casl, 1985-1966] in Carla van Baalen et al. (eds.) Jaarboek Parlementaire Geschiedenis 2013. (Amsterdam: Boom) 123-135 (p.125). The only exception to the rule of BVD secrecy was Damst√©‚Äôs 1964 response to public criticism of the BVD expressed by a committee of the Association of Academic Researchers (Verbond van Wetenschappelijke Onderzoekers) in the Netherlands in its journal Wetenschap en Samenleving (December 1963). This report assessed the purpose and procedures of secret BVD investigations into the political antecedents for appointments to public office, particularly at Dutch universities.Algemeen Handelsblad (25 January 1964) In a personal capacity, Damst√© published a reply in the journal, suggesting that the committee‚Äôs reference to ‚Äòradicals‚Äô referred to people with communist sympathies.Sinninghe Damst√©, J.S. (1964) ‚Äò‚ÄòHet politieke- antecedentenonderzoek‚Äô [The investigation into political antecedents], Wetenschap en Samenleving (June‚ÄìJuly 1964); Aanhangsel Handelingen Tweede Kamer 1964-1965, no.15. This issue continued to follow Damst√© around. In 1967 he still had to deny that the BVD investigated the political antecedents of academics at Dutch universities.Vrij Nederland (21 October 1967). He retired from the BVD in September 1967. == Personal, family, honours and death == There are few observations of Damst√©‚Äôs personality. In 1930 a journalist described him thus: ‚ÄòSinninghe Damst√© has a calm appearance, balanced and controlled. He speaks in a thoughtful and well-considered manner.‚ÄôIndische Courant (27 June 1930). His memoires of the 1940s also reveal Damst√© as a calm observer, unflappable despite personal hardship, unimpressed by posturing, intolerant of inconsistency and gibberish, analysing issues by dissecting them to their essence, and reporting them in a matter of fact and un-emotive manner.Sinninghe Damst√© 1999: 242-243. Damst√© married Johanna Philippine Aletta Greebe (1898‚Äì1935) in Surabaya on 16 February 1928. They had two sons; Willem ‚ÄòPim‚Äô (1931-2008) and Cornelis Aleidus Arnoldus Johannes ‚ÄòHans‚Äô (1933‚Äì1989). Greebe died at a young age in 1935Soerabaijasch Handelsblad (20 July 1935). Damst√© remarried during his second furlough to Europe with Maria Eleonora ‚ÄòMiep‚Äô Overbosch (1912‚Äì1990) in Arnhem on 17 September 1938.Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi√´ (17 December 1937); Leeuwarder Courant (19 September 1938). They had one son; Dick (1938).Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (16 September 1939). Damst√© was appointed Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion (Ridder in de Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw) in 1951Nieuwe Courant (28 April 1951) and Commander of the Order of the Netherlands Lion (Commandeur in de Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw) in 1968Nieuwsblad van het Noorden (29 April 1968). In retirement, Damst√© initially lived in The Hague 1967-1978, and subsequently in Southern Spain, particularly in San Pedro de Alcantara. He died in Guadalmina (Spain) on 14 May 1995. In 1986, he self-published his memoires of his experiences during the 1940s. His son Pim organised for them to be posthumously re-published.Sinninghe Damst√© 1999. ==References== Category:1902 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Dutch civil servants Category:Indonesian lawyers Category:Dutch expatriates in Indonesia Category:Dutch lawyers Category:20th-century Dutch East Indies people Category:People from Leeuwarden Category:University of Groningen alumni Category:Knights of the Order of the Netherlands Lion Category:Commanders of the Order of the Netherlands Lion Category:World War II civilian prisoners held by Japan Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Koos Sinninghe Damst√©"},{"id":"54218846","text":"Allepipona schultzeana is a species of wasp in the family Vespidae.

In 1835, he was received in formal audience by Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienari and was subsequently conferred with the courtesy title of Kai-no-kami, and Court rank of Junior 4th Rank, Lower Grade, and his name was changed to . After widespread peasant revolts occurred in Morioka Domain in 1836 and 1847, largely in protest to economic policies and food shortages, Toshitada went into voluntary retirement, and Toshitomo nominally became the new daimy≈ç. However, Toshitomo was ordered to remain at the domain residence in Edo instead of making the usual sankin-k≈çtai journey to Morioka, and the domain continued to be administered by the kar≈ç and other influential samurai who answered only to his father. After around a year, sentiment against Toshitada had died down somewhat in Morioka, so Toshitomo was forced into retirement, and replaced by his more pliable younger brother Nanbu Toshihisa. Toshitomo was very angry with this situation, especially as the policies which had resulted in widespread revolts were continued, and the samurai of the domain split into factions supporting either the son or the father. Relations between the two were so bad that at one point a retainer of Toshitada attempted to kill Toshitomo by poisoning. In 1849, he changed his name to . As Toshitomo had predicted, another widespread revolt occurred in the Nanbu domains against Toshitada in 1853. The situation was so dire that the Tokugawa shogunate was forced to intervene directly. The r≈çj≈´ Abe Masahiro placed Toshitada under house arrest, where he died a year later. However, Toshitomo was also found culpable of inciting the insurrection, and was confined to a single room within this own house. The same year, he changed his name once again, this time to Nanbu Toshitomo. Toshitomo remained in Edo through the remainder of the Bakumatsu period, and only visited Morioka as a private citizen after the Meiji Restoration. ==References== *Papinot, Edmond. (1948).

Both of his parents were doctors who worked at a mission hospital in Shanghai. In 1911, the family moved to Fuzhou, Fujian. He was sent to a local private primary school at the age of 7, then he attended then Ko-Chih High School at the age of 13. Despite his father's objections, Zhang sought to transfer to Shanghai, spending the last year of high school in there. Soon afterwards he was admitted to Fukien Christian University. After completing his first year, he transferred to Faculty of Agriculture, University of Nanking. Upon graduation Zhang returned to Fukien Christian University as a lecturer. Supported by the university, he surveyed tea cultivation and processing in Japan and then Taiwan under Japanese rule between 1934 and 1935. Later, he established and headed a vocational college of agriculture along with a tea intensive breeding base in Fu'an. In 1936, he introduced the tea processing machines from Japan, facilitating the automation of the domestic tea industry. From 1942 to 1944, he resumed teaching at Fukien Christian University. Then he took over the leadership of the National Tea Research Institute in Chong'an county. ==Personal life== In the 1950s, Zhang was transferred to Fuzhou. He was targeted at the start of the Anti-Rightist Movement and subsequently was exiled to Chong'an until 1962. The Cultural Revolution followed, and Zhang was exiled to Shouning. Despite his exile, Zhang continued scientific research. He was rehabilitated in 1980. He finished a monograph on oolong by the 1990s. Zhang's first wife died in the early 1990s.

Edith Sarah Louisa Boulton (1847 - November 14, 1912) was a Canadian philanthropist and imperialist. The daughter of James Boulton, a barrister, and Margaret Neilina Fortye, she was born in Toronto. Her grandfather D‚ÄôArcy Boulton had been attorney-general for Upper Canada. In 1871, Boulton married Toronto businessman Samuel Nordheimer; the couple had eight daughters and three sons. She contributed to various Toronto institutions including the Infants' Home, the Hillcrest Convalescent Hospital, the Ladies' Work Depository, the Working Boys' Home, the Children's Aid Society and St. James‚Äô Cathedral. Boulton also served on the board of governors for the Victorian Order of Nurses, was president of the local Red Cross Society and helped found the Female Immigrants Receiving Home. In 1904, she became vice-president of the Toronto South African Memorial Association. The Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire (IODE) was established in Toronto in 1901 by a group of Ontario women with Boulton serving as its national president. The Federation of the Daughters of the Empire had been founded in Montreal the previous year but it was later decided to relocate the head office and change the name of the organization. The aim of the IODE was to promote closer ties between Canada and the British Empire. Boulton was a skilled organizer even if somewhat autocratic by nature; under her leadership the organization grew to 10,000 members with chapters across Canada and in the United States, The Bahamas, Bermuda, the Dominion of Newfoundland and India. After dissatisfaction with a delegation sent to England to attend the coronation of George V, she resigned as president in 1911 but was named patroness of the order the following year. The couple lived in a 35-room mansion known as Glen Edyth, once considered \\"the finest private house in Toronto\\" but since demolished to allow the construction of new homes, which was located on a 25-acre estate. The current Glen Edyth Drive was originally a carriageway for the estate. She died in Toronto at the age of 65. She was named a Lady of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusaleml. The children of Edith Boulton and Samuel Nordheimer were Stuart Fitzroy Boulton Nordheimer (b. 1872), Julia Melina Boulton Nordheimer (b. 1874), Samuel Max Boulton Nordheimer (b. 1876), Athol Gordon Boulton Nordheimer (b. 1877), Adeline Matilda Boulton Nordheimer (b. 1878), Edith Vera Boulton Nordheimer and Errol Louisa Boulton Nordheimer (b. 1879 - twins), Cecil Evelyn Boulton Nordheimer (b. 1881), May Estelle Boulton Nordheimer (b. 1883), G.

His mother was Lillie Ashleigh living at 66 West End Lane, West Hampstead, London, UK. In about 1918, he stated he was not married and that his father was deceased and no name was given. Around 1905 or 1906 Ashleigh had been in London as in a letter he mentioned meeting a Mrs Horsley, outside Cornwall Hall, wishing to attend a lecture which had been cancelled.Mrs Horsley - Charles Ashleigh wrote to Mrs Morsley from prison on June 22nd 1919 In 1909 he lectured on socialism across Wales. In 1916, seven members of the IWW were killed by sheriff's deputies during the Everett Massacre. 74 IWW members were then arrested. Ashleigh worked for the Everett Prisoners‚Äô Defense League during their trial. While working as a journalist in San Francisco, Ashleigh was arrested on October 20, 1917 during a national sweep of radical leaders and organizers. Ashleigh was put on trial for seditious conspiracy, conspiracy to injure civil rights, and conspiracy to obstruct the military service with other IWW leaders in Chicago in 1918.Case number 6125 U.S. v. Charles Ashleigh, August 30, 1918 He was sentenced to 10 years in the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas on September 7, 1918 Ashleigh was inmate 13115. A fellow inmate was William D. Haywood, together with around 90 others from the IWW. His sentence was commuted on December, 26, 1921 after Ashleigh agreed to be deported to England. After his release from prison Ashleigh moved to New York City at the insistence of The Liberator, which had published his prison poems and implored their readers to fund his bail. While in New York, Ashleigh befriended the Jamaican poet, Claude McKay. The pair were romantically involved off and on throughout the 1910s and 1920s. In 1922 the pair traveled together to the 4th World Congress of the Communist International in Petrograd, USSR. The following year the pair traveled to Berlin and reconnected in Nice in 1926.

Content morphemes have lexical denotations that are not dependent on the context or on other morphemes. For instance, in English, the abstract noun beauty (already a fused form with an incorporated suffix) may mean 'pleasing quality'. Adding the causative verbal suffix -fy (a functional morpheme) produces the verb beautify 'to make pleasing'. By adding the suffix -ful (another functional morpheme), the adjective beautiful is formed. Further adding the adverbializer -ly (yet another functional morpheme) produces the adverb beautifully. The various functional morphemes surrounding the semantic core are able to modify the use of the root through derivation, but do not alter the lexical denotation of the root as somehow 'pleasing' or 'satisfying'. Most or all major class words include at least one content morpheme; compounds may contain two or more content morphemes. In addition to content morphemes, major class words frequently (but not obligatorily) include one or more functional morphemes affixed to the root(s). Some languages, such as Kharia, can be analyzed as having a single major word class composed of semantic bases or content morphemes. Thus, the distinction between nouns, verbs, and adjectives in such languages is entirely morphological (realized through the concatenation of functional morphemes), rather than lexical (having separate entries in the lexicon for each of the major word classes). ==References== Category:Units of linguistic morphology ","title":"Content morpheme"},{"id":"54219071","text":"Alphamenes richardsi is a species of wasp in the family Vespidae.

However this supports the people only during the shrimp fishery season which extends from October to April. The most abundant shrimp species in Rekawa lagoon and commercially most important shrimp species is Penaeus indicus (White shrimp).Rathnaweera E (2005), Report on A case study on the impact of the Kapuhenwela causeway on the Rekawa lagoon & lagoon fishery, Practical Action, Sri Lanka White shrimp == Environmental problems ==  Ecohydrological impact of the Kapuhenwela causeway  In 1984 the Road Development Authority of Tangalle built a causeway called Kapuhenwela across the outlet canal; around from the lagoon mouth to the inland. Water passes under the causeway through twenty three, 23 cm diameter pipes which greatly reduce the volume and speed of water entering and leaving the lagoon system. This causeway has prevented flushing of the lagoon by natural water flow, causing continues sedimentation in the lagoon. In 1999 a bridge of in length was constructed in place of the part of the causeway in order to improve free water flow. After the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004, minor damage was inflicted on the causeway and it was renovated and replaced with eight cylindrical culverts with an average diameter of in 2005. Causeway itself and its modifications provoked concern over local resource users and environmentalists as the lagoon hydrology (ex; reduced flushing), salinity and there by the ecology (ex; reduction in shrimp catch) showed drastic changes and variations Before the construction of causeway, the effective channel cross section was which was then reduced to with the introduction of existing causeway structure with the bridge, a drop of 71% of effective channel cross section. Existing situation of the causeway with eight cylindrical culverts and the partial bridge Schematic representation of channel cross section at the causeway before 1984 (a) and cross section of the causeway after 2005 (b)  Mangroves exploitation  Around the lagoon, many mangrove species including Lumnitzera racemosa, Aegiceras corniculatum, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Excoecaria agallocha, Rhizophora mcronata, Avicennia marina, and Avicennia officinalis are found. In addition to its ecological benefits (ex; shrimp and fish habitats), traditionally, Rekawa people have used mangroves for the benefit of the local community, but the increasing population has led to an increasing non- sustainable abuse of the resources. Mangroves have been exploited for timber for building dwellings and boats and fuel-wood for cooking in the area.

It was built between 1864 and 1867 and demolished in 1971. ==History== The corner stone for the church was laid by William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire on 29 March 1864. The architect was George Gilbert Scott and the contractors were Thompson and Fryer and even though incomplete, it was consecrated on 10 May 1866 by Rt. Revd. John Lonsdale the Bishop of Lichfield. The font was designed by Scott and carved by Mr. Hall of Derby. It consisted of an octagonal bowl of grey Derbyshire fossil marble, with a clustered column of green Connemara and Red Belgian marble. Work on the tower and spire started in 1880 and it was consecrated by the Bishop of Lichfield on 30 December 1881. The musician Ronald Binge, composer of BBC Radio Four's theme tune 'Sailing By' was a boy chorister at the church in the 1920s. The church became redundant in the 1960s and was demolished in 1971. The parish merged with that of St Osmund's Church, Derby. ==Organ== An organ was installed in 1866 for the opening of the church. A new organ was installed in 1902 by Forster and Andrews. It was modified in 1919 by Nicholson and Lord and again in 1928 by J.H. Adkins of Derby. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Millikin was born on September 30, 1890, in Oswego, Kansas. He attended several schools including Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas; the University of Oregon; the University of Washington; and the University of California. Before the 1919‚Äì1920 school year, Millikin resigned his teaching position at Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon. He arrived at Queen Anne High School in Seattle in 1919 as a history teacher and athletic coach. He resigned from the high school eleven years later, working for a book publisher and the Department of Labor and Industries. In 1937, when Millikin was King County, Washington auditor, he issued \\"hundreds of [marriage] licences [...] without the prospective bride and groom being compelled to appear\\" according to the Associated Press, who cited \\"white slavery\\" as the main opposition to Millikin's practices. He served two full terms as auditor. Millikin was elected as Mayor of Seattle on March 11, 1941, defeating police chief William F. Devin in a special election to finish the term of mayor Arthur B. Langlie, who resigned to become Governor of Washington. During a strike of American Federation of Labor affiliated welders in October 1941, Seattle Mayor Millikin demanded the striking workers return to their jobs without negotiations. Millikin was mayor at the time of the Bombing of Pearl Harbor and the United States's entry into World War II. He supported the internment of Japanese Americans, which began in early 1942, and stirred fears of Japanese traitors that would burn Seattle to the ground. On March 8, 1942, Millikin was at the launching of the USS Carmick (DD-493) when he said it would be \\"heard in Australia and Tokyo\\" in front of ten thousand shipyard workers and United States Navy men. Millikin lost to Devin in the 1942 mayoral election. After leaving office, he was called into the United States Army and served with Artillery units in the South Pacific. He retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1945. Millikin would go on to work for the State Department of Veteran Affairs and as a distillery representative before serving on the civil staff of King County Sheriff Tim McCullough until his permanent retirement in 1960. He died on March 23, 1970, at the age of 79, in Seattle. ==References== Category:Washington (state) Republicans Category:Mayors of Seattle Category:Kansas Republicans Category:People from Oswego, Kansas Category:Baker University alumni Category:University of Oregon alumni Category:University of Washington alumni Category:University of California alumni Category:1890 births Category:1970 deaths ","title":"Earl Millikin"},{"id":"54219237","text":"Dawlish Methodist Church is located on Brunswick Street in the town of Dawlish, Devon, England.

She is the associate curator of Odonata & non-holometabolous insect orders at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. In addition, she is a principal investigator at the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics and an associate professor for the Richard Gilder Graduate School. She studies the evolution of insect physiology and behavior, particularly dragonflies and dictyoptera, as well as their biogeography (their geographic distribution). Ware was a contributor to a major study of the phylogenomics of insect evolution, and developed molecular phylogeny of hexapoda. ==Early life and education== Jessica Lee Ware was born in Montreal, Quebec, one of twins (her twin is artist and activist Syrus Marcus Ware). Ware has said that she became interested in biology because her grandparents, Gwen and Harold Irons, in northern Canada encouraged her to collect snakes, insects, and frogs. Ware attended the University of Toronto Schools (UTS) for grades 7-13. Ware earned a bachelor of science in invertebrate zoology from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 2001. She pursued entomology after working in the University's Entomological Museum to support herself during her studies. After graduating, Ware traveled to Costa Rica to work with Diane Srivastava for a semester. She reports that her time there led to her to choose research as a career, and it was also her first experience of working with other scientists of color. Ware went directly from her bachelor's degree to the doctoral program at Rutgers University. She was awarded a PhD in 2008, with a dissertation titled, Molecular and morphological systematics of Libelluloidea (Odonata: Anisoptera) and Dictyoptera. Ware was married to another entomologist. She is now a single parent. ==Career== In 2010, she was appointed as an associate professor at Rutgers University. She is also a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and the National Museum of Natural History. Ware contributed to a major study of the phylogenomics of insect evolution, and developed molecular phylogeny of hexapoda. She has undertaken fieldwork in several continents. Ware is the PI and lead coordinator of her lab working over multiple PhD, masters, and undergraduate students working on research in the entomological field. Ware is active in encouraging women and people from under-represented groups to become entomologists. She was a featured speaker at the March for Science in Washington DC in 2017. She is a contributor to Entomology Today, and serves on the board of several entomological journals.

Prolactin inhibitors suppress and prolactin releasers induce the secretion of prolactin, respectively. Prolactin inhibitors are mainly used to treat hyperprolactinemia. Agonists of the dopamine D2 receptor such as bromocriptine and cabergoline are able to powerfully suppress pituitary prolactin secretion and thereby decrease circulating prolactin levels, and so are most commonly used as prolactin inhibitors. Antiestrogens such as aromatase inhibitors and analogues are also able to inhibit the secretion of prolactin, though not nearly as robustly as D2 receptor agonists, and as such, they are not usually used as prolactin inhibitors. Whereas D2 receptor agonists suppress prolactin secretion, dopamine D2 receptor antagonists like domperidone and metoclopramide have the opposite effect, powerfully inducing the pituitary secretion of prolactin, and are sometimes used as prolactin releasers, for instance to correct hypoprolactinemia in the treatment of lactation failure. When such drugs are used not for the purpose of inducing prolactin secretion, increased prolactin levels may be unwanted, and can result in various side effects including mammoplasia (breast enlargement), mastodynia (breast pain/tenderness), galactorrhea (inappropriate or excessive milk production/secretion), gynecomastia (breast development in males), hypogonadism (low sex hormone levels), amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual cycles), reversible infertility, and sexual dysfunction. D2 receptor agonists that are described as prolactin inhibitors include bromocriptine, cabergoline, lergotrile, lisuride, metergoline, quinagolide, and terguride. ==See also== * Hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìprolactin axis ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Breastfeeding ","title":"Prolactin modulator"},{"id":"54219628","text":"The Cachar bulbul (Iole cacharensis) is a species of songbird in the bulbul family, Pycnonotidae.

After a brief hiatus while Weaver auditioned to join the band Northlane, the name Well Wisher was dropped, and the band relaunched under the name Casey.

The ferry was notable for being the first to use steam power which began in 1812. The ferry's history was closely tied to the Pennsylvania Railroad's station in Jersey City at Exchange Place, which gradually fell into disuse after the railroad opened the North River Tunnels and Penn Station in 1910. Ferry service from lower Manhattan to Jersey City continued via the even older Communipaw ferry which operated from the adjacent Liberty Street Ferry Terminal until this service was also discontinued in 1967. In 1986 ferry service was revived and today it is operated by New York Waterway. ==History== Map from 1847 showing the Jersey City Ferry's route as well as several Hoboken ferry services.

Adams, pg. 64 ,1999, Fordham University Press, 978-0823219544 Subsequent expansions of rail service led to an ever increasing demand for the ferry's passenger and cargo service during the 19th century. Upon completion of the North River Tunnels and Penn Station in 1910, passengers increasingly opted to avoid using Exchange Place Terminal and the ferry's passenger traffic declined. In 1949 the final ferry service was made and passengers wanting to travel from Exchange Place to lower Manhattan were left with only the Downtown Hudson Tubes of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (now PATH) as a form of direct travel. ==References== Category:1764 establishments in New Jersey Category:Companies established in 1764 Category:Transport companies established in 1764 Category:Ferries of New Jersey Category:Ferries of New York City Category:Ferry companies of New Jersey Category:Ferry companies of New York City Category:Water transportation in New York City Category:Transportation in Jersey City, New Jersey ","title":"Jersey City Ferry"},{"id":"54219754","text":"Matilde Moraschi (11 April 1910 - 16 April 2004) was an Italian sprinter.

It is a Grade II* listed building. In commercial use since its construction, it now houses a firm of architects. ==History== Cadw suggests a construction date close to 1700. The building was refaced in the 19th century and has since been unaltered externally. During the mid-19th century, the building was owned by the Dukes of Beaufort and used as the estate office for their substantial Monmouthshire land holdings. It was converted by a firm of architects in the late 20th century and now houses their offices. The architects were responsible for the conversion of the nearby Beaufort Arms Hotel. ==Architecture and description== The building is rendered, under a roof of Welsh slate. Of two storeys, with an attic, it has a double-front plan. The architectural historian John Newman noted the \\"botched\\" pediment while the Monmouth historian Keith Kissack recorded its Grecian fanlight. The interior has a notable dog-leg staircase dating from the late 17th century and a complete early 19th century strong-room, installed when the building was used as a solicitors' office.

In 1849, her parents inherited an estate in County Kerry and as a result the family changed their names to Bernard. They were then living in Cork but she and her parents moved to Shehersee House on the Bernard's new estate. In 1854, she undertook formal education at Laurel Hill convent in Limerick. She was there for three years and after a year with her parents she went to Paris to complete her education at the Convent of Dames Anglaises where she chose a religious life. She became a novice at the Religious Sisters of Charity convent in Dublin when she was 21. In 1863, she took the name Sister Mary Joseph Arsenius and professed in 1866. She was initially involved in teaching but then moved on to managerial and administration. In 1877, a new convent opened in Ballaghaderreen in County Mayo and Bernard was chosen as Reverend Mother. The convent expanded in 1879 to create a national school and in 1866 an industrial school. ==Foxford== Moving on from Ballaghaderreen, Bernard went to Foxford on 9 December 1890. She opened another convent in 1891 and took over a national school in the poor town. Bernard obtained ¬£7,000 in funding and opened the Providence Woollen Mill in Foxford in 1892 using power from the River Moy.

Bernard's organisation instilled new methods of breeding poultry, farming and gardening. In 1897 she created the Brass and Reed Band which was still running in 2014.Agnes Morrogh Bernard, Towns Villages, Retrieved 6 June 2017 Bernard tried to avoid politics but she did get involved when Charles Stewart Parnell fell from power and there was disagreements between her workers and the parish priest. She also got involved when some of her workers were victimised by the Black and Tans in 1921. Bernard was able to get the soldiers disciplined. Bernard supported the revival of Gaelic culture and language as she had arranged earlier the building of cottages for workers. She herself organised cart roads to give access to 118 houses. In 1898, Mother Mary Arsenius undertook the task of building roads in the area; through her scheme cart roads were built to the doors of 118 houses. In addition, she encouraged the local authorities to build labourers' cottages. She was also interested in the social and cultural life of the area, and supported the efforts of the Gaelic League to revive Irish language and culture. She died at her convent on 20 April 1932 and was buried there three days later.D. Gildea, Mother Mary Arsenius of Foxford (1936) ¬∑ M. B.

It was instituted at the foundation of the University, in 1737, along with the three other original faculties of Law, Medicine, and Philosophy (or Arts). Over the centuries, the G√∂ttingen Faculty of Theology has been home to many influential scholars and movements, including the rise of historical criticism, Ritschlianism, the History of Religions School, and Dialectical Theology. Its members were also involved in the G√∂ttingen School of History. A Protestant institution, the Theologische Fakult√§t has long consisted of the five traditional disciplines of theology‚ÄîOld Testament Studies, New Testament Studies, Church History, Systematic Theology, and Practical Theology‚Äîbut now includes Religious Studies as well. The faculty has numerous projects, programs, and partnerships with other centers, departments, and faculties across the University as well as the G√∂ttingen Graduate School of Humanities and the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Besides the G√∂ttingen State and University Library‚Äîwhich stands across from the Faculty's home, the Theologicum‚Äîthe Faculty of Theology maintains its own specialist library, with current holdings of 170,000 volumes and 250 periodicals. == Academics == The Faculty of Theology educates University students at all levels, for bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. (Historically, the Doctor of Theology was considered the highest academic rank, and at the University's foundation, it was mostly reserved for honorary purposes.) It also trains ordinands for the Confederation of Protestant Churches in Lower Saxony. To support its students, the Faculty of Theology runs the Theologisches Stift. This residential college‚Äîinitiated by Isaak August Dorner modelled on the T√ºbinger Stift‚Äîhas its origins in an earlier theological seminary and numbers among the University's oldest institutions.  Departments  Theologicum The Faculty is divided into six primary departments, with their own dedicated chairs, researchers, lecturers, and support staff. * Old Testament Studies * New Testament Studies * Church History * Systematic Theology * Practical Theology * Religious Studies  Special Research Sections  In addition, the G√∂ttingen Faculty of Theology houses other sections for specialized research. These sections often cut across departments within the faculty and involve other faculties as well. They include, among others, the following: * Institute for Research on Qumran * Institute for Jewish Studies * Karl Barth Research Center * Archive for the History of Relions School * Division for Hellenistic Religious History  Major Research Projects  Scholars at the G√∂ttingen Faculty of Theology have launched substantial research undertakings, often in partnership with other institutions. Larger and longer-running ones among them include the following: * Septuaginta-Unternehmen (1908‚Äì2015): a critical edition of the Septuagint (i.e., the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible), launched by Alfred Rahlfs in cooperation with the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities * Qumran- W√∂rterbuch: a dictionary of the Dead Sea Scrolls, directed by Reinhard Gregor Kratz in collaboration with the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities * Critical Edition of the Old Testament in Coptic language together with the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities * G√∂tterbilder - Gottesbilder - Weltbilder: Polytheismus und Monotheismus in der Welt der Antike (2004‚Äì2012): an interdisciplinary graduate school or \\"research training group\\" (Graduiertenkolleg) for religion in the ancient world, directed by Hermann Spieckermann through support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft * \\"Early Jewish Monotheisms\\" (2009‚Äì2014): a research group on the history of Judaism, led by Nathan MacDonald and supported by the Sofia Kovalevskaya Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation  Lecture Series  * Julius-Wellhausen- Vorlesung‚Äîa lecture series delivered by distinguished scholars‚Äîheld in conjunction with the G√∂ttingen Centrum Orbis Orientalis et Occidentalis == People == File:Johannes Laurentius von Mosheim.jpgJohannes Laurentius von Mosheim, Professor of Church History File:AlbrechtRitschl.jpgAlbrecht Ritschl, Professor of Dogmatics and Church History File:Voit 185 Rudolf Smend.jpgRudolf Smend, Professor of Old Testament File:Carl Mirbt ca. 1925.jpgCarl Mirbt, Professor of Church History File:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-1283-23A, Wuppertal, Evangelische Gesellschaft, Jahrestagung.jpgKarl Barth, Professor of Reformed Theology File:Gerhard_von_Rad.jpgGerhard von Rad, Professor of Old Testament File:Hermann Spieckermann.jpgHermann Spieckermann, Professor of Old Testament  Notable Members  The following are notable past and present senior associates of the Faculty of Theology:  Past  * Karl Barth * G√ºnther Bornkamm * Hans Conzelmann * Heinrich Ewald * Ernst K√§semann * Johann David Michaelis * Nathan MacDonald * Carl Mirbt * Bernd Moeller * Johann Lorenz von Mosheim * Alfred Rahlfs * Albrecht Ritschl * Rudolf Smend * Paul Tschackert * Gerhard von Rad * Walther Zimmerli  Present  * Reinhard Gregor Kratz * Gerd L√ºdemann * Hermann Spieckermann * Andreas Gr√ºnschlo√ü  Notable Students  The following are notable students of the Faculty of Theology: * Wilhelm Bousset * Albert Eichhorn * Richard Gaffin * Hermann Gunkel * Wilhelm Heitm√ºller * J√ºrgen Moltmann * Rudolf Otto * Otto Ritschl * Ernst Troeltsch * Johannes Weiss * Julius Wellhausen * Paul Wernle * William Wrede == Bibliography == * Bernd Moeller, ed.

It runs from the Upper Rhine Plain near Rastatt for about through the northern Black Forest to Rottweil. The section from Rastatt to Freudenstadt, which runs through the Murg valley to Baiersbronn, has been known since the 1960s as the Black Forest Valleys Road (Schwarzwald-T√§lerstra√üe) and, along with the B 500 (Black Forest High Road), is one of the tourist routes in the Black Forest. Both roads meet in Freudenstadt. In 2001 the section from Rastatt to Gaggenau was widened into a dual carriageway as far as Schloss Bad Rotenfels (Landesakademie) and a further widening to the centre of Gaggenau is planned. In 1997, the road through Gernsbach was relieved by the building of the 1,527-metre-long Gernsbach Tunnel. == Route == The B 462 runs through the following larger settlements: Rastatt, Kuppenheim, Gaggenau, Gernsbach, Weisenbach, Forbach, Baiersbronn, Freudenstadt, Alpirsbach, Schenkenzell, Schiltach, Schramberg, Rottweil. From there the B 14 continues to Tuttlingen. == Electrification == In the \\"eWayBW\\" pilot project, the route 462 between Kuppenheim and Gernsbach-Obertsrot is to serve as a test route for trolleybus lorries.

He was the 40th hereditary chieftain of the Nanbu clan.. ==Biography== Nanbu Toshihisa was the 3rd son of Nanbu Toshitada, the 12th daimy≈ç of Morioka Domain and was born in Morioka. He was initially adopted by Nanbu Nobunori as heir to Shichinohe Domain, but was returned to Morioka after the forced retirement of his brother, Nanbu Toshitomo in September 1849. He was received in a formal audience by Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyoshi, and received the courtesy title of Min≈ç-no-kami and Junior 4th Rank, Lower Grade Court rank later the same year. In 1851 he received the additional courtesy title of Jij≈´ (Chamberlain) and his court rank was increased to Senior 4th Rank. At the time, the domain was divided into a faction supporting Toshitomo, and a faction supporting his father, Toshitada, who was still controlling the domain despite his official retirement. When Toshitomo was forced aside to permit the appointment of the more pliable Toshihisa, the domain erupted into widespread revolt in 1853. The r≈çj≈´ Abe Masahiro responding by placing both Toshitada and Toshitomo under house arrest in Edo, thus removing their influence over the government of the domain. In 1861, his courtesy title was changed to Sash≈çsh≈ç. Although he was approached by Kuj≈ç Michitaka to support the new Meiji government, Toshihisa led the domain into the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei during the Boshin War, and fought against the forces of the pro-Meiji Akita Domain. However, there was little support within the domain for the war, and he formally surrendered to the Meiji government on 9 October 1868. On 7 December, he was ordered to retire and was replaced as daimy≈ç by his son, Nanbu Toshiyuki ten days later. Three of the senior kar≈ç of the domain committed seppuku rather than submit to the Meiji government. On 30 October 1896, Toshihisa was posthumously awarded Senior Third Rank. His grave is at the temple of Gokoku-ji in Tokyo. Toshihisa had at least 11 sons and 6 daughters. His eldest daughter married Prince Kach≈ç Hirotsune, and one of his sons was adopted by ≈åkuma Shigenobu. ==References== *Papinot, Edmond. (1948). Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan.

He was the 41st hereditary chieftain of the Nanbu clan. Nanbu Yoshiyuki was the eldest son of Nanbu Toshihisa, the 14th daimy≈ç of Morioka Domain. Yoshiyuki, together with Nanbu Nobutami, the daimy≈ç of Shichinohe Domain, he surrendered his forces to the new Meiji government on 9 October 1868 during the Boshin War. On 2 December, he travelled to Tokyo with his father, and was re-confirmed as daimy≈ç of Morioka Domain by the new government ten days later. However, as Yoshiyasu had actually participated in combat against the Meiji government against the forces of Akita Domain in the war, the appointment was withdrawn only five days later, and on 24 December, his position was abolished and his territories were seized. The Nanbu clan was ordered to transfer to Shiraishi Domain (130,000 koku) in southern Mutsu Province instead. On 18 June 1869, with the abolition of the han system, he became domain governor of Shiraishi, and on 28 June he received the courtesy title of Kai-no-kami and Court rank Junior 5th Court Rank, lower grade. On 22 July, Yoshiyuki applied to be returned to Morioka as domain governor, and the government agreed in exchange for a donation of 700,000 gold ry≈ç. Although he proved unable to raise the funds, he was transferred to Morioka in July 1870. His stay in Morioka was short, as with the abolition of the han system in 1871, he was ordered to live in Tokyo, where he founded the Ky≈çkan Gijuku, a school of western learning, whose students included the noted writer Natsume S≈çseki. Yoshiyuki was elevated to the title of Count (hakushaku) in the kazoku peerage system on 7 July 1884. On 20 June 1902, shortly before his death, he was awarded Senior Third Rank. His grave is at the temple of Gokoku-ji in Tokyo. His eldest son and heir, Nanbu Toshinaga, was an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army, and was killed in combat during the Russo-Japanese War while serving with the Guards Regiment. The title of Count and position of 43rd chieftain of the Nanbu clan went to his second son, Nanbu Toshiatsu. ==References== *Papinot, Edmond. (1948). Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan.

She began horseback riding with her sister at Oak Meadows Farm when she was 8 years old. By age 9, she was learning to jump. At 11 years old, Brain got her first horse, Patty, a 15.3 hh chestnut Thoroughbred. A year and a half later, Brain sold Patty and purchased Pumpkin, an American Quarter Horse. Brain continued to advance on Pumpkin, earning ribbons in various classes. In 1983, Brain met Alpine Renegade (Alpo), a 6 year old 15 hh gelding. The two had early successes, leading Brain to buy him in 1983. In 1984, Brain was deeply immersed in horseback riding, working and riding at Spring Ride Farm. She began eventing on Alpo, winning her first pre-training event in 1985 in Maple Ridge, British Columbia. In 1987, Brain participated in the Western Canada Summer Games in Regina, Saskatchewan. She placed fifth in preliminary-level three day eventing. In 1988, at age 18, Brain moved to Ontario and began working for Nick Holmes-Smith. In November 1988, Brain was selected for a scholarship to train with Mark Phillips in England. In February 1989, Brain and Alpo flew to England. In April 1989, Brain's horse Alpo was injured at the Gatwick Horse Trials. This injury highlighted Alpo's limitations as a small horse. When Brain returned to Canada and began to seriously prepare for the Olympics, she made the decision to sell Alpo. In 1992, while working at Hunt Valley Farm in Victoria, Brain found Merlin, a 15.3 HH Thoroughbred she dubbed Double Take. The team competed at events across North America throughout the 1990s. == Accident == On September 18, 2001, Karen Brain fell off her horse Miko, shattering her T12 vertebrae and puncturing a lung. The accident resulted in incomplete paraplegia. == Paralympics == Karen Brain competed in the 2004 Summer Paralympics and the 2008 Summer Paralympics.

Administratively, Hoheluft is divided into two quarters: in the borough of Hamburg-Nord, and in the borough of Eimsb√ºttel. The Hoheluftchaussee is the boundary between the two quarters. With about 22,673 inhabitants per square kilometer (as of 2016), Hoheluft is one of the most densely populated quarters in all of Germany. http://mobil.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article2042848/Eppendorf-am-Wasser.html ==Geography== The Isebekkanal is the southeast border of Hoheluft. Behind it lies the quarter of Harvestehude. Hoheluft-Ost also borders Eppendorf, Hoheluft-West also borders Lokstedt in the north and Eimsb√ºttel in the west. The Hoheluftchaussee in the east forms the border between Hoheluft-West and the district of Hoheluft-Ost, part of the district of Hamburg-Nord. ==History== Historically and administratively, the district of Hoheluft is closely connected with Eppendorf, which - like Eimsb√ºttel and Harvestehude - had been owned by Harvestehude Monastery. The name Hoheluft was only officially introduced as a district name in 1939. The origin of the name is not clearly known. The local historians Wilhelm Melhop and Armin Clausen assume that the boundary point Veerendeel to the former village of Lokstedt as the elevation of the area over the lowlands of the Isebek was designated as \\"on the Hohenluft\\". But it can also be that the name is derived from a gallows erected in 1602 or the \\"Hoge Licht\\" of the local inn. This light served the purpose of guiding drivers at night and fog. Hamburg-Lexikon, hrsg. von F. Kopitzsch und D.

The building was designed in the spirit of classicism with a pronounced triangular pediment above the main entrance. The structural system shows the characteristics of the Baroque. The interior layout is simple and logical ‚Äì rooms line up along a longitudinal corridor.

In 1699, she was tried by the Inquisition on Sicily alongside brother Romualdo, a monk of the Order of St Augustine, who was charged for Quietism and Molinism, while Cordovana was charged with pride, vanity and hypocrisy. She claimed to have sexual intercourse with God, and described herself as pure and holy. Both were subjected to imprisonment, during which they refused to recount their views despite food- and water deprivation and torture. Gertrude Cordovana remained in prison for twenty five years. In 1724, having still not repented, the Inquisition gave up their attempt to make them repent and applied for their executions, which were approved by the bishop of Albarucin, the grand inquisitor of Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor. Both Gertrude Cordovan and Romualdo was executed at the square of San Erasmo in Palermo the morning of 6 April 1724. The execution attracted great attention and was attended by the public, the Inquisition, the senate, the viceroy, the city government and the nobility, as well as the remaining 26 prisoners of the Inquisition. Cordovana was taken to the place of execution in a grande procession before Romualdo. After having mounted the stake, her hair and her clothes were set on fire by the help of certain liquids before the stake itself was set at fire, burning her to death. == References  Sources== * S.

For the DVD, another video was placed on the track list, the recruiting review video for \\"Ninin Sankyaku\\" (misono„Å®‰∫å‰∫∫‰∏âËÑö! „Éë„Éº„Éà„Éä„ÉºÂãüÈõÜ„Ç™„Éº„Éá„Ç£„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ÔΩûÁ¨¨1Ê¨°„Éª2Ê¨°„Éª3Ê¨°ÂØ©Êüª„ÅÆÂ∑ªÔΩû / misono and Ninin Sankyaku!

The CD portion not only contained both a-sides and their corresponding instrumentals, but also alternate versions to her songs \\"Kimi to Watashi no Uta\\" and \\"music letter.\\" The single contained the grunge/pop song \\"„Äå‚Ä¶Suki√ó√ó√ó„Äç,\\" which was written and arranged by musical composers Susumu Nishikawa of Diamond Head and Ihashi Naruya. Susumu had previously worked with misono during her time in the group day after tomorrow. Ihashi Naruya also composed the music for the other a-side, \\"0-ji Mae no Tsunderella.\\" Akira Murata, who was in Diamond Head with Susumu Nishikawa, arranged the piece. The song \\"„Äå‚Ä¶Suki√ó√ó√ó„Äç\\" is about enjoying living life while being without a partner, but wondering how things would have turned out if they had been older and more mature. In contrast, \\"0-ji Mae no Tsunderella\\" was a song about how the fictional character Cinderella had felt after going to the ball and meeting the prince. The take was most likely from the 1950 cinematic Disney version of the fairy tale. \\"0-ji Mae no Cinderella\\" was used as the April ending theme to the television program Hiro Obi!, which aired on the Tokyo Broadcasting station. misono's older sister, Koda Kumi, would later cover the song \\"0-ji Mae no Cinderella\\" on her cover album, Eternity ~Love & Songs~, which was released in October of the same year. ==Music video== The music video for \\"„Äå‚Ä¶Suki√ó√ó√ó„Äç\\" carried an overall grunge theme, with misono in several locations many United States and United Kingdom videos used in the early-to-late 1990s. These included a rundown skatepark and the inside of a building under construction. The video used low-lighting, along with a spotlight, something her sister, Koda Kumi also utilized for her song \\"Physical Thing,\\" which was released the same year. Her video for \\"0-ji Mae no Cinderella\\" was performed in one continuous shot with misono sitting on a giant, white clock, symbolizing midnight in the story of Cinderella. ==Track listingCharts== Oricon Sales Chart (Japan) {  width=\\"650px\\" !Release !Chart !Peak Position !Weekly Sales !Sales Total !Chart Run - rowspan=\\"4\\"2010.05.05 Oricon Weekly Charts align=\\"center\\"15 5,489 5,489  - Oricon Weekly Charts align=\\"center\\"76 1,172 6,661 2 weeks } ==ReferencesExternal links== *misono Official Site Category:2010 singles Category:2010 songs Category:Misono songs Category:Avex Trax singles Category:Songs written by Misono ","title":"...Suki xxx/0-ji Mae no Tsunderella"},{"id":"54220485","text":"Kapilavastu was an ancient city on the Indian subcontinent which was the capital of the clan of the Shakyas.

Most Albanians in Slovenia originally come from Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro.name=>name=> name=> ==History== The first Albanians located in the territories of today's Slovenia came after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and after the Balkan wars. At the time of Yugoslavia, Albanians migrated to Slovenia for economic and political reasons, especially after 1945. Albanian migrants were mainly from the Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo and Montenegro. Even in the republic of Slovenia, as in most countries, we have an early exile of Albanians, especially from the areas of Kosovo. Here the Albanians are present almost immediately, sometime after the Second World War, namely from the time of the creation of the Yugoslav state, in which the state was part of a constituent unit, Slovenia as a republic and the state of Kosovo as an autonomous province. Since then, the difficult economic situation and later, even politics, forced Albanians to seek and find better living conditions in this country, which from the outset was distinguished by the standard of living compared to other units of the former Yugoslav federation. ==Demographics== At the beginning, we had a small number of wing workers in Slovenia, but the worse worsening of the political situation in Kosovo caused the number of Albanians there to grow, whereas today, according to statistical data, in Slovene the number of Albanians is 6.228 which was issued on the basis of 0.31% of Albanians from the total number of inhabitants in Slovenia.

The vast majority emigrated from Kosovo, Republic of Macedonia and Albania. ==History== On August 1, 1956, the train carrying 700 refugees from southeastern European communist countries arrived at the Seille station in Namur province. These refugees have traveled for 72 hours and among them were hundreds of refugees from Albania. This marks the first wave of Albanian exiles in Belgium. The first wave of Albanian exiles was so-called \\"elite\\". The emigrants came mainly from northern Albania, were relatively educated and opposed the communist dictatorship of Enver Hoxha seeking freedom. Albanian political refugees have been welcomed in Belgium and adapted well. In v. 1968 Skanderbeg Monument was built in Schaerbeek, with money collected from Albanian Diaspora in Belgium and America. In the 1960s, with immigrants from Turkey, Albanians, who had previously migrated from Yugoslavia to Turkey, came to Belgium. They were followed by guest workers from Yugoslavia in the 1970s and strengthened in the 1980s. This first wave of exiles will be followed by the large influx of Kosovo Albanians beginning in the late 1970s and intensified in the 1990s as a result of Serbian repression over Kosovo Albanians. This influx will culminate when Belgrade will massacre over thousands of Albanian civilians and drive out nearly a million Kosovo Albanians in v. Also in the 1990s, a second wave of exiles came from Albania after the collapse of the communist regime. Hundreds of thousands of Albanians, disconnected from the world for 45 years, fleeing poverty in Albania, rush especially to Italy and Greece, but also to Belgium. ==Demographics== In addition to Albanian citizens (2,941 people per 2008), there are also numerous Albanians from Kosovo, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Greece or Montenegro.

A career military officer, he served in the Boxer Rebellion, Russo-Japanese War, and World War I, before joining the White movement during the Russian Civil War. Like many other officers, he went into exile after the end of the Russian Civil War, initially moving to Yugoslavia. After World War II, Flug went to the United States, where he died. ==Biography== Flug graduated from the 2nd Saint Petersburg Military Gymnasium in 1877 and the Mikhailovsky Artillery Academy in 1880 with the rank of second lieutenant, being first assigned to the 7th Horse Artillery Battery. Upon his graduation from the General Staff Academy in 1890, he was appointed head of the drilling staff department of the Vladivostok Fortress on November 26 of that year. From October 4, 1893, Flug served as a squadron commander in the 11th Kharkov Dragoon Regiment. He transferred to become a senior adjutant of the Caucasian Grenadier Division on October 6, 1894. Far East service Flug as a Colonel in 1900 On February 16, 1896, Flug became a staff officer at the headquarters of the 2nd East Siberian Rifle Brigade, stationed in the Russian Far East. He participated in the Russian invasion of Manchuria during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and 1901. On July 22, 1900, he became head of the military staff department of the Kwantung Oblast. For his actions during the capture of Lutai on September 9, 1900, Flug was awarded the Gold Sword for Bravery on March 15, 1901. On January 22, 1902, he became chief of staff of the Kwangtung Oblast, and was promoted to major general on August 27, 1903 for distinguishing himself. From 29 January 1904, Flug was the quartermaster of the field headquarters of the governor in the Far East. He participated in the Russo-Japanese War. From 14 January 1905, Flug was the general quartermaster of the headquarters of the 2nd Manchurian Army. From 21 September 1905, he is the military governor of the Maritime Region and Ataman of the Ussuri Cossacks. A Lieutenant General in 1908, he became on 19 November 1909, the commander of the 37th infantry Division and on 30 July 1912, of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division. From 12 January 1913, Flug was an assistant to the General Governor of Turkestan and commander of the Army of the Turkestan Military District. World War I After the destruction of General Samsonov's 2nd Army in the wake of the Battle of Tannenberg, the 10th Army was formed in late August 1914 from reserve units. On 29 August 1914, Vasily Flug was appointed commander of this 10th Army and made a general of the infantry. Despite successful actions in the battles against the 8th German Army and the taking of Suwa≈Çki, and because of disagreements with General Nikolai Ruzsky, Vasily Flug was on 23 September 1914 suspended for \\"dangerous activities\\" by the command of the army and transferred to the supreme Commander. On 4 October 1914, he was appointed to supervise the restoration of the 13th and 15th Army Corps, which had been all but destroyed in Eastern Prussia in August 1914. On 8 July 1915, he was appointed commander of the 2nd Army Corps. He was awarded the Order of St. George 4th degree. During the Vilnius operation in September 1915, the Germans set out to disengage the troops of the Northern and Western fronts by hitting at the wedge between the 5th and 10th armies, and sending cavalry to the area of Molodechno to operate in the rear of the 10th Army. Part of the 2nd Corps under the general command of General Flug was ordered to counter the enemy's designs. Not only did he withheld the onslaught of the enemy, but he also moved to the offensive. As a result of the energy, courage and skilful leadership shown by General Flug, the German plan came to nothing. In 1916, the 2nd Corps joined the 7th Army and participated in the South- Western Front offensive in the summer of 1916. Revolution and Civil War After the February Revolution, Flug was put on 30 May 1917 in the reserve of officers at the headquarters of the Petrograd Military District. After the October coup, he left for Don. On November 14, 1917, he arrived in Novocherkassk and offered his services to General Mikhail Alekseyev, who had formed the Volunteer Army. In February 1918, Vasily Flug was sent to Siberia to organize the anti-bolshevik resistance there. He left Novocherkassk on 25 February under the name of Vasily Fadeev. During his mission to Siberia, he helped unify and coordinate the activities of the clandestine officers' organizations in Omsk, Petropavlovsk, Tomsk and Irkutsk. On 29 March 1918, he arrived in Omsk, on 27 April, in Tomsk, on 4 May, in Irkutsk, and on 11 June in Vladivostok. Vasily Flug then travelled to Harbin, where he was a member of the Government of General Horvath from June 1918. On 1‚Äì14 December 1918, he temporarily served as commander of the troops in the Amur military region. As of 3 December 1918, he became an assistant High Commissioner in the Far East of General Horvath in the civil area. At the very end of 1918, Flug arrived in Omsk where he met Admiral Kolchak. Despite his extensive experience and involvement in the organization of the Anti-Bolshevik resistance in Siberia, there was no place for him in Kolchak's Army. On the instructions of Kolchak, he returned to southern Russia at the disposal of general Anton Denikin. On February 10, 1919, Vasily Flug sailed from Vladivostok on the steamboat Tomsk and on April 6, 1919, arrived in Novorossiysk. After returning to Southern Russia, Flug was entrusted in May 1919 with carrying out an inspection of all logistical institutions under the authority of the Special Meeting. His main task was the expulsion from the excessively overgrown number of logistical offices compared to officers suitable for combat service. In September 1919, he was appointed an assistant to the military unit of the commander-in-chief and commander of the Kiev region, General Dragomirov. After the loss of Kiev, he retreated to the Crimea. On 8 December 1919 Flug was transferred to the reserve ranks at the headquarters of the Novorossiysk region. In exile In 1920, after the Crimea was abandoned by the White Russian troops, Flug left for Yugoslavia. From 1922 he served in the Yugoslav Military Ministry (Vara≈ædin). He was actively involved in the activities of the Russian All- Military Union. In 1930, Flug became acting chief of the 4th Division of the Russian All-Military Union (Yugoslavia), and at the same time until March 1932, he served as chairman of the District government of the Russian staff officers in the 4th Division of the Russian All-Military Union. During World War II Flug served in the Russian Corps. After the war ended, he moved to the United States. He was a member of the Society of Great War veterans. He was a permanent employee of the magazine \\"Watch\\" and \\"Bulletin of Military Knowledge.\\" Flug died in San Francisco. ==Essays== *A mission report from the Volunteer Army to Siberia in 1918//Archives of the Russian Revolution. -Berlin, 1923. -T. 9. -c. 243-304; *10th Army in September 1914, military compendium-kn.

The son of Meier Nordheimer, a cattle dealer, and Esther Nathan, he was born in Memmelsdorf and came to New York City in 1839 with his brother Samuel. Nordheimer moved to Kingston in 1842, becoming the first Jew living there and began advertising his services as a music teacher. He also opened a store which sold sheet music and musical instruments. It has been said that Nordheimer gave music lessons to the children of Canadian Governor-General Sir Charles Bagot. In 1844, he opened a music store in Toronto with his brother Samuel. Besides selling reprints of European music, the brothers also published Canadian compositions. The firm sold instruments manufactured in the United States; it later became involved in the manufacturing of pianos. Branches of the store were opened in Montreal, Hamilton and London. The firm invited famous performers of the day to come to Canada and established a concert hall in Montreal. Nordheimer played the piano and sang; he also played second violin for the Toronto Philharmonic Society. In 1849, with Judah George Joseph, he purchased land to establish a Jewish cemetery in Toronto. Nordheimer married Fanny Rosenthal. He died in Bamberg at the age of 45 during a visit to Germany. In 1927, Heintzman & Co. took over the operation of the Nordheimer Piano & Music Company Ltd. factory. == References == Category:1816 births Category:1862 deaths Category:People from Bamberg (district) Category:Canadian merchants Category:Jewish Canadian musicians Category:German emigrants to pre-Confederation Canada Category:Canadian publishers (people) ","title":"Abraham Nordheimer"},{"id":"54220574","text":"Inocybe rimosa (formerly known as Inocybe fastigiata) is a poisonous mushroom native to Europe. Its toxic ingredient is muscarine, discovered during the 1930s. German naturalist Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer described this species in 1774. Lucien Qu√©let transferred it to the genus Inocybe in 1872. I. fastigiata has a brownish fibrous cap, and stalk that lacks a ring. In Israel, I. fastigiata grows under Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos) and pines, with mushrooms still appearing in periods of little or no rain as they are mycorrhizal. In Israel, it is confused with edible mushrooms of the genus Tricholoma, particularly Tricholoma terreum, and Suillus granulatus, all of which grow in similar habitat. ==References== rimosa Category:Poisonous fungi Category:Fungi described in 1774 Category:Fungi of Europe ","title":"Inocybe rimosa"},{"id":"54220592","text":"Geneveve Casugod (born January 12, 1991) is a Filipino volleyball player who currently plays for the Foton Tornadoes.

Enlarge graphic to view legend. According to the UN, the number of first-generation immigrants worldwide is 244 million. These large-scale population changes worldwide have led many scholars, across fields, to study the acculturation and adjustment of immigrants to their new homes. Specifically, researchers have examined immigrant experiences as they pertain to educational attainment, mental and physical health, and conduct/crime. Researchers have tried to understand why later generations seem to perform less well than their forebears. They have found that it can be explained by non-optimal methodology and differences in the way generations are modified by the host culture. == Challenges facing immigrants == Immigrants face many challenges as a result of migration, stemming from the fact that the nations and communities they settle in are culturally unfamiliar. As a result, they find themselves in an unwelcoming environment lacking in the infrastructure necessary to ensure a simple transition. Additionally, because general attitudes of the host society are often hostile and xenophobic, immigrants are doubly vulnerable. Discrimination and prejudice are common and dictate daily experiences with individuals and organizations within the host society. For example, although cultural sensitivity training is increasingly a required component of medical education, immigrants have historically faced and continue to face discrimination in the health care system. An added barrier to equitable access to health care comes as a result of many immigrants' limited English proficiency. Many health care facilities have inadequate interpretation services, and culturally sensitive health care providers are also scarce. In addition, many immigrants are uninsured, making the financial burdens of adequate health care insurmountable. Many immigrants also settle in de facto segregated, low-income neighborhoods and ethnic enclaves, especially during periods of high immigration. Although the benefits of living in such communities include increased social support, positive in-group relations, and the virtual elimination of cultural and language barriers in daily interaction, often such neighborhoods are targets of institutional violence, such as stop and frisk. Further, due to public education funding policies in the United States, funds are often allocated to schools based on neighborhood property taxes. As a result, many immigrant children attend schools that are understaffed, underfunded, and lacking in resources in comparison to the schools of their more affluent peers. This is known as the opportunity gap, by which low-income and marginalized groups have disproportionately low access to the opportunities and conveniences afforded to societally privileged groups, resulting in group-wide disparities in academic achievement, wages, and political power. In direct relation to these obstacles, immigrants also face challenges in the workplace, including poor and dangerous working conditions, unemployment, and the employment of highly skilled individuals in low-skill jobs. To compound all of these issues, the burden of acculturation is an added stressor. Navigating the divide between the heritage culture and the culture of the new society is difficult, as the traditions, beliefs, and norms of these two cultures are often in direct conflict. This challenge is only compounded by the other obstacles immigrants are faced with, and has deleterious consequences for mental health, particularly because many migrants and refugees are already susceptible to elevated levels of psychopathology, due to the trauma associated with interpersonal conflict, acculturative stress and/or political unrest in their countries of origin. In light of these obstacles, it is expected that recent immigrants would have outcomes inferior to those of their native-born or non-immigrant peers. == Paradoxical findings == Despite the numerous challenges facing early generation immigrants, research on the mental and physical health, educational, and conduct-related outcomes of these populations has demonstrated a paradoxical pattern.  Mental health outcomes  Research with Filipino Americans has demonstrated that first-generation immigrants had lower levels of depressive symptoms than subsequent, US-born generations. First-generation Mexican immigrants to the United States were found to have lower incidences of mood disorders and substance use than their bicultural or subsequent generation counterparts. Similarly, immigrant youth in general are less likely to engage in risky behaviours and substance use, including alcohol and marijuana consumption. Other research with Latino populations shows that immigrants are less likely to suffer from any mental disorder than non-Latino whites. Research with Asian populations has supported this apparent paradox, with first-generation Asian Americans reporting lower levels of lifetime symptoms of depression and anxiety than US-born Asian Americans. One study inclusive of immigrants to the United States from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe found that immigrants, regardless of place of origin, exhibited less violent and nonviolent antisocial behaviour than US-born individuals. These findings have been replicated outside of the United States, with Canadian researchers finding that foreign born youth are less likely to display emotional and behavioural problems than their native-born peers, despite experiencing similar levels of poverty. Research conducted in the Netherlands has also found evidence of an immigrant paradox, with first- and second-generation Muslim immigrants reporting fewer psychological problems and higher self- esteem than Dutch nationals.  Physical health outcomes  The immigrant paradox also extends to physical health, with recent immigrants having better outcomes than US-born individuals. One study of several thousand health records in Southern California found Asian and Latina women had better perinatal outcomes than both white and Black women. Specifically, Asian and Latina women had lower infant mortality, higher birth weight, fewer Caesarean sections, fewer medical diagnoses during delivery, and shorter hospitalizations. This finding has also been replicated in Spain, with immigrant mothers, barring those of Sub-Saharan African origin, having a lower frequency of low birth weight than native Spanish mothers. With respect to overweight and obesity, it has been found that first-generation Mexican American women had healthier diets than both non-Latino whites and second- generation Mexican American women. Further, second-generation women had the poorest dietary intake, consuming even smaller amounts of necessary nutrients than non-Latina white women. US-born immigrants (i.e., second-generation immigrants, and subsequent generations) have also been found to engage in more overweight-related behaviours, such as poor diet, smoking, and little physical activity, in comparison to foreign-born immigrants. For Cubans and Puerto Ricans, increased length of stay in the United States was also associated with increased presence of overweight. These findings were replicated in a later study, which showed that with increased length of stay in the United States, immigrant health levels decreased significantly, approaching the levels of US- born individuals. Although immigrant men and women entered the US with lower BMIs than their US-born counterparts, within 10 to 15 years of arrival, there was no significant difference between the BMIs of immigrants versus US-borns. These findings apply to Asian American immigrants as well, with second- and third-generation Asian American adolescents being 100% more likely to be obese relative to their first-generation peers.  Educational outcomes  Among Latino populations, first- and second-generation Latino adolescents report high levels of effort in school, with effort declining across generations. They also place a greater value upon education, with the same downhill trend being observed. First-generation Mexican American adolescents, specifically, have more positive attitudes towards academics and skip school less than subsequent generations and non-Latino US-born Whites. They are also more involved in high school STEM coursework and have higher GPAs. With respect to Asian Americans, first-generation Asian American youth have more positive attitudes towards academics and skip school less than subsequent generations and non-Latino US-born whites. Further, first- and second-generation Asian American youth report higher levels of effort in school. Other differences in educational outcomes include superior reading achievement for first- and second-generation immigrant children, in comparison to their third-generation counterparts. First-generation Latino, Asian, and African youth have greater overall educational attainment and are less likely to drop out of high school than subsequent generations of each community. There are also differences in susceptibility to stereotype threat across generations, with second-generation Afro-Caribbean youth more at risk than first-generation youth.  Conduct- related outcomes  There is also evidence that the immigrant paradox extends to differential outcomes in conduct and/or crime. For example, rates of intimate partner violence are lower among non-Latino first-generation immigrant families. Immigrants are also less likely than non-immigrants to engage in many kinds of lifetime criminal and violent antisocial activity, including drunk driving, speeding, purposeful physical violence, and weapon use, with first-generation immigrants the least likely to engage in criminal behaviour, followed by second-generation immigrants, then third-generation. These effects can be seen at the neighborhood level, with increases in first- generation immigrants resulting in decreases in neighborhood-wide violence over time. Further, among undocumented immigrants, drug-related crime is even less likely than it is among non-immigrants. With respect to criminality among adolescents, first-, one-and-a-half-, and second-generation Asian American, African American, and Caribbean American adolescents are all less likely to engage in illegal or delinquent behaviour than non-Latino US-born White adolescents. Immigrant neighborhood concentration was also negatively correlated with recidivism for Latino youth. == A special case: the immigrant paradox in refugees? == There is a general consensus that refugees are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to successful resettlement in the host society, as the same challenges voluntary immigrants face are generally aggravated for refugees. However, some research has found evidence of a paradox, with refugees at least three times less likely to engage in substance use than non-immigrants. Other research has found refugees to Denmark to have a lower likelihood of stroke and breast cancer compared to Danish natives, but higher likelihood of lung cancer, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Notably, levels of all of these diseases among refugee populations eventually converged to the same levels as Danish natives with increased length of residency. There may also be an immigrant paradox for the perinatal outcomes of refugees, with the majority of refugee women studied having a lower crude birth rate, infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, and percentage of low birth weight than women in both their host country and their country of origin. == Conflicting evidence == There is some doubt among scholars as to whether or not the phenomenon actually exists, with some findings conflicting with the body of research on immigrant outcomes. For example, among Asian Americans, limited English proficiency was consistently associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes. In addition to language proficiency, age at time of immigration is also an important factor, with older first-generation Mexican American youth more likely to drop out of school than their US-born and younger, first-generation counterparts. In further support of this conclusion, data from the CPS shows that immigrating as a teenager is associated with completing less schooling than immigrating before or after adolescence. CPS data also shows that second-generation immigrants completed more schooling than both foreign-born immigrants and non-immigrant US-born individuals. In international research on the phenomenon, Europe's SHARE data demonstrated no evidence of a paradox, with immigrants having poorer health outcomes than native Europeans. A study in Canada found that recent and non- European immigrant women were more predisposed to developing postpartum depression than non-immigrant Canadians. == Explanations ==  Acculturation and the erosion of protective factors  The most common hypothesis for the immigrant paradox considers recent and first-generation immigrants' comparative access to cultural and social protective factors. Despite being confronted with the many challenges arising from immigration and acculturation, first-generation immigrants have greater social and cultural capital than subsequent generations. These include stronger social networks and highly adaptive cultural practices concerning religion, diet, substance use, and parenting style. Researchers also posit that first-generation immigrants are more likely to place high importance upon academic success due to fear of limited employment opportunities in the host society. These protective factors result in superior lifetime health, educational, financial, and conduct-related outcomes. Additionally, by having access to multiple cultural frameworks, recent immigrants are able to code-switch between frameworks or engage in downward social comparison as methods of self- protection. In comparison, subsequent generations may not have access to such social and cultural capital, having been socialized into the norms and expectations of the host society (i.e., consuming more processed and unhealthy foods, having a smaller network of same-ethnicity peers, increased substance use). Further, intergenerational conflict is more likely between first- generation immigrants and their second-generation children due to differing cultural practices, with parents being accustomed to the norms of their culture of origin and children having been socialized into the norms of the host society. This type of conflict has been linked to poorer outcomes for children. A third cost of acculturation is linked to immigrant children's cultural socialization. A strong sense of ethnic identity and pride in one's cultural heritage is generally understood to be protective from negative mental health outcomes. However, with increased length of stay in the host society, subsequent generations are likely to report decreasing levels of involvement in culturally important traditions and practices. With this comes decreasing strength of ethnic identity. Second-generation immigrants are also less likely to endorse meritocratic views, which is similarly correlated with decreasing strength of ethnic identity. These attributes are all associated with poorer mental health.  Possible benefits of ethnic enclaves  :See: Barrio advantage First-generation immigrants often settle in ethnic enclaves, which carry a host of advantages. Residents of these neighborhoods have access to a strong and supportive network of same-ethnicity peers and potential access to culturally sensitive healthcare providers that may allow for increased financial gain and better physical and mental health outcomes. Ethnic enclaves also eliminate the challenges associated with language barriers, with residents often sharing linguistic similarity.  Healthy immigrant selection  Another common explanation for the immigrant paradox is that the vast majority of superior outcomes among early generations of immigrants can be accounted for by a selection effect. Proponents of this hypothesis argue that only the most psychologically and physically healthy individuals migrate from their country of origin, and therefore have superior outcomes to begin with.  Methodological concerns  Much of the literature on the immigrant paradox in mental health relies on self-report data. This may be problematic in that certain populations may differentially interpret questions in ways that are meaningful and result in significant disparities between groups. Similarly, many measures view mental health solely through a Western lens, accounting only for the types of symptoms commonly expressed in Western societies. This may result in the underreporting of poor mental health among non-Western populations. Another issue in research on immigrants is the grouping of highly diverse ethnic groups together in monolithic racial categories, namely the pan-ethnic \\"Asian\\" and \\"Latino\\" categories. Much of the research on Latinos and the immigrant paradox has been conducted with Mexican American populations, ignoring the fact that there are 32 other countries that fall under the Latin American label. Similarly, much research on Asian Americans has been conducted with East Asian populations, ignoring the differential treatment and experiences of South and Southeast Asians, and the different refugee status of individuals across Asia (examples include Lhotshampa refugees, who are of South Asian heritage, and Cambodian refugees, who are of Southeast Asian heritage). Such groupings are problematic in that they erase the large diversity in socioeconomic status, educational background, and historical trauma of each of these ethnic groups ‚Äì factors which all contribute to the consequent positive or negative outcomes of immigrants. == Future directions in immigrant research == Carola Su√°rez- Orozco, Ph.D. calls for increased research on the psychology of immigrants paying attention to differences in refugee status, documentation status, gender, and ethnic group (in lieu of using pan-ethnic groupings). Research must also consider seasonal migrants, the differential racialization of ethnic groups, and the role of English proficiency on educational and health outcomes. == See also == * Acculturation * Americanization (immigration) * Health equity * Hispanic paradox * Mental health inequality * Minority stress ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Acculturation: Advances in Theory, Measurement, and Applied Research.

The two longest serving were assisted with training in 2015 by the local territorial force in Cheshire. Although volunteers, they were not appointed as special constable as they work for a private constabulary. In August and October 2017 they were joined by 3 former Special Constables, leaving Chester Cathedral Constabulary with five serving cathedral constables. ==Present Day== In June 2017 a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by Chester Cathedral Constables (represented by Inspector Chris Jones) and Cheshire Constabulary (represented by the Chief Constable). Under the terms of the MoU the territorial police force acknowledges the right of sworn cathedral constables to carry rigid batons and handcuffs, and to carry out arrests. The cathedral constables agree to deliver all arrested persons to Cheshire Constabulary for processing and custody. The MoU also acknowledges that the cathedral constables will be the initial point of contact for all policing matters on cathedral Dean & Chapter property, passing offences of a serious nature to the territorial force. ==Ranks== In common with other members of the Cathedral Constables Association (CCA), the former positions of Head Constable and Deputy Head Constable have now been replaced with the ranks of Inspector and Sergeant.

Until then, Bra≈°ovan had already completed his independent work on the building of the former Eskontna banka in Nu≈°iƒáeva Street. The combined baroque-classicist eclectic style of this work had given Bra≈°ovan a level of fame in Belgrade. ≈†karka‚Äôs Villa was built during 1926-1927 as a city villa. Academic principles, romantic spirit, historic motifs, tinges of modern ideas and art deco surface treatment are recognized in the design of the main street facade of the building. The facade is made in one plane, and the decorative elements which are taken from the historical styles - Romanic, Venetian Gothic and Baroque - contribute to its vividness. Strict academic division of the facade was abandoned, and the architect approached its layered processing in a creative way. The flat surface of the floor is in contrast to the rustic treatment of the lower part with gable motifs, diamond cubes very close to Czech Cubism, and windows completed with blind arcades. The floor is dominated by romantic trifora filled with floral, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic motifs, placed between modernist treated window openings without special emphasis. The fa√ßade ends with a decorative pronged roof attic. The motif of the pointed arch and Baroque volutas is repeated on the monumental entrance gate, whose doors are resolved in the form of a very decoratively treated metal grille. Today, the Embassy of Belarus is located in this luxurious city mansion. ==Design== A modernist approach is revealed in the realisation of detail. Deviating from the academic principles, Bra≈°ovan separated the ornamental decoration into clearly determined continents, which made elements of modern architecture prominent. Opposed and at the same time unified broad-sided surfaces and ornament, arch and sharp angle, curved and straight line and motifs of different historical styles in a very modern arrangement make this fa√ßade of the most unusual fa√ßades and one of the most charming fa√ßades in Belgrade. Unlike most of his contemporaries, Dragi≈°a Bra≈°ovan also paid special attention to the less prominent facades, achieving the unity of the overall appearance of the building in morphological and stylistic terms. The well-equipped interior corresponds to the lush exterior finish. On the ceiling of the circular hall of the ground floor, a mural of an unknown artist is preserved to date. ==Recognition== In 1927, the facade of ≈†karka‚Äôs Villa received an award as one of the most beautiful facades in Belgrade. ≈†karka‚Äôs Villa is a building of significant architectural and cultural-historical value. It is one of the most successful examples of Bra≈°ovan‚Äôs architecture of city villas, and as a rare building of romantic spirit, it occupies a special place in Belgrade's interwar architecture. As a building of significant architectural and cultural-historical value, ≈†karka‚Äôs Villa was declared a cultural monument in 2002 (Decision, Official Gazette of RS, no. 73/02). == See more == * List of cultural monuments in Belgrade == Literature == * K. ƒÜiriƒá, ≈†karkina vila, Zavod za za≈°titu spomenika kulture grada Beograda, Beograd 2011. * Dokumentacija ZZSKGB, SK-296 Z.

It Is Now is the third live album by English hard rock band Thunder. Recorded on 4 May 2000 at Dingwalls in London, the last date of the band's UK Farewell Tour, it was produced by the band's guitarists Luke Morley and Ben Matthews, both of whom also mixed it. The album was initially released on 10 July 2000 as the band's first release on Papillon Records. It was later issued in Europe by Repertoire Records on 27 November 2000. Thunder announced in November 1999 that they were due to split up, following one last concert tour. The band's final show before disbanding took place on 4 May 2000 at Dingwalls in London, featuring an opening acoustic set followed by a regular \\"electric\\" set. They Think It's All Over... It Is Now features eleven of the fifteen electric songs and eight of the twelve acoustic songs. The album was the first release by Thunder following the band's breakup. They Think It's All Over... It Is Now registered at number 108 on the UK Albums Chart and number 7 on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart. A second album recorded at the same show was released on 14 May 2001 ‚Äì They Think It's All Acoustic... It Is Now features all but one of the recordings from the acoustic set (only the performance of \\"New York, New York\\" is excluded). Both albums were reissued in the UK by STC Recordings on 28 September 2005. ==Background== On 5 November 1999, Thunder released a statement which revealed that they had decided to break up. The announcement explained that \\"After a great deal of exploration, discussion and soul searching, we have decided to split up. The reasons are many and complex, but to cut a long story short, we feel we have no choice. We must stress that this decision is due to outside business forces and not down to any personal or musical differences within the band.\\" Speaking later about the band's breakup, vocalist Danny Bowes explained that \\"I felt by late 1999 that we couldn't compete, and I was very fed up\\", adding that \\"Basically, I'd had enough\\". Both Bowes and guitarist Luke Morley expressed frustration with the band's frequent change of record labels, including their latest label Eagle Records. Starting the following month, the band completed an official farewell tour, beginning with a run of UK shows wrapping up on 11 December at The Forum in London. A Japanese leg of the tour followed in March 2000, before the band played one final UK show at Dingwalls in London. The show featured two sets ‚Äì one acoustic and one electric ‚Äì both of which were filmed for an intended video release, however technical problems prevented the film from being made. Recalling the show in 2016, Bowes complained that \\"All kinds of bullshit went on. The sound was dreadful and we all hated it. It wasn't a great way to end, although we did record the audio and the audience was great, as usual.\\" They Think It's All Over... It Is Now was released on 10 July 2000 by Papillon Records as a limited edition numbered double CD set. It was released later in Europe by Repertoire Records, on 27 November 2000. The album debuted at number 108 on the UK Albums Chart and number 7 on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart. Another album recorded at the same show, They Think It's All Acoustic...

The film contrasts the daring work of McComber and his coworkers in the skies above New York with life back home in Kahnawake. It also explains how the Mohawk people living across the Saint Lawrence River from Montreal first gained their reputation for high steel work in the late 19th century, working on a railway bridge that ran through their land. However, as the film recounts through narration and archival photos, such a reputation came at a terrible cost: while working on the Quebec Bridge further down river near Quebec City, dozens of Mohawks were among the 75 men killed during its 1907 construction collapse‚Äîwith a devastating impact on the small community. While celebrating their courage and skill, the film also makes plain how Mohawks are forced to leave home in order to make a living, with McComber regretting that his sons have had to grow up without their father. == Production == The film's director of photography was John Spotton, with Don Francks as narrator, Julian Biggs as producer, and with a song by Bruce Mackay, \\"Mountains of Iron and Steel\\" (replacing Gordon Lightfoot, who was originally supposed to have provided music). The film was shot using 35 mm cameras, with film crews having to gain access to the construction site high above the ground by traversing a ladder from an adjacent building. == Reception == High Steel received the Canadian Film Award for Best Editing. It also received a Special Youth Prize from the Berlin International Film Festival. ==Further reading== * ==ReferencesExternal links== * * (requires Adobe Flash) * Category:1966 films Category:Films directed by Don Owen Category:Documentary films about First Nations Category:Documentary films about New York City Category:Films set in Manhattan Category:National Film Board of Canada short films Category:National Film Board of Canada documentaries Category:First Nations history in Quebec Category:Mohawk culture Category:Canadian short documentary films Category:Quebec films Category:Canadian films ","title":"High Steel"},{"id":"54221114","text":"Everything's OK may refer to: * Everything's OK (EP), a 1998 EP by The Queers * Everything's OK (album), a 2005 album by Al Green ","title":"Everything's OK"},{"id":"54221120","text":"Bunoo Sutton (born 2 June 1909, date of death unknown) was an Indian sprinter.

It helps a Network Administrator locate and troubleshoot bottlenecks like network delay, data loss and availability of any network link across on-premises networks, Microsoft Azure VNets, Amazon Web Services VPCs, hybrid networks, VPNs or even public internet links. ==About Operations Management Suite== Operations Management Suite (OMS) is a cloud-based solution for IT management that gives operational insights by correlating the logs and performance data collected from any Operating System (Microsoft Windows as well as Linux) or application deployed in cloud (Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services) or on-premises. It monitors IT infrastructure and provides more visibility and control by identifying and assessing security risks, automating administrative tasks using PowerShell, and cloud integrated backups for business continuity. ==Network Performance Monitor== Network Performance Monitor (NPM) is a network monitoring solution from the Operations Management Suite, that monitors networks. NPM monitors the availability of connectivity and quality of connectivity between multiple locations within and across campuses, private and public clouds. The solution uses synthetic transactions to test for reachability and can be used on any IP network, irrespective of the make and model of network routers and switches deployed. Topology map Hop by hop metrics ==Features== * A dashboard is generated to display summarized information about the Network including Network health events, unhealthy Network links, and Subnetwork links with most loss and most latency. Custom dashboards can also be created to find the state of the network at a point-in- time in history. * An interactive topology map is also generated to show the routes between Nodes. Network administrator can use it to distinguish the unhealthy path to find out the root cause of the issue. * Alerts can be configured to send e-mails to stakeholders when a threshold is reached. Runbooks can also be triggered to take auto corrective action. Use cases *Two on-premises networks: Monitor connectivity between two office sites which could be connected using MPLS WAN link or VPN *Multiple sites: Monitor connectivity to a central site from multiple sites. For example: scenarios where users from multiple office locations are accessing applications hosted at a central location *Hybrid Networks: Monitor connectivity between on- premises and Azure VNets that could be connected using S2S VPN or ExpressRoute *Multiple Virtual Networks in Cloud: Monitor connectivity between multiple VNets in same or different Azure regions. These could be peered VNets or Vnets connected using VPN. *Any Cloud: Monitor connectivity between Amazon Web Services and on-premises Networks. And also between Amazon Web Services and Azure VNets. ==How Network Performance Monitor works?== The solution does not require any access to network devices. Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) or OMS extension (valid only for Virtual machines hosted in Azure) is to be installed on the servers in the Subnetworks that are to be monitored. # OMS Agent auto downloads the Network Monitoring Intelligence Packs which spawns NPM agent that detects the subnets it is connected to and this information is sent to OMS. # NPM Agent gets to know the list of IP address of other agents from OMS. # NPM Agent IP starts active probes using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Ping and the roundtrip time for a ping between two nodes is used to calculate network performance metrics such as packet loss and link latency. This data is pushed to OMS where its used to create customizable dashboard. A video based demo of NPM is available online. Synthetic Transactions NPM uses synthetic transactions to test for reachability and calculate network performance metrics across the network. Tests are performed, using either TCP or ICMP and users have the option of choosing between these protocols. Users must evaluate their environments and weigh the pros and cons of the protocols. The following is a summary of the differences. * TCP provides more accurate results compared to ICMP ECHO because Routers and switches assign lower priority to ICMP ECHO packets compared to TCP Ping. * TCP needs configuration of network firewall and local firewall on the computers where agents are installed to allow traffic on default port 8084. Some other port can also be chosen for this. * ICMP does not need to configure firewall but it needs more agents to provide information about all the paths between two subnets. So, the OMS agent must be installed on more machines in the subnet as compared to when TCP is used. A detailed write-up on the selection of the appropriate protocol is available on TechNet. ==Timeline== * February 27, 2017 NPM Solution became generally available (GA).

Bell, 556 U.S. 449 (2009), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant was entitled to a hearing to determine whether prosecutors in his 1982 death penalty trial violated his right to due process by withholding exculpatory evidence.. The defendant, Gary Cone, filed a petition for postconviction relief from a 1982 death sentence in which he argued that prosecutors violated his rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment by withholding police reports and witness statements that potentially could have shown that his drug addiction affected his behavior. In an opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Supreme Court held that Cone was entitled to a hearing to determine whether the prosecution's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence violated Cone's right to due process; the Court noted that \\"the quantity and the quality of the suppressed evidence lends support to Cone‚Äôs position at trial that he habitually used excessive amounts of drugs, that his addiction affected his behavior during his crime spree\\".Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. 449, 471, 476 (2009). In 2016, Gary Cone died from natural causes while still sitting on Tennessee's death row.Stuart Ervin, Death row inmate Gary Cone dies WSMV (April 20, 2016). ==Background== In 1982, Gary Cone was convicted and sentenced to death for a crime spree that included the robbery of a jewelry store, a police pursuit, and the murder of an elderly couple.. At trial, Cone's attorney argued that he was not guilty by reason of insanity, and several experts testified that Cone suffered from a long history of drug abuse and post traumatic stress disorder resulting from his military service during the Vietnam War.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 690. According to one expert, Cone's long-term drug abuse caused hallucinations and paranoia that \\"affected respondent's mental capacity and ability to obey the law.\\"Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 690 (noting that Cone's drug use caused \\"chronic amphetamine psychosis, hallucinations, and ongoing paranoia\\"). The jury rejected Cone's insanity defense and found him guilty on all counts.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 690. At a sentencing hearing, Cone's attorney did not present evidence of Cone's drug use as mitigating evidence.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 706 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Cone's attorney also waived his final argument so that the prosecutors would not have an opportunity for a rebuttal argument.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 691‚Äì92. The trial court ultimately sentenced Cone to death, and on appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed Cone's convictions and sentence.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 692 (citing State v. Cone, 665 S.W. 2d. 87 (1984)). ==Previous petitions for postconviction relief== After the Tennessee Supreme Court denied Cone's direct appeal in 1984, Cone filed a petition for postconviction relief in which he argued that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by waiving his closing argument and by failing to present mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase of his trial.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 692. After conducting a hearing on Cone's petition, a Tennessee state court rejected Cone's contentions, and the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the lower court's ruling.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 692 (citing Cone v. State, 747 S.W. 2d. 353 (1987)). The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that Cone's attorney acted within an acceptable range of competency and that Cone \\"received the death penalty based on the law and facts, not on the shortcomings of counsel.\\"Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 692 (citing Cone v. State, 747 S.W. 2d. at 356‚Äì58). Both the Tennessee Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court declined to consider further appeals.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 692 (citing Cone v. Tennessee, 488 U. S. 871 (1988)). In 1997, Cone filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 692‚Äì93. In his petition, he alleged that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial, but the federal district court denied his petition.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 693. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling with respect to Cone's conviction, but it revered the district court's ruling with respect to Cone's sentence.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 693 (citing Cone v. Bell, 243 F.3d 961, 979 (6th Cir. 2001)). The Sixth Circuit held that Cone \\"suffered a Sixth Amendment violation for which prejudice should be presumed\\" because his attorney's failure to ask for mercy \\"did not subject the State's call for the death penalty to meaningful adversarial testing.\\"Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 693 (citing Cone v. Bell, 243 F.3d at 979) (quotation taken from Supreme Court opinion). Additionally, the Sixth Circuit held that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals decision constituted \\"an unreasonable application of the clearly established law\\".Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 693 (citing Cone v. Bell, 243 F.3d at 979; ) (quotation taken from Supreme Court opinion). In 2001, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.Bell v.Cone, 534 U.S. 1064 (2001). Bell v. Cone In Bell v. Cone, in an opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's ruling and remanded the case to the Sixth Circuit for further proceedings.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 693, 702. Chief Justice Rehnquist stated that the Tennessee state court correctly identified Strickland v. Washington's two-part test as the proper legal standard for effective assistance of counsel when it rejected Cone's petition for postconviction relief.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 698 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688, 694) (\\"We hold, therefore, that the state court correctly identified the principles announced in Strickland as those governing the analysis of respondent's claim.\\"). Citing various \\"tactical reasons\\" why Cone's attorney did not present mitigating evidence, Chief Justice Rehnquist concluded that the jury still had an opportunity to consider whether \\"evidence of a mental disease or defect\\" should mitigate Cone's ultimate sentence.Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 699‚Äì701. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that Cone's attorney \\"entirely fail[ed] to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.\\"Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. at 702, 718‚Äì19 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659 (1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further proceedings in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit On remand, the Sixth Circuit ordered a new sentencing hearing \\"based on the purported invalidity of an aggravating circumstance found by the jury.\\"Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. at 463 (citing Cone v. Bell, 359 F.3d 785 (6th Cir. 2004). In a per curiam opinion, Bell v. Cone (2005), the United States Supreme Court again reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision. (per curiam). The case then returned to the Sixth Circuit for a third time.Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. at 463. In a 2007 opinion, the Sixth Circuit reconsidered whether the prosecution violated Cone's rights to due process under the Fourteenth AmendmentSee . by withholding police reports and witness statements that potentially could have corroborated his claims about the effects of his drug use. The Sixth Circuit rejected Cone's claims, holding the due process claims were procedurally barred by the Tennessee state courts in prior proceedings.Cone v. Bell, 492 F.3d at 753. The Sixth Circuit noted that even if the police reports and witness statements were admitted, they would not outweigh \\"overwhelming evidence of Cone‚Äôs guilt in committing a brutal double murder and the persuasive testimony that Cone was not under the influence of drugs.\\"Cone v. Bell, 492 F.3d at 756. ==Opinion of the Court== The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated the Sixth Circuit's 2007 ruling.Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. at 464, 476 (\\"We granted certiorari to answer the question whether a federal habeas claim is 'procedurally defaulted' when it is twice presented to the state courts.\\" (Internal quotations omitted)). In an opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Supreme Court held that Cone's due process claims should not have been procedurally barred, and the Supreme Court remanded the case to the United States District Court that first examined Cone's habeas petition, \\"with instructions to give full consideration to the merits of Cone‚Äôs [due process] claim.\\"Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. at 476. Justice Stevens noted that \\"the quantity and the quality of the suppressed evidence lends support to Cone‚Äôs position at trial that he habitually used excessive amounts of drugs, that his addiction affected his behavior during his crime spree, and that the State‚Äôs arguments to the contrary were false and misleading.\\"Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. at 471.

Considered the fastest sprinter who‚Äôs ever logged track time, Bolt is a hero to millions and admired on a level comparable to global sports legends like Muhammad Ali and Pele.\\" Xan Brooks of The Guardian gave it 2/5, stating \\"Fans of Usain Bolt will find much to relish in this gushing homage to the nine-time Olympic gold medallist, which chases its idol from his 2015 slump, via scenes of downtime in Jamaica to the podium in Rio. == References  External links == * Category:Sports films based on actual events Category:Running films Category:Biographical films about sportspeople Category:Documentary films about sportspeople Category:2010s biographical films Category:2016 films Category:Pel√© Category:Cultural depictions of track and field athletes Category:Cultural depictions of Jamaican men ","title":"I Am Bolt"},{"id":"54221359","text":"Mario Marques (born 15 May 1909, date of death unknown) was a Brazilian sprinter.

It is a parasitoid of whiteflies of the family Aleyrodidae. ==Description== Baeoentedon balios adults are around 0.9 mm in length, the head and thorax are metallic blue-black in colour, while the abdomen is pale yellow. The antennae have a largely white scape with a pale pedicel and its legs are coloured pale yellow. The hyaline forewing has an apical transverse brown cloud. ==Distribution== Baeoentedon balios was described in 2014 from specimens taken from Xiamen in Fujian, in December 2014 it was discovered in Homestead, Florida, the first record of the genus Baeoentedon in the New World. A survey in 2015 recorded balios wasps in four counties of southern Florida, Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach. Within Florida the wasp is likely to be spread by being transported with Ficus trees infested with whiteflies. ==Biology== Baeoentedon balios is a parasitoid of whitefly, specifically ficus whiteflies. The type specimen was reared from Pealius spina which had been collected on Ficus religiosa. These wasps develop through six distinct stages from the egg through three larval instars, a pupa like stage and an imago and this takes 19‚Äì24 days at room temperature. They are able to parasitise whitefly nymphs in the first, second and third instars but they appear to prefer the second instar. As well as parasitizing the nymphs the wasps can also cause high level of mortality among them when they are probed by or fed on by the adults, 76% of the first instar nymphs which were probed or fed on by adult balios wasps subsequently died. A parasitized nymph has a tiny pinhole on its right side in the middle and turns dark yellow and as it grows the asp larva can be visible. When the adult wasp emerges it creates a neat round hole in the nymph's exoskeleton. Encarsia variegate has been recorded as a hyperparasitoid of B. balios.

It was released June 23, 2017 by Third Man Records on CD and single sided 12\\" vinyl. == Production == The first track, \\"I'm Watching You\\", was recorded during the same sessions as the Monks' last single \\"Love Can Tame the Wild\\"/\\"He Went Down to the Sea\\". The remaining tracks were recorded after hours at The Top Ten Club in Hamburg, after the manager, Ricky Barnes, revealed he had a recording booth set up in the club they were performing at nightly. Under pressure from Polydor, they veered away from the harder Monk's style to a softer sound more like the mainstream music of the day. The vocal track for \\"Yellow Grass\\" went missing, so is presented here as an instrumental. The recording of \\"I'm Watching You\\" was obtained by Gary Burger with the collection of one of the Monks' managers, Walther Niemann, who had died. He played it for Ben Blackwell of Third Man Records during a visit to Nashville, after which they tried to coordinate a 7\\" release of it, but it did not come to pass. After Burger died, Blackwell and Eddie Shaw approached his widow inquiring if there were any other Monks recordings in the collection. She found tapes containing multiple mixes of the Top Ten Club recordings. Some mistakes were found in the recordings that were corrected in the final mixes with help from Shaw. According to Shaw, the last track \\"Yellow Grass\\" had a vocal track, but this had apparently disappeared, so it is presented here as an instrumental. == Critical reception == Pitchfork gave the EP a 6.9 out of 10 stating that the lighter tone of the music reflect the Monks' Hamburg contemporaries rather than the proto-punk pioneers they became revered as. == Track listing  References == * == External links == * Category:2017 EPs Category:The Monks albums Category:Third Man Records EPs ","title":"Hamburg Recordings 1967"},{"id":"54221406","text":"Alan Lucien √òyen is a choreographer, writer, and director from Bergen, Norway.

It was to be located on the western edge of what is now St Helier on the border between the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton, in south-west London. ==Plan== Railway bridge over Love Lane, location of the proposed Elm Farm station The station was to have been built on the W&SR;'s planned surface railway line in Surrey (now south-west London) from Wimbledon to Sutton. The station was to be on the south side of Love Lane. The construction of the railway was approved in 1910. In 1911 the UERL agreed to provide funding for the line's construction and to operate its train services by extending the UERL's District Railway (DR) from Wimbledon station. Delays in the purchase of land along the railway's route and the outbreak of war prevented the works from commencing and the permission was extended several times with a final extension granted in 1922. Following the war, the UERL presented new proposals to construct an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;, now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden in tunnel where it would come to the surface and join the W&SR; route. Both DR and C&SLR; trains would run to Sutton. The revised proposals omitted Elm Farm station from the W&SR; route. The plan to extend the C&SLR; was opposed by the Southern Railway (SR), the operator of the mainline services through Wimbledon and Sutton. A settlement between the companies agreed that the extension of the C&SLR; would end at Morden and the W&SR; would be taken over and its route would be constructed by the SR. When the Wimbledon to Sutton line was constructed by the SR in the late 1920s, the nearest station to the proposed site of Elm Farm was St Helier to the north. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Unbuilt London Underground stations Category:Proposed London Underground stations Category:Unopened tube stations in the London Borough of Merton ","title":"Elm Farm tube station"},{"id":"54221491","text":"H√©ctor Berra (23 September 1909 ‚Äì 4 November 1977) was an Argentine track and field athlete.

He can solve a serious mystery while reading out his nonsense poems. == Stories == Premendra Mitra wrote a good number of Detective fictions of Parashor Barma, some of are: * Hippie Songe Parashor Barma (Parashor Barma in Hippie Company) * Cluber naam kumati (The Club named Kumati) * Nilem daklo parashor Barma (Parashor Called an Auction) * Premer Chokhe Parashor (Parashor in the Eye of Love) * Haar manlen Parashor Barma * Parashor Barma O Bhanga Radio (Parashor Barma and the Broken Radio) * Parashor Barma O Ashlil Boi (Parashor Barma and a Obscene Book) * Parashor Ebar Johuri (Parashor the Jeweler) * Anke kancha Parashor Barma(Parashor Barma's math is poor) * Wrong number Two Ghanada tales also include Parashar Barma : Parasharey Ghanaday and Ghanada Phirlen. == References == Category:Fictional Bengali people Category:Fictional male detectives Category:Culture of Kolkata Category:Fictional private investigators Category:Fictional Indian people ","title":"Parashor Barma"},{"id":"54221610","text":"Casio calculator character sets are a group of character sets used by various Casio calculators and pocket computers. == Code charts ==  fx-9860G series  { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } ÔøΩ Not in Unicode  Character set 0x7F  { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 }  Character set 0xE5  { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 }  Character set 0xE6  { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 }  Character set 0xF9  { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } * Back control code. * Forward control code. * Down control code. * First from left control code.

The larvae feed on the foliage of many species of native and imported pines. This species was named after John Lawrence LeConte, an American entomologist of the 19th century. ==Taxonomy== It forms part of the N. lecontei species group, which consists of a clade of about twenty closely related species which have been intensively studied. The genome has been sequenced and consists of 330 MB arranged on seven chromosomes. ==Description== The adult N. lecontei has membranous wings and a broad waist and is between long, with the males being somewhat smaller than the females. Males have feathery antennae while females have serrated ones with nineteen segments. Males are entirely black and are more slender than the robust females, which have reddish-brown heads and thorax, and mainly black abdomens, sometimes with white on the sides. The larvae resemble the caterpillars of lepidopterans; young larvae are whitish with brown heads while older larvae are yellowish-green with up to eight longitudinal rows of black spots, and brown heads. They have three pairs of legs at the front and six to seven pairs of prolegs at the rear. ==Distribution== N. lecontei is native to eastern North America. Its range extends from southeastern Canada westwards to the Great Plains and southwards to Texas and Florida. ==Host range== The larvae feed on many members of the pine family. In the northern part of its range, it favours hard or yellow pines such as Pinus banksiana and Pinus resinosa. Further south, it prefers Pinus echinata, Pinus taeda, Pinus elliottii and Pinus palustris. Trees less than tall are frequently attacked, and plantations of pine established in the 1930s saw the insect reach pest proportions. Other host trees that the larvae will feed on include Pinus virginiana, Pinus strobus and Pinus sylvestris, and if nothing else is available, Picea abies, Cedrus deodara and Larix spp. ==Life cycle== The adult female sawfly cuts slits in pine needles with her ovipositor and deposits one egg in each slit. These appear pale and give the needle a banded appearance. The eggs hatch after about four weeks. The young larvae feed on the sides of the pine needle, leaving an uneaten central section which withers and dies, remaining on the tree giving a distinctive straw-like effect. Older larvae eat the whole needle before moving on to the next. The larvae are gregarious, and can strip whole branches and trees of needles. If the tree is completely defoliated, the larvae move as a group onto a neighboring tree, or may start chewing at the soft bark of twigs. When their development is finished, they drop to the ground and spin cocoons in the needle litter or underground. Here they overwinter as prepupae, pupating in the spring and biting their way out of one end of the cocoon to emerge as adults. Some individuals may not emerge as adults until the following year, or have an extended diapause. In the northern part of the range there is a single generation each year, but further south there may be two or three, sometimes overlapping, generations. == References == Category:Tenthredinoidea Category:Pest insects Category:Insects described in 1859 Category:Hymenoptera of North America ","title":"Neodiprion lecontei"},{"id":"54221652","text":"Richard Alois is a Papua New Guinean footballer who usually plays as a forward.

It was published quarterly from 1983 to 1986, and bimonthly from 1986 to 1993. Based on a suggestion made by company president Masaya Nakamura, NG provided information and other content relating to Namco-published video games. Additional content was added as the magazine progressed, such as crafts, developer interviews, fan mail, and two manga series illustrated by Hiroshi Fuji. NG, which stood for \\"Namco Games\\", was created as a way for Namco developers to connect with the company's fans. The magazine was sold primarily through Namco-owned video arcades across the country, though it was also made available through other arcades and mail-order delivery. The magazine endured several financial difficulties, before it was retired in 1993 and replaced with Nours, a similar publication that continues to the present day. NG is fondly remembered by its fans, and has received praise retrospectively for its content and overall quality. The name was repurposed for a video game brand in 2010 and its manga series have since been reprinted as standalone novels. ==History== Old NG logo (1983‚Äî1989) Namco Community Magazine NG launched in Japan on February 15, 1983. Its creation was suggested by Namco founder and president Masaya Nakamura as a way for the company's developers to connect and interact directly with its fans. The magazine was headed by new-hire \\"Esuko\\", who also provided mailing duties. NG, standing for \\"Namco Games\\", was published quarterly in its early years and sold primarily at Namco-operated video arcades free of charge. The original goal of the magazine was to promote and provide the latest information on Namco's video games, merchandise, and other products to its readers, while simultaneously allowing company developers to interact with fans of their games and vice versa. Namco specifically designed the format of NG in a way that made it easy-to-understand and flow properly for readers. Early issues of NG were presented as more of a newsletter, featuring advertisements and information on Namco-related goods. Additional content was added as the magazine continued, including fan letters, developer interviews, papercraft models, and drawing workshops hosted by sprite artist Hiroshi \\"Mr. Dotman\\" Ono. Among the most notable additions were Mei Rou Yakata no Chana (Labyrinth of Chana) and GoGo no Kuni (Afternoon Country), two manga series illustrated by Valkyrie no B≈çken character artist Hiroshi Fuji. NG also provided information regarding Namco's overseas operations, such as the impact of Pac-Man in North America. After the first fourteen issues, NG switched from being distributed quarterly to bimonthly in November 1986. The magazine started being sold through retail stores, in addition to other competing video arcades. The switch from quarterly to bimonthly resulted in a reset in the issue number on the front cover, alongside a page size increase from A5 to B4 and issues now costing a small fee. Readers were able to receive previous issues directly from Namco via mail order, however budget constraints prevented mass-production. As such, NG issues became increasingly harder to find, while video arcades began giving away older issues for free. With little income being generated from the magazine, Namco chose to retire NG on April 4, 1993; its final issue featured a congratulatory letter from the writing staff and other designers within the company. It was succeeded months later by Nours, a similar magazine that featured many of the same writers and staff members. When Namco merged with Bandai to form Namco Bandai Holdings in 2005, Nours was renamed B-Nours, continuing until it was merged with sister publication Side-B in April 2009. The current iteration of the magazine, Side-876, is available as a digital newsletter on the company's website. ==Legacy== Namco Community Magazine NG is fondly remembered by its readers for its content and way of distribution. Retrospective feedback on the magazine has been positive; Ranbu Yoshida, a writer for Famitsu, described the magazine's content as \\"really rich in variety\\" with plenty of interesting, provocative material. He believed NG was an influential publication for the way it was distributed, in addition to its overall quality. Yoshida showed appreciation particularly towards Afternoon Country with its detailed imagery and plot, calling it \\"something that cannot be expressed in words will remain in my heart.\\" Gaming Alexandria founder Dustin Hubbard enjoyed its interesting write-ups and overall quality, writing that \\"they do not disappoint\\" for its small size. However, he commented on the \\"bit of a mess\\" that is the issue numbers, due to the way it was originally distributed. In 2010, Namco Bandai Games (Namco's successor) announced the creation of a brand named Namco Generations, which was used for modernized remakes of classic Namco video games such as Pac-Man and Galaga. Each Namco Generations game came with a free digital newsletter that provided information on current and upcoming projects, a move believed to have been inspired by NG. The brand was discontinued in 2012 due to a lack of updates and the quality of its releases. In August 2019, Fuji revived Labyrinth of Chana in the form of a graphic novel. As the original manga left on a cliffhanger as a result of NGs discontinuation, the novel begins after the events of the magazine's final issue, with Fuji claiming that additional novels are in production. ==NotesReferences== Category:Video game magazines published in Japan Category:Magazines established in 1983 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1993 Category:Monthly magazines published in Japan Category:Namco Category:Video game magazines ","title":"Namco Community Magazine NG"},{"id":"54221878","text":"Wolff is an unincorporated community in Washington Township, Morgan County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==Geography== Wolff is located at . ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Morgan County, Indiana Category:Unincorporated communities in Indiana ","title":"Wolff, Indiana"},{"id":"54221886","text":"Klock Hill is a mountain located in Central New York region of New York southwest of Burlington, New York.

Rebels and government forces fought for control of the city's Palestinian refugee camp, a built-up residential area of the city. == Background == In mid-February 2017, the Syrian rebels launched a major offensive against government forces in Daraa city. Rebels initially captured a large part of the al-Manshiyah District, but the offensive soon stalled. By mid-March, the Syrian Army claimed to have regained almost all of the positions it had lost, with less than 25% of Manishiyah remaining under rebel control. However, a renewed rebel attack in early April left the rebels in control of 80% of Manshiyah.

On 3 June, the rebels launched a new attack in Manshiyah, but were repelled. In retaliation for the attack, the Army heavily shelled rebel-held parts of the city the following day.

Final preparations were also concluded for a ground attack with the arrival of the Syrian Army's Fourth Division. Between 10 and 11 June, five FSA commanders were reported killed in Daraa. According to pro-government sources, some of these were as a result of a direct rocket strike on a rebel headquarters amid an intensified bombing campaign by the Army. On 11 June, government forces reportedly made their first territorial advance by capturing most of the School Complex area in the Daraa Camp suburb, a former Palestinian refugee camp. On 12 June, vicious fighting took place in the Palestinian camp, with reports stating the Syrian Army had captured between 30% and 50% of the neighborhood. Rebel forces responded with mortar shelling of government-held neighborhoods of the city.

The episode was written by Harley Peyton, and directed by series co-creator David Lynch. It features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean, Ray Wise and Richard Beymer; and guest stars Chris Mulkey as Hank Jennings, Miguel Ferrer as Albert Rosenfield, David Patrick Kelly as Jerry Horne. Don S. Davis as Major Garland Briggs, Victoria Catlin as Blackie O'Reilly, Don Amendolia as Emory Battis, Frances Bay as Mrs. Tremond, Grace Zabriskie as Sarah Palmer, and Catherine E. Coulson as the Log Lady. Twin Peaks centers on the investigation into the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), in the small rural town in Washington state after which the series is named. In this episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) continues his investigation on Laura Palmer's murder together with Sheriff Truman (Ontkean), and FBI Special Agent Albert Rosenfield (Ferrer). In the meanwhile, Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) and Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) continue their separate attempts at investigating, respectively by taking Laura's place in the Meals on Wheels, her community service, and by working undercover in the \\"One Eyed Jack's\\", a brothel where Laura has worked in the past. \\"Episode 9\\" was broadcast on October 8, 1990, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and was watched by an audience of 14.4 million households in the United States. Critical response to the episode was mainly positive. ==Plot== Background The small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has been sent to the town to investigate. After being shot, Cooper has met the Giant (Carel Struycken), an enigmatic figure who gave him three clues; two of these will prove as true and fundamental to the investigation, clearing Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re) from Teresa Banks' murder and predicting that Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) has been murdered. At the One Eyed Jacks, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) manages to avoid a sexual experience with her father Ben Horne (Richard Beymer), which causes friction between her and the brothel's manager Blackie O'Reilly (Victoria Catlin). In Twin Peaks, after the burning of the Packard Sawmill arranged by Leo, Shelly Johnson (M√§dchen Amick) is confirmed to have survived while Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) remains missing. Events During their breakfast together at the Great Northern Hotel, Dale Cooper explains to a visibly uninterested Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) Buddhist Tibetan history and traditions. Albert then proceeds to update Cooper over the progress made on their investigation during his absence, including that Jacques Renault was not strangled but smothered with a pillow, that the mill was definitely arson and that Leo Johnson is the most likely suspect and that Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine) woke up from her coma, but has not spoken yet. Albert then informs a visibly shocked Cooper that his former partner, Windom Earle, has escaped the psychiatric hospital in which he was institutionalized. An Asian man (Mak Takano) observes them intently for the whole time. Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) has taken over Laura's community service at the Meals on Wheels. She serves a tray of food to bed-ridden Mrs. Tremond (Frances Bay), who complains about the presence of creamed corn in her tray. The corn disappears from the tray, and it reappears in the hands of a little boy (Austin Jack Lynch) whom the woman refers to as her grandson \\"studying magic.\\" When Donna asks her if she knew Laura Palmer, Mrs. Tremond denies it, but she suggests asking her neighbour, Mr. Smith; since he does not answer the door, Donna leaves a message. Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman (Michael Ontkean) are in Ronette Pulaski's hospital room, interrogating her; when shown a portrait of Leo Johnson, she shakes her head, while seeing a portrait of BOB causes her to convulse violently and knock over her I.V. Wondering whether to burn the real ledger or the fake one redacted by Josie, Ben Horne (Richard Beymer) and his brother Jerry end up not burning either, deciding to toast marshmallows instead. In the Double R Diner, Deputy Andy Brennan tries to tape a poster of BOB to the door. After Norma Jennings (Peggy Lee) scolds her for spitting her chewing gum on the counter, the Log Lady (Catherine E. Coulson) tells Major Briggs (Don S. Davis) that her log tells him to \\"deliver the message\\", to which the Major replies that he understands. At the Sheriff's office, Andy reports to Lucy (Kimmy Robertson) that he was diagnosed as sterile when applying for a donation to the Tacoma Sperm Bank, and asks how she can have a child. Sheriff Truman signs in Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) and tells him to stay clean; when Hank leaves, Truman tells Cooper that he used to be one of the best Bookhouse Boys. Ben Horne calls in and reports that his daughter Audrey has been missing since two days. Jerry explains to Ben that Catherine Martell did not sign her policy, fearing that Josie would be the beneficiary. As they decide to call the Icelandic investment group, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) enters the room; when Einar, the investor, tells them that Leland already called him to tell him about the fire, Ben and Jerry calm him down. Annoyed, Ben tells Leland to concentrate on his tax returns; Leland, having spotted a poster of BOB, says that he knows him as the man who lived next to his grandfather's summer house when he was a child, and leaves to report it to the Sheriff. At the hospital, Dr. Hayward (Warren Frost) shows to a shocked Shelly Johnson (Madchen Amick) her husband Leo (Eric Da Re), telling her that his brain may be damaged. At One Eyed Jack's, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) takes the place of the girls serving Emory Battis (Don Amendolia), the manager of the Horne Department Store, and threatens him into giving her information. Emory admits that Audrey's father, Ben Horne, is the owner of the brothel, and that Emory recruited Laura Palmer and Ronette Pulaski for the brothel from their jobs at the perfume counter. He tells her that Laura was fired from the brothel for using drugs, but Ben knew that she was there and made it \\"his business to entertain all the girls.‚Äù Finally, Emory says that Laura knew that Ben was the owner of the place, and that she always got her way, just like Audrey. In Major Briggs' car, Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and Shelly talk about their relationship. Bobby tells her that they can get up to five thousands dollars a month of disability if Leo is at home. Major Briggs visits Cooper, who is recording a tape for Diane, in his room at the Great Northern Hotel. Briggs tells him that there is a message for him, and explains that part of his job is maintenance of deep space monitors aimed at distant galaxies. The message, written in clear English, is \\"the owls are not what they seem\\", and it arrived on the night in which Cooper was shot. When Cooper asks Briggs how he knew that the message was for him, Briggs shows him another message from the same night: the word \\"Cooper\\" repeated. At the Haywards' house, Donna, James Hurley (James Marshall) and Maddy Ferguson (Sheryl Lee) are recording a song called \\"Just You.\\" Noticing Maddy and James looking at each other, Donna rushes away from the room, unnerved; while James tries to console her, a call from Harold Smith arrives. In the living room, Maddy has a vision of BOB coming at her from the couch. When she screams, James and Donna reach her, and nothing is in the room. At the Great Northern, Cooper has a dream which includes part of his conversation with the Giant (Carel Struycken) and of Ronette's nightmare. He is awakened by the phone; when he answers, Audrey Horne asks him why he is not there and tells him that she is in trouble. Their conversation is interrupted by Emory Battis and Blackie O'Reilly. Blackie tells Audrey, ‚ÄúMiss Horne, you don‚Äôt know what trouble is, not by a long shot.‚Äù ==Production== alt=A man raises his hand and speaks into a microphone against a black backdrop. \\"Episode 9\\" was written by Harley Peyton and directed by David Lynch. Lynch had directed three prior episodes‚Äî\\"Pilot\\", \\"Episode 2\\" and \\"Episode 8\\". Lynch would later direct \\"Episode 14\\", the original series finale \\"Episode 29\\" and all of the installments of the limited series, while Peyton wrote or co-wrote a total of ten more episodes of the original series. ==Broadcast== \\"Episode 9\\" was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network on October 6, 1990. The initial broadcast was watched by 14.4 million households in the United States. It was considerable drop in ratings from the season premiere (19.1 million), a problem which will affect the rest of the season and which will lead the show to its eventual cancellation. Reception Critical response to the episode was positive. In his review for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps noted that the episodes \\"sows a lot of seeds for future harvest\\", particularly citing the references to Windom Earle, Harold Smith and Garland Briggs' UFO work. Phipps praised the scene in which BOB appears to Maddy, calling it \\"one of those images that capture what the show does well\\" but criticised Audrey's plotline, giving the episode as a whole a B+ rating. AllRovi's Andrea LeVasseur has noted that \\"Episode 9\\" \\"contains the first of many significant references to owls throughout the series\\", rating it four out of five stars. DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich gave a mixed response and commented that \\"side stories take a lot of the spotlight in the first half of the second season and suggest that Twin Peaks might have had a longer life as a regular cliffhanger serial had they abandoned the need for the series through-line.\\" Nerdist's Eric Diaz rated the episode 3.5 burritos out of 5 and called it \\"the least memorable of the six Lynch directed episodes\\", praising the episode as a whole but criticizing the scene in which James, Maddy and Donna sing together as \\"a black mark over an otherwise great episode.\\" ==NotesReferences== Footnotes Bibliography * ==External links== * \\"Coma\\" at Showtime * * Category:1990 American television episodes Category:Twin Peaks (season 2) episodes ","title":"Episode 9 (Twin Peaks)"},{"id":"54221924","text":"Dublin Institute of Adult Education was established by Archbishop John Charles McQuaid in 1950 as the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology, its first director was Rev.

Directed as a single shot, it is based on Goyette's stage play of the same name. The film premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival. It was nominated for three Canadian Screen Awards. ==Plot== Dave is a young man who considers himself to be a king as well as a strong man. When he sees another man dancing with his girlfriend, he sets out for revenge, walking and riding on a car and bus over nine kilometres on his way. ==CastProduction== Daniel Grou shot the film in continuous shots. Alexandre Goyette wrote the film, based on his play. Director Daniel Grou, under his professional pseudonym \\"Podz\\", filmed King Dave in five unbroken shots, in five nights. However, all of the footage seen in the released film was taken in the fifth night of shots. Podz said that unlike other \\"one-shot films\\" such as Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, this method was not to portray action in real time, but to portray the character narrating in real time. Despite the challenges in the proposed project, producer Nicole Robert was eager to make it and raised a budget of $4.7 million. Art director Andr√© Guimond then went location scouting, choosing an area of Montreal for shooting. Rehearsals took place for weeks before filming commenced. Difficulties on the fourth day caused all of the footage to be unused. Twenty locations were used. ==Reception== The film debuted at the Fantasia International Film Festival on 14 July 2016 before a theatrical Quebec release on 15 July. Critical reception was generally positive. The Georgia Straights Ken Eisner, reviewing the film in the Vancouver International Film Festival in October 2016, called it \\"highly kinetic\\" and fun.

She became a prominent figure of the famous political battle of the general election of 1784 in the Westminster constituency. Charles James Fox's side had the glamorous Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, accused by her opponents of kissing voters in the street for their pledges, and the other Hobart, the Countess of Buckinghamshire, supporting her relative Sir Cecil Wray, 13th Baronet. On her husband's death in 1804, she became the Dowager Countess of Buckinghamshire. She died on 11 March 1816 in Nocton, where she was buried with her husband. ==Family== She had eight children: *Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire (1760‚Äì1816) *Hon.

It runs between Ashland at SR 11 and Presque Isle at SR 167, entirely in Aroostook County. ==Route description== SR 163 begins in Ashland's business district at Main Street (SR 11). It heads due east along Presque Isle Road passing some gas stations, markets, Ashland District School, and houses. The road leaves the town center and enters a more rural area with it surrounded mostly by wooded areas. It curves to the northeast and enters the unincorporated Central Aroostook territory. It then curves back to the east where it enters the town of Castle Hill. SR 163 makes another curve to the northeast where it climbs a hill to the south of Haystack Mountain. On this climb, an extra climbing lane is provided for eastbound travelers. At the summit of this hill, the road passes the entrance to a park. After making a few more curves, homes begin to appear along the road again. After completing one more set of curves to the north, SR 163 enters the town of Mapleton and its town center. At first, the road (carrying the name Main Street) passes mostly houses, but also a church and the post office. After passing under a Maine Northern Railway railroad (formerly Bangor and Aroostook Railroad), the road enters the town's business center passing some eateries, markets, and a gas station. The business district gives way to a more residential setting passing a school along the way. Rolling hills are also found along SR 163 east of downtown Mapleton. The road crosses the aforementioned railroad at-grade and curves to the south to head around the south side of Northern Maine Regional Airport at Presque Isle. While curving to the south to bypass the airport, SR 163 enters the city of Presque Isle. While curving back to the north, the street name of the road here is Industrial Street and passes in front of various stores, specialty businesses, and light industrial companies. It joins Mechanic Street heading east for three blocks before reaching a five- leg signalized intersection with State Street, Dyer Street, and Parson Street. SR 163 heads due north along Parson Street where SR 227 begins at the previous intersection forming a wrong-way concurrency (as SR 163 travels east, SR 227 travels west). The routes pass a mix of businesses, service corporations, and houses. The road briefly curves to the west and intersects State Road; SR 227 breaks off the concurrency here and heads northwest. SR 163 continues east on Parsons Road Connector around the north side of downtown Presque Isle. After passing over Presque Isle Stream, it reaches an intersection with US 1\\\\. Continuing east, it passes to the south of Aroostook Centre Mall and various other stores while it briefly expands to four lanes. It necks down to two lanes as it crosses over a railroad and ends at Fort Fairfield Road, SR 167. ==History== SR 163 formerly followed a different routing through Presque Isle and continued further east into Fort Fairfield. From the five-point intersection in Presque Isle, it traveled east along State Street to US 1\\\\. After traveling north along US 1 / Main Street, it turned east along North Street forming a concurrency with SR 167\\\\. The two routes traveled along the southern banks of the Aroostook River and intersected the southern terminus of SR 205 before SR 163 split from the road and traveled east along Maple Grove Road.

He lives on the central California coast in the city of San Campion with his mom and paternal grandfather. His creature partner is Tatsurion the Unchained. Raiden's natural ability to befriend the creatures comes from his father Ken Okamoto (who The Choten converted into Saguru) and his birth in the Creature Realms when Ken and Janet were hiding in the Nature Civilization from The Choten. Allie ' (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) ‚Äì A girl who has been friends with Ray since their childhood, she has a wealthy father but does not act like a stereotypical rich girl. She is fiercely independent and extremely adventurous. Her creature partner is Scaradorable of Gloom Hollow. Her mother Piper ran away before her tenth birthday, although the reason was never explained. It is implied in several episodes that Allie has a crush on Ray. Gabe ' (voiced by Phil LaMarr) ‚Äì A friend of Ray, he is more direct than most people, but is honest and true. His creature partner is Reef Prince Glu- urrgle. He later meets Sasha, Channeler of Light who becomes his second partner. Following the fight at The Choten's base and the treachery of Master Nigel, Gabe is later chosen as the temporary Duel Master of the Light Civilization (due to his connection with Sasha) until the Duel Masters can find a suitable replacement for Nigel. ==Duel Masters== Hector Chavez Master Hector Chavez (voiced by Freddy Rodriguez) ‚Äì A Duel Master and expert on the Fire Civilization, Master Hector Chavez is always on the front lines of Earth, where he fights any creatures that come through the tears in the Veil. His creature partner is Gilaflame the Assaulter. During both \\"Heart of Darkness\\" episodes, he has given hints that he has a crush on Master Nadia. By the episode \\"The Rising\\" Pt. 2, Master Jaha tells Master Chavez and Master Nadia to admit their feelings towards each other as they both kiss. Master Jaha Master Jaha (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) ‚Äì An elderly dwarfish female Duel Master, she is the most resourceful of the group and an expert on the Darkness Civilization. Her creature partner is Black Feather of Shadow Abyss. Master Jaha collects secrets kept hidden on both sides of the Veil. She was the Darkness Duel Master when The Choten was still in the order. In the episode \\"Heart of Darkness\\" Part 2, Megaria the Collector and Master Jaha reveal that they have known each other for a long time. Master Jaha may once have been Megaria's protege. Master Jaha says that her walking cane was a part of Megaria's brother. In the episode \\"The Rising\\" Pt. 1 during the fight at The Choten's base, Master Jaha sides with The Choten. When Master Chavez asks Master Jaha why she sided with Choten, Master Jaha says, \\"I'm sorry, Chavez. This is the way of darkness.\\" She orders the freed Black Feather of Shadow Abyss to attack Master Chavez. In \\"The Rising\\" Pt. 2, it turns out that this is a ruse to knock out Master Nigel as she quotes to Master Chavez \\"those who work with darkness works in mysterious ways.\\" In \\"Siege,\\" Master Jaha was aged by Megaria during the Choten's siege of the Duel Master's temple. In \\"The Evolution Will Not Be Televised,\\" Master Isao Okamoto uses his mana to keep Master Jaha alive. When the Spell of Radiant Purification is cast by Raiden, the curse on Master Jaha is undone as she finds herself younger, (and taller), than she was before. Master Benjirou Kimora Master Benjirou Kimora (voiced by Andrew Kishino) ‚Äì A sumo-like Duel Master and expert on the Nature Civilization, Master Benjirou Kimora serves as the front man for the martial arts dojo that hides the Duel Masters Temple. His creature partner is Mighty Shouter. He succeeds the previous Nature Duel Master Ken Takahashi Okamoto (Ray's father). Master Nadia Lobachevsky Master Nadia Lobachevsky (voiced by Grey DeLisle in a Russian accent) ‚Äì A female Duel Master and expert on the Water Civilization, she has spent years studying the Creature Realms and the Veil that protects the Creature Realms and Earth from each other. In the past, when The Choten was a Duel Master at the Kaijudo Temple, Nadia was an acolyte. Her creature partner is Aqua Chaser, Rusalka. During both \\"Heart of Darkness\\" episodes, Master Chavez has shown signs of having a crush on Master Nadia. By the episode \\"The Rising\\" Part 2, Master Jaha tells Master Chavez and Master Nadia to admit their feelings towards each other as they both kiss. ==Evil Forces== The Choten The Choten (voiced by Oded Fehr) ‚Äì The primary antagonist of the series. His real name is August. The Choten is an evil genius and a former Duel Master that went rogue to pursue his own goals. He may have been the former Water Civilization Duel Master, preceding Master Nadia. His main creature partner is Aqua Seneschal, and he has a secondary creature partner named Trox, General of Destruction. Both creatures help the Choten with his plots. From his hideout in the Skidbladner ship, the Choten has many allies to help him in his goals to enslave the creatures and take over Earth once the Veil that separates both worlds is brought down. The Choten seeks the artifacts of the Five Civilizations in order to control the creatures and take over Earth. When the Choten finally collects all five relics of the Five Civilizations, he announces that it is time for the Creature Kings to rise. In the episode \\"The Rising\\" Part 1, the Choten goes to great lengths to capture the Duel Masters' creatures in order to prevent them from interfering with his plan of summoning the Creature Civilization Monarchs. He succeeds in awakening them and summons King Tritonus to him. In \\"The Rising\\" Part 2, the Choten summons Infernus the Immolator, Almighty Colossus, Queen Kalima, and Eternal Haven to him in order to take down the Veil. When the Veil is restored, The Choten and his base end up in the Creature World alongside Master Nigel, Fingers, and Heller. The Choten plans to make his army within the Creature World. He starts by using the Helm of Ultimate Technology to control King Tritonus in order to use Water Civilization technology to repair and upgrade the Skidbladner. Upon obtaining the horns from some of the Rumbling Terrasaurs, the Choten forms an alliance with Megaria. In \\"Siege,\\" the Choten uses the Weapon of Mass Evolution on the Null Zone to evolve the creatures in the radius of its explosion in order to control them. He also uses a large saw made up of some Rumbling Terrasaur horns to open a portal to San Campion. In \\"The Evolution Will Not Be Televised,\\" the Choten captures the Light Mystic so that he can have an endless battery source. When Raiden gets through to his father, the Saguru/Humonculon webs up the Choten. With his plans thwarted, the Choten escapes by banishing the Saguru/Humonculon; Saguru is later rescued by Tay, leaving the Choten's fate unknown. Joseph Joseph \\"Fingers\\" (voiced by Jason Marsden) ‚Äì Joseph is a duelist who is nicknamed \\"Fingers\\" because of an injury in which he lost two of the fingers on his right hand following an incident with an unknown creature. He is an ally of the Choten, for whom he gathers corrupted creatures to help build the Choten's army. Joseph infiltrates the Duel Masters Temple as a newcomer acolyte in order to obtain some tablets. While the other Duel Masters are fighting Flametropus (who Fingers releases from the vault part of the Kaijudo Temple's creature stables), Ray, Gabe, Allie, and Master Chavez manage to repel Fingers, who manages to escape. In the fight against the Choten at his hideout, Fingers is sucked into the Creature World with the Choten, Master Nigel, and Heller. Heller Heller (voiced by John DiMaggio) ‚Äì Heller is a notoriously quick- tempered thug who works as a thief. One of the things he steals is one of the Choten's Duel Gauntlets. He discovers its power when he unknowingly summons Shaw K'Naw to Earth and uses it to commit a crime spree throughout San Campion. He encounters Ray, Gabe, and Allie, and Shaw K'Naw temporarily blinds Ray, then injures Master Nigel in a second encounter. When Ray comes to the museum, he uses Master Jaha's Fumes to combat Heller and Shaw K'Naw. When Ray and Fumes break Heller's gauntlet, Shaw K'Naw turns on Heller. Ray tells Shaw K'Naw that revenge isn't part of the Light Civilization's way and returns him to the Creature World. Heller is knocked out by Fumes as Ray leaves Heller for the police. While in jail, Heller is approached by the Choten, who \\"offers him a job,\\" which Heller accepts. In the fight against the Choten at his hideout, Heller is sucked into the Creature World with the Choten, Master Nigel, and Fingers. Master Nigel Brightmore Master Nigel Brightmore (voiced by John DiMaggio in a British accent) ‚Äì A Duel Master, he is an expert on the Light Civilization and a master strategist. His creature partner is Ra-Vu, Seeker of Lightning. As the leader of the Council of Masters, Nigel guides the Order of the Kaijudo Duel Masters in their efforts to maintain the Veil to protect Earth from the Creature World and from the Choten. Unimpressed with Ray and his friends, he is appreciative of their talents (especially Gabe's intelligence). He was the Light Duel Master when the Choten was still in the order. By the episode \\"The Rising\\" Part 1, Master Nigel decides to side with The Choten because of his strong belief in the original Duel Master code of conduct between humans and Kaiju. He could not allow the creatures to enter Earth, and he would rather accept the Choten's flawed motivations than deal with the chaos that has resulted from breaking the code. Ray, Allie, and Gabe have violated the Duel Master code on several occasions in order to do what is good and logical, rather than what is lawful to the code. His attachment to the rules has blinded him to what is really important in life. As a result, he chooses to join the Choten. Master Nigel is defeated by Master Jaha and is sucked into the Creature World with the Choten, Fingers, and Heller. Afterwards, Gabe is elected to be Master Nigel's temporary successor due to his connection with Sasha, Channeler of Light, until other arrangements can be made. In the episode \\"Caught in the Spotlight\\", Master Nigel evolves Ra-Vu into Ra-Vu the Stormbringer so that the Choten can demonstrate the Evolution Serum's effect to Alex. During the fight at Carnahan Family house in the woods, Master Nigel is surprised to find that Ra-Vu has the power of speech in this form. Master Nigel secretly regrets having to evolve his creature under The Choten's orders. In \\"The Evolution Will Not Be Televised,\\" Master Nigel turns against the Choten since Master Nigel only wanted order in the Duel Masters. This led to his fight with Master Tiera where both of them ended up falling into the transportation ley lines in the Duel Master Temple taking each of them to another location. Alex Alexander \\"Alex\\" Carnahan (voiced by Andrew Kishino) ‚Äì Alex is the father of Carny and helps to run the city of San Campion. Alex is continuously disappointed at Carny when he gets into trouble at school. When Ray plans to use Tatsurion the Unchained to set Alex straight, Tatsurion and Ray are surprised that Alex knows everything about them when Alakshmi and the Choten's henchmen arrive. Alex reveals that he is the Choten's largest benefactor and one of his silent partners. When Ray and Tatsurion the Unchained end up in the Fire Civilization with Carny, Alex is surprised that Carny has come with them. After Carny is returned to Earth, he returns to his dad, who decides that Carny is ready for his gift‚Äîone of the Choten's Duel Gauntlets. At the end of the episode \\"Boosted,\\" the Choten introduces Alex to Nigel as his chief financial benefactor. He directs him to one of Alex's chemical factories, which provide Nigel with a chemical that he places in the Duel Masters' spy system so that they would not spot the Choten and/or his allies. In the episode \\"Caught in the Spotlight,\\" the Choten discusses Alex's plot to be a war profiteer by mass-producing his Evolution Serum. After Lucy leaks footage of Carny and Simian Trooper Grash on the Internet, Alex tries unsuccessfully to reach Carny, and sends Fingers and Heller to bring Carny to him. When Ray fights hard against Fingers, Heller, and Master Nigel, Alex breaks up the fight with Sword Horned. He orders Carny into the car so that the Choten can have Carny return to his base to be further trained and disciplined. Carny \\"Carny\\" Carnahan (voiced by Phil LaMarr) ‚Äì Carny is a school bully who often picks on Ray, Gabe, and Allie. When Carny and his friends corner the three friends in an alley, Ray unknowingly summons a Rumbling Terrasaur, which scares off Carney and his friends.

Ray lets him go as he tells the two Duel Masters that Carny's dad is one of The Choten's benefactors. Carny returns to his dad, who decides that Carny is ready for his gift‚Äîone of Choten's Duel Gauntlets. In the episode \\"The Unbearable Being of Lightness,\\" Carny is trained by Alakshmi in the operation of the Duel Gauntlets. When Carny plans to target Sasha, Channeler of Light, he ends up fighting Gabe. Carny is defeated by Gabe and gets away.

The battle is broken up by Alex, who has Carny sent to The Choten's base to be further trained and disciplined. Master Tiera Master Tiera (voiced by Kari Wahlgren in armored form, Alanna Ubach in normal form) ‚Äì She was the Fire Duel Master before Master Hector Chavez and the girlfriend of The Choten. In \\"Duel Hard,\\" Saguru receives a memory fragment from the Choten. In this memory fragment, Master Tiera is seen jumping off a cliff after her partner Meteor Dragon betrays her. It is presumed that she has perished while the circumstances of Meteor Dragon's betrayal are unknown. It turned out that she is alive and had been placed in a cursed mana-dampening armor when she tried to control the Fire Mystic. Upon resurfacing as a prisoner of Lord Skycrusher, she has taken Alakshmi in as an apprentice following the destruction of the Volcano Warship in the first part of the Fire Civilization's war with the Water Civilization. Both of them were recaptured a second time following the conflict at Black-Ridge Volcano. Lord Skycrusher plans to make use of Alakshmi and Master Tiera. In \\"Bring Me the Head of Tatsurion the Unchained,\\" Master Tiera has trained Alakshmi to cross the Veil. Following Moorna's failure to destroy Tatsurion, Alakshmi uses her veil- crossing ability to get her and Master Tiera away from Lord Skycrusher before he can have Vorg cook Master Tiera. In \\"Unmasked,\\" Master Tiera joins Alakshmi Verma when she steal a Choten Minion's transport and brings her to the Choten's ship as one of her attempts to free Master Tiera from her mana- dampening armor. When this was a success, Master Tiera stops Alakshmi from taking her revenge. It was revealed that Meteor Dragon \\"betrayed\\" Master Tiera when she was unable to control its evolved form and she was thought dead when she actually summoned a smaller creature to save her. Before the Fire Mystic placed a mana-dampening armor on Master Tiera where she remained in the Fire Civilization for 20 years, it repaired her damaged gauntlet. Following Alakshmi being taken out of the Choten's base by Master Isao, Ray, Gabe, and Allie, Master Tiera stays by the Choten's side.

His creature partner is Humonculon. Because of his unknown past, Saguru is working for The Choten in exchange for The Choten's help in discovering his past. The first memory that Saguru recovers is when he came from Earth after he handed over the Sword of Fiery Cataclysm to The Choten. In the two-part episode \\"The Deep End,\\" Saguru helps Ray, Allie, and Gabe get to the Water Civilization so that Ray can get his memories back from the Mother Virus after Choten's Memory Swarm removed Ray's memories. Once inside the capital of the Water Civilization, Gargle has the guards remand Saguru to the dungeon. During the group's escape, Ray has Saguru freed. While the guards are busy chasing after Ray's group, Saguru makes his way to the Mother Virus as Aqua Seneschal tells him that the Memory Swarm used by Choten is not associated with the Mother Virus. After The Choten fails to gain control over the Helm of Ultimate Technology, Saguru helps him and Aqua Seneschal escape the Water Civilization in exchange for his next memory. The second memory that he recovers is that he is a former Nature Civilization Duel Master and an old friend of The Choten. In the episode \\"The Nature of Things\\" Part 2, Saguru poses as a Snow Faerie in order to enter the Nature Civilization's tournament where the prize is the Shield of Unity. During the final round, Aqua Seneschal crashes the round and steals the Shield of Unity, causing Ray, Tatsurion, Saguru, and the other Nature Civilization creatures pursue him. After the Shield of Unity falls into the Darkness Civilization during the scuffle, The Choten is not pleased with Saguru failing in the tournament and crushes one of the Memory Swarms. Saguru realizes that The Choten is not the friend he knew in the past. Saguru is forced to work with him for his remaining memories. In the episode \\"Duel Hard,\\" Choten sends Saguru to help Alakshmi and Heller hold up a bank, where the two pieces of the Helm of Ultimate Technology are held. Saguru succeeds in his mission, and Alakshmi and Heller fail. When Saguru asks why they have to fight the Duel Masters, The Choten tells them that they are misguided, and he gives Saguru the Memory Swarm that contains the memories about what happened the day that Master Tiera was betrayed by Meteor Dragon (the creature she has chosen), and the day when Master Toji lost part of his left leg to Snapclaw. The Choten also returns to Saguru his Duel Gauntlet. In the episode \\"Betrayal,\\" Saguru accompanies The Choten, Alakshmi, Fingers, and Heller to attack Ray's apartment. When The Choten plans to have the apartment taken down, Saguru objects and secretly destroys the Summoning Inhibitor. Saguru saves Ray, Gabe, Allie, and Sasha, Channeler of Light when The Choten summons Flametropus to level Ray's apartment building and brings them to his place in the Nature Civilization. Saguru informs Ray that The Choten holds his memories hostage, and gives Ray the coordinates of The Choten's base in San Campion Bay, telling him that he was one of the Duel Masters. At the Nexus point of the Five Civilizations, Tatsurion the Unchained and Sasha, Channeler of Light collapse as Saguru saves the lives of the humans. Saguru gets Sasha, Channeler of Light away from the Nexus and claims the Heart of Light from her. He hands it over to The Choten, and is given the Memory Swarm that reveals the memory that he was once Ken Okamoto, married to Janet Pierce-Okamoto and that Ray is his son. Devastated to realize that via The Choten's using him he has betrayed his own child, Saguru retaliates, is knocked out by Trox and incarcerated. In the episode \\"The Rising\\" Part 1, Saguru uses Humonculon to break open his helmet and free Tatsurion. Aqua Seneschal intervenes and shoots Saguru, Tatsurion the Unchained, and Homonculon with the evolution serum where Humonculon's evolution binds him to Saguru. When Ray enters The Choten's hideout, he finds Saguru in his hybrid state (referred to in the cards as Humonguru) until The Choten arrives. Saguru rises to his feet and helps Ray fight a mind-controlled Tatsurion the Unchained. While Ray tries to get through to Tatsurion, Saguru deals with The Choten until The Choten uses the Shield of Unity to order Humonculon to throw Saguru back into the cargo bay. Crashing to the cargo bay floor, Humonculon is banished to the Creature Realm, taking Saguru with him, since they are bound together. In the episode \\"The Rising\\" Part 2, Saguru and Humonculon lie comatose at the shores of the Water Civilization as Saguru's body is placed in a special underwater suit before being dragged underwater by a Water Civilization creature. In \\"The King's Speech\\" episode, Saguru is revealed to be alive. He helps Finbarr get Ray, Gabe, and Allie to the Darkness Civilization when King Tritonus' is under The Choten's control. The Water Civilization creature that found Saguru in a coma works for Finbarr and it is revealed that Saguru has just awakened from a coma. Ray works with Saguru and Reef Prince Glu-urrgle to infiltrate the Choten's ship to expose The Choten's control of King Tritonus. After the failed mission, Saguru tells Ray that he cannot return to Earth, since Humonculon binding to him has made him more creature than human. Ray vows to find a way to return his father back to normal, which leads Ray to seek out each of the Creature Mystics to find one of them who might know a spell that can separate Saguru from Humonculon. Over time, the fusion of Saguru and Humonculon causes more of Humonculon to slowly take over Saguru's mind and body. In \\"Bargain,\\" The Choten tricks Raiden into giving him the Spell of Liquid Compulsion from the Water Mystic in exchange for the antidote for the Evolution Serum to be used on Saguru (who is almost transformed into a humanoid spider-like creature). Unfortunately, the antidote doesn't work on human/creature hybrids as The Choten uses the spell to take control of Saguru much to the dismay of Master Nigel Brightmore and Master Tiera. During that time, Saguru is seen trying to fight Humonculon's control. In \\"The Evolution Will Not Be Televised,\\" Saguru fights the Choten's control and helps to subdue him.

Master Ken was Janet's husband who married her while he was a Duel Master. While Janet was pregnant with Ray, The Choten and his forces attacked their home. Master Ken's gauntlet was damaged in the fight, but he was able to open the Veil and took Janet with him to escape. Janet gave birth to Ray in the Nature Civilization and when Ray was a toddler, Master Ken was able to repair the Gauntlet. As the family was preparing to return to Earth, The Choten found them and attacked.

In addition, Megaria the Collector assumed Piper's form in order to get Allie on her side, but Megaria ultimately fails. By the end of the episode \\"Heart of Darkness\\" Pt. 2, Allison makes peace with her mother by peeling the packaging tape off from Piper in the family picture on her bedroom wall. In \\"Gargle, Gargle, Toil and Trouble,\\" Piper returns into Allie's life and tries to reconnect with her.

She is a very single-minded Kaijudo duelist, cool and calculating with a definite dark side. Not only is Alakshmi skilled in battle and a serious challenge for the heroes, but her beauty is intimidating and distracting to the boys, which is very irritating to Allie. In the episode \\"Heart of Darkness\\" Part 2, it is revealed that Alakshmi's mother Padma may have sold Alakshmi to The Choten. In the episode \\"Heavenly Creatures,\\" Alakshmi has personal issues with the Light Civilization, because one of its creatures destroyed her ancestral village.

He is also revealed to be a fugitive of the Fire Civilization with a bounty on his head after he attacked a dragon that was attacking the Nature Civilization (more specifically the Quillspike Tribe). Before the final attack on The Choten's base, Tatsurion is captured by the Choten's summoning machine. He is later injected with the Choten's evolutionary serum, which evolves him into Evo Fury Tatsurion. In this form, Tatsurion sprouts wings that grant him flight.

Ever-vigilant steward and deadly servant, Aqua Seneschal manages the Choten's operations from behind his many computer consoles. When more direct action is needed, Aqua Seneschal can form a pair of ice-sword arms to deal with pesky opponents, use his body circuitry for covert mobile data retrieval, or make a complete character judgment about someone (usually poor) with one sweep of his eye scan. When Tatsurion the Unchained asked him what kind of creature betrays his own kind as seen in \\"The Taken,\\" Aqua Seneschal replied that Tatsurion isn't his part of his kind. Ray later learns how to summon him after being lured into a deal with the Choten, but later uses this to infiltrate the Choten's base. Seeing Seneschal as a liability due to this, the Choten has Squillace Scourge attack him, leading to Seneschal's apparent demise. * Trox, General of Destruction ‚Äì A Shadow Champion that is associated with the Darkness Civilization.

Trox joined up with The Choten to assist in his goals. * Razorkinder Puppet of Miasma Pit (voiced by Grey DeLisle) ‚Äì An Evil Toy that is associated with the Darkness Civilization.

During the attack on The Choten's base, both Humonculon and Saguru are hit with the Choten's evolutionary serum causing the two of them to fuse into a hybrid form (referred to in the cards as Humonguru). The progress of the further combination causes Humonculon to slowly take over Saguru's mind and body. Eventually, the final process turns both of them into a humanoid spider- like creature. In \\"The Evolution Will Not Be Televised,\\" Raiden uses the power within him to restore Saguru and Humonculon back to normal. * Prism-Blade Enforcer ‚Äì An Enforcer that is associated with the Light Civilization. It is used by Isao Okamoto to fight Sniper Mosquito. It is Isao's primary creature partner. Creature Monarchs The Creature Monarchs are the rulers of the five Creature Civilizations. The Creature Monarchs are shown to be immune to the effects of the Null Zone (a neutral area between the Five Creature Civilizations that can drain mana from any creatures). They banded together with Five Wizards when a war between the humans and the monsters threatened both worlds. The Creature Monarchs sacrificed some of their Mana so that the original Duel Masters can create a veil that has since separated the human and creature worlds. With little energy left, the Creature Monarchs fell into a deep slumber. It appears the plan was originally to allow the Creature Monarchs to recover their strength and awaken before sending them across the Veil so they might rule their civilization again. At some point in the Creature Monarchs' history following the two worlds being separated, the Order of the Kaijudo Duel Masters betrayed the Creature Monarchs' trust where they periodically siphoned off their mana and kept them in hibernation for a millennium as experienced when Ray used his mana on the Fire Civilization's King. This information surprised Master Hector Chavez and Master Benjirou Kimura. If the Veil collapses, the Five Creature Monarchs will be reawakened and continue what they began thousands of years ago. The Choten later awakened the Creature Monarchs in a plot to bring down the Veil. This plan was thwarted when the Duel Masters and their allies concentrated their Mana to repair the Veil and send the Creature Monarchs back to the Creature World. After engaging in conflict, all five Monarchs meet for a summit at the instigation of the Duel Masters only to end up comatose due to the Mana draining properties of the region. * Infernus the Immolator (voiced by John DiMaggio) ‚Äì A giant Armored Dragon that is associated with the Fire Civilization. His wings are large enough to shade an entire city in their shadow. It was from Infernus the Immolator that Ray learned the truth on what happened when the original Duel Masters put them into a hibernation. Infernus the Immolator gave Ray a gift of advanced mana which evolved his Duel Gauntlet. Upon being awakened by the Choten, Infernus the Immolator is summoned to the Choten. When Allie claims the Sword of Fiery Cataclysm, Ray returns it to Infernus the Immolator. Infernus remembers Ray and agrees to duel with him to stop the Choten. When the Veil is restored, Infernus the Immolator is returned to the Fire Civilization as he tells Lord Skycrusher to send word to all Fire Civilization Creatures that they are going to war. Following the incident with the Water Civilization in the first part of the war, Infernus the Immolator has pardoned Tatsurion the Unchained of his previous crimes in return for saving Lord Skycrusher from his falling volcano warship and for Ray returning his sword. * King Tritonus (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) ‚Äì A Leviathan that is the ruler of the Water Civilization. It resembles a giant cybernetic combination of a jellyfish and an octopus. Upon being awakened by the Choten, King Tritonus is summoned to the Choten. When the Veil is restored, King Tritonus is returned to the Water Civilization. King Tritonus later fell under the control of The Choten who used the Helm of Ultimate Technology on him in order to further his goals. The Choten even used King Tritonus to form the Loyalty Police, had Milporo incarcerated, and Reef Prince Glu-urrgle exiled from the Water Civilization. In \\"Clash of the Monarchs,\\" Ray uses the Mana Ticks that came with Roaming Bloodmane to attack the Choten enough for King Tritonus to be freed from the Choten's control. * Almighty Colossus ‚Äì A Colossus that is the ruler of the Nature Civilization. He has two horns on his head, four arms, a landscape on his body, and he has small mandibles in his mouth. Upon being awakened by the Choten, Almighty Colossus is summoned to the Choten.

In \\"Mixed Vegetables\\", it is revealed that Almighty Colossus can give off a lot of mana to the Nature Civilization's ground simply by walking all over it....which explained why the plants were growing out of control on both sides of the Veil. In \\"Fallout\\", Almighty Colossus regains the Shield of Unity so that he can rally the Nature Civilization. * Queen Kalima (voiced by Alanna Ubach) ‚Äì A Dark Lord that is the ruler of the Darkness Civilization. She has the purple and black appearance of a giant-sized purple chimeric dragon with wings for arms. Upon being awakened by the Choten, Queen Kalima is summoned to the Choten. When the Veil is restored, Queen Kalima is returned to the Darkness Civilization. In \\"Dueling Partners,\\" the Choten and Master Tiera meet with Queen Kalima where they try to trick her into going to war with the Light Civilization. Due to the seeds of suspicion sewed by the Choten, Queen Kalima decides to go to war with the Light Civilization and sets up a foothold in San Campion. In \\"Brainjacked\\", Queen Kalima starts her campaign to invade San Campion with Gregoria leading the invasion. Allie leads Ray, Gabe, and Master Jaha into a meeting with Queen Kalima where Allie uses the Cloak of Dark Illusion to get Queen Kalima to listen to her. With help from Sasha, Allie convinces Queen Kalima to call off the invasion where Allie returns the Cloak of Dark Illusion to her.

The book is a breezy, but skeptical, gonzo-journalistic tour of transhumanism and radical life extension. It chronicles O'Connell's travels around the world to interview prominent transhumanists. ==Description== Interviewees range from mainstream figures, such as computer scientist Stuart J. Russell, to more colorful individuals, such as Zoltan Istvan, who ran for the American Presidency on the \\"Immortality Ticket\\". Much of the book focuses on radical life extension (the desire to engineer immortality); in addition, O'Connell visits a group of \\"grinders\\" in Pittsburgh who surgically implant sensors into themselves. O'Connell makes it clear that he personally chooses to reject transhumanist philosophy, stating that his child playing horsy with his wife could not be \\"rendered in code... Their beauty was bodily, in the most profound sense, in the saddest and most wonderful sense.\\" The book also examines existential risk from artificial general intelligence, the fear that superintelligent machines will destroy the human race. An oversimplified example would be a machine that is asked to eliminate human cancer, and does so by eliminating all humans. In the book's conclusion, O'Connell declines to offer any predictions about whether the hopes or fears of the transhumanists will come to pass, instead stating: \\"I have seen the present, and the present is strange enough to be getting along with: filled with strange people, strange ideas, strange machines.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:2017 non-fiction books Category:Futurology books Category:Irish non-fiction books Category:Granta Books books ","title":"To Be a Machine"},{"id":"54222047","text":"Brodec (, ) is a village in the municipality of Tetovo, North Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 1136 inhabitants.

As such, they were subject to the whims of the annual Congressional appropriation and periodic seasonal reductions in the workforce. Workers during the early nineteenth century lived in a state of constant anxiety regarding employment and wages. Wages were subject to considerable change, in some cases daily pay fluctuated dramatically, e.g. WNY carpenters wages were reduced from a high of $2.50 per day in the year 1808 to $1.64 per day in 1820.Tingey to Board of Navy Commissioners, 9 January 1821 National Archives and Records Administration Washington DC RG 45, Entry 314, Volume 74 Workers actively responded to pay cuts, as early as March 1807; the blacksmiths writing to the Secretary of the Navy, Robert Smith claimed the \\"right to Demand an Equal Participation with others in the Benefit of our Labour\\" and their wages restored.Blacksmiths to Smith 11 March 1807, RG 45/M124, NARA The Secretary in reply labeled them \\"a dissatisfied set of men\\" and threatened to \\"dismiss all complaining men as soon as publick convenience will permit...\\" and replace them with a \\"set of orderly, hard working fellows...\\" Robert Smith to Edward Preble 13 March 1807, RG45/M125, NARA, Two Washington Navy Yard \\"job actions\\" had occurred previously. The first on 13 March 1827, when a dispute over wages provoked laborers to leave the yard briefly to express their displeasure. The second began on 23 March 1830, when the laborers were recorded \\"standing out\\" for a week to show that their per diem wage rate should have been granted sooner.Sharp, John G.

Except for the brief entries made by the officer of the watch however in the station log, little is known about the exact circumstances of either incident. In early nineteenth century America though \\"strikes constituted illegal conspiracies under common law, exposing labor to criminal prosecution,\\"although rarely enforced, strikes, sometimes led local authorities to call out the militia.Howe, Daniel Walker What Hath God Wrought The Transformation of America, 1815 - 1848 Oxford University Press: New York, 2007.p. 549. Federal employee organizations were in their infancy, and mostly limited to charitable endeavors. On the Washington Navy Yard, the first such organization, was the Navy Yard Beneficial Society founded in 1804. While not representing workers economic interests, the Society did provide members for a nominal sum of fifty cents per pay period, the assurance of a decent funeral, and financial assistance to their spouse and minor children. Records regarding the Navy Yard Beneficial Society are scarce, but early employee obituaries provide evidence that, it was very active as a charitable group during the period 1804 to the 1860s.Meeting Minutes of Naval Lodge No.4 F.A.A.M. 1813editor Isaiah Akin, Westphalia Press: Washington D.C.2013, John G. Sharp \\"Brother William Henry Burdine Sr.\\"3rd paragraph The workday in all federal navy yards prior to 1835 was sunrise to sunset, with time off for breakfast and lunch. In May 1835, the Boston carpenters issued their famous \\"Ten Hour Circular,\\" advocating a ten- hour day which found wide distribution throughout the major cities on the eastern seaboard and the District of Columbia and quickly became a rallying cry for reducing the length of the working day.Commons, John A., ed., A Documentary History of American Industrial Society, Volume VI (New York: Russell and Russell, 1958), 94‚Äì99. On 26 March 1835, the mechanics in the New York Navy Yard (Brooklyn), petitioned the Board of Navy Commissioners to reduce the workday to ten hours,they stated, \\"the present custom of laboring on the public works of the Naval Service , from sunrise to sunset, is in summer an inconvenience and hardship to the workman.\\"They requested that the day of labor on the works of the naval service , may not exceed ten hours.\\"The Evening Post (New York ), 23 May 1835, p.2.

History of Labor in the United States, Volume 1.Macmillan Company: New York,1918 p.393 accessed 6 December 2017 https://archive.org/details/historyoflabouri02comm In the summer of 1835 Philadelphia Navy Yard shipwrights, joiners and other workers became leaders in this effort when they chose to combine direct action, a threatened strike, with political pressure to the executive branch. After first making a request to the Secretary of the Navy via shipyard Commandant Commodore James Barron, on 29 August 1835 they appealed directly to President Andrew Jackson.Harvey, O. L. The 10-Hour Day in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, 1835-36 Labor Review Monthly Vol. 85, No. 3 (MARCH 1962), pp. 258-260 Commodore Barron endorsed his workers request with the following acknowledgment \\"I would respectfully observe ‚Äì Seems to be inevitable, sooner or later, for as the working man are seconded by all the Master workmen, city councils etc. there is no probability they will secede from their demands.\\" Their petition was granted and on 31 August 1835 the president ordered the Secretary of the Navy to grant the ten hour work day effective 3 September 1835. However, the change was only applicable to the Philadelphia Navy Yard.Sharp, John G. COMMODORE JAMES BARRON, U. S. NAVY --Letters to The Board Of Navy Commissioners http://genealogytrails.com/penn/philadelphia/phlbios_a-b.html News of these events at Philadelphia Navy Yard was widely circulated in Washington D.C. Lastly Commodore Isaac Hull, WNY Commandant 1829‚Äì1835, was unpopular with navy yard civilian workforce and frequently had difficulties with employees.Peck, Taylor Round Shots to Rockets A History of the Washington Navy Yard and United States Naval Gun Factory United States Naval Institute: Annapolis,1940, p. 96. Navy Yard workers felt Hull often treated them with \\"silent contempt\\" which was probably the result of his deafness.\\" Maloney, pp. 437‚Äì438. Hull for his part came to believe that most navy yard mechanics were overpaid and underworked. In a revealing 1831 letter, Hull wrote to the President of the Board of Navy Commissioners: \\"If the men employed by day would perform fair days work, it would be much to the public interest to have the work done in that way, [rather than by contract] but experience has shewn me that all the care and attention possible to give them and all the driving and encouragement is thrown away on the mechanics of this place, for if they are at work by the day on a building that there is the least chance of keeping through the whole season they will be sure to do so though it might be completed by mid- summer\\".Maloney, p. 422 and p. 437. ==Strike== Captain Isaac Hull, who issued the order that caused the strike The spark that ignited Washington Navy Yard strike occurred on July 29, 1835, when Commodore Isaac Hull issued a new and unprecedented regulation forbidding Yard workers and mechanics from entering shop spaces during their lunch break and from bringing lunches on the yard property. The order read: \\"The Commandant of the Navy Yard at Washington D.C. finds it necessary to adopt the following regulations Vizt The Mechanics (with the exception of the Anchorsmiths & Engineers ) and Laborers employed in the Navy Yard are prohibited entering the Workshops, Ship Houses and other places where the public property, Tools &c; are deposited, during the hours allotted to Meals. The Mechanics and Laborers are forbidden to bring their Meals into the Yard either in Baskets, Bags or otherwise, and none will be permitted to eat their Meals within the Yard unless specially permitted by the Commandant.\\"Sharp, John G.

A watch was set up and not long afterward, on July 27, 1835, Anthony Sumners, a blacksmith striker in the Anchor shop, was found hiding a copper spike in his lunch basket. Afterward, a search of Sumners house revealed more missing government property. Sumners later explained he stole the items in order to sell and support his large family. Sumners was subsequently arrested, tried and convicted of theft of government property. Sumners was later pardoned based on his service in the war of 1812 and the recommendation of the jury, by President Andrew Jackson.The Metropolitan, Georgetown Washington DC 2, December 12, 1835, p. 2 When the workers found they no longer could carry even their own lunch into the Yard, many viewed the order as nothing more than a presumption that they were all thieves. On Friday 31 July 1835 when Francis Barry, the Clerk of the Roll, began reading the morning muster roll, a few men filed in to answer while their workmates stood nearby just outside the main Latrobe Gate yelling and urging them, \\"Don't answer! Don't answer!\\" Naval Constructor William Doughty a frequent critic of the commandant denounced Hull's regulations telling the men Hull must \\"think them all rogues or thieves.\\" Three-quarters of workers employed in August 1835, 175 of 231 left the Yard and joined their colleagues on strike. According to Hull's figures, of the 175 workers who went on strike, 107 were still out on 14 August 1835. The strongest group of holdouts remained the ship carpenters and their young apprentices, urged on by the inimitable William Doughty and his steadfast antipathy toward Hull.Hull to Dickerson, Aug. 12, 1835, NARA RG 45, Entry 39, Volume 209 letter number 48.Maloney, p. 439.Commodore Isaac Hull's regulation of 29 July 1835 re employee meals and access to the Washington Navy Yard that touched off the August 1835 labor strike.

Later on Friday afternoon, the strikers quickly formed a committee and elected their leaders: Samuel Briggs (plumber), George Lyndall (ship joiner), and John Miskill (carpenter). Local papers reported that \\"great excitement prevails among the Mechanics in the Yard.\\" United States Telegraph 4 August 1835, p.2. The three elected leaders, followed by 150 of their fellow strikers, immediately carried their petition directly to the office of Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson, located just a mile and half away on Capitol Hill, \\"to pray for redress of grievances.\\"Baltimore Gazette and Daily Advertiser, Aug. 4, 1835, p.3 Hull's predecessor Thomas Tingey had \\"understood the difficult conditions in which ordinary workmen, who were on daily wages, had to earn a living.\\" Brown, Gordon S. p.146. Hull who had spent much of his life at sea, was simply unable to comprehend or convey this to his workforce. His previous command at Charleston had been racked by controversy with mechanics and this soured him. The mechanics and laborers quickly came to resent his gruff manner of address which they thought more suited for the quarterdeck. In their petition to the Secretary they vented their animosity toward Commodore Hull's whole demeanor \\"The very first step of his administration was marked by his despotic power, by parading us all before him to try the tempers of the men by swearing in most blasphemous manner that if they did not march before him, he would march them out the dam-d yard.\\"Sharp, John G. History of the Washington Navy Yard Civilian Workforce 1799 -1962, p. 22 https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/browse-by- topic/heritage/washington-navy-yard/pdfs/WNY_History.pdf Dickerson alarmed, quickly wrote Hull to question what had prompted workers to strike. On August 1, 1835, Hull replied with a copy of his original order and an explanation of what in his judgment incited the workers action: \\"The regulation has met with disapprobation of the workmen generally and without stating their objections and without assigning their reasons for doing so have left the yard and ended their work. I cannot conceive of any good reason and I believe that the mechanics of this said yard have been acted upon by other causes.\\"Hull to Dickerson August 1, 1835, RG 45/M125 NARA Hull's \\"acted upon by other causes\\" is underscored in the original and is his reference to the Board of Navy Commissioners resistance to the ten hour day.Maloney, p. 437. Hull was aware that his navy yard workers were striking over more than the newly imposed lunch restrictions. Hull like other shipyard commandants was aware of the ten- hour day movement, as well as the Board of Navy Commissioners resistance to reducing the workweek. Hull too knew of the calls for general strike that summer by the Philadelphia shipyard workers and probably thought they were the proximate cause of the strike. He must have feared these calls had found an attentive audience.Maloney, p. 437. The strike and the subsequent Snow Riot in the District exacerbated long-standing white fears of black workers on the navy yard. In an undated diary entry for August 1835, African American diarist Michael Shiner confirms intimidation by white workers and their demand that the black caulkers stop work: \\"Commodore Hull ishsared and evry one of them struck and said they wouldn't work anny moore and at the same time they were collered man from Baltimore by the name of Israel Jones a caulker by Trade he was the forman Caulker of those Colerded Caulkers and they were fifteen or twenty of them here at that time Caulkin on the Columbia and the Carpenters made all of them knock oft two.\\"Shiner, August 1835, p.60 Isaac Hull's report to the Secretary of the Navy confirm Michael Shiner's account that the black caulkers did not strike.Maloney, p.430. As Michael Shiner wrote the white workers blamed Hull for bringing in black caulkers from Baltimore, Maryland and believed that black workers were to be used to break their strike. Hull's report to Dickerson shows the black caulkers did not strike.Hull to Dickerson, Aug. 12, 1835 confirms 31 caulkers in total with none on strike. This and other incidents raised always simmering racial tension in the city and on the navy yard. White mechanics and laborers went on a three-day rampage in which they threatened blacks and broke up their businesses and property. On August 14, 1835, Hull wrote a letter to Dickerson, and expressed some apprehension for the safety of the black caulkers that he recently hired. Rather than make a decision, Hull looked to the Secretary for a solution to his dilemma. \\"Information has been conveyed to me that the Excitement which has prevailed in the City for some days past is about to be extended to the Neighborhood of the Establishment; the immediate Cause I understand is there are employed in the Yard a number of Blacks, who were in consequence of the Scarcity of Caulkers in this City brought in from Baltimore to caulk the Ship now building. Under the Circumstances I have to request that you will be pleased to give me instructions, Shall I let the Blacks inside the yard and afford them such protection as the force and means at my Command will allow or shall I discharge them and afford them an opportunity to return to Baltimore?\\"Hull to Dickerson, Aug. 14, 1835, RG 45/M125, NARA. As one historian has noted, Dickerson chose to throw the black caulkers to the mob as he promptly replied, \\"In answer to your letter of this date, I have to observe that for the present should think it not best to admit the colored people in the Navy Yard at night.\\" After days of disorder and riot, President Andrew Jackson ordered a company of US Marines to restore order.Maloney, 439. Image of the 1835 Ten Hour Day Circular by the Philadelphia shipwrights, joiners, caulkers and mast makers to advocate for a reduction in working hours from 12 to 10 hours. This circular was sent to the Secretary of the Navy by Commodore James Barron. During 1835 labor leaders widely distributed the circular to Washington Navy Yard and other federal shipyards. Source:: National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC., Board of Navy Commissioners, Letters Receive, RG 45, E314 Volume 91. The strike which began over regulations and work-hours had \\"quickly morphed into a race riot\\" as now unemployed white mechanics and laborers took out their resentment on the black population.Sharp, John G. Shiner Diary, Introduction. Many of the navy yard 'mechanics were primed for racial conflict.\\" Ash, Chris Myers & Musgrove, George Dereck Chocolate City A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation's Capital University of North Carolina Press: Chapel Hill, 2017, p.76. The strikers were particularly incensed that Hull had brought a group of free black caulkers from Baltimore to caulk the frigate . This action inflamed an already volatile situation and was an important reason why the mechanics threatened to attack the navy yard and Commodore Hull. At about the same time a rumor rapidly circulated that a free black man named Beverly Snow, the owner of Epicurean Eating House, known for serving sophisticated and luxurious food, had insulted the wives of the navy yard mechanics. This resulted in a group of mechanics attacking Snow's restaurant. Michael Shiner relates the navy yard strikers were not only angry at Snow but prepared to go after Isaac Hull. \\"Mechanics of classes gathered into snows Restaurant and broke him up Root and Branch and they were after snow but he flew for his life and that night after they had broke snow up they threatened to come to the navy yard after Commodore Hull. But they didn't come that night and the next day Commodore Hull Received orders from the navy department from the Hon secretary of the navy Mr levy Woodbury Levi Woodbury to fortify the yard\\"Shiner, p. 60. After breaking up his restaurant, the mechanics drank all Snows stock of whiskey and champagne. Fortunately for Snow the white rioters were unable to locate him and he made his escape. In the capital though mobs of whites still continued to attack all establishments run by free blacks: schools, churches and businesses.Morley, Jefferson Snow Storm in August Washington City, Francis Scott Key, and the Forgotten Race Riot of 1835 Doubleday: New York 2012, pp. 148‚Äì150. Josephine Seaton, a keen observer and the daughter of the publisher of the National Intelligencer, William Seaton, states the navy yard strikers played a significant role in the Snow riot: \\"Snow will certainly be torn to pieces by the mechanics if he be caught, and they are in full pursuit of him. Unfortunately, several hundred mechanics of the navy yard are out of employment, who, aided and abetted by their sympathizers, create the mob, ‚Äî the first I have ever seen, not recollecting those of Sheffield, and it is truly alarming.\\" Seaton, Josephine. William Winston Seaton of the National Intelligencer: A Biographical Sketch, James R. Osgood : Boston, 1871, p. 217. Seaton was one of the few whites to record the strike, a strike which revealed the corrosive effects of racism on the navy yard workforce as white workers sought to blame their own precarious economic situation on free and enslaved African Americans. The riot was widely publicized in national and local newspapers and alarmed the white community. As their economic situation deteriorated and stung by public criticism of their actions the navy yard mechanics and laborers sought to end the strike. The two sides came together in an agreement that both Hull and the workers accepted through the offices of an outside mediator, Dr. Alexander A. McWilliams, who had a medical practice adjacent to the navy yard and was known to both the workforce and Hull, as a result, the Department of the Navy encouraged mediation and the navy yard labor strike ended on Saturday 15 August 1835 when the mechanics returned to work.Sharp, John G. History of the Washington Navy Yard Civilian Workforce 1799-1962, pp21-22.Notice to the Public from the Washington Navy Yard Strike leaders, regarding the end of the strike. This notice was published in the Daily National Intelligencer August 14, 1835 by the strike leaders, to inform the public the strike had ended through mediation. Note the last line for early use of the word \\"strike\\" for a labor dispute. ==Legacy== On 15 August 1835 the navy yard strikers were allowed to return to work. The strike had ended through mediation with both Commodore Hull and the strikers acknowledging the two-week labor strike as simply a \\" misunderstanding\\" which \\"originated in a misconception...\\"Daily National Intellgencer 14 August 1835, p. 3.Peck, p. 98. While publicly accepting mediation neither party was happy with the result. The Commodore only reluctantly accepted the Secretary of the Navy's recommendation to allow the strikers to return. The strikers too were not happy for they had failed to achieve any of their goals. To calm worker agitation for the ten hour day, the Board of Navy Commissioners on 26 August 1835, issued a directive to naval shipyards establishing \\"the mean of the working hours for the year\\" for Washington D.C. as: 9.53 hours. This BNC order set work hours to coincide with the hours of available daylight during the year, dramatically skewing the work day for example from December 1 to 15 December 1836, the day was 9.18 hours, however, the workday from July 1 to July 15, 1836 was 14.42 hours! For the workers this was not the ten-hour day they sought and this nominal change in calculating the basis of work hours failed to mollify workers and remained deeply unpopular.BNC Circular 26 Aug 1835, to Commandants of Naval Shipyards, sub. \\"Memoranda basis working hours\\" RG45 NARA Board of Navy Commissioners circular to all naval shipyards date 26 Aug 1835.BNC directed change to the \\"basis of working hours\\" to coincide with hours of available daylight, with a goal of 9.53 mean hours for the year at Washington Navy Yard. This edict failed to appease worker demand for a ten-hour day. Instead, the new instruction, dramatically skewed the existing workday, by requiring workers labor 9.18 hours in December but up to 14.42 hours in July!. Commodore Isaac Hull left the navy yard in September 1835, never to return but the regulation regarding the workers' lunch restrictions remained in place and the hours of work continued the same until 1840.Maloney, p.439.General Orders for the Regulation of the Navy Yard Washington, DC [circa 1833 -- 1850] editor Sharp, John G.

As day labor in a protracted dispute, absent effective organization and financial resources they inevitably suffered. Most of all the strike revealed the corrosive effects of racism on the workforce as white workers sought to blame their own precarious economic situation on free and enslaved African Americans. Further, the strike left as part of its legacy a deep and abiding racial mistrust, which would linger. For next century, the history of the Washington Navy Yard strike of 1835 and Snow race riot remained an embarrassment to be glossed over and disassociated from the District of Columbia and Washington Navy Yard's official histories.Hibben, Henry B. Navy- Yard, Washington Government Printing Office: Washington DC, 1890.Peck, Taylor Round Shot To Rockets ,1949. Historical understanding of the strike has improved with the transcription and publication of important documents such as the correspondence of Isaac Hull and the Diary of Michael Shiner. Prior to the 2007 publication of the complete Michael Shiner diary, one historian for example actually described the strike as an example of early inter-racial worker solidarity. \\"In a number of instances, however, Negro and white workers [at the WNY] worked and went on strike together. Thus white carpenters and caulkers and Negro caulkers employed in the navy yard in Washington joined in a strike in July 1835.\\"Foner, Phillip S.

According to Ronald Syme, Balbus is known only from a single anecdote from Cassius Dio (LVII.18.3), yet in it he \\"comes to life.\\" Dio describes Balbus as a keen trumpeter; at dawn on his first day as consul he began to play his trumpet, terrifying the populace who had believed the year to be announced with fateful omens.Syme \\"Early Tiberian Consuls\\", p. 190 Josephus mentions a Norbanus, a nobleman of great bodily strength, who was killed by the German bodyguards when Caligula was assassinated (Antiquities of the Jews, XVIII, 123). Edmund Groag argues he was Balbus; if so, then Balbus died in January 41.

Notable acts up to 2017 included rock (The Quireboys, Dr. Feelgood, The Blockheads), folk punk (Ferocious Dog), ska (The Selecter), folk rock (Wille and the Bandits, Gaz Brookfield, Mad Dog Mcrea, Rusty Shackle), blues (The Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band), dance (Dreadzone, The Orb), world music (3 Daft Monkeys) and singer-songwriters (Les Carter, John Otway).

It is the nineteenth installment in the WWE game series (fifth under the WWE 2K banner) and a follow-up to WWE 2K17. It was released worldwide on October 17, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. With its release, WWE 2K18 became the first in the series to be exclusively released on eighth generation hardware and also the first in the series to be released for PC and consoles simultaneously. A Nintendo Switch version followed on December 6, 2017, the inaugural release of the series for the Switch and the first WWE game to be released for a Nintendo platform since WWE '13. Among the features 2K promoted were enhanced graphics and the return of Kurt Angle to the series as a playable character. Critical response to the game was mixed, with particular criticism levied at the Switch version and its various technical issues. A sequel, WWE 2K19, was released in October 2018. == Marketing == On May 23, 2017, 2K Sports announced WWE 2K18 would be released in 2017. On June 19, 2017, 2K released a trailer, revealing that Seth Rollins will be featured as the game's cover star. In the trailer, it features Rollins vandalizing and burning down a fictitious WWE warehouse in Stamford, Connecticut, as well as showing the tagline \\"Be Like No One\\". The second trailer features Kurt Angle visiting the ruins of the warehouse and finding a pair of his boots among the ashes, which announced Angle as the game's pre-order. The game's Deluxe Edition was also announced, giving players access to the game four days early, along with the season pass and additional in-game content. On July 10, 2017, a Nintendo Switch version was also confirmed. On July 27, 2K Sports announced the Collector's Edition, called the \\"Cena (Nuff)\\" edition. The collector's edition revolves around John Cena, commemorating his 15 years in the WWE, and includes a Cena action figure, a piece of the ring mat from his victory at the 2017 Royal Rumble, and an autographed photo from Cena. Unlike previous years, the Collector's Edition included the game's season pass. The Collector's Edition (as well as the Deluxe Edition) has two additional playable versions of Cena (included with 2006's ECW One Night Stand and WrestleMania XXVI attires), as well as Batista and Rob Van Dam as playable characters. On August 16, 2K and IGN announced the first 47 playable characters, with a roster reveal special hosted by Corey Graves, Renee Young, and Goldust. Two days later, 2K announced that the soundtrack for the game would be curated by The Rock and will feature a mix of classic rock, modern rock, and hip hop. On September 26, 2K announced that for the first time, the PC version of the game will release alongside its console counterparts on October 17. Season pass details were unveiled on September 27, featuring the Accelerator, MyPlayer kick start, New Moves pack, NXT Generation pack, and the Enduring Icons pack. The NXT Generation pack was released on November 21, 2017, while the pre-order and deluxe edition bonus content was available as a separate purchase a week earlier. The New Moves pack was released on December 12, 2017, and the Enduring Icons pack was released on January 16, 2018. On March 23, 2018, a WrestleMania-themed edition of WWE 2K18 was released internationally, which contained all of the characters and downloadable content in addition to exclusive items prior to WrestleMania 34.  Roster  On June 29, 2017, it was announced that Kurt Angle would be the pre-order bonus character for WWE 2K18, making his first WWE video game appearance since WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007. For the third installment in a row, the roster is the largest included in the series with over 200 WWE superstars from the roster. As part of a product placement deal with KFC, WWE 2K18 has Colonel Sanders as a playable character, accessible through the attire templates in the Create-A-Wrestler feature. ==Gameplay == Similar to its predecessors, WWE 2K18 is a professional wrestling game and for the first time since WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, eight wrestlers are able to be in a match at once, instead of six (the Nintendo Switch version only supports six wrestlers in the ring). The Royal Rumble match has been retooled, with new mechanics, finishers and elimination sequences. A carry system was introduced (which is similar to the Ultimate Control Grapple system introduced in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007), allowing players to pick up or drag their opponent and place them in a specific spot. Thousands of new moves and animations have been added to the game.  Game modes  Improvements have been made to the creation suite, such as new superstar parts and materials. One such material is a glow effect, which gives players the ability to make hair, clothing, and logos on their created superstars to glow. Other new creation suite features include an enhanced highlight system, however the free-roaming camera has been removed when the highlight reel is being used mid-match. Crowd area templates can also be selected in Create-An-Arena, allowing players to select five different templates that have different weapons and objects to use. The Create-A-Match feature, last seen in the 7th-gen version of WWE 2K17 (WWE 2K15 for 8th-gen players), has returned. New to the feature includes the ability to create your own custom matches and save them for use in exhibition mode, Universe, and Online through Private matches. MyCareer now allows backstage free roaming (Last seen in WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2011s Road to WrestleMania mode), with wrestlers creating alliances and enemies, and fighting styles are introduced in the \\"MyPlayer\\" career mode, letting players choose between eight different fighting styles, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. However mixed gender tag-team matches are not featured in the game and cannot be created using Create-a-Match. The new \\"Road To Glory\\" mode enables players to use their MyPlayer characters to qualify and compete in events, similar to the one found in WWE SuperCard. This mode replaces the 2K Tonight online mode from WWE 2K17. Universe mode has been improved with a new story system, alongside new cut-scenes, power-rankings, and a goal system.  Commentary and graphics  WWE 2K18 features a new commentary team of Monday Night Raw's Michael Cole, SmackDown Live's Byron Saxton, and dual branded commentator Corey Graves.

Its range includes much of southern and eastern Africa, from South Africa to Ethiopia, including Madagascar. It has creeping, straggling or upright stems, with few narrow, entire leaves and erect, white or pinkish, slightly zygomorph flowers on a long tube, with five lobes, reminiscent of a Phlox-flower. It may not always be fully dependent on the supply of minerals by other plants, but usually makes connections with the roots of grasses. It can be found in moist, short grasslands, reaching altitudes of about . Its conservation status in South-Africa is \\"least concern\\". == Taxonomy == The plant was first described by Carl Linnaeus the Younger in 1782 as Gerardia tubulosa. Other species that initially were in this genus have later been assigned to Stenandrium (Acanthaceae), Agalinis (Scrophulariaceae), and Micrargeria (Orobanchaceae). In 1835, George Bentham though the species should be in the genus Rhamphicarpa, and made the new combination R. tubulosa. In his book Die Pflanzenwelt Ost-Afrikas und der Nachbargebiete of 1895, Adolf Engler assigned the species to Bentham's genus Cycnium.  Phylogeny  Recent DNA-analysis has revealed the evolutionary relationships between many of the species in the broomrape family. Cycnium tubulosum is most related to C. adonense, and more distantly to C. racemosum. The genus Cycnium is monophyletic and the sister group of a clade consisting of the genera Buchnera and Striga. Most related to the clade consisting of Cycnium, Bruchnera and Striga is a clade consisting of Xylocalyx and Graderia. The current insights in these relationships are expressed in the following tree. == Description == leftThe vlei ink-flower is a hairless or nearly hairless, hemiparasitic, high perennial herbaceous plant, with angular stems having four flat sides, which are creeping, straggling or upright, that may have side branches or not, and sometimes there are a few glandular hairs. These stems carry few distanced leaves arranged oppositely or nearly so, which are approximately linear, widest at midlength, with a pointed cartilaginous tip, with a very short leaf stalk or seated, glossy, the margin entire or with a few teeth, rather thick, the veins sunken, long and wide. Its flowers are long, reminiscent of a Phlox. These are set individually in the axil of a bract on a slender but rigid pedicel of long, which does not carry any bracts subtending the flower. The five sepals are fused into a high bell- to cone- shaped calyx tube, with ten veins, and ending in five almost lanceolate keeled lobes, that become narrower towards their tips and are long. The corolla is white, pinkish or purple and consists of five petals, which are fused into a curved, cylindrical long corolla tube. Above the \\"limb\\", the corolla becomes an approximately flat disk in diameter, that splits into five ovate lobes with a rounded margin, with the two lobes at the outside of the curve merged over a greater length than the others. Inside the corolla tube are five stamens with softly hairy filaments topped by long hairless, oblong anthers. The style does not reach the stamens, and is topped by a thickened, pointy stigma. The fruit is a hairless, short, oblique, slightly compressed, oval capsule of long and wide, topped by a short and obliquely beak, and has coriaceous valves. The plant discolors to black when drying. == Distribution and habitat == The vlei ink-flower is known from Angola, Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It can be found in moist, short grasslands, reaching altitudes of about . == Ecology == The vlei ink-flower has white or rosy-tinged (sometimes purple) flowers that open in the evening, and have long narrow corolla tubes. These traits all occur in flowers that are pollinated by hawkmoths, although a clear scent was not observed. Hippotion celerio and Nephele comma have been seen to visit C. tubulosum. == References == Cycnium Category:Plants described in 1782 Category:Flora of Africa ","title":"Cycnium tubulosum"},{"id":"54222455","text":"Pecadora may refer to: * \\"Pecadora\\" (song), a song by Lila Downs * Pecadora (telenovela), a Venezuelan telenovela ","title":"Pecadora"},{"id":"54222463","text":"Thomas Moodie (29 November 1839 - 30 April 1894) was a pioneer who in 1892 led a party of mostly Afrikaner farmers from the Orange Free State to settle in Rhodesia.

A Madea Halloween is a 2017 American comedy horror film written, produced, directed by and starring Tyler Perry. It is the ninth film in the Madea series, the sequel to Boo! A Madea Halloween (2016), and the third Madea film (after Madea's Witness Protection and Boo!) not adapted from a stage play. The film was released on October 20, 2017, by Lionsgate, received negative reviews from critics and grossed $48 million. At the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards the film received three nominations: Worst Actress (for Perry), Worst Screen Combo (Tyler Perry & either the ratty old dress or worn- out wig) and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel. ==Plot== After school on Tiffany's 18th birthday, she and her friend Gabriella encounter Tiffany's dad Brian and brother B.J. outside the school. Tiffany's mom, Brian's ex-wife Debrah, arrives with her new husband Calvin and they surprise Tiffany with the car she wanted (and hoped her father would give her). She and Gabriella drive it recklessly to the frat house from the first film, where they hear that Jonathan and the others are having a Halloween party at Lake Derrick. She hopes to make it up to them for ruining the previous year's party. Brian goes home where Madea, Joe, Bam, and Hattie are waiting at his house to surprise Tiffany. She tells her friend Leah about the party and asks her mom if she can go. She says yes to upset Brian. Madea overhears Tiffany's conversation about the party and immediately tells Brian, but he agrees to let her go so that he can teach her a lesson. Unhappy about Brian's decision, Madea decides to go to Lake Derrick with her old friends to get Tiffany, who rounds up Gabriella, Leah, and Anna (a girl who's stalking Horse) and they arrive at Lake Derrick in her new car. The frat boys meet up and have fun with the girls until some of them disappear after seeing \\"Derrick\\", his brother, and his daughters. On the way, Madea accidentally hits one of \\"Derrick's\\" daughters with her car when she mysteriously appears on the road. Madea, Bam, and Hattie check on the girl, who pulls her hair and shows her scarred-up face to everybody. The ladies run back to the car, but the girl appears on top of the car, scaring everyone again, and Joe immediately drives away. Back at Lake Derrick, Tiffany, Gabriella, Leah, and the remaining frat boys are at the campfire discussing the murders that happened in the area but Gabriella doesn't want to hear this and insists on leaving. Horse and Leah sneak away to have sex, under the guise that they will look for ice for the cooler. While on the truck, the two find blood and are immediately confronted by \\"Derrick\\" and his family, who chase them into the woods, with Horse getting caught and presumably killed. Leah runs out of the forest and sees Madea and the gang, deciding to wait with them for the car to stop smoking, until Bam sees a \\"grim reaper\\" figure standing in the middle of the road. Madea initially thinks this is just another one of the frat boys‚Äô pranks until the figure slashes one of the Cadillac's tires, but Joe continues to drive it anyway. Gabriella reluctantly seeks safety in a tent with Dino, a frat brother who had been flirting with her all night, but they discover \\"Derrick\\" and his daughters outside the tent. In another tent, Tiffany hooks up with Jonathan until \\"Derrick\\" tears down the tent. Tiffany, Gabriella, Jonathan, and Dino escape from the camp after Tiffany tries unsuccessfully to call her mom. Madea and the crew finally arrive at the camp; Madea accompanies Hattie to an old outhouse to go to the bathroom. While waiting, Madea spots a masked, axe-wielding killer coming out of the river and immediately runs away. Inside the outhouse, Hattie spots the girl trying to grab her, and she runs away. Madea and Hattie arrive back at the car, but Joe spots \\"Derrick\\" and drives away. At the police station, Debrah and Calvin desperately ask the sheriff to check for Tiffany at Lake Derrick, but Brian says he will go look for her with Gabriella's dad. Madea's car stops in front of an old abandoned house, where the girl scares everyone out of the car into the house. They find Tiffany, Leah, Gabriella, Jonathan and Dino hiding there. Inside, Hattie and Madea witness Joe being dragged away by \\"Derrick\\" and his brother and \\"Derrick\\" sawing off Madea's car. The girl appears inside, scaring everyone out. Brian and Victor are waiting for them, where they reveal that they had been pranking them for lying and sneaking out, and for Debrah to learn to co-parent. Debrah agrees, and the people who were \\"killed\\" are safely locked at the police station for trespassing and having drugs. Outside the station, Brian and Victor realize that the masked chainsaw killer at the outhouse was not part of the prank; he is the actual Derrick. When Derrick spots them, they drive away from the camp. Joe, who is still alive and in cahoots with Derrick, asks him if he can help him kill Madea and he nods in response. == Cast == * Tyler Perry as Mabel \\"Madea\\" Simmons, Brian Simmons, and Uncle Joe Simmons * Cassi Davis as Betty Ann \\"Aunt Bam‚Äú Murphy * Patrice Lovely as Hattie Mae Love * Taja V.

Gusev is a mild, slightly dim character who has difficulties understanding the diatribes of Pavel Ivanovich, an ardent 'protester' whose wont is to tell people 'truth to their faces' and who is now very proud of having riled every single person around him during his three years' service in the East.

Basel were the reigning Swiss Super League champions. The season started on the weekend of 22‚Äì23 July 2017 and ended on 19 May 2018. They were also the Swiss Cup holders. The first round of the Swiss Cup was played on 13 August 2017. Basel were also qualified for this season's Champions League in the Group stage. The first round was played on 12 September 2017. == Club ==  Management  Rapha√´l Wicky was appointed as new first team manager and was given a two-year contract with an option for a third year. His assistant is Massimo Lombardo and further members of the training staff are Werner Leuthard and Marco Walker. Massimo Colomba is the Goalkeeper coach. Massimo Ceccaroni is head of the FCB Youth System.  Further information  The FC Basel annual general meeting took place on 9 June 2017. The previous board of directors under president Bernhard Heusler with sportdirector Georg Heitz, vice-president Adrian Knup, financial manager Stephan Werthm√ºller and marketing manager Ren√© Kamm stepped back. Reto Baumgartner, Dominik Donz√© and Benno Kaiser remained on the board. Bernhard Burgener took over as chairman and Marco Streller as sportdirector. Peter von B√ºren was voted as financial manager and Patrick Jost in marketing. ==Overview== Offseason and preseason At the end of the 2016‚Äì17 FC Basel season Marc Janko left the club and joined Czech First League club Sparta Prague. Daniel H√∏egh also left the club and joined SC Heerenveen of the Dutch Eredivisie On 23 June 2017 Basel announced that Jean- Paul Bo√´tius had been transferred to Dutch club Feyenoord. Seydou Doumbia's loan came to an end and Basel neither wanted to prolong nor enter the option to buy him. Adama Traor√© left the club mid-August because he no longer played a part in the teams planning. In the other direction Basel were not too busy on the transfer market. On 14 June 2017 Basel announced that they had signed Ricky van Wolfswinkel from SBV Vitesse. A few days later, on 20 June, the club announced that they had loaned Dimitri Oberlin from Red Bull Salzburg. First half of season During the season, on 13 September 2017 Basel announced that they had recalled striker Cedric Itten from the loan to Luzern. Then following the injury suffered by Ricky van Wolfswinkel Basel were forced to hire another striker and on 2 October 2017 they announced that Albian Ajeti had been signed a five-year contract. Mid-season break During the winter mid-season break there was also quite some movements on the transfer market. On 23 December 2017 FC Basel announced that Fabian Frei would return to the club, signing a four and a half year contact dated up until June 2022. On 27 December the club announced that Samuele Campo, a former Basel youth player, was also returning, signing a four and a half year contact dated up until June 2022. Furthermore, on 10 January 2018 the club announced that another former Basel player Valentin Stocker was also returning. Stocker signed a three and a half year contact dated up until June 2021. In the other direction, also on 10 January, Basel announced that Renato Steffen had left the club. Steffen signed a three and a half year deal with VfL Wolfsburg. The transfer fee was reported as being 1.75 million Euro.http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/714577/artikel_alles- klar_renato-steffen-wird-ein-wolf.html Just a few days later Basel announced that Akanji had transferred to Borussia Dortmund. The transfer fee was reported as being 21.5 million Euro. He signed a four and a half year contract dated until June 2022. ==The Campaign== Domestic League The season started on the weekend of 22‚Äì23 July 2017. Basel's priority aim for the new season is to win the league championship for the ninth consecutive time. Their first game was the match against Young Boys in Stade de Suisse which ended in a 0‚Äì2 defeat. Following three victories Basel played four games without a win (two draws, two defeats) and slipped down to fourth position in the league table. Following this poor start the following game was at home against Z√ºrich. The game was a passionate battle and the home club titled their report: A passionately fighting FCB wins against FCZ 1:0. The game changed the run of the season and afterwards the team won seven and drawing three of the next ten games. The first game of the second half of the season was the last game of the kalender year and is included in these figures. By the mid-season break Basel had narrowed the gap to table leaders Young Boys to just two points, third placed Z√ºrich were twelve points adrift. After the winter break Basel could not find to their good form that they had before the break. They lost three of their first four games, at home against Lugano and St. Gallen and away against Luzern. The gap to leading Young Boys grew and was no longer reversible. The 5‚Äì1 win against Young Boys was achieved in the third last game of the season, but came after the championship had mathematically already been decided. Domestic Cup Basel are the Swiss Cup holders. Basel's clear aim for the cup is to defend their title. The first round of the Swiss Cup started on 13 August 2017. In the first three rounds Basel were drawn away against lower tier teams, winning against FC Wettswil-Bonstetten, FC Chiasso and FC Rapperswil-Jona. Basel were then drawn at home against Luzern in the quarter- final. This was won 2‚Äì1 and Basel advance to the semi-final in the Stade de Suisse against Young Boys on 27 February 2018. Champions League Basel entered into this season's Champions League in the Group stage. They were drawn into Group A along with Manchester United, Benfica and CSKA Moscow. Basels initial aim is to remain in a European competition after the Champions League group stage. The first match was the away game against Manchester United. Basel were previously drawn with both Benfica and United in 2011‚Äì12 and on this occasion, United finished third in the group and dropped down to the UEFA Europa League. ;Manchester United (12 September 2017) The first game was played in Old Trafford, in proper Manchester weather in Manchester. Basel were sitting deep, with their three centre-backs, as United took control of the game from the very start. Marouane Fellaini came off the bench after 19 minutes to replace the injured Paul Pogba and opened the scoring with a powerful header in the 35 minute, which was only part of his Man of the Match performance. Basel played better after the opening goal and even at the beginning of the second half created their chances. But it was also a particularly special night for Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford, both of whom found the net on their Champions League debuts with second-half strikes. United took a corner short, Daley Blind to Juan Mata and when Blind took the return he crossed for Lukaku who outjumped Balanta to power home. in the 85 minute Fellaini crossed, the ball was missed by Mkhitaryan and Such√Ω before Rashford, opening his body, sidefooted into the ground and high into the net. ;Benfica (27 September 2017) Basel ran out 5‚Äì0 victors at St. Jakob-Park in Basel against Portuguese side Benfica on Wednesday 27 September in an emphatic and much-needed victory for the Swiss club in the Champions League. Basel controlled the game from the start, Michael Lang (2) and Dimitri Oberlin (20) gave Basel a two-goal lead in the first half. Oberlin showed his amazing speed as he scored this goal. He made a clearance from a Benfica corner before covering the length of the pitch in mere seconds. Impressively, the 20-year- old composed himself after the run upon receiving the pass from Renato Steffen before sending the ball past the goalkeeper J√∫lio C√©sar. Ricky van Wolfswinkel then added a third in the second half (60) with a penalty, before birthday-boy Oberlin scored his second (69) and Blas Riveros's goal in the 76 minute completed the rout. Benfica were reduced to 10-men when Andr√© Almeida was sent off for foul play in the 63 minute. ;CSKA Moscow (18 October 2017) Match three of the Group Stage took Basel to the away game in the VEB Arena against CSKA Moscow. The game started slowly, the teams getting to know each other, indeed both teams looked very cautious in the beginning. But Basel took control after about ten minutes. Taulant Xhaka missed his first chance, but in the 29 minute he scored his first European goal in his 47th European match. The Albanian international cruised through the CSKA defence and shot the ball into the back of the net, a right footed shot from outside the box to the bottom left corner. There was little reaction from CSKA players after conceding. Quite the contrary - the visitors grew in confidence and took more control. At the end of an energetic first half, the visitors had the majority of the possession. The hosts matched the energy of the Swiss side, but had not been able to make more than one attempt on goal (off target). It was a deserved lead at half- time and Basel looked the more dangerous in the second half. Ten minutes into the second half the assistant referee canceled out Basel's second goal for offside, after referee Bj√∂rn Kuipers initially pointed to the centre circle. The decision came about 40 seconds after the visitors started their celebrations. Towards the end of the game Basel made themselves good chances. Dimitri Oberlin missed the target on two occasions, until eventually in the 90 minute he didn't miss. The Switzerland U21 international made his run from the halfway line and finished with composure, slotting it calmly in the corner of goal. == Players ==  First team squad  The following is the list of the Basel first team squad.

Salleh applied on the premise that although Second Chance Properties' shareholder equity was between $254.3 million and $263.25 million in the past three financial years, which fells short of the $500 million required for automatic qualification as a candidate, it did not prevent the Presidential Elections Committee to qualify him, if it is satisfied that he has the experience and ability to effectively carry out the functions and duties of the office of the President.

Its name refers to Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, a Sufi saint who is a major inspiration behind the musical genre of qawwali. Its members are brother-and-sister Pakistani vocalists Sukhawat Ali Khan and Riffat Salamat, as well as Bay Area multi-instrumentalist/producer Richard Michos. It was established in 1994 as the Ali Khan Band; its members decided to change its name to Shabaz in 2001 to avoid confusion with other \\"Ali Khan\\"s. Both Khan and Salamat are descended from Chand and Suraj Khan, who sang to Akbar the Great when he was emperor of the Mughal Empire. As the Ali Khan Band, the band released two albums on the San Francisco-based City of Tribes label. They signed with Mondo Melodia in 2001, and released their self-titled album as Shabaz on September 11, 2001. ==Critical reception== Derk Richardson described Shabaz as an atypically successful attempt at combining world and dance music, writing that the band had \\"succeeded where countless others have faltered.\\" He further stated that there were two reasons the album was successful at achieving this crossover, namely: \\"The Khans sacrifice none of the emotional power of their singing in Shabaz's aggressively pop-crossover format, and Michos carefully complements their ecstatic stylings with his deftly programmed arrangements of traditional Asian and Middle Eastern acoustic instruments and modern Western electric guitars and synthesizers.\\" Robert Christgau gave the album a 3-star honorable mention, describing the band as \\"sister and brother qawwali singers with more spirit than shame and an American collaborator helping them take their bhangra and chela technopop\\". Silke Tudor wrote that on the album, \\"synthesizers and keyboards accent the ecstatic vocalizations of Sukhawat and Riffat, which is the opposite orientation of most exports from the Asian Underground.\\" ==Discography== *Shabaz (Mondo Melodia, 2001) ==References== Category:Musical groups from San Francisco Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:Qawwali Category:1994 establishments in California ","title":"Shabaz (band)"},{"id":"54223413","text":"Batsaikhany Ariunbold (; born in 3 April 1990) is a Mongolian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Mongolian Premier League club Erchim and the Mongolian national team. ==Career statistics== International {  - !colspan=3Mongolia national team - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 201420 - 201520 - 201650 - 201700 - !Total90 } Statistics accurate as of match played 9 November 2016 ==References== Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Mongolian footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Mongolia international footballers Category:Erchim players ","title":"Ariunbold Batsaikhan"},{"id":"54223414","text":"NGC 480 is a spiral galaxy located about 546 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Cetus.

King's Cross was a short-lived building in London which gave its name to the area still known as Kings Cross. The building was erected in 1830, as the base for a memorial to the recently deceased King George IV. A statue of the late king was added in 1835, but then removed in 1842, and the structure was demolished in 1845. The structure was built using public subscriptions, raised by its architect and promoter Stephen Geary. He exhibited a model of \\"the Kings Cross\\" at the Royal Academy in 1830. The project was originally intended to be called \\"St George's Cross\\". The amount raised was disappointingly low, and the structure was correspondingly less impressive than intended. It was constructed at the junction of Gray's Inn Road, Pentonville Road and New Road (developed in 1765, and renamed Euston Road in 1857), in an area previously known as Battle Bridge, where York Way crossed the River Fleet, reputedly referring to a battle fought between Boudicca's rebellious army of Ancient Britons and soldiers of Ancient Rome. It had an octagonal base with paired columns at each corner, a balustrade at first floor level intended to be decorated with four statues, one on each corner (either kings of England, or the patron saints of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland; but it is not clear if any statues were ever put in place), rising to a pedestal with a clock. From 1835, it was surmounted by a statue of George IV. The statue stood high, on top of the high building. The statue cost no more than ¬£25. It was constructed of bricks and mortar, and finished in a manner that gave it the appearance of stone, \\"at least to the eyes of common spectators\\". It was described by Walter Thornbury as \\"a ridiculous octagonal structure crowned by an absurd statue\\". It was one of the buildings criticised by Pugin in his 1836 polemical book Contrasts, which advocated a revival of the medieval Gothic style. Pugin compared King's Cross unfavourably with the medieval Chichester Cross. The upper storey was used as a camera obscura. The base was used for exhibitions, then as a police station, and later a public house. The statue was shoddily built, never satisfactory, and was removed in 1842.

The building was demolished in 1845, with a report in The Illustrated London News mentioning its \\"grandiloquent name of King's Cross'\\". King's Cross railway station opened nearby in 1852. In recent years, with the redevelopment of the King's Cross area, there have been proposals to \\"put the king back into Kings Cross\\" by erecting a new public monument to the monarch and his memorial who gave the area its name. ==References== * Statue: King's Cross statue of George IV., London Remembers * Help Bob Stuckey create a plaque to commemorate George IV ‚Äì the ‚ÄòKing‚Äô in Kings Cross, kingscrossenvironment.com * 'Euston Road', in Survey of London: Volume 24, the Parish of St Pancras Part 4: King's Cross Neighbourhood, ed.

Some Gazans use private electric generators, solar panels and uninterruptible power supply units to produce power when regular power is not available.Gaza‚Äôs Electricity Crisis: The Impact of Electricity Cuts on the Humanitarian Situation , UN OCHA, May 2010‚ÄòGaza Infrastructure Nearing Collapse‚Äô, JPost, January 2017Seeing no end to power crisis, Gazans turn to the sun, Reuters, March 2016Gaza‚Äôs electricity crisis sheds light on gap between social classes, al-Monitor, March 2016 The crisis is a result of the tensions between Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, and the Palestinian Authority/Fatah, which rules the West Bank over custom tax revenue, funding of Gaza, and political authority. == Power sources== As of 2017, Gaza's normal energy needs are estimated to be approximately 400‚Äì600 megawatts for full 24-hour supply to all residents, which are normally supplied by a diesel power plant in Gaza which has a nominal rating of 60‚Äì140 MW (figures vary due to degree of operation and damage to the plant) which is reliant on fuel imports,Gaza's Only Power Plant Knocked Out, Arutz7, July 2014Israel, Turkey eager to rebuild Gaza, Globes English, June 2016 an additional 125 MW imported from Israel via 10 power lines, and 27 MW of power imported from Egypt. Even in normal conditions, the current rated supply of Gaza is inadequate to meet growing needs, and the crisis has led to further closure and reductions to each of these power sources.The humanitarian impact of Gaza‚Äôs electricity and fuel crisis , UN OCHA, March 2014With Only Three Hours of Electricity a Day, Gaza Is 'On Verge of Explosion', Ha'aretz, January 2017 == Development == Prior to June 2013, fuel for the power plant was smuggled from Egypt, where fuel at the time was highly subsidized. Following measures taken by the Egyptians against the Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels, these cheap imports were halted and the power plant began operating in a partial capacity with fuel supplied via Israel, which charges a high import duty. Even though Gaza is ruled by Hamas, they are currently dependent on the Palestinian Authority (PA) to help provide electricity ‚Äì the import duties on Gaza's fuel purchases via Israel are passed to the PA, making Hamas reliant on the PA for funding, and the PA, not Hamas, pays the bill to Israel and Egypt for the electricity they provide to Gaza. As of 2017, the Palestine Authority has ceased making some of the payments. Israeli human rights group B'Tselem has documented how common people cope in Gaza with electricity being provided on a rolling blackout schedule of a few hours a day, and has further said that Israel should take responsibility for the crisis, a responsibility Israel denies, saying that Hamas should allocate funds for electricity rather than personal gain and military expenditure on equipment and military tunnels. In April 2017, Gaza's sole power plant ran out of fuel. Hamas blamed the Palestinian Authority for levying taxes on the fuel (levied by Israel as per Protocol on Economic Relations, and passed to the PA) while not passing tax revenue back to Gaza. The PA claims that the Hamas officials in Gaza are simply incapable of running the plant efficiently. From April 2017, power supply from Egypt is reportedly not operational.Egyptian power lines to Gaza down, Middle East Monitor, April 2017Egypt shuts non- functioning power lines to Gaza for maintenance ‚Äì report, Times of Israel, Dov Lieber, 12 June 2017 According to Asharq Al-Awsat Egypt offered, in June 2017, to supply Gaza with electricity in exchange for the extradition of 17 wanted terrorists and other security demands.Egypt said to offer Hamas electricity in exchange for 17 wanted men, Times of Israel, 13 June 2017 Following the PA's refusal to pay for electricity in Gaza and instructions to reduce supply, Israel further reduced supply to Gaza in May and June 2017, saying this was an internal Palestinian matter.Israel cuts Gaza electricity after Palestinian president says he will no longer pay the bill for Hamas, Telegraph, 12 June The Israeli military and the UN have warned that the electricity crisis and resulting humanitarian crisis may lead Gaza to initiate military hostilities.Gaza Power Cuts Boost Tension With Israel, Ha'aretz, 12 June 2017 Hamas has labelled Israel's decision as \\"dangerous and catastrophic\\", threatening to renew violence.Hamas: Cutting electricity to Gaza would be 'catastrophic', ABC News (AP Newswire), 12 June 2017 On the 20th of June 2017, reports emerged that Egypt and Hamas reached an understanding according to which Egypt would supply 500 tons of diesel fuel daily.

He began his training course with a CAP (Certificat d'Aptitude Professionnelle) in butchery and then in accounting. By 1966, he created in his native village of Chailley his first poultry factory named La Chaillotine. The same year, the family company expanded to become one of the biggest French poultry group. During the 1980s, La Chaillotine changed of name into BSA (Bourgoin SA), diversified and developed in the international field. With the buyout of several companies, BSA became the first worldwide leader of fresh poultry with 30% of the national production, 6,600 employees, 30 factories and a gross revenue of 6.5 billion francs. Faced to industrial and financial difficulties, the group that he manages with his daughter Corinne Bourgoin, named general director in 1996, is in bankruptcy in August 2000.

It is a form of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed. Ghana's current copyright law is Act 690 issued by the ParliamentCopyright Act, 2005 of the Republic of Ghana. It was enacted on May 17, 2005 and replaced Parliament's Act No. 110, the country's previous Copyright law from 1985. The Copyright law affords protection to a variety of works, grants Copyright holders rights to their work and defines the duration of that Copyright protection. ==History== The history of Copyright protection started in 1911 with the U.K. Copyright Act 1911 which was one of the statutes that was of general application to the British Colonies. Issues of copyright had been the responsibility of the Ministry responsible for information. Ministerial responsibility for Copyright Matters changed to the National Commission on Culture when the National Commission on Culture Law, 1990PNDC Law 238 placed the Copyright Office under the National Commission on Culture. In 2005, the ministerial responsibility for copyright and related matters shifted to the Ministry of Justice. ==Structure== The Copyright Act is divided into 8 parts with 78 provisions: {  - ! Heading !! Sections -  Copyright  1-11 -  Duration  12-18 - Permitted uses of Copyright  19-23 -  Copies of Sound Recordings, Mechanical Reproduction Rights of Composers  24 - Enforcement Provisions 25-27 -  Protection of Performers and Broadcasting Organisations  28-37 -  General Provisions 38-64 -  Administration, the Copyright Office and Miscellaneous Matters  65-78 } Copyright The first division of the Copyright Act deals with the works of authors that are eligible for the grant of copyright protection such as literary work, artistic work, among others as stated in Section 1 of the Act and Folklore as provided for in Section 4 and those works that would not be granted copyright protection namely ideas, concepts, procedures, methods or other things of a similar nature as in Section 2 of the Act, the rights that accompany authorship and the rights and obligations of producers. According to Section 3 of the Act the copyright in a work shall be vested in the President for and on behalf of and in trust for the people of Ghana or an international body so long as the work in question is made under the control of the President on behalf and in trust for the people of the Republic or a specified international body. The Act recognizes two main types of rights of authors in Sections 5 and 6 as Economic rights and the Moral rights of the authors respectively. The Economic rights can be broken down into reproduction rights, transformation rights., public performance, broadcasting and communication of the work to the public rights, distribution rights, and commercial rental rights while the moral rights of the author are basically the right to be named as the author of the work and the right to seek relief where the author's work has been used without his permission. In some instances the economic rights may be vested in an employer or a person who commissions the work done in the course of the author's employment or commission per Section 7 of the Act. Section 8 of the Act recognizes certain works that moral rights and economics rights would not vest in any person and that those works are held in trust for the public except those authored by private media. Copyright can also be transferred either in whole or part by assignment, testamentary disposition or operation of law as identified in Section 9 of the Act. The moral rights of the author cannot be transferred. Section 10 and 11 of the Act also provides for the obligations that producers of sound recordings or audio visuals have which copyright protection do not depend on and notice of the protection of the rights of producers respectively.Sections 1 ‚Äì 11 of Act 690  Duration of Copyright  The right to copyright does not subsist forever. There is a duration of copyright to every work that is copyright-able, after which the public is free to use it in any way it pleases. The Act gives the durations for works protected under copyright. This part of the Copyright Act covers, individuals,Section 12 of Act 690 bodies corporate,Section 13 of Act 690 anonymous worksSection 14 of Act 690 audio visual work,Section 15 of Act 690 sound recordingsSection 16 of Act 690 expressions of folkloreSection 17 of Act 690 and moral rights.Section 18 of Act 690 The moral rights of authors under Section 6 of the Act exist in perpetuity while the others mentioned above are limited to a certain time frame. Sections 12 ‚Äì 18 of Act 690  Permitted uses  The Copyright Act despite offering exclusive protection to a copyright holder, allows for some permitted use of such works which will not amount to infringement upon the author's Copyright. Copyrighted works can be used for personal purposes, research for which there should be citation of source, review purposes, reporting of current and fresh events and then for educational purposes.Section 19 of Act 690 These are however subject to fair practice. The Act in dealing with computer programs allows for a copy of the program to be made by the lawful owner for the purposes of using it for the reason for which it was purchased or for archive purposes, this will not amount to infringementSection 20 of Act 690 An infringement will not arise on the copying of a work if it is a single copy and it is to be used in a library or archive purposes.Section 21 of Act 690  Copies of Sound Recordings, Mechanical Reproduction Rights of Composers Section 24 deals with copying and the reproduction of copyright works, the Act allows for a manufacture or a producer to make copies of any musical work on condition that there already exist copies of that musical work made by the owner or licensed for the purposes of retail sale. However, the Act requires that producer or manufacturer provide the owner or authorized personnel with notice, the notice must include the name and address of the producer, the title of the work to which the notice relates, the type of sound recording and the number of copies he intends to make, the selling price of each and the date of possible availability for sale. This is however subject to a mechanical royalty fee of not less than seven per centum which is to be charged on each copy and paid to the copyright holder. A failure to comply with these provisions amount to an infringement.Section 24 of Act 690  Enforcement Provisions  The enforcement mechanisms under the Act are in three legs, the security device for sound and audio visual recordings, importation of copyright works and the imposition of a levy on devices capable of reproducing copyright works. The first limb of enforcement provides that a manufacturer on the approval of the minister must purchase a security device for which he is to attach to each copy of a sound or audio visual recording,Section 25 of Act 690 without which he cannot sell any copy or will be liable to a penalty. The second aspect of enforcement, seeks to restrict the importation of copyright works without the owner's consent into the jurisdiction. The section states that a Customs, Excise and Preventive Service office who is unsatisfied that a work is not pirated shall not permit the importation of such works unless it has with it a written declaration by the ownerSection 26 of Act 690 The final leg of enforcement is provided for in Section 27Section 27 of Act 690 this involves the importation of a levy on devices capable of reproducing copyrighted works. This levy is to be collected by the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service and paid into a fund established by the Minister for the benefit of copyright holders. The invasion of which by any person who imports such devices, shall amount to an offense is liable on summary conviction to a fine of not less than two hundred and fifty penalty units or imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months.  Protection of Performers and Broadcasting Organisations  The rights of a performerSection 28 of Act 690 bars any unauthorized person from; broadcasting or communicating a performance of the performer directly or indirectly to the public, with some exceptions; fixation of a performance not previously fixed on a physical medium, exercising the right of reproduction of the fixation in any manner or form, providing the first public distribution of the original or a copy of a fixation of a performance, providing or obtaining a rental of the original or a copy of the performance for the purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage irrespective of the ownership of the original or copy rented, or making available to the public a fixed performance by wire or wireless means, in a way that members of the public may access it from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. The duration of a performer's right is seventy years starting from the end of the calendar year in which the performance was fixed on a physical medium or in the absence of such a fixation, from the end of the calendar year in which the performance took place.Section 29 of Act 690 Also a performer is not precluded from entering into a contract as stated in Section 30. The moral rights of the performer are outlined under Section 31. Section 32 provides for the requirement of authorization relating to broadcasting. It states that, In the absence of a law or contract to the contrary, the provisions of section 28 shall not imply a consent to; (a) license other broadcasters to transmit the performance, (b) make a fixation of the performance, (c) reproduce the fixation if the authorization granted is to broadcast and make a fixation of the performance, or (d) broadcast the performance from a previous fixation or from the reproduction of the fixation where initial permission was given solely to enable the broadcasting of the performance. Under Section 33, the right of broadcasters includes the right to, re-broadcast its broadcast, the fixation of its broadcast, or reproduce a fixation of its broadcast, or communicate to the public of its broadcast. Section 35 expressly provides for the limitation on economic rights of performers and broadcasting organizations. According to Section 36, broadcasting rights are protected until the expiration of forty years from the date of making the broadcast of the signal. Section 37 entitles the authorized performer and producer in the case of a public performance and use of copyright work to royalties. Sections 28 ‚Äì 37 of Act 690  General Provisions  The copyright law affords protection to a variety of work and grants protection to holders to their works and defines the duration of that copyright protection. In Sections 38 to 58 we can find the general provisions of copyright law in Ghana. These provisions basically deal with things such as works that belong to the public domain, how copyright owners can register their works if they choose to and the effects of the infringement of copyright rights. For example, if an individual infringes another's copyright right that individual commits an offence and is liable to conviction to a fine of not more than one thousand penalty units and not less than five hundred penalty units or to a term of imprisonment of not more than three years or to both; and in the case of a continuing offence to a further fine of not less than twenty-five penalty units and not more than one hundred penalty units for each day during which the offence continues. The above provision has been established in Section 43 whiles Section 46 has made provision to the victims of the office or forfeiture. In situations where there is a dispute pertaining to copyright the Copyright Act has provided the methods in which the dispute may be settled which negotiation, mediation by the copyright administrator and the last resort being the court[.Section 48 of Act 690 Authors, producers, performers and publishers are even allowed to form collective administration societies for the promotion and protection of their interest.Section 49 of Act 690 Per the Act, a copyright monitoring teamSection 50 of Act 690 as well as a copyright tribunalSection 51 of Act 690 with a specific tenure of an officerSection 54 of Act 690 and laid out functionsSection 53 of Act 690 as well as the rules of procedure.Section 57 of Act 690 National Folklore Board Works of folklore are literary, artistic and scientific works forming part of the cultural heritage of Ghana such as Kente, Adinkra designs, folksongs and folktales.

The flight originated in Atlantic City International Airport, and was scheduled to land in Owatonna. The crew made a go-around attempt after the aircraft touched down, but it overran the runway, hit Approach Lighting System fixtures, stalled and crashed, with the main wreckage coming to rest from the runway end. ==Aircraft and crew== The aircraft operating the flight was a Hawker 800 registered as N818MV, manufactured in 1991. East Coast Jets began operating it in June 2003. The captain was 40-year-old Clark Jon Keefer, a former flight instructor who had been with East Coast Jets since 2005. He had 3,600 flight hours including 1,188 hours on the Hawker 800. Keefer also had 874 hours on Learjet aircraft. totaling 2,062 flight hours on turbine-engine aircraft. The first officer was 27-year-old Daniel D'Ambrosio, who had been with East Coast Jets for less than a year and had previously worked with Colgan Air but quit during training due to an unexpected transfer of location. D'Ambrosio had 1,454 flight hours, with 295 of them on the Hawker 800. He also had two hours on Learjet aircraft, with a total of 297 hours on turbine-engine aircraft. ==Flight== After first travelling from its base airport at Lehigh Valley International Airport to Atlantic City to pick up passengers, East Coast Jets Flight 81 departed from Atlantic City International Airport at 8:13 am, en route to its destination, Owatonna Degner Regional Airport in Minnesota. \` ==Accident== The crash site with the wreckage of N818MV. At 9:45 am, Flight 81 was cleared for landing, and the aircraft touched down on assigned runway 30. Noticing that there was insufficient runway length remaining for the jet to stop, the crew decided to go around. As it began to take off again, the aircraft overran the end of the runway and impacted elements of the Approach Lighting System. This caused the aircraft to bank hard to the right until it was upside down before crashing into a cornfield from the runway. Seven occupants died on impact. One survived the crash, but she died less than two hours later in a hospital. ==Investigation== The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators deduced that the aircraft crashed due to a failed go-around. Because the jet had no flight data recorder on board, NTSB investigators used the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and eyewitness accounts. Because of the wet runway, the idea of possible hydroplaning was discussed, however it was ruled out later on. Investigators determined that the pilots hadn't begun the go-around earlier before overrunning Runway 30. The pilots failed to apply full brakes, and moved the airbrake handle towards the OPEN position instead of selecting the proper DUMP position during the landing. which would have safely brought the aircraft to a stop even after it overran the runway. The pilots were also criticized that they continued the attempt to go-around after overrunning the runway. The NTSB cited the pilots' error in attempting a go- around as the primary cause of the accident, concluding that the aircraft would have come to rest within the runway safety margins. The NTSB cited other contributing causes, and issued a series of recommendations. Probable Cause In the NTSB's final report, it states the following: > The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause > of this accident was the captain's decision to attempt a go-around late in > the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the > accident were, 1, the pilots' poor crew coordination and lack of cockpit > discipline; 2, fatigue, which likely impaired both pilots' performance; and > 3, the failure of the Federal Aviation Administration to require crew > resource management training and standard operating procedures for Part 135 > operators. The NTSB issued 14 Safety Recommendations as a result of this accident. ==Aftermath== The six passengers were all connected with the construction of Atlantic City's gigantic Revel Casino, the city's tallest building, then under construction.

The Act regulates the process through which trademarks and collective marks are registered, the issuance of registered trademarks and how trademarks and collective marks are protected through the enforcement of the Act. The rationale for enacting the Act is for the protection of the goodwill and reputation of the business of a proprietor.Pulsart Impex Limited v. Dart Hills Limited Suit No. IPR/4/07 (High Court of Ghana) The Act establishes the Trademark Registry(Registar) to which is mandated to register trademarks and issue registered trademarks. The Act has been amended by the Trademarks (Amendment) Act, 2014 (Act 876)(The Amendment) which came into force on 25 July 2014. The Amendment incorporated the Madrid Protocol into The Act. == Structure == This Act is made up of fifty-four (54) sections and three (3) schedules that are arranged under various headings as follows; {  Headings Sections - Registration of Trademarks s 1-17 - Trademark Registry s 18-22 - Trade description and Fraudulent Marks s 23-33 - Functions of Registrar and Legal Proceedings s 34-43 - Miscellaneous Provisions s 44-54 } {  !Schedule !Title - First schedule Article 4 ‚Äì Paris convention 1967 - Second schedule Form of Notice - Third Schedule Special Provisions Relating to Protection of Trademarks Through International Registration Under the Madrid Protocol } == Registration of Trademarks ==  Meaning of Trademark  Per the Amendment, a trademark means, sign or combination of signs including words such as personal names, letters, numerals, and figurative elements.The Amendment, s 1 A trademark may consist of words, personal names, designs, letters, colours, numerals, shapes, holograms, sounds or a combination of any of these elements; slogans, where they are not long enough to be protected by copyrights.  Application for Registration  The application for registration of a trademark must be filed with the Registrar and is contingent on the payment of a prescribed fee.The Amendment, s 4(1) The application must contain a reproduction of the trademark and a list of goods or services for which for which the registration of the trademark is made and the applicant must have a bona fide intention for which the trademark is to be used in relation to goods or services.The Amendment, s 4(2) The application may contain a declaration claiming the priority of an earlier national or regional application filed by the applicant or the predecessor in title of the applicant.The Act, s 4(3) An application for registration can be refused on several grounds such as where the trademark is a trade name, it is incapable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from the goods or services of another enterprise or devoid of distinctive character, it is contrary to public order or morality or it is likely to mislead the public or trade circles with particular reference to the geographical origin of the goods or services, their nature or characteristics among others.The Amendment, s 5 Once the Registrar has examined the application for registration of the trademark and is satisfied that it complies with all the Act, the Registrar shall then publish the application as to allow any interested person to file a notice of opposition claiming that one or more of the requirements have not been met.The Act, s 6 When the Registrar sends a copy of the notice of opposition to the applicant and the applicant does not respond to the claims of the notice, the applicant will be deemed to have abandoned the application. Where the application has not been opposed within the prescribed time limit or any oppositions were granted in favour of the applicant and the Registrar is satisfied that the application has met all necessary requirement, the Registrar shall then register the trademark, publish a reference to the registration and issue the applicant with a certificate of registration.The Act, s 7 When the trademark has been published trademark enjoys the same rights and privileges as if the trademark has been registered so long as the application has been published.  Meaning of Collective Mark  The Amendment defines a collective mark is a visual sign capable of distinguishing the origin or any other characteristic of different enterprises which use the sign under the control of a registered owner from any other enterprises or a collective mark can be a visual sign cable of distinguishing the origin of the quality of goods or services of different enterprises which use the sign under the control of a registered owner from goods and services of any other enterprises.The Amendment, s 2 The former meaning can be described as a collective membership mark as the mark only serves to show membership in a collective group of enterprises and the collective itself does not use the mark to identify its products or services. The latter meaning of collective mark can be described as a collective mark for commerce as the mark is intended to identify the goods or service as belonging to a certain membership of enterprises.  Registration of Collective Mark  The registration procedure for collective marks is the same as the registration procedure for trademarks, and thus the Registrar may grant an applicant a registration certificate for a collective mark once he is satisfied that all requirements have been met. The only difference between the registration of trademarks and collective marks is that an application for registration of a collective mark shall designate the trademark as a collective mark and shall be accompanied with a copy of the regulations governing the use of the collective mark.The Act, s 8  Rights Conferred by the Registration of Trademarks and Collective Marks  A person other than a registered owner of a trademark shall not knowingly infringe the rights of the owner of a registered trademark by using a trademark in relation to goods or services for which the trademark was registered without the consent of the owner.The Act, s 9 A person may also not use signs that are similar and identical to the registered trademark as the registered owner's right extend to such identical signs. In the Ghanaian case of Menkish Impex Limited v Pam Ventures Limited,Suit No.IPR/2/09 it was held that, in relation to the two marks ‚Äò‚ÄôHeaven‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚ÄôDhoom‚Äô‚Äô, they are not so similar as to qualify for an infringement of trademark. The defendant‚Äôs mark ‚Äò‚ÄôDhoom‚Äô‚Äô was held not to resemble the Plaintiff‚Äôs registered mark as to cause the likelihood of confusion and deception. Although the registered owner of a trademark has exclusive rights, such rights are limited to an extent. The rights conferred by registration do not extend, thus in turn no infringement claim can arise, to acts in respect of articles which have been put on the market in any country by the registered owner or with the consent of the owner. Once the registered owner establishes an infringement of trademark, either by the authorised use of the registered trademark or acts likely to infringe the trademark, the registered owner may institute court action against a person who infringes a registered trademark and such a person may be held to have committed an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of two hundred and fifty (250) penalty units or term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both.  Duration of Trademark and Collective Mark Protection  The duration of a registered trademark is for a period of ten(10) years from the filing date of the application for registration and may be renewed for a consecutive period of ten years subject to the payment of a prescribed fee for renewal.The Act, s 10 The registration of a collective mark enjoys the same duration and renewal rights as a trademark.  Invalidation of Trademark and Collective Mark  An already registered trademark may be invalidated on two grounds, namely; * Where it is proved that the registered trademark did not comply with any of the requirements in the Act. * Where the registered trademark has become a common name in the trade for goods or services for which it is registered.The Act, s 12 An already registered collective mark may be invalidated on three grounds, namely; * Where only the registered owner uses the trademark to the exclusion of any other enterprises * Where the registered owner permits the use of the trademark in contravention of the regulations of the collective mark * Where the registered owner uses or permits the use of the trademark such a way as will likely to cause confusion to trade circles or the public as to the origin of the goods or services concerned.The Act, s 13  Removal of Trademark and Collective Mark from Registration for Non-use  An already registered trademark, although not invalid, may be removed from the register of trademarks where a person interested in a trademark requests the Registrar to remove a trademark from the register because the trademark had not been used for a continuous period of five years or more.The Act, s 14 A collective mark may also be removed from the register in accordance with the procedure applied to trademarks.  Change in Ownership of a Trademark and Collective Mark  An application for a change in the ownership of a trademark or collective mark shall be in writing and be filed with the Registrar.The Act, s 15 The owner of a trademark may transfer the trademark in whole or in part for the goods or services for which it has been registered. Also where a person transfers an enterprise's, it is impliedly deemed that such a person has also transferred the trademark rights of the enterprise.  Licence Contract  A licence contract concerning the registration of a trademark or an application for registration shall be filed with the Registrar for which the contents shall be kept confidential but a reference to it will be published and if the said licence contract is not properly filed with the Registrar it is ineffective against third parties. For a licence contract to be valid, the licensor must have effective control over the quality of the goods or services of the licensee in connection with which the mark is used.The Act, s 16  Agency  An applicant who has a registered trademark in Ghana but is an ordinary resident outside of Ghana's jurisdiction must be represented by a legal practitioner resident in the country.The Act, s 17 == The Trademark Registry ==  The Trademark Register  The registry is mandated to make a register of trademarks for keeping records of all registered trademarks. In cases of collective marks (trademarks of companies) the registry is required to provide a special section in the register to keep them.The Act, s 19 Application for a trademark is to be in writing and it would only be granted if it is applied directly for a trade description or applied to goods; or it is applied to a covering label, reel, or any other thing in which the goods are sold or manufactured.The Act, s 23 After the application has been granted, a person (whether natural or legal) could be represented by the said trademark, the person is entitled to use it in businesses or in any kind of advertisement. An entry in the register would be rectified or erased upon request where there has been an omission, error or a defect in the registration by the affected person. This request may be made to the registrar who further forwards the application to the high court. The application for rectification does not in any way affect the validation of the trademark unless it found that the trademark was made fraudulently.The Act, s 20 The time for correction of the errors may be extended on notice to the parties concerned and on the terms directed by the Registrar.The Act, s 22 The register as provided by the act is opened to the public; it is to be published in the gazette.The Act, s 21 == Trade Description and Fraudulent Marks ==  Offences under the Act  An offence under The Act is any offence that is in relation to the unauthorised use of a trademark in relation to goods or any offence involving dishonesty and deception with a trademark. A person is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred penalty units or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or to both the fine and the imprisonment when he applies a false trade description to goods; or forges a trademark; or use or possesses an article or instrument to forge a trademark; or sells or exposes for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture goods or things to which a forged trademark or false trade description is applied. In cases where prosecution for an offence where goods are imported, evidence of the port of shipment is prima facie evidence of the place of origin of the goods. Where a person is convicted of an offence the goods and things of any kind by means of or in relation to which the offence is committed are liable, at the discretion of the Court, to be surrendered to the State. However, a person may not be prosecuted after three years from the commission of the offence, or one year after the first discovery of the commission, by the prosecutor, whichever occurs first. Again a person for the purpose of gain or the intent to cause loss to an owner of a trademark applies that trademark or a trademark that is likely to be mistaken for a registered one to goods or labelling or advertising of goods or as a business paper in relation to goods or has possession of goods with that sign of trademark, or has an article in possession his or her control or in the course of business with the intent to sell ,hire or distribute for any purpose of trade commits an offence and is liable on a summary conviction to a fine of not less than two thousand penalty units and not more than seven thousand penalty units or to a term of imprisonment not less than five years and not more than fifteen years or both. A person who is charged with these offences is not entitled to bail, food, drugs, medical services, household chemicals, cosmetics, vehicle machine parts or electrical appliances.  Defences  A person may claim the acts done were of pure intent thus not for defrauding purposes. Also, he could claim he in good faith believed the trademark was genuine. Again reasonable precautions were taken against committing the offence charged or the relevant information was given to the police officer with respect to the persons on whose behalf the trademark, mark, or description was applied.The Act, s 27  Forfeiture of Goods  A person may apply to the court for an order for the forfeiture goods which bears an identical sign or likely to be mistaken to his and are in connection with the investigation or prosecution of an offence for the court to release the goods materials or articles on condition that the person causes the sign to be obliterated and complies with any order to pay costs which has been made against that person. A person aggrieved by the order of the decision of the court may appeal.The Amendment, s 10  Implied Warranty on the Sale of Goods  A buyer is mandated to accept trademarked good or trade description from a seller if there are no issues of fraud or forgery to the trademarked good.The Act, s 31 == Functions of Registrar and Legal Proceedings == The Act deals with the power of the Registrar to award costs. The Registrar may award costs and direct how and by which parties they are to be paid in proceedings under the Act. By leave of the court, order for costs may be enforced in the same manner as a judgement or order of the court.The Act, s 34 Per the Act in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trade mark, registration of the trademark by the owner shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trade mark and all subsequent assignments and transmission of it.The Act, s 35 The certificate of validity. In legal proceedings, where there is an issue about the validity of the registration of a registered trademark, the court may certify validity in favour of the owner. In subsequent legal proceedings concerning validity, the owner of the trade mark is entitled to costs and expenses between legal practitioner and client on obtaining a final judgement, unless the court certifies otherwise.The Act, s 36 The orders of the Registrar are subject to judicial appeal.The Act, s 39 The Act provides the procedure for where an applicant has an option to make an application to the court or to Registrar. The application shall be made to the court if an action concerning the trademark in question is before the Court; or where the application is to the Registrar, the Registrar may refer the application to the court at any stage of the proceedings or may determine the question. A copy of any entry in the register, purporting to be certified and sealed with the official seal of the Registrar shall be admissible in a court without further proof of the original. Also, a person may obtain a certified copy of a register entry from the Registrar on payment of the prescribed fee.The Act, s 42 == Miscellaneous provisions ==  Falsification of Entries in Register  Under the Act, it is provided that a person who knowingly makes or causes a false entry to be made in the register commits an offence and is fixed with the liability of summary conviction of a fine not exceeding five hundred penalty unit and a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both.The Act, s 44  Offences of Falsely Representing a Trademark as Registered  Per the Act it is an offence to negligently make a fraudulent representation for the purpose of falsely representing a trademark as registered, or that a partly registered trademark is separately registered as a Trademark or that a registered trademark is registered in respect of specific goods or that a registered trademark gives an exclusive right to use taking into account the limitations entered on the register. The offender shall be liable to imprisonment, fine or both. However, the continuance of offence attract a further fine for each day during this continuation.The Act, s 45 In the USA first successful fraud case of In Re Bose Cooperation.91 U. S. P. Q 2d 1938( federal Circuit 2009) Hexwave Inc, filed a use-based application to register the mark Hexwave, for a variety of electronic goods it claimed to be using in commerce. Bose corporation (‚ÄúBose‚Äù) opposed Hexwave's application based on fraud and likelihood of confusion with Bose‚Äôs registered WAVE Mark for a variety of electronic goods. Hexwave filed a counterclaim to cancel Bose‚Äôs registration on grounds of fraud and furnished evidence in this regard. Bose insisted that its renewal application was based on its honest, good faith belief that its receipt, repair and return of its previously sold audio tape recorder and players bearing wave Mark was sufficient to support its renewal application. The court held that trademark was obtained, procured or maintained fraudulently when an applicant or registrant makes false, material representation of fact in connection with a trademark application or registration with the intent to deceive the patent and trademark office.  Penalty for Unlawful User of Official Badges  The Act also prevents the use of reserved items such as badges, seals, devices, emblems or a flag for the use of the State or an apparatus of the State in a manner that leads or is likely to lead to the belief that that person is authorised to use such reserved items without lawful authority.The Act, s 46  Jointly Owned Trademark  Two or more persons may be registered as a joint proprietor of a trademark, and shall apply as if those rights were vested in a single person but the right of the person who registered as joint owner can be infringed by any of the other owners who uses the trademark in respect of which the trademark is registered under which both or all of the joint owner have not been connected in course of trade. And also do not authorise the registration of two or more persons who use a trademark independently or propose to use it independently to be registered as joint owner.The Act, s 41  Trust and Equities  Under this provision, no notice shall be entered in the register of a trust express, implied or constructive and the registrar shall not receive notice of a trust. The enforcement of equity in respect of a trademark may be enforced in the same manner as any other movable property.The Act, s 49  Offences Committed by Body of Persons  An offence committed by body of persons which may include a body corporate other than a partnership, every director, manager, secretary or other officer of similar status of that body corporate shall be deemed to have committed that offence; and in the case of a partnership, every partner or officer of similar status shall be deemed to have committed that offence.The Act , s 50 == Schedules ==  First Schedule   Article 4 of the Paris Convention in the Trademark Act of Ghana  This Schedule incorporated Article 4 of the Paris Convention into the Act  Second Schedule   Form of Notice  This part of the Schedule provides the standard form for a notice of fraudulent mark.  Third Schedule   Special Provisions Relating to Protection of Trademarks Through International Registration Under the Madrid Protocol  The Madrid System is a convenient and cost-effective solution for registering and managing trademarks worldwide. Ghana has made a declaration by incorporating some articles of the Madrid Protocol into the Amendment.The Amendment, s 14 == External links == * http://rgd.gov.gh/index.php/services/intellectual-property/trademark- registration/ * http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/gh/gh013en.pdf == References == Category:Ghanaian law Category:Trademark law ","title":"Trademarks Act, 2004"},{"id":"54223913","text":"The Miss Universe Germany 2017 pageant was held on September 24, 2017 in the Dormero Hotel Bonn in Windhagen.

The ranking is Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace. == Method == The objective of Quatorze is to have the lowest possible score and cause the each other player to reach a score of 201+.  Dealing the cards  The dealer alternates to the right each round with the first dealer chosen arbitrarily. The dealer shuffles the cards and the person to their left cuts the deck. If the bottom card of the cut section is a joker then the player that cut is allowed to keep the joker. The cut section in the player's hand it then placed on the table (stock pile) and the dealer deals the cards in their hand first, taking from the top of the stock pile if needed. The player to the right of the dealer is first dealt 3 cards then each next player (including the dealer) is dealt 2 cards at a time in an anti-clockwise fashion until each player has 14 cards except the player to the right of the dealer who should have 15. Any cards remaining with the dealer go on top of stock pile. If the player have 9 cards from the same species it will stop the game.  Game play  First, the player with 15 cards strategically chooses 1 card to discard face up forming the discard pile. The player to their right can then either draw the top card on the discard pile or draw a (face-down) card from the stock pile. The player can only draw the top card from the discard pile if it will then be used to \\"go down\\". \\"Going down\\" is how players get rid of their cards in order to maintain a low score. Going down consists of cards being placed on the table either in triplets or quadruplets of different suits (e.g. 10 of spades + 10 of hearts + 10 of clovers or 3 of spades + 3 of hearts + 3 of diamonds). In addition, a series of cards of the same suit can be placed (e.g. 9 of hearts, 10 of hearts, Jack of hearts etc..) with a minimum of three cards in the series and a maximum of 13. Essentially, the sum of all the cards a player uses to \\"go down\\" the first time must amount to a minimum of 51 (e.g. 7 of hearts, 7 of spades, 7 of diamonds + Jack of hearts, Queen of hearts, and King of hearts = 51). After a player has put down a minimum of 51, they can begin to place sets as they collect them (e.g. they could add the 7 of clubs to the above set or place down the 4 of hearts, 4 of clubs, 4 of spades all together on to the table). Once a player has gone down with a minimum of 51, they can add to any other player's cards that have been put down on the table to either complete a set of 4 or continue a series. With each turn players must end their turn with discarding a card. This means that a player holding two cards in their hand cannot draw a third and place them down to finish a set because they would not have a card left to discard. Once one player has finished their cards that round is over.

Altman, 85, a fashion advertising executive who built several obscure clothing lines into household names, died Aug. 30 in New York\\" September 12, 2000 ==Biography== Born to a Jewish family,Jewish Virtual Library: \\"Modern Jewish History: Advertising\\" retrieved May 4, 2017 Altman served as an Army weapons instructor during World War II. After the war, he attended New York University School of Law at night on the G.I. Bill. While in school, he worked during the day as the advertising director for the trade magazine, The Women's Reporter. Although he earned a law degree, he instead accepted a job as an account executive with the fashion house, Irving Serwer Advertising. In 1950, he founded Altman & Stoller with fellow Irving Serwer alumni Max Stoller where he served as chairman. Altman focused on the fashion industry which was ripe for development as most clothing manufacturers typically pitched their concepts direct to the stores rather than develop the brand with the general public. Through his ad campaigns, Altman was credited with transforming then unknown fashion brands into household names. He developed the Wrangler jeans brand with ads that promised that the jeans would fade exactly how teenagers wanted them. He transitioned Monet jewelry from being perceived as low-cost to a premier brand by photographing inexpensive pieces on supermodels. He promoted the Russ Togs brand with a red neon sign that read RRRRRRRRRuss Toggs at the entrance to the Midtown Tunnel in Manhattan, elongating the name into a sexy purr. His creed was \\"Find your character; create your character; concentrate on your character.\\" In 1955, the firm became Altman, Stoller, and Chalk with the addition of Howard W. Chalk as a partner; Chalk left the company to start Chalk, Nissen, Hanft. The firm became Altman, Stoller, Weiss in the mid 1970s after Melvin D. Weiss joined the firm. The firm then diversified out of fashion advertising winning accounts with the Spanish tourist board, Ezo denture adhesive, and Lanson champagne, and handled the introduction of Newsweek's Inside Sports magazine. In 1978, he published an editorial in the New York Times that he was sickened by what television advertising had done to election campaigns which often promoted mediocre candidates stating \\"'A candidate is not a can of soup.\\" Altman, Stoller, Weiss was later purchased by Nadler & Larimer Advertising where it was maintained as a subsidiary before being fully absorbed and the name retired in 1983.New York Times: \\"ADVERTISING; Nadler & Larimer Absorbing Subsidiaries\\" By Philip H.

He holds 140 World of Outlaws sprint car series wins (fifth all-time), 37 All Star Circuit of Champions wins, and is a five-time Knoxville Nationals champion and two-time Kings Royal winner. He finished second in the Outlaws standings four times and had four seasons with over ten wins. ==Early lifeRacing career== Early career As a teenager Wolfgang hung out and eventually worked for local race Darryl Dawley's transmission shop. Wolfgang's first experience behind the wheel of a race car came in a B-modified at Huset's Speedway in 1970. His early goal was simply to make a living driving racecars. As he put it, \\"My design from day one was to become a full-time race car driver. Not to win Daytona, not to win Knoxville or Indianapolis--but to make my living in a race car.\\" He began driving sprint cars in the mid-1970s with that aim in mind. Sprint car racing Wolfgang found his first regular sprint car seat with Dave Van Patten in the mid-1970s. Shortly thereafter, he teamed up with car owner Bob Trostle in 1976 and won 45 races the following year, including the Knoxville Nationals. Amid talk that Bill Smith was planning an Indy program, Wolfgang teamed with Smith in the Speedway Motors 4x.https://speedsport.com/featured/magazine-doug-wolfgang-i-was-ok/ The team won 24 races in 1978 along with Wolfgang's second Knoxville Nationals. 1980 saw Wolfgang driving for Doug Howells, and the pair spent three seasons together, resulting in two second-place World of Outlaws point finishes. Wolfgang spent 1983 in the #18 Gambler house car owned by C. K. Spurlock, however despite 11 feature victories in that car, he was let go before the end of the year. It wasn't long before he found his way to Pennsylvania owner Bob Weikert, where he would remain for several years and raise the bar on sprint car racing success with a mind-boggling 52 wins in 1985. In his time with Weikert and mechanic Davey Brown, Sr., he won the Knoxville Nationals twice and the 1985 Kings Royal, as well as three straight victories at the Williams Grove National Open, but ran a varied schedule across multiple series and therefore his final position in the World of Outlaws standings from 1984 to 1987 was unremarkable. By 1988, Wolfgang felt the lure of a World of Outlaws title and left Pennsylvania to run full-time in that series in the Fred Marks/Les Kepler Kodiak #18. In 1989 he joined forces with 21-year-old team owner Danny Peace and ran a true outlaw pick and choose schedule, Wolfgang earned over $500,000 in prize money, 44 wins, and won his final Knoxville Nationals as well as a $50,000-to-win race at Selinsgrove.http://www.keloland.com/news/article/sports/salute-to-champion- doug-wolfgang-and-the-8d-sprint-car Wolfgang would grab his final major victory in 1990, winning the Kings Royal in the Ray & Jay Williams owned #8, before being released at the end of the year. He rejoined Max Rogers in 1991 for a reduced schedule, hitting the major races and otherwise staying relatively local. Other racing series Wolfgang took the checker flag in a USAC Midget race, two USAC Silver Crown races and three USAC Sprint car races. Doug claimed one victory in the NCRA 100-inch Champ Car division and an ASCS 360 Sprint division triumph. Wolfgang also claimed victory in a MARA midget race. Injury On April 3, 1992, Wolfgang was competing in a World of Outlaws event at Lakeside Speedway in Kansas City. During qualifying, he was involved in a fiery crash that resulted in burns over 30% of his body, a broken vertebrae, and injuries to his right hand. Following his recovery, upon climbing back into the seat, Wolfgang was never again as dominant as he had once been. Speaking about the incident, Wolfgang stated, \\"I have absolutely zero interest in getting hurt again. I've had all the fun I can handle with that. I also know what it takes to win, and I guarantee you I don't have that anymore.\\"http://www.argusleader.com/story/sports/2015/03/20/wolfgang-might- race-sprint-car-summer/25077141/ While he would never again be a dominant force in the World of Outlaws, he did go on to win the IMCA 360 sprint car championship in 1995 and the ASCS 360 National race in 1996 before retiring in 1997. Knoxville Nationals Wolfgang is a five-time Knoxville Nationals champion. His first, in 1977, was with Bob Trostle. He followed that up with Bill Smith in 1978, Bob Weikert in 1984 & 1985, and Danny Peace in 1989. In 1990, he famously \\"ran the alphabet\\", advancing from the D-main, through the C & B, to finish fifth in the A-feature driving the Williams Racing #8. Awards and recognition Doug Wolfgang will be known as one of the premiere sprint car drivers of all time. Winning 481 sprint car races for seventeen car owners in 29 states at 105 tracks and being inducted into numerous Hall of Fames. Wolfgang was an old school racer, who could build anything and races with a heavy foot start to finish. He was never one for wanting to be in the spotlight, Doug was just a regular guy from South Dakota who wanted to race and make a living at it. His incredible career cut short from two near-fatal accidents in 1992 and 1997. *National Sprint Car Hall of Fame inductee, 2003 *South Dakota Sports Hall of Fame inductee, 2007 * Nebraska Auto Racing Hall of Fame inductee, 2002 *National Sprint Car Poll Driver of the Year, 1985 & 1989http://www.sprintcarhof.com/Pages/DriverOfYear *National Motor Press Association Driver of the Year, 1985 ==Motorsports career results== (key) World of Outlaws {  style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" - !

It is used as a field studies centre for environmental sciences. ==History== Orielton in 1818 The first known house at Orielton was a fortified manor built by the Wyriott family in about 1200, which was mentioned by the historian Giraldus Cambrensis ( ). Orielton was the seat of the Owen baronets. The first Owen at Orielton was Sir Hugh Owen, the son of Owen ap Hugh (1518‚Äì1613), of Bodeon, near Llangadwaladr, Anglesey. Sir Hugh married Elizabeth Wirriot, who had inherited Orielton from her father George Wirriot. Sir Hugh left Orielton to his grandson, also Sir Hugh Owen (1604‚Äì1670), who was awarded the title Baronet of Orielton in 1641. The more recent Orielton House is said to have been built in 1656 and rebuilt in 1734. It passed down in the Owen baronetcy until it was inherited in 1806 by John Lord (1776‚Äì1861), a wealthy mineowner and politician, who remodelled the house in 1810 to its current form. Lord changed his surname to Owen, and became a baronet in 1813 when the Orielton baronetcy was recreated for him. At this stage, Owen had considerable wealth; the properties in north Wales had been disposed of in 1808 for nearly ¬£100,000 and his status in Pembrokeshire has been enhanced by the purchase of the Llanstinan estate. In later years, however, his profligacy led him to sell Orielton in 1857, along with other property in Pembrokeshire. Orielton was requisitioned during the Second World War and used as a base for Australian airmen. In 1954 Orielton was bought by the naturalist and author Ronald Lockley (1903‚Äì2000). The estate then covered 260 acres. Lockley used Orielton for biological research, including into the rabbit disease myxomatosis. He wrote The Private Life of the Rabbit whilst at Orielton. In 1977 he wrote Orielton, The Human and Natural History of a Welsh Manor about his time there. The palaeontologist Martin Lockley is Ronald Lockley's son, and was brought up in Orielton. In 1963 Orielton was bought by the Field Studies Council, for use as a field studies centre. ==Architecture== The house Orielton is a three-storey mansion in painted stucco. The core of the house may have been created by Sir Hugh Owen (1604‚Äì1670) in the late seventeenth century, probably from brick and stone. The house was rebuilt in 1813 by John Owen (n√© John Lord), (possibly following an earlier rebuilding in 1734). In the later nineteenth century the east front was shortened by five bays. The east front has eight bays with a large central porch with Doric columns. The west front has eleven bays. The interior features a full-height hall with a cantilevered stone staircase. The house is a grade II* listed building. The gardens The house is surrounded by gardens that date from at least the early nineteenth century. There are remains of a nineteenth- century Japanese garden and a walled kitchen garden. An icehouse was installed under the lawn, this has been filled in. The stables Orielton stables are in wooded parkland, 100m north of the house. Built in the nineteenth century, there is an ornamental entrance block with a courtyard to the year. The stables are a grade II listed building and are now used by the field studies centre for classrooms and laboratories. The stables and its cellars are a roost for lesser horseshoe bats, greater horseshoe bats, brown long- eared bats and whiskered bats, and are registered as a site of special scientific interest. Orielton tower The tower Orielton tower was built in the eighteenth century in the Georgian style, and originally straddled the entrance to the Orielton estate. The tower is built of brick, with Bath stone dressings. It became derelict in the nineteenth century, when it was described as a banqueting tower. The tower is a grade II* listed building. Brick Hall The Brick Hall at Orielton is an eighteenth-century estate house in a walled garden. Brick buildings of this period are rare locally. The Brick Hall is a grade II listed building, as are adjoining garden walls and dog kennels. ==Field studies centre== In 1963 Orielton was bought by the Field Studies Council for use as a field studies centre. The centre provides short residential and non-residential courses and field trips for school and university students and for the general public, and provides a base for researchers. The Oil Pollution Research Unit of the Field Studies Council was established at the centre in 1967. The centre is near the major oil port of Milford Haven. ==Further reading== * ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Video tour Category:Country houses in Pembrokeshire Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Pembrokeshire Category:Field studies centres in the United Kingdom Category:Education in Pembrokeshire ","title":"Orielton, Pembrokeshire"},{"id":"54224111","text":"The New England Center for Circus Arts (NECCA) is a non-profit circus school based in Brattleboro, Vermont.

He is known for his research on transaction costs and property rights, and how these influence the structure of organizations and institutions. His research covers four broad areas: transaction cost theory, economic history, agricultural organizations, and the family. Allen has published 85 academic articles, of which 58 are in refereed journals. In addition he has published \\"The Nature of the Farm\\" (MIT Press, 2002) with Professor Dean Lueck, and \\"The Institutional Revolution: Measurement and the Economic Emergence of the Modern World\\" (University of Chicago Press, 2012). Allen's most cited academic work is \\"What Are Transaction Costs?\\" Here Allen notes that economists traditionally had thought of transaction costs as mere frictions to market transactions. The problem with this conception is that these types of costs are purely neoclassical, and fail to violate the Coase Theorem. Allen brought together ideas in the property rights literature with those of transaction costs, to define transaction costs as those costs incurred from establishing and maintaining economic property rights. When these costs are zero, the Coase Theorem holds, when they are positive, the Coase Theorem fails. In 2013 his work on the effects of same-sex parenting on children's educational outcomes received public attention. In one paper, using Canadian census data, he found that the likelihood ratio for children of same-sex parents graduating from high school compared to children from opposite-sex married families was below one. He also found that child educational success in same-sex households depended on the gender composition of the household, something that was not found in all other family types. These findings were similar to those found in an earlier article by Allen, Pakaluk, and Price, which used the US census. Both studies used large random sample data that give more credibility to his study. In 2014, he testified as an expert witness in defense of Michigan's marriage laws. At the end of his four-hour testimony, plaintiff attorney Ken Mogill asked him: \\"Professor Allen, yes or no, are gays going to hell?\\" Allen replied: \\"Unless they repent, yes.\\" Many in the press took this to mean that he believed that people who engage in homosexual acts will go to hell. Allen has stated he was only referring to Luke 13:3 where Jesus stated all will perish (regardless of sexuality) unless they repent. The state of Michigan defended Allen's remarks, arguing that they did not taint the expert statistical conclusions he expressed in his testimony. The judge in that case, Bernard A. Friedman, subsequently overturned the ban and concluded that Allen's research, along with the research of Professors Loren Marks and Joe Price, on same-sex marriage represented a \\"fringe viewpoint\\" and rejected the use of snowball sampling as a legitimate statistical strategy. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Douglas W.

A pioneer of early anesthetic devices for medical use, he co-authored the first comprehensive textbook on the subject of medical anesthetics, titled Anesthesia, which was published in 1914. For this and other contributions to anesthesiology, which included innovations in administering anesthetics to war wounded and in obstetrics, Gwathmey was hailed at the time of his death as the \\"Father of Modern Anesthesia.\\" == Biography ==  Early life  Gwathmey was born on September 10, 1862 at Buena Vista Plantation near Roanoke, Virginia. He was a student at the Norfolk Male Academy and later attended the Virginia Military Institute. The third year of his college education was marked by multiple citations for bad behavior, including exhibiting \\"culpable neglect of his duties and studies\\" and \\"an air of careless indifference\\", going to a billiards saloon without authorization, and of throwing a brick into a subprofessor's window. This last infraction led to his expulsion from V.M.I. on December 8, 1887. While at the Institute, he had become very interested in acrobatics, so after his dismissal he left to join an acrobatic troupe that he traveled with for two years. Following this, he taught gymnastics at the YMCA first in Des Moines, Iowa, and then in Omaha, Nebraska. In 1890, Gwathmey moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he founded and led the Summer School for Higher Culture at Vanderbilt University. During his time at the school, Gwathmey became president of the Bicycle Club, was Director of the Gymnasium and Instructor in Physical Exercise, and was the faculty advisor to the Chi Chapter of the Kappa Alpha fraternity. He thought about pursuing a career in the ministry before enrolling at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, where he earned his M.D. in 1899. Gwathmey was a lifelong devotee to athletics and acrobatics and in 1915 published the book Tumbling for Amateurs.  Career  In 1902, several years after he finished medical school, Gwathmey moved to New York City and started practicing medicine. During this first year in New York, Gwathmey completed training in surgery and anesthesia at the New York Skin and Cancer Hospital. At the time, medical specialists whose sole job was to administer anesthesia did not exist, and as a resident Gwathmey practiced giving anesthesia alongside the rest of his training. While at the hospital, he made improvements on the Bennett Inhaler, an early self- administered chloroform device. Gwathmey, not wanting to accrue personal gain from the design or sale of his medical instruments, refused to receive money from or patent this and his later devices. With his training complete in 1903, Gwathmey initially practiced both dermatology and anesthesia. His mastery of the design of anesthesia apparatuses and of the administration of the drugs, coupled with the dearth of trained anesthetists at the time, led him to quickly transition to practicing anesthesiology full-time. Gwathmey was among the first full-time private practice anesthesiologists in the U.S., and his actions helped to establish the field as an independent medical specialty on the same footing as the older specialties. His practice was not affiliated with any individual hospital or surgeon, instead he worked on a case-by-case basis and would send patients his own separate bill. His writings make clear this was a deliberate choice intended to guarantee his independence and income as an anesthetist: > Handling another man‚Äôs money is both theoretically and practically wrong. > When the anesthetist is paid by the surgeon, it always means the minimum > fee. The anesthetist should send his bills directly to the patient, thus > establishing his identity and independence. Under this system the > anesthetist can stand as high in the profession and make as good a living as > other physicians. There would not be many gynecologists if the general > practitioners who referred patients to them also paid them for their > services. Gwathmey was also actively involved in the early organization of anesthesiology as a specialty around this time. He was a founding member of the Long Island Society of Anesthetists, established in 1905. This organization expanded its scope on October 28, 1911 to become the New York Society of Anesthetists (which later expanded to a national level as the American Society of Anesthesiologists), in which Gwathmey served as the second president. He was a primary force behind the establishment of the first national organization of anesthetists. On June 12, 1912, the American Association of Anesthetists was incorporated and elected James T. Gwathmey as its first president. The innovations that Gwathmey imparted to the practice of anesthesia during the beginning of the 20th century were several. For one, he proposed using combinations of anesthetic agents during the same case. He also was a proponent of tailoring the choice of anesthetic to the particular patient and situation, ridiculing physicians who would only ever use a single method: > How foolish, then, for one to suggest or recommend this or that special > anesthetic or method, as, for example, ether by the drop method. This seems > like an attempt to fit the anesthetic to the anesthetist and not to the > patient. Those who recommend the drop method exclusively would be satisfied > with an orchestra of one piece and this one piece to have but one string. leftGwathmey also developed an ether-oil anesthesia cocktail that would be given to patients rectally and was frequently used in obstetrics. He made refinements on a 1911 nitrous oxide-oxygen Boothby-Cotton anesthesia respirator, making adjustments that allowed the operator to estimate the amount of anesthetic gases remaining as well as reducing the weight of the instrument from 50 lbs (22.7 kg) to 14.5 lbs (6.6 kg). Writing with New York chemist Dr. Charles Baskerville, Gwathmey detailed his contributions and research within the first complete compilation of the medical knowledge of anesthesiology in the 1914 textbook titled Anesthesia.An illustration of Gwathmey's Nitrous Oxide-Oxygen anesthesia device as it appears in Gwathmey's 1914 textbook, Anesthesia.When the United States became a belligerent in World War I, Gwathmey served in Europe as a captain in the medical branch of the United States Army. He advised both the French and British armies on the use of anesthesia, and his nitrous oxide-oxygen apparatus was frequently used to treat soldiers who were wounded in the conflict. Upon the conclusion of hostilities, Gwathmey returned to his New York practice. He remained active in academic medicine for the rest of his life, publishing 113 papers in medical journals and revising his textbook. His passion for learning and improving the practice of anesthesiology was not diminished in old age. He continued to attend the national meetings on anesthesia into his 70s. A colleague describes how Gwathmey decided to master the details of giving spinal anesthesia - this in 1934, when Gwathmey was 72 years old. It was only in 1939 that Gwathmey retired from clinical practice due to his severe bronchial asthma and coronary heart disease. James Tayloe Gwathmey died on February 11, 1944 at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  Family  James T. Gwathmey was the third of six sons for mother Mary Lavinia Tayloe and his father William Watts Gwathmey. His father's side of the family was descended from Owen Gwathmey, who fled to Virginia from Wales in the 1600s. His mother was part of an old and respected Virginia family which carried a history of military and community service, The Tayloe's of Mount Airy. He married Margaret L. Riddle, a Nashville resident, in 1890, although the marriage ended in divorce. Gwathmey had one daughter, Mary Tayloe Gwathmey, and one son, William Riddle Gwanthmey, who was a captain in the British Army. == References == * Category:American anesthesiologists Category:1862 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Roanoke, Virginia Category:American physicians ","title":"James Tayloe Gwathmey"},{"id":"54224254","text":"Daughters of Eve is a 1979 novel by Lois Duncan.

She was first revealed in a May 2017 Nintendo Direct, where she quickly became a fan favorite. ==Concept and creation== Twintelle was first revealed during a May 17, 2017 Nintendo Direct. Twintelle features dark brown skin and large, white/pink pigtails that she uses to fight due to her hair being affected by the ARMS Ability. She is the only character in the ARMS universe whose hair is affected in this way. She wears a blue mask, a sleeveless white top, black pants, and black heels. Twintelle was a more worrisome character to design than others by ARMS producer Kosuke Yabuki. The initial concept of Twintelle was just a character who fought with their hair. The design team wanted to do something different and wanted to represent different countries and different backgrounds. The staff reached out to people at Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe to get ideas for a character from a different background. Designers sent sketches to these divisions of the character to get their opinions on them. The design of Twintelle took more time and had designers working harder than they did on others. Yabuki designed her to have a muscular build. Yabuki enjoyed the character, commenting that she was a rare character type for Nintendo to create. He was particularly happy to have made what he considers to be a strong female character. ==Appearances== Twintelle first appears in ARMS as a playable character. She participates in ARMS competitions due to her not feeling enthused about just her acting career. She also appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate in a cameo role as a \\"Spirit.\\" ==Reception== Since her appearance in ARMS, Twintelle has received generally positive reception. She is regarded as the most popular ARMS character by fans. The positive response to Twintelle left Yabuki feeling happy and energized. He added that he was not expecting the popularity to be as strong as it was. Critics including Allegra Frank and Gita Jackson suggested that her popularity was derived in part from her hair, outfit, sexual characteristics, and her \\"calm, collected\\" personality. Writer Xavier Harding suggested that the amount of fanart that Twintelle has received suggested that Nintendo \\"has a hit on their hands.\\" Twintelle's high degree of popularity lead to Nintendo including her in ARMS \\"Global Testpunch,\\" a free temporary online video game demo. US Gamer's Matt Kim called her the \\"star of ARMS\\" and said he has \\"fallen in love\\" with her. She has been a suggestion for inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate by critics such as Xavier Harding, Paul Tassi, and Brian Shea. Writer Will Greenwald included her in his list of most-wanted female characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Her status as a woman of color stood out due to its added variety to the roster. Writer Tanya DePass was unhappy with Twintelle's design, criticizing the fact that she was a \\"brown, female character with weaponized hair.\\" She compared the idea of \\"weaponized hair\\" to real-world discrimination against black people for their natural hairstyles. She suggested that Twintelle's hair issues was a part of a greater issue in video games to do with black people's hair. Writer Shonte Daniels responded to this article, noting that she found her argument \\"completely valid,\\" playing as Twintelle in ARMS made her feel empowered. She argues that her hair deconstructs the idea, and that Twintelle \\"isn‚Äôt fighting against her hair\\" but rather \\"fights alongside it.\\" She compares Twintelle to black female athletes such as tennis player Serena Williams, who touched upon how she used to dislike her masculine body but in time grew to love it due to how it has helped achieve her goals. Daniels suggests that Twintelle is similarly proud of her body and flaunts her hair in spite of criticism. She also suggested that her hair was affected by the \\"ARMS ability\\" due to her closeness to her hair. Williams went on to name her as one of the best new video game characters in 2017. Writer Janet Garcia called Twintelle the most unique character designs of the Nintendo Switch generation, praising her design as both \\"sexualized and empowered.\\" She further discusses that Twintelle's sexuality fits in well with the ARMS world, and her sexuality comes off better because ARMS other female characters are not sexualized. She added that Twintelle's backstory helps justify her sexualization and that it makes her seem \\"badass.\\" However, she acknowledges that the femme fatale design that Twintelle incorporates is one that is too commonly applied to women of color. In celebrating Reggie Fils-Aime, writer Jordan Minor featured Twintelle on his list of his favorite black characters, calling her the \\"Queen of ARMS.\\" Writer Alisha Karabinus acknowledged that Twintelle had potential problematic aspects, but noted that if video games did not have black women depicted poorly that gaming would have little left. ==References== Category:Black characters in video games Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional actors Category:Fictional French people in video games Category:Fighting game characters Category:Nintendo protagonists Category:Nintendo characters Category:Video game characters introduced in 2017 ","title":"Twintelle"},{"id":"54224281","text":"United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409 (1941), is the fourth and final decision by the United States Supreme Court in a long battle between the Secretary of Agriculture and market agencies on the reasonable rates to be rendered for services. The Court held that, under the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Secretary of Agriculture had the authority and he properly determined the reasonable rates for services rendered by market agencies.United States v. Morgan, . ==Background== The Packers and Stockyards Act provides the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to set rates to be paid by agencies for services rendered. Under the Act, however, two conditions are put upon the exercise of this power: (1) The Secretary must be of the opinion that the existing rate is unjust, and (2) this opinion must be the result of a full hearing. In the early 1930s the Secretary of Agriculture became concerned that the Fred O. Morgan Sheep Commission CompanyUnited States v. Morgan, . and other agencies doing business at the Kansas City Stockyards were charging unreasonable rates for services rendered. The Secretary of Agriculture at that time was Arthur M. Hyde, who, in lieu of an open hearing, had taken testimonies from the agencies. In March 1933, Henry A. Wallace became the new Secretary of Agriculture as Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as the 32nd United States President. Three months after assuming office, Wallace issued an order setting maximum rates to be charged by market agencies for their services at the Kansas City Stockyards. Morgan and the other agencies then brought suit to void that maximum rate because they had not been provided a proper hearing on the matter. The United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri agreed with the Secretary of Agriculture, and the agencies appealed to the Supreme Court.  Morgan v. United States  In 1936, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the agencies and reversed the District Court by setting aside the maximum rate that had been determined by the Secretary. The Court required the Secretary of Agriculture to provide evidence that he had adequately provided an appropriate hearing to the agencies. The matter returned to the District Court where the Secretary of Agriculture would provide evidence that he had made his determination on the maximum rate after reading the transcripts of the hearings provided by his predecessor. The District Court agreed with the Secretary of Agriculture, and so the agencies again appealed to the Supreme Court because Wallace had not presided over the hearings himself.Morgan v. United States, .  Morgan v. United States  For the Second time, the Supreme Court heard the case between the agencies and the Secretary of Agriculture. In 1938, the Court would side in favor with the agencies for the second time and reversed the District Court for the second time. The Court determined that reading the testimonies of a prior hearing did not provide the agencies a full hearing by the Secretary of Agriculture as required by the Packers and Stockyards Act. The Court held the hearing to be fatally defective and the order of the Secretary invalid. This decision stands for the important rule of administrative law that \\"he who decides must hear.\\"  United States v. Morgan  In 1939, the Supreme Court heard the third case between the agencies and the Secretary of Agriculture. This case involved the return of payments made between 1933 and 1937 in excess of a reasonable rate properly determined, and agreed by both parties, in 1937. The Secretary of Agriculture wanted to hold a new hearing to determine whether the excess payments were reasonable; while the agencies demanded return of the excess. Unlike the previous two cases, the District Court agreed with the agencies and determined that the Secretary of Agriculture must return the excess payments to the agencies.United States v. Morgan, . For the third time, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the District Court. It determined that the excess should be held pending a new hearing to determine the reasonable rate that should have been charged between 1933 and 1937.  United States v. Morgan  In June 1938, the Secretary of Agriculture directed that the proceeding be reopened to determine the reasonable rate that should have been set retroactively between 1933 and 1937. After an appropriate hearing and consideration, it was determined that the rate set in 1933 was reasonable. The agencies again brought suit. This time the agencies charged the Secretary of Agriculture with making a decision that was not supported by the evidence and that the Secretary of Agriculture was biased against a fair ruling. The agencies introduced into evidence a letter Wallace wrote to the New York Times following the Court's 1938 decision stating his extreme disappointment that opinion. The agencies also sued for the right to dispose and question the Secretary of Agriculture. After siding with the Secretary of Agriculture in the first two cases, the District Court sided with the agencies for the second consecutive time. The Secretary of Agriculture would then appeal to the Supreme Court. == Decision == In 1941, the Supreme Court heard its fourth cases between Henry A. Wallace, the Secretary of Agriculture, and Fred O. Morgan Sheep Commission Company with other agencies doing business at the Kansas City Stockyards. The Court determined that the Wallace had properly heard evidence and made determinations on the reasonable rates agencies should have been charged for their services between 1933 and 1937. The Court also determined that the expressed strong views by Wallace in his letter to the New York Times did not unfit him for exercising his duty in the subsequent proceedings. Finally, the Court held that the Secretary of Agriculture, as a high-ranking official, should not be called upon to question and defend the basis for his decision. Thus the Court ruled in favor of the Secretary of Agriculture and determined that the agencies could not recover payments made to the government between 1933 and 1937. The District Court decision was then reversed. This was the last case between the Secretary of Agriculture and the agencies. In their four appearances before the Court, each side had prevailed twice. The Court sided with the agencies with their 1936 and 1938 decisions and sided with the Secretary of Agriculture in the 1939 and 1941 decisions. However, the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri decisions did not prevail in any Morgan case as the Supreme Court reversed the lower court in all four decisions. == Morgan Doctrine == The 1941 Morgan decision has been classified as a landmark decision by federal courts and the decision is the foundation for the Morgan Doctrine which strongly cautions against the taking of depositions from high-ranking government officials. In 1941, the Court recognized the importance of protecting the decision-making process of such officials and feared the effects of interrogations and analogized the high-ranking government official to a judge; \\"[j]ust as a judge cannot be subjected to such scrutiny, so the integrity of the administrative process must be equally respected. == References External links== * Category:1941 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Hughes Court Category:United States Supreme Court cases ","title":"United States v.

With these words Faggioli described his idea of the worker association: We (Craft Worker) have formed sections of crafts, for example blacksmiths, masonry, chapels etc. All these sections having different interests come together separately to deal with their business. However, the individual sections are tightened by the economic constraint, so that if the chapels make a strike, the other sections help them with money; So the strikes are profitable and at the same time the masses are used to revolutions.

Young] (1869‚Äì1941) was an American fiction and editorial writer, and an advocate for the suffrage movement. == Background and early work == Rose Emmet Young was born in Lexington, Missouri and spent her childhood there. Prior to her work in the suffrage movement and as a writer, she ran a lumber company. Young contributed to magazines and editorials under the pen name R.E. Young. Her fiction was published in Harper's, McClure's, The Century Magazine, Collier's and Atlantic Monthly; she was the literary and art editor for the University Publishing Co. for four years. Young moved to New York in 1899 and worked on the staff of the New York Evening Post. She spent much of her life in New York. == Suffrage movement == In 1915, Young was hired by Carrie Chapman Catt to create and direct the Leslie Bureau of Suffrage Education, the press bureau for the Leslie Woman Suffrage Commission and the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The bureau was created with funds from an inheritance, valued at nearly one million dollars, left to the cause of women's suffrage by Miriam Leslie. The Bureau was a daily news service distributed in all fifty states that collected and distributed information about women's right to vote; Young's job was to compile and redistribute news, editorials, photographs, cartoons and statistics to newspapers across the United States to inform the public about efforts related to women's suffrage and advocate for its adoption. The Bureau claimed that its news service, through distribution by the Associated Press and other wire services, reached ten to twenty million readers. Rose Emmet Young (top row, first from left) As an extension of that effort, Young created and was editor-in-chief of The Woman Citizen (later The Woman's Journal), a weekly newsletter for women that merged three existing publications: Woman's Journal, National Suffrage News, and The Woman Voter. This project extended the reach of the Leslie Bureau's research department for compiling statistics, lists of books, and editorial pieces. The Woman Citizen operated out of 171 Madison Avenue in New York City and on its own had a circulation of 20,000 readers. Young also contributed to several magazines and newspapers by writing editorials advocating for the advancement of the cause of women's suffrage. == Published works ==  Novels  * Sally of Missouri (1903) * Henderson (1903) * Murder at Mason‚Äôs (1927)  Short stories  * \\"Petticoat Push\\" (1906/1907), published in Harper's Bazaar * \\"With Reluctant Feet\\" (1906/1907), published in Harper's Bazaar * \\"The Substance of Things Hoped For\\" (1906/1907), published in Harper's Bazaar  Plays  * \\"The Cigar Smoker\\" (performed 1936), co-written with Marie Jenney Howe.

'Gudeuljangnon Paddy field' is a paddy field artificially created by reorganizing natural environment to produce more rice in such unfavorable conditions. Cheongsando 'Gudeuljangnon Paddy field' in Wando County was designated Republic of Korea's Important Agricultural Heritage No. 1 on January 22, 2013 according to the strict criteria of value, partnership, and effectiveness of heritage in deference to Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (South Korea) (April 14, 2014)Press Releases  Beombawi('Tiger Rock')  Beombawi The legend has it that a tiger that lived on Cheongsando long ago was surprised at its own roar leveled at the rock and ran off the island.

She established the first Francophone Protestant community in Quebec. The daughter of Alexandre Nicolas Odin, municipal secretary, and Jeanne Marie Gachet, she was born Henriette Odin in Montagny in the canton of Vaud and moved to Lausanne with her parents three years later. In 1822, Odin married Louis Feller, the director of the Lausanne police. Over the next five years, her daughter, husband, sister and mother died. She contracted typhoid fever and took a rest cure at the Jura. In 1827, she left the official Protestant church; she became involved with the Soci√©t√© des Missions √âvang√©liques de Lausanne. In 1835, she left for Canada with Louis Roussy. Opposed by the Catholic clergy in Quebec, she settled in Grande-Ligne, where the clergy had less influence. During the Lower Canada Rebellion, the patriotes viewed the missionaries as sympathetic to their English opponents and Feller and her converts fled to the United States. Following the Rebellion, Feller found that she was better received in Grande-Ligne; her group also gained some sympathy in the United States which helped them raise funds in support of the mission. Feller came down with pneumonia in 1855 which led her to rest in the southern United States and later Switzerland without much improvement. In 1865, she became paralyzed and was confined to her room. Although Feller did not join it, she was instrumental in inspiring the creation of the French Canadian Missionary Society in 1839, which had the aim of converting French Canadians to Protestantism. The Institut Feller, established in 1855, was expanded in 1880 and continued to operate until 1967.

A longtime leader of the Homemakers' Union and Foundation and the National Union of Taiwan Women‚Äôs Associations, she was an active member of Green Party Taiwan before joining the Democratic Progressive Party in 2015. She represented the DPP in the 2016 legislative elections, and won a seat via party list proportional representation. ==Education== Chen earned a master's in business administration from San Diego State University in the United States. ==Political stances and activism== In a 2001 open letter co-written with nine others, Chen rejected the One China principle and advocated Taiwanese independence. In the early 2000s, she was the leader of the Homemakers' Union and Foundation. From this position, Chen advocated for a centralized collection effort regarding organic kitchen waste. She also denounced the Chinese fur trade. She has called upon governmental and private efforts to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions. By 2009, Chen had stepped down as chair of the Homemaker Union and Foundation, but later resumed the post and remained on its board of directors. She has described nuclear power as \\"something that can cause immense destruction when something goes wrong\\" in spite of increasing public support for the technology due to climate change. Chen advocated that construction of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant be stopped, and plans were eventually put on hold in 2014. Chen believes that the use of ractopamine and other additives is questionable and not fully endorsed by scientific research, and that US beef imports to Taiwan found to include ractopamine should not be accepted. She is active in raising awareness for other food safety concerns, among them nitrate and radiation contamination. Chen has warned against cigarette consumption on public health and environmental grounds. She opposed the reclassification of scrap metal as non- hazardous material proposed in 2013, citing a health scare similar to food scandal that received widespread attention that year. Chen has also led the National Union of Taiwan Women‚Äôs Associations. In this capacity, Chen opposed the appropriation of public land for government-sanctioned private and business use. In 2009, she led a protest against legislator Tsai Chin-lung, who charged public oversight organization Citizen Congress Watch with slander over an unfavorable ranking of him. Chen also participated in a campaign to bar the construction of a casino on Penghu later that year. A referendum was held in September to consider its establishment, but it failed. As a legislator, Chen has been frequently critical of Taipower, Taiwan's state- owned electric utility. In addition to Taipower, Formosa Petrochemical and Formosa Plastics Group have also drawn her attention for subpar environmental protection efforts. Chen has pushed for the government to revise standards and clearly differentiate between types of industrial waste. With regards to animal rights, Chen supports a ban on the use of steel traps and backs government attempts to cut down on animal euthanasia. ==Career== Green Party Taiwan supported Chen's 2006 campaign for a seat on Taipei City Council. She later became a party convenor. Chen received Green Party Taiwan support for a legislative run in Taipei County 9th district during the 2008 election. In 2015, Chen was named to the Democratic Progressive Party proportional representation party list ballot and subsequently elected to the Legislative Yuan. In 2016, Penghu County considered a second referendum on casinos, which Chen also opposed. Like the first vote, the second referendum did not pass. She supported an amendment to the Act of Gender Equality in Employment proposed in May, which aimed to lengthen maternity leave for partners of unmarried women. Chen also backed calls to establish a government ministry leading marine conservation efforts. Chen sat on a total of four committees, including the Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee, the Procedure Committee, the Expenditure Examination Committee, and the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:San Diego State University alumni Category:Taiwanese women in politics Category:Taiwanese environmentalists Category:Taiwanese women environmentalists Category:Party List Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Members of the 9th Legislative Yuan Category:Democratic Progressive Party Members of the Legislative Yuan Category:Politicians of the Republic of China on Taiwan from Taipei Category:Taiwanese anti‚Äìnuclear power activists ","title":"Mary Chen"},{"id":"54224646","text":"The Listies are Richard Higgins and Matt Kelly, a double act from Melbourne, The two have made books, a TV show and have had performed at the Melbourne Comedy Festival.

The operating system arrived at Berkeley in 1974, at the request of computer science professor Bob Fabry who had been on the program committee for the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles where Unix was first presented. A PDP-11/45 was bought to run the system, but for budgetary reasons, this machine was shared with the mathematics and statistics groups at Berkeley, who used RSTS, so that Unix only ran on the machine eight hours per day (sometimes during the day, sometimes during the night). A larger PDP-11/70 was installed at Berkeley the following year, using money from the Ingres database project. Also in 1975, Ken Thompson took a sabbatical from Bell Labs and came to Berkeley as a visiting professor. He helped to install Version 6 Unix and started working on a Pascal implementation for the system. Graduate students Chuck Haley and Bill Joy improved Thompson's Pascal and implemented an improved text editor, ex. Other universities became interested in the software at Berkeley, and so in 1977 Joy started compiling the first Berkeley Software Distribution (1BSD), which was released on March 9, 1978. 1BSD was an add-on to Version 6 Unix rather than a complete operating system in its own right. Some thirty copies were sent out. ==2BSD (PDP-11)== The Second Berkeley Software Distribution (2BSD), released in May 1979, included updated versions of the 1BSD software as well as two new programs by Joy that persist on Unix systems to this day: the vi text editor (a visual version of ex) and the C shell. Some 75 copies of 2BSD were sent out by Bill Joy. A further feature was a networking package called Berknet, developed by Eric Schmidt as part of his master's thesis work, that could connect up to twenty-six computers and provided email and file transfer. After 3BSD (see below) had come out for the VAX line of computers, new releases of 2BSD for the PDP-11 were still issued and distributed through USENIX; for example, 1982's 2.8.1BSD included a collection of fixes for performance problems in Version 7 Unix, and later releases contained ports of changes from the VAX-based releases of BSD back to the PDP-11 architecture. 2.9BSD from 1983 included code from 4.1cBSD, and was the first release that was a full OS (a modified V7 Unix) rather than a set of applications and patches. The most recent release, 2.11BSD, was first issued in 1991. In the 21st Century, maintenance updates from volunteers continued: patch 451 was released on December 22, 2018. ==3BSD== DEC VT100 terminal, widely used for Unix timesharing VAX-11/780, a typical minicomputer used for early BSD timesharing systems VAX-11/780 internals A VAX computer was installed at Berkeley in 1978, but the port of Unix to the VAX architecture, UNIX/32V, did not take advantage of the VAX's virtual memory capabilities. The kernel of 32V was largely rewritten by Berkeley students to include a virtual memory implementation, and a complete operating system including the new kernel, ports of the 2BSD utilities to the VAX, and the utilities from 32V was released as 3BSD at the end of 1979. 3BSD was also alternatively called Virtual VAX/UNIX or VMUNIX (for Virtual Memory Unix), and BSD kernel images were normally called \`/vmunix\` until 4.4BSD. The success of 3BSD was a major factor in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) decision to fund Berkeley's Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG), which would develop a standard Unix platform for future DARPA research in the VLSI Project. ==4BSD== 4BSD (November 1980) offered a number of enhancements over 3BSD, notably job control in the previously released csh, delivermail (the antecedent of sendmail), \\"reliable\\" signals, and the Curses programming library. In a 1985 review of BSD releases, John Quarterman et al., wrote: ==4.1BSD== 4.1BSD (June 1981) was a response to criticisms of BSD's performance relative to the dominant VAX operating system, VMS. The 4.1BSD kernel was systematically tuned up by Bill Joy until it could perform as well as VMS on several benchmarks. The release would have been called 5BSD, but after objections from AT&T; the name was changed; AT&T; feared confusion with AT&T;'s UNIX System V. ==4.2BSD== 4.2BSD (August 1983) would take over two years to implement and contained several major overhauls. Before its official release came three intermediate versions: 4.1a incorporated a modified version of BBN's preliminary TCP/IP implementation; 4.1b included the new Berkeley Fast File System, implemented by Marshall Kirk McKusick; and 4.1c was an interim release during the last few months of 4.2BSD's development. Back at Bell Labs, 4.1cBSD became the basis of the 8th Edition of Research Unix, and a commercially supported version was available from mtXinu. To guide the design of 4.2BSD, Duane Adams of DARPA formed a \\"steering committee\\" consisting of Bob Fabry, Bill Joy and Sam Leffler from UCB, Alan Nemeth and Rob Gurwitz from BBN, Dennis Ritchie from Bell Labs, Keith Lantz from Stanford, Rick Rashid from Carnegie-Mellon, Bert Halstead from MIT, Dan Lynch from ISI, and Gerald J. Popek of UCLA. The committee met from April 1981 to June 1983. Apart from the Fast File System, several features from outside contributors were accepted, including disk quotas and job control. Sun Microsystems provided testing on its Motorola 68000 machines prior to release, ensuring portability of the system. The official 4.2BSD release came in August 1983. It was notable as the first version released after the 1982 departure of Bill Joy to co-found Sun Microsystems; Mike Karels and Marshall Kirk McKusick took on leadership roles within the project from that point forward. On a lighter note, it also marked the debut of BSD's daemon mascot in a drawing by John Lasseter that appeared on the cover of the printed manuals distributed by USENIX. ==4.3BSD== \\"4.3 BSD UNIX\\" from the University of Wisconsin circa 1987. System startup and login. 4.3 BSD from the University of Wisconsin. Browsing \\"/usr/ucb\\" and \\"/usr/games\\" 4.3BSD was released in June 1986. Its main changes were to improve the performance of many of the new contributions of 4.2BSD that had not been as heavily tuned as the 4.1BSD code. Prior to the release, BSD's implementation of TCP/IP had diverged considerably from BBN's official implementation. After several months of testing, DARPA determined that the 4.2BSD version was superior and would remain in 4.3BSD. (See also History of the Internet.) After 4.3BSD, it was determined that BSD would move away from the aging VAX platform. The Power 6/32 platform (codenamed \\"Tahoe\\") developed by Computer Consoles Inc. seemed promising at the time, but was abandoned by its developers shortly thereafter. Nonetheless, the 4.3BSD-Tahoe port (June 1988) proved valuable, as it led to a separation of machine-dependent and machine- independent code in BSD which would improve the system's future portability. Apart from portability, the CSRG worked on an implementation of the OSI network protocol stack, improvements to the kernel virtual memory system and (with Van Jacobson of LBL) new TCP/IP algorithms to accommodate the growth of the Internet.M.K. McKusick, M.J. Karels, Keith Sklower, Kevin Fall, Marc Teitelbaum and Keith Bostic (1989). Current Research by The Computer Systems Research Group of Berkeley. Proc. European Unix Users Group. Until then, all versions of BSD incorporated proprietary AT&T; Unix code and were, therefore, subject to an AT&T; software license. Source code licenses had become very expensive and several outside parties had expressed interest in a separate release of the networking code, which had been developed entirely outside AT&T; and would not be subject to the licensing requirement. This led to Networking Release 1 (Net/1), which was made available to non-licensees of AT&T; code and was freely redistributable under the terms of the BSD license. It was released in June 1989. 4.3BSD-Reno came in early 1990. It was an interim release during the early development of 4.4BSD, and its use was considered a \\"gamble\\", hence the naming after the gambling center of Reno, Nevada. This release was explicitly moving towards POSIX compliance, and, according to some, away from the BSD philosophy (as POSIX is very much based on System V, and Reno was quite bloated compared to previous releases). Among the new features were an NFS implementation from the University of Guelph and support for the HP 9000 range of computers, originating in the University of Utah's \\"HPBSD\\" port. In August 2006, InformationWeek magazine rated 4.3BSD as the \\"Greatest Software Ever Written\\". They commented: \\"BSD 4.3 represents the single biggest theoretical undergirder of the Internet.\\" ==Net/2 and legal troubles== Installation of 386BSD. 386BSD was an early port of BSD to the Intel 80386 architecture. After Net/1, BSD developer Keith Bostic proposed that more non-AT&T; sections of the BSD system be released under the same license as Net/1. To this end, he started a project to reimplement most of the standard Unix utilities without using the AT&T; code. For example, vi, which had been based on the original Unix version of ed, was rewritten as nvi (new vi). Within eighteen months, all of the AT&T; utilities had been replaced, and it was determined that only a few AT&T; files remained in the kernel. These files were removed, and the result was the June 1991 release of Networking Release 2 (Net/2), a nearly complete operating system that was freely distributable. Net/2 was the basis for two separate ports of BSD to the Intel 80386 architecture: the free 386BSD by William Jolitz and the proprietary BSD/386 (later renamed BSD/OS) by Berkeley Software Design (BSDi). 386BSD itself was short-lived, but became the initial code base of the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects that were started shortly thereafter. BSDi soon found itself in legal trouble with AT&T;'s Unix System Laboratories (USL) subsidiary, then the owners of the System V copyright and the Unix trademark. The USL v. BSDi lawsuit was filed in 1992 and led to an injunction on the distribution of Net/2 until the validity of USL's copyright claims on the source could be determined. The lawsuit slowed development of the free-software descendants of BSD for nearly two years while their legal status was in question, and as a result systems based on the Linux kernel, which did not have such legal ambiguity, gained greater support. Although not released until 1992, development of 386BSD predated that of Linux. Linus Torvalds has said that if 386BSD or the GNU kernel had been available at the time, he probably would not have created Linux. In June 1993, 4.4BSD-Encumbered was released only to USL licensees. ==4.4BSD and descendants== The lawsuit was settled in January 1994, largely in Berkeley's favor. Of the 18,000 files in the Berkeley distribution, only three had to be removed and 70 modified to show USL copyright notices. A further condition of the settlement was that USL would not file further lawsuits against users and distributors of the Berkeley-owned code in the upcoming 4.4BSD release. Marshall Kirk McKusick summarizes the lawsuit and its outcome: In March 1994, 4.4BSD-Lite was released that no longer require a USL source license and also contained many other changes over the original 4.4BSD- Encumbered release. The final release from Berkeley was 1995's 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2, after which the CSRG was dissolved and development of BSD at Berkeley ceased. Since then, several variants based directly or indirectly on 4.4BSD-Lite (such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD) have been maintained. In addition, the permissive nature of the BSD license has allowed many other operating systems, both free and proprietary, to incorporate BSD code. For example, Microsoft Windows has used BSD-derived code in its implementation of TCP/IP and bundles recompiled versions of BSD's command-line networking tools since Windows 2000. Also Darwin, the system on which Apple's macOS is built, is a derivative of 4.4BSD-Lite2 and FreeBSD. Various commercial Unix operating systems, such as Solaris, also contain varying amounts of BSD code. Simplified evolution of Unix systems. Not shown are Junos, PlayStation 3 system software and other proprietary forks. ==Significant BSD descendants== Bar chart showing the proportion of users of each BSD variant from a BSD usage survey in 2005. Each participant was permitted to indicate multiple BSD variants BSD has been the base of a large number of operating systems. Most notable among these today are perhaps the major open source BSDs: FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, which are all derived from 386BSD and 4.4BSD-Lite by various routes. Both NetBSD and FreeBSD started life in 1993, initially derived from 386BSD, but in 1994 migrating to a 4.4BSD-Lite code base. OpenBSD was forked in 1995 from NetBSD. A number of commercial operating systems are also partly or wholly based on BSD or its descendants, including Sun's SunOS and Apple Inc.'s macOS. Most of the current BSD operating systems are open source and available for download, free of charge, under the BSD License, the most notable exception being macOS. They also generally use a monolithic kernel architecture, apart from macOS and DragonFly BSD which feature hybrid kernels. The various open source BSD projects generally develop the kernel and userland programs and libraries together, the source code being managed using a single central source repository. In the past, BSD was also used as a basis for several proprietary versions of Unix, such as Sun's SunOS, Sequent's Dynix, NeXT's NeXTSTEP, DEC's Ultrix and OSF/1 AXP (now Tru64 UNIX). Parts of NeXT's software became the foundation for macOS, among the most commercially successful BSD variants in the general market. A selection of significant Unix versions and Unix-like operating systems that descend from BSD includes: * FreeBSD, an open source general purpose operating system. ** NeXT NEXTSTEP and OpenStep, based on the Mach kernel and 4BSD; the ancestor of macOS *** Apple Inc.'s Darwin, the core of macOS and iOS; built on the XNU kernel (part Mach, part FreeBSD, part Apple-derived code) and a userland much of which comes from FreeBSD ** Orbis OS, Sony's fork of FreeBSD 9 is the operating system for the PS4.

During his time with the Mountaineers, Sutton and his teammates became the first North Carolina Division 1 team to go undefeated. He is currently the founder and President of Carolina Therapeutic Services, Inc., a private agency that provides mental health, foster care, and adoption services to high-risk populations throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, and Illinois. Sutton is also the author of Why Not Me ‚Äì From Survival to Significance, a biography that explores his early life growing up in inner city Chicago. == Early life == Sutton was born on December 29, 1972, and grew up in Austin, Chicago, the largest suburb of Chicago by both size and population. According to the Chicago Police Department, the area is known to have high rates of poverty, homicide, and violent crime. While growing up, Sutton was frequently exposed to gang violence and criminal activity. However, he was able to find comfort and empowerment through athletics. He pursued football, baseball, and track at Austin Community Academy High School, and his success enabled him to leave Chicago to pursue a better future. == Football career == Sutton first attended Triton College, a two-year community college, where he continued to play football. When the school's football program was eliminated, Sutton was recruited by several 4-year colleges, and ultimately selected Appalachian State University. At Appalachian, Sutton majored in Criminal Justice and played for the Appalachian State Mountaineers. In 1996, Sutton was signed by the Chicago Bears as a free agent, where he played until 1997. While preparing to sign with the Kansas City Chiefs, he learned that he was at risk for long- term disabilities and nerve damage should he continue to play football. Sutton decided to walk away from the sport he loved, and began to pursue other avenues. == Post-Athletic career == After leaving his athletic career, Sutton worked for the Texas Juvenile Probation System in Beaumont, Texas, helping to guide and mentor at-risk children. In 1998, he and his family moved to Concord, North Carolina, where he enrolled in the local police academy. Upon graduation, Sutton became a law enforcement officer for the Concord City Police Department, and later a deputy sheriff for the Mecklenburg County Sheriff‚Äôs Department. While he enjoyed the work, he found that he missed working with children and young people. In 1999, Sutton began working with the North Carolina State Medicaid program, where he learned the ins-and-outs of the mental health field. When North Carolina voted to divest itself from various public programs, Sutton decided to start his own private venture that would provide opportunities and resources to the state‚Äôs underserved areas. In 2001, he founded Carolina Therapeutic Services, Inc. (CTS), formerly Greater Metrolina Mental Health Services. This private agency provides mental health services, foster care, and adoption to high-risk populations in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Illinois. In 2014, Sutton formed CTS Community Development, a 501(c)3 non-profit that provides funding for school supplies, scholarships, holiday gifts, and more to low-income adults and children. == Works == Sutton published his first biography, Why Not Me ‚Äì From Survival to Significance, in 2017.

Quality in Health Care 2000; 9: 6‚Äì13. Nursing process model provides the theoretical framework for nursing documentation. A nurse can follow this model to assess the clinical situation of a client and record a constructive document for nursing communication. ==Content== Nursing documentation mainly consists of a client's background information or nursing history referred as admission form, numerous assessment forms, nursing care plan and progress notes. These documents record the client's data captured at the relevant stages of the nursing process.Blair, W., & Smith, B. (n.d). Nursing documentation: Frameworks and barriers. Contemporary Nurse, 41(2), 160-168. The following sections describe the concept, aim, possible structure and content of these nursing documents using the example of nursing documentation in Australian residential aged care homes.  Admission  An admission form is a fundamental record in nursing documentation. It documents a client's status, reasons why the client is being admitted, and the initial instructions for that client's care. \\"General Info\\". Archived from the original on 12 March 2009. Retrieved 2009-04-03 The form is completed by a nurse when a client is admitted to a health care facility. The admission form provides the basic information to establish foundations for further nursing assessment. It usually contains the general data about a client, such as name, gender, age, birth date, address, contact, identification information (ID) and some situational descriptions about marriage, work or other background information. Based on the different nursing care provider's requirements, this form may also record family history, past medical history, history of present illness, and allergies  Assessment  The documentation of nursing assessment is the recording of the process about how a judgment was made and its related factors, in addition to the result of the judgment. It makes the process of nursing assessment visible through what is presented in the documentation content.Oroviogoicoechea C., Elliott B. & Watson S. (2008) Review: evaluating information systems in nursing. Journal of Clinical Nursing 17, 567‚Äì575. During nursing assessment, a nurse systematically collects, verifies, analyses and communicates a health care client's information to derive a nursing diagnosis and plan individualized nursing care for the client.Crisp J., Taylor C., Potter PA. & Perry A.G.

(2002) Documentation and the Nursing Process. Delmar Learning, Clifton Park, NY The nursing documents may contain a number of assessment forms. In an assessment form, a licensed Registered Nurse records the client's information, such as physiological, psychological, sociological, and spiritual status (see Figure 2). The accuracy and completeness of nursing assessment determine the accuracy of care planning in the nursing process. L. White, Documentation and the Nursing Process, Delmar Learning, Clifton Park, NY, 2002.  Nursing care plan  The nursing care plan (NCP) is a clinical document recording the nursing process, which is a systematic method of planning and providing care to clients. It was originally developed in hospitals to guide nursing students or junior nurses in providing care to client; however, the format was task-oriened rather than nursing-process-based.Greenwood D. (1996) Nursing care plans: issues and solutions. Nursing Management 27(3), 33-40. Nowadays, the NCP is widely used in nursing in various clinical and educational settings as a tool to direct individualized nursing care for clients.Neilson T., Peet M., Ledsham R. & Poole J.

There are many ways of structuring nursing care plans in correspondence with the different needs of nursing care in different nursing specialties. For example, a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home may be structured with several sections under each care domain such as pain, mobility, lifestyle, nutrition and continence. The information is recorded in free-text style, and various terms are used singly or in combination to name each of the four sections in the formats that are used by a facility during a particular period  Progress notes  A progress note is the record of nursing actions and observations in the nursing care process.\\"UW Internal Medicine Residency Program\\". Retrieved 2009-04-10 It helps nurses to monitor and control the course of nursing care. Generally, nurses record information with a common format. Nurses are likely to record details about a client's clinical status or achievements during the course of the nursing care. == Recording format ==  Paper-based nursing documentation  The paper-based nursing documentation has been in place for decades. Client's data are recorded in paper documents. The information in these documents needs to be integrated for sense-making in a nursing decision.  Electronic nursing documentation  Electronic nursing documentation is an electronic format of nursing documentation an increasingly used by nurses. Electronic nursing documentation systems have been implemented in health care organizations to bring in the benefits of increasing access to more complete, accurate and up-to-date data and reducing redundancy, improving communication and care service delivery.Zhang Y, Yu P, Shen J. The benefits of introducing electronic health records in residential aged care facilities:A multiple case study. Interna- tional Journal of Medical Informatics 2012; 81: 690‚Äì704.  Comparison of the quality of paper-based and electronic documentation  Electronic nursing documentation systems are able to produce somewhat better quality data in comparison with paper-based systems, in certain respects depending on the characteristics of the systems and the practice of the various study settings. The common benefits of electronic documentation systems include the improvement of comprehensiveness in documenting the nursing process, the use of standardized language and the recording of specific items about particular client issues and relevance of the message. In addition, electronic systems can improve legibility, dating and signing in nursing records. For the documentation of nursing assessment, the electronic systems significantly increased the quantity and comprehensiveness of documented assessment forms in each record. In regard to the NCP, the electronic standardized NCPs were graded with a higher total quality score than its paper-based counterpart. In addition, in comparison with the paper- based documentation systems, the electronic systems, due to their automatic functions, were able to improve the format, structure and process features of documentation quality such as legibility, signing, dating, crossing out error and space with a single line and resident identification on every page. Paper- based documentation has been found to be inferior in comparison with electronic documentation. This is caused by the inherent nature of paper being difficult to update, time-consuming in a recording. Thus, the records are often incomplete, illegible, repetitive and missing signatures.Ammenwerth E,Eichstadter R,Haux R et al.A randomized evaluation of a computer-based nursing documentation system.

An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home Electronic nursing documentation systems have the potential to improve the quality of documentation structure and format, process and content in comparison with paper-based documentation, as demonstrated in a comparative study of electronic and paper-based nursing admission forms. Wang, N., Yu, P., & Hailey, D. (2012). Description and comparison of quality of electronic versus paper-based resident admission forms in Australian aged care facilities. International Journal of Medical Informatics, doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.11.011 However, improvement in documentation quality is not necessarily to be brought about by the introduction of electronic nursing documentation system to replace paper-based documentation. For example, Wang et al. that although the electronic nursing assessment form contained more documented assessment forms, which covered a wider range of resident care needs, they did not perform better than the previous [null paper-based assessment forms according to] the quality criteria of [null completeness] and timeliness. Therefore, further work on the usage of the electronic documentation systems may focus on improving form design and usage. There is also a need for improvement in compliance with standards in order to better meet the clients' care needs. == Quality of nursing documentation == A study by the National Client Safety Agency (NPSA)National Clients Safety Agency (2007) Recognising and responding appropriately to early signs of deterioration in hospital clients. NPSA, London. http://tinyurl.com/yk8ao5x (Accessed 20 November 2011) found that poor standards of documentation were a contributory factor in the failure to detect clients who were clinically deteriorating. Nurses are responsible for maintaining accurate records of the care they provide and are accountable if information is incomplete and inaccurate.Owen K (2005) Documentation in nursing practice. Nurs Stand 19(32): 48‚Äì9 Thus, a quality standard is required for recording of nursing documentation. The systematic review of nursing documentation audit studies in different settingsWang N, Hailey D, Yu P. Quality of nursing documentation and approaches to its evaluation: A mixed-method systematic review.Journal of Advanced Nursing 2011; 67: 1858‚Äì1875. identified the following relevant quality characteristics of nursing documentation: * Quality of documentation structure and format: relates to constructive features and physical presentation of records such as quantity, completeness, legibility, read- ability, redundancy and the use of abbreviations. * Quality of documentation process: the procedural issues of capturing client data such as nurse's signature and designation, date, chronological order, timeliness, regularity of documentation and concordance between documentation and reality. * Quality of documentation content: refers to the message from data about a care process. It is concerned with the comprehensiveness, appropriateness and the relation- ship of the five steps of the nursing process. The care issue recorded at each step is also considered. == Standardized nursing terminology == North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) nursing diagnosis: NANDA International (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) is a professional organization of nurses standardized nursing terminology that was officially founded in 1982 and develops, researches, disseminates and refines the nomenclature, criteria, and taxonomy of nursing diagnoses. Nursing intervention classification (NIC): The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) is a care classification system which describes the activities that nurses perform as a part of the planning phase of the nursing process associated with the creation of a nursing care plan. Nursing outcome classification (NOC): The Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a classification system which describes client outcomes sensitive to nursing intervention. The Omaha System: The Omaha System is a standardized health care terminology consisting of an assessment component (Problem Classification Scheme), a care plan/services component (Intervention Scheme), and an evaluation component (Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes). International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP): The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) is a collaborative project under the auspices of the International Council of Nurses. The ICNP provides a structured and defined vocabulary as well as a classification for nursing and a framework into which existing vocabularies and classifications can be cross-mapped to enable comparison of nursing data.Wake, M., & Coenen, A. (1998). Nursing diagnosis in the international classification for nursing practice (icnp). International Journal of Nursing Knowledge, 5(4), 335. == Structured documentation == Structured documentation takes the form of pre-printed guidelines for specific aspects of care and can, therefore, focus nursing care upon diagnoses, treatment aims, client outcomes and evaluations of care.Dahm M, Wadensten B (2008) Nurses' experiences of and opinions about using standardised care plans in electronic health records; a questionnaire study. J Clin Nurs 17(16): 2137‚Äì45 It can improve client care by replacing the practice of vague, narrative style entries by nurses with cohesive and accurate information determined by the format of the care plan. Irvine K, Tracey M, Scott A, Hyde A, Butler M, MacNeela P (2006) Discursive practices in the documentation of client assessments. Journal of Advanced Nursing 53(2): 151‚Äì9 The clarity of the recorded information also facilitates clinical auditing and evaluation of documentation practices through.Saranto K, Kinnunen U (2009) Evaluating nursing documentation-research designs and methods: systematic review. J Adv Nurs 65(3): 464‚Äì76 Therefore, the introduction of structured documentation and care plans are seen as a means by which nurses can raise standards of record-keeping practice.Law L, Akroyd K, Burke L (2010) Improving nursing documentation and record-keeping in stoma care.

He was descended from Genghis Khan, as the grandson of Kublai Khan, and son of Manggala, the third son of Kublai. Ananda was a devoted Muslim. According to Persian historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, he was raised by a Muslim from Central Asia whose name was Hassan. Under the influence of his step-father, Ananda became a Muslim. Tem√ºr Khan of China, the cousin of Ananda, tried to convert Ananda to Buddhism after discovering that Ananda was promulgating Islam in northwestern China where his fief was located. The prince's action was seen as unorthodox since most of the Mongols were affiliated with Buddhism. However, Ghazan Khan of Persia, another member of Genghis Khan's family, converted to Islam as well. Ananda mentioned Ghazan upon being called to the court. Tem√ºr was not able to change the mind of Ananda and decided to tolerate his practice of religion. The father of Ananda was enfeoffed with the Hexi Region, Tibet, and Sichuan Province.History of Yuan,vol.14 The broad fief made Ananda a competitive player in the politics of China. He gathered his army under his tent and converted his soldiers to Islam. The location of Ananda's throne was in the Liupan mountains of northwestern China where Genghis Khan spent his final days. The official title of Ananda was King of Anxi. In 1295, Ananda was in charge of the defense against Kaidu's invasion of Yuan China.New History of Yuan,vol.114 After the death of Tem√ºr Khan, Ananda aimed his goal at seizing the throne of China. He was appointed the regent of China with the support of Aqutai, the left chancellor. However, his ambition was disillusioned by K√ºl√ºg Khan and right chancellor Qarahesun in the year 1307. In the same year, he was executed by K√ºl√ºg. Ananda's scheme of usurpation, at first glance, was prevented by K√ºl√ºg. However, according to the History of Yuan, Ayurbarwada, younger brother of K√ºl√ºg, came to Khanbaliq before Ananda took power and imprisoned him.History of Yuan.vol.117 After his defeat and death, the Muslim population under his rule remained and became one of the main sources of Hui Chinese. His enthusiasm in Islam also made it one of the most important religions in northwestern China.

They expect to be welcomed by a representative from a local Arab cultural organization, but no one shows up. The group's leader, the quiet Colonel Tewfiq Zakaria, eventually decides the group will take the bus and instructs the younger, adventurous officer, Haled, to purchase the group's bus tickets. At the ticket office, Haled asks the clerk for a ticket to the city of Petah Tikvah, but due to his Egyptian accent, she misunderstands him and sells him tickets to the isolated desert town of \\"Bet Hatikva\\". The scene shifts to Bet Hatikva, where the residents bemoan the boring and monotonous lives they lead in the desert (\\"Waiting\\"). When the band arrives in Bet Hatikva, they approach two cafe workers, Papi and Itzik, to ask for directions to the Arab cultural centre for their performance the next day. Unsure who these men are and what they're asking about, they get the caf√©'s owner, a charismatic woman named Dina. Tewfiq again asks for directions to the cultural centre before Dina realizes they think this is Petah Tikvah, and explains that this is the wrong place, and they must have taken the wrong bus (\\"Welcome to Nowhere\\"). Dina tells the group that the next bus does not arrive until the next day. One of the band members looks for a phone to contact the Egyptian embassy, but Dina tells him that the only pay phone in town is guarded over, every night, by a man who obsessively waits for his girlfriend to call him, even though it has been months. Dina offers the band a meal and a place to stay for the night, and Tewfiq reluctantly agrees. In her kitchen, Tewfiq asks her about her background, and she tells how she was once married, and nothing in real life went as she had idealistically and naively thought (\\"It Is What It Is\\"). She asks Tewfiq the same, and he tells of a wife and son in Egypt. Meanwhile, Itzik allows the band member Simon to stay with him, his wife, their baby, and his father-in-law, Avrum. During dinner, Simon asks what happened to Avrum's wife, and Avrum says she died. When Simon asks when she died, he is silenced; Avrum says it is healthy for him to talk about it. He tells the story of how he met his wife many years ago at a club and remembers how music had been the foundation for their entire relationship. Itzik and Simon are touched by the story, but Itzik's wife continues to eat silently, avoiding all interaction during the meal (\\"The Beat of Your Heart\\"). That night, everyone makes plans to go out. Papi is invited on a double date with his crush but suffers from anxiety about going out with her. Haled tags along. Dina offers to show Tewfiq around Bet Hatikva, which he again is reluctant to accept. At dinner, Dina asks Tewfiq about what style of music his band plays. After he claims they stick to traditional Arab music, she mentions how as a child she would listen to music on Egyptian radio stations, from the likes of Umm Kulthum, and movies starring Omar Sharif. Tewfiq quotes one of the movies in question and they bond over the shared memories (\\"Omar Sharif\\"). At the roller skating rink, Haled watches from afar as Papi continues to ignore his crush and clumsily skate. After Papi defuses a brief altercation between Haled and one of the guards at the rink, Papi explains his romantic anxieties to Haled (\\"Papi Hears the Ocean\\"). After accidentally causing his crush to slip on her skates and fall down, Papi is petrified yet again. Haled helps to boost Papi's confidence, which leads to Papi and his crush finally embracing each other (\\"Haled's Song About Love\\"). After their dinner, Dina takes Tewfiq to \\"The Park\\", which is just a bench in the middle of Bet Hatikva. She asks him what it is like to have an orchestra and play music for people. He initially stutters, but after she asks him to sing, he begins to show her what it's like to be a conductor by allowing her to mimic his arm motions as he sings (‚ÄúItgara‚Äôa‚Äù). Despite not being able to understand his Arabic lyrics, she remains mesmerized by him and wonders if his visit to Bet Hatikva was meant for her by fate (\\"Something Different\\"). Itzik sings his son to sleep (\\"Itzik's Lullaby\\"), but in frustration with his lack of ambition in life, his wife leaves. Simon is initially concerned, but Itzik tells him that this happens often and she always returns. Soon, she does, and their son begins to cry. Simon is able to soothe the infant by playing his original concerto on his clarinet. Itzik and his wife reconcile, and Simon says goodbye to Avrum before going to bed. Dina finally asks more about Tewfiq's life. When she approaches the topic of his son, he reveals that he and his son never quite got along, which has bothered Tewfiq to this day and was the likely reason of his son's suicide. He also tells how his wife ended her life, as well, due to the heartbreak. Now visibly distraught, Tewfiq resists Dina's romantic advances as Haled arrives with news that the bus will be there in the morning to take them to Petah Tikvah. Tewfiq starts to leave the room, upset, while Dina solemnly recalls the meaning of their relationship (\\"Something Different (Reprise)\\"). Once Tewfiq is gone, Haled jokingly compliments her eyes, and she kisses him forcefully. Distraught, the 'telephone guy' questions his devotion to his loved one as he continues to wait by the pay phone. He and the citizens of Bet Hatikva long for the presence of a meaning to their lives as they anticipate the return to normalcy (\\"Answer Me\\"). Suddenly, just as 'telephone guy' gives up hope, the phone rings and he speaks to his girlfriend for the first time in months. The following morning, the band gathers by Dina's cafe before they prepare to board the next bus. As they begin to board, Dina hands Tewfiq a piece of paper with \\"Petah Tikvah\\" on it to ensure he doesn't forget. Later that day, the band makes it to the Petah Tikvah's Arab cultural centre. Once they are in their places, Tewfiq begins to conduct, and the stage cuts to black. ==Off-Broadway versus Broadway productions== In addition to numerous script tweaks, the musical arrangements for several songs were updated for the Broadway production. \\"Itzik's Lullaby\\", for example, was changed from a solo piece to a partial duet with Camal singing in Arabic. ==Musical numbers== Based on the tracklist from the cast recording released on December 15, 2017 * \\"Overture\\" ‚Äì The Band * \\"Waiting\\" ‚Äì The Residents of Bet Hatikva * \\"Welcome to Nowhere\\" ‚Äì Dina, Itzik, Papi * \\"It Is What It Is\\" ‚Äì Dina * \\"Beat Of Your Heart\\" ‚Äì Avrum, Itzik, Simon, Camal * \\"Soraya\\" ‚Äì The Band (added for Broadway, replacing \\"Aziza\\") * \\"Omar Sharif\\" ‚Äì Dina * \\"Haj-Butrus\\" ‚Äì The Band * \\"Papi Hears the Ocean\\" ‚Äì Papi * \\"Haled's Song About Love\\" ‚Äì Haled, Papi * \\"The Park\\" (Dialogue Track) ‚Äì Dina, Tewfiq * \\"Itgara'a\\" ‚Äì Tewfiq * \\"Something Different\\" ‚Äì Dina, Tewfiq * \\"Itzik's Lullaby\\" ‚Äì Itzik and Camal (Camal added for Broadway) * \\"Something Different\\" (Reprise) ‚Äì Dina * \\"Answer Me\\" ‚Äì Telephone Guy and Ensemble * \\"The Concert\\" ‚Äì The Band In addition, Boney M.'s cover of \\"Sunny\\" is heard in the roller rink, and Rodgers and Hart's \\"My Funny Valentine\\" is performed by Haled on the trumpet in the style of Chet Baker. ==Characters and original cast== {  style=\\"width:1000;\\" - !

[with] character depth and strong sense of place.\\"Caggiano, Christopher. \\"The Quiet, Exquisite Intensity of 'The Band‚Äôs Visit' \\" Huffington Post, January 2, 2017 The New York Times praised the cast, noting, \\"There‚Äôs not a performance, or a sung note, that feels out of key here... When the ensemble, led by Mr. Liberman, delivers the show‚Äôs final number, 'Answer Me,' the music takes on a transcendent harmonic shimmer that stops the heart.\\" According to Forbes, by October 2017, the Broadway show was \\"making a great impression\\" with critics with its first seven performances. The Broadway production, which featured a revised script and score, was praised by the Twin Cities Arts Reader as \\"one of the best new musicals of the year, gifted with a beautiful score and touching performances.\\" The New York Times said it was \\"one of the most ravishing musicals you will ever be seduced by,\\" and also \\"a Broadway rarity seldom found these days outside of the canon of Stephen Sondheim: an honest- to-God musical for grown-ups.\\" It also praised the adaptation for the bigger stage, due to an \\"impeccably coordinated creative team.\\" Deadline also gave the musical a positive review. The review's only criticism was that seating at a far distance in the new theater made the sound somewhat muddled and sight lines limited. The Chicago Tribune gave the \\"weird new Broadway musical\\" a very positive review and said it was a \\"remarkable and boundlessly compassionate and humanistic piece of theater.\\" Tablet Magazine thought it was \\"terrific.\\" Entertainment Weekly also reviewed The Band's Visit positively, praising Katrina Lenk's portrayal of the cafe owner Dina as \\"dazzling.\\" It gave the production an A-, and said it is \\"understated, probably better described as charming than life-altering, but its scale reinforces the moral themes of the musical itself.\\" The Washington Post observed that \\"producers unaffiliated with the show say they are heartened by its run,\\" as the \\"almost minimalist\\" production was doing well despite not having what seemed to be \\"a lot of overt commercial potential.\\" == Representation == The show has had a positive impact on Middle-Eastern actors and audiences, as many feel represented by the authentic characters that are not negative stereotypes. Ari‚Äôel Stachel who plays Haled, acknowledges this in his speech after winning the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical: ‚ÄúFor so many years of my life I pretended I was not a Middle Eastern person. [‚Ä¶] I am part of a cast of actors who never believed that they'd be able to portray their own races and we are doing that. And not only that but we're getting messages from kids all over the Middle East thanking us and telling us how transformative our representation is for them. [‚Ä¶] I want any kid that's watching to know that your biggest obstacle may turn into your purpose.\\" ==Awards and honors==  Original Off-Broadway production  {  width=\\"95%\\" - ! width=\\"5%\\" Year ! width=\\"20%\\" Award Ceremony ! width=\\"45%\\" Category ! width=\\"20%\\" Nominee ! width=\\"10%\\" Result -  rowspan=\\"24\\" align=\\"center\\"2017 -  rowspan=\\"7\\" Drama Desk AwardsCox, Gordon. \\"Drama Desk Awards 2017: Bette Midler, ‚ÄòOslo‚Äô Take Top Honors\\" Variety, June 4, 2017McPhee, Ryan. \\"2017 Drama Desk Awards Presented June 4\\" Playbill, June 4, 2017  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Book of a Musical  rowspan=\\"1\\" Itamar Moses  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Director of a Musical  rowspan=\\"1\\" David Cromer  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical  rowspan=\\"1\\" Ari'el Stachel  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Lyrics  rowspan=\\"1\\" David Yazbek  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Music  rowspan=\\"1\\" David Yazbek  -  rowspan=\\"1\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Outstanding Musical  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Orchestrations  rowspan=\\"1\\" Jamshied Sharifi  -  rowspan=\\"4\\" Lucille Lortel AwardsHetrick, Adam. \\"Ben Platt, 'The Band‚Äôs Visit', and 'Oslo' Take Top Honors at 2017 Lucille Lortel Awards\\" Playbill, May 2, 2017  Outstanding Lead Actress in a Musical  Katrina Lenk  -  Outstanding Costume Design  Sarah Laux  -  Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical  Ari‚Äôel Stachel  -  colspan=\\"2\\" Outstanding Musical  - New York Drama Critics Circle AwardStaff. \\" 'Oslo' & 'The Band's Visit' Win 2017 New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards\\" broadway.com, May 8, 2017 colspan=\\"2\\"Best Musical  -  rowspan=\\"7\\" Outer Critics Circle AwardsHetrick, Adam. \\"Bette Midler, 'Come From Away', and 'The Band‚Äôs Visit' Win Outer Critics Circle Awards\\" Playbill, May 8, 2017  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Actor in a Musical  rowspan=\\"1\\" Tony Shalhoub  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Actress in a Musical  rowspan=\\"1\\" Katrina Lenk  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Book of a Musical (Broadway or Off-Broadway)  rowspan=\\"1\\" Itamar Moses  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Director of a Musical  rowspan=\\"1\\" David Cromer  -  rowspan=\\"1\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Outstanding New Off-Broadway Musical  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding New Score (Broadway or Off-Broadway)  rowspan=\\"1\\" David Yazbek  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Outstanding Orchestrations (Broadway or Off- Broadway)  rowspan=\\"1\\" Jamshied Sharifi  -  rowspan=\\"1\\" Theatre World AwardClement, Olivia. \\"Josh Groban, Eva Noblezada, and More Among 2017 Theatre World Award Honorees\\" Playbill, May 11, 2017  rowspan=\\"1\\" colspan=\\"1\\"Dorothy Loudon Award for Excellence in the Theater  rowspan=\\"1\\" Katrina Lenk  -  rowspan=\\"1\\" Off-Broadway Alliance AwardsNews Desk. \\" 'Ernest Shackleton Loves Me' and 'Indecent' Top 2017 Off Broadway Alliance Awards; Winners Announced!\\" broadwayworld.com, May 16, 2017  rowspan=\\"1\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Outstanding Musical  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Obie AwardGans, Andrew. \\" 'Oslo' and 'The Band's Visi't Among 2017 Obie Award Winners\\" Playbill, May 22, 2017  rowspan=\\"1\\" colspan=\\"1\\"Obie Award for Musical Theatre  rowspan=\\"1\\"Itamar Moses (book) and David Yazbek (music & lyrics)  -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Obie Award for Directing  rowspan=\\"1\\" David Cromer  } Original Broadway production {  style=\\"width:95%;\\" - ! style=\\"width:5%;\\" Year ! style=\\"width:20%;\\" Award ! style=\\"width:45%;\\" Category ! style=\\"width:20%;\\" Nominee ! style=\\"width:10%;\\" Result -  rowspan=\\"15\\" 2018  rowspan=\\"11\\" Tony Award  colspan=\\"2\\" Best Musical  - Best Book of a Musical Itamar Moses  - Best Original Score David Yazbek  - Best Actor in a Musical Tony Shalhoub  - Best Actress in a Musical Katrina Lenk  - Best Featured Actor in a Musical Ari'el Stachel  - Best Scenic Design in a Musical Scott Pask  - Best Lighting Design in a Musical Tyler Micoleau  - Best Sound Design in a Musical Kai Harada  - Best Direction of a Musical David Cromer  - Best Orchestrations  rowspan=\\"1\\" Jamshied Sharifi  -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Drama League Award  colspan=\\"2\\" Outstanding Production of a Broadway or Off-Broadway Musical  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Distinguished Performance Award Katrina Lenk  - Tony Shalhoub  - rowspan=\\"1\\"Drama Desk Award Outstanding Sound Design in a Musical Kai Harada  -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2019  Grammy Award  colspan=\\"2\\"  Best Musical Theater Album  -  Daytime Emmy Award  Outstanding Musical Performance in a Daytime Program  The Cast of The Band's Visit on Today  } ==Recording== An original Broadway cast recording was released on December 15, 2017 through Sh- K-Boom Records.

It was used by the early settlers in the area to cross the river before the construction of the West Toodyay Bridge. For many years the whereabouts of the ford remained a mystery. It is not marked on any early survey map. In addition, the building of the West Toodyay Bridge in 1902 negated its use and details of its existence were lost. However, research carried out and published in 2010 revealed that the ford crossing was, and still is, a natural feature of the Avon River. A wide rocky shelf spans the river immediately upstream from the West Toodyay Bridge. It would have facilitated an easy crossing. In addition, the approaches on either side are relatively protected from erosion during times of flood. It is highly probable that the rocky ford crossing was part of a long established trail used by the local indigenous Ballardong Noongar people as they travelled up and down the Toodyay valley. The ford proved ideal for the passage of horse, cart and wagon across the Avon River. If, however, the river was in flood, any crossing of the river would have been too dangerous to attempt. Nevertheless, unlike other purposely built fords, there appear to have been no reports of damage to the ford, even in times of severe flooding, nor of any repairs having been carried out to its approaches. On the upstream side of the ford lay a long pool. The pool was fed by a permanently running spring that entered the river bed from the north side of the Avon River. Thus, throughout the heat of summer, the pool was ever present. The Military Barracks also stood upstream from the ford crossing on the left hand bank of the river. The ford crossing proved to be of paramount importance to the early inhabitants of the town of Toodyay as well as those in the valley beyond. == References == Category:West Toodyay Category:River crossings in Australia Category:Avon River (Western Australia) ","title":"Ford crossing, West Toodyay"},{"id":"54224929","text":"Robic or Robiƒá is the surname of the following people: *Antony Robic (born 1986), French football midfielder *Genevi√®ve Robic-Brunet (born 1959), Canadian road racing cyclist *Ivo Robiƒá (1923‚Äì2000), Croatian singer and songwriter *Jean Robic (1921‚Äì1980), French road racing cyclist *John Robic (born 1963), American basketball coach *Jure Robiƒç (1965‚Äì2010), Slovenian cyclist and soldier *Myl√®ne Dinh-Robic (born 1979), Canadian actress *Sa≈°o Robiƒç (1967‚Äì2010), Slovenian alpine skier *Xavier Robic (born 1979), French actor ","title":"Robic (surname)"},{"id":"54224956","text":"Military Barracks location on the high left bank of the Avon River, West Toodyay The Toodyay Barracks (also referred to at various times as the Military Barracks, Police Station or Police Barracks) and its stables, erected in 1842, were the first buildings constructed in the townsite of Toodyay, Western Australia. The Barracks were also the first government buildings within the Toodyay district. Situated on the left bank of the Avon River and a little upstream from the ford, the Barracks overlooked a long pool, which soon became known as the Barracks Pool. In the early 1840s, Toodyay Resident Magistrate John Scully had requested military protection as a means of controlling a problem with the local indigenous people. Governor John Hutt agreed at the time to temporarily station a mounted native policeman to keep order. The Toodyay Barracks were built by William Criddle, a local farmer, at a cost of 60 pounds. Completed in September 1842, they stood on what became lot L1. The main building measured and was built of rammed earth with a thatched roof. It contained two rooms with a central chimney and an earthen floor. Each room had a door and a shuttered window. Two beds, two tables, dishes, plates, pots, buckets, an axe, shovel and such like were provided. The stables, built of wooden upright slabs with a thatched roof, measured and were considered adequate for the number of horses it would shelter. It also contained areas set aside for the storage of chaff and hay. John Nicol Drummond At times, the Toodyay Barracks were variously referred to as the Military Barracks or the Police Station because both a soldier and mounted native policeman were stationed there. The Barracks also served as a temporary lock-up. However, the lock-up proved inadequate, as Aboriginal prisoners were able to escape with ease. John Nicol Drummond, Inspector of Native Police, visited the area regularly. During the 1840s, Edward Conlin erected a large hut type store on land between the Barracks and the ford. However, its presence is not officially recorded. In 1851, Charles Pye set up a store on what became lot L2, on the other side of the Barracks. The Barracks were first used as a post office in 1846 when operated by Mrs Pusey, the policeman's wife. Constable Pusey was a native police officer stationed at Toodyay under the supervision of Drummond. William Herbert took over the post office duties in 1848, followed by Michael Clarkson in 1849. After the coming of the convicts to Toodyay, the Barracks were occupied by only a civil police constable and a mounted native policeman. Thereafter, the Barracks were referred to as the Police Station. The Police Station at West Toodyay closed in 1859. On 30 March 1859, the Police Station was offered for sale or let, possession available on 21 June. The police were being transferred to a number of unused buildings within the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot, situated approximately upstream. The sale of the original Police Station did not eventuate and the building saw no further use. Lot L1 remained as Crown land. Ruins of the original building could be seen for many years. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in West Toodyay ","title":"Toodyay Barracks"},{"id":"54225006","text":"ford crossing from near the site of the Highland Laddie The Highland Laddie was an inn in West Toodyay. The business was initially established in 1850 as the Bonnie Laddie, and also traded as the Gum Tree Tavern. Approximate location of the Highland Laddie Inn Alexander Warren had been granted lot R25 in the original townsite of Toodyay, Western Australia in October 1849. He very quickly applied for a publican's license, which was granted in early 1850, and named his inn the Bonnie Laddie. It stood at , close to the Royal Oak and not far from the ford crossing of the Avon River. Both inns were likely to have been built of rammed earth with a thatched roof. Warren managed the inn for two years before advertising the property as either for sale or to let. His advertisements referred to the inn as the Toodyay Hotel. In April 1852, he leased the hotel to the partnership of Joseph York and William Rummer. When the partnership dissolved twelve months later, Rummer took over the lease. In doing so, he changed the name of the hotel to the Highland Laddie. Rummer terminated his lease at the end of 1854. In 1855, Warren resumed management of his hotel and gave it the name of the Gum Tree Tavern. He also set about obtaining nearby lots R24, R27, R28 together with lot R10 and lot R45. In 1855 he exchanged lot R10 for John Herbert's lot R26.State Records Office of Western Australia, Acc 1803, Townsites & Suburbs 3. It seems very probable that Warren decided to operate the Gum Tree Tavern from the better quality building on lot R26 (), instead of the original building on R25. He soon found himself in financial difficulties. By early 1856, his debt had amounted to almost 320 pounds. On 18 September 1856, Warren's wife died giving birth to their child. The child also did not survive. Nevertheless, on 29 October 1856, he fulfilled his commitment to the Agricultural Society's festivities by hosting an excellent luncheon served up in superior style. More than 120 guests attended, including the Governor and a large party of ladies. On 26 February 1858, an indenture was registered between Warren and the partnership of Joseph Farmaner and Walter Padbury whereby Warren was recorded as owing the sum of three hundred and nineteen pounds, a princely sum of money in those days. That same day, Isaac Doust signed an agreement to purchase lots R24, R25, R26, R27, R28 and R45 and take over the debt of three hundred pounds owed to Farmaner and Padbury. The mortgage was formally drawn up on 18 June 1858. The mortgage did not include lot R26. On obtaining his publican's license, Doust chose to name the hotel the Highland Laddie. Doust renewed his publican's license in February 1859. However, he had borrowed a large sum of money and, before long, he found he could not meet his commitments. In September 1859, Doust was declared insolvent and all household furniture, goods, and effects were sold by auction at the Toodyay Fair of that year. The Highland Laddie went out of business and was washed away entirely in the disastrous flood of 1862. The majority of the town lots he had owned were put to auction by a mortgagee power of sale. Doust later re-established himself in the Bridgetown district. He died in 1903, aged 90 years. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in West Toodyay Category:Pubs in Western Australia Category:Defunct hotels in Western Australia Category:1850 establishments in Australia Category:1859 disestablishments in Australia ","title":"The Highland Laddie, Toodyay"},{"id":"54225018","text":"Noahs Rump is a mountain in the Central New York region of New York.

It was situated on lot R3, on the right bank of the Avon River. A shrewd businessman, he had placed his hotel within easy reach of the Enrolled Pensioner Guard Barracks, which, for the time being, continued to be maintained at the original site of the Toodyay Convict Depot. His action took much of the ready trade from the other two hotels, The Royal Oak and the Gum Tree Tavern. Everett had arrived as a convict on board Pyrenees in June 1851. His crime was larceny, for which he received a sentence of seven years and transportation to Western Australia. Prior to his transportation, Everett had been a gardener by occupation. His father had been a farmer and stock owner. Everett applied the knowledge gained from his background as he endeavoured to carve out a living for himself in the colony. He had left his wife and three children behind in England, only one of whom, George, ventured to join him in Western Australia. Location of the Queens Head Hotel, which opened in 1855 Along with all the other convicts who were on board Pyrenees, his ticket-of- leave was granted immediately after disembarking in Fremantle. A conditional pardon was granted on 23 April 1853. By this time he had made his home in Toodyay and was working as a boot and shoemaker. In 1854, he applied for his first grant of land, lot R3. After its approval in June 1854, Everett erected a brick building with a shingled roof. His subsequent application for a publican's license caused controversy. Toodyay resident magistrate, Joseph Harris, was of the opinion that two public houses were sufficient. However, Everett persisted and, in 1855, he opened the Queen's Head for business. He advertised himself as a publican, storekeeper and general dealer. A wide range of boots and shoes were offered for sale. Meetings at the Queen's Head were encouraged. Everett was a most enterprising man. He soon acquired lots R2, R4 and R5, which enabled him to expand the hotel. In the following years Everett would acquire further properties elsewhere in the Toodyay area. In November 1856, Governor Kennedy gave the order to close the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot, which had been relocated three miles upstream. The corps of Enrolled Pensioner Guards was no longer required and the Government therefore chose to put it up for sale. Avon Location 69 together with lot R1 were sold to John Davidson, a local settler. With news of the closing of the depot the enterprising Everett understood the potential impact to his business, Everett endeavoured to sell up and return to England. The sale did not eventuate. In November 1858, on the day after the Toodyay Show, Everett hosted an elaborate tea party. The tea party was repeated the following year. In 1860, after the demise of the Royal Oak and the closure of the Highland Laddie, all the social events of the Agricultural Society were held at the Queen's Head. Everett made it a grand affair indeed. The annual meeting was held at 2pm on 30 October, and followed by the annual dinner that evening. The tea party with games and amusements was scheduled for 5pm the next day. It all culminated in a grand public ball held on 1 November, for which Everett was most proud. Everett's success was short lived. In 1861, he was denied the renewal of his publican's license due to the fact that there was no longer a police presence in the old township of Toodyay. The police had been transferred to the newly established township of Newcastle and it was considered unwise to operate a hotel under such circumstances. The Queen's Head was forced to close. Moondyne Joe For a number of years, Everett continued operating his former hotel as a shop offering a wide range of goods. He acquired further land grants and pastoral leases and soon derived added income as a farmer and stockowner of cattle, horses, bullocks and a few sheep. Unfortunately, one of those leases included land regularly used by Joseph Bolitho Jones, otherwise known as Moondyne Joe. Moondyne Joe was most irate when he discovered that his horse traps, from which he derived a living, now stood on privately held land. Everett had made an enemy indeed and on the night of 7 September 1866, his store was ransacked. Moondyne Joe had struck. A variety of goods such as guns, ammunition, food and clothing were stolen. Joe and his party were planning to escape across the border to South Australia. He was also intent on evening the score with Everett whose losses turned out to be considerable. Two weeks later, Moondyne Joe was recaptured and sent directly to Fremantle Gaol, where a specially prepared and secure cell awaited him. Everett made other such enemies and spent quite some time debating issues in the courts of Perth. Everett continued to live at the Queen's Head where he cultivated his own vineyard. He also acquired other town lots, which he developed and farmed. Fruit trees and the production of wine and raisins were doing well in the district. In 1872, Everett applied for a colonial wine license. The Queen's head was back in business. When the Toodyay Road Board was formed in 1871, Everett was elected as one of its founding members. A total of seven men were elected, only two of whom were expirees. Everett was one and Dan Connor was the other. In 1886, Everett realised that his health was failing. He made up his mind to sell all his goods and properties and return to England. Toodyay town lots R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R71, R72, R73 and R74, suburban lot 1, and Avon location 69 were among those properties. On many of them were cultivated vineyards. He estimated their worth to be 1500 pounds. Everett achieved his aim and sailed for London on 19 July 1886. == Thomas Donegan == In 1886, Thomas Donegan purchased all Everett's properties for the sum of 1500 pounds. He had sold the ownership of the Freemason's Hotel to his brother James Donegan. James had formerly operated the Bailup Inn on Toodyay Road. Charlotte, wife of Thomas Donegan and youngest daughter of John and Charlotte Herbert, brought an air of respectability to the Queen's Head. The Donegan family made it their home. The Queen's Head was now a long narrow structure containing about twelve rooms and many an occasion was celebrated under its roof. Concerts, dances, meetings, dinners, church services were attended by the people of Newcastle. Donegan died on 26 July 1891. Although a mere 40 years of age he was a man of considerable means. Social life in the old township waned dramatically after his passing. The Queen's Head stood for quite some time afterwards. In 1910 it was occupied by a retired watchmaker. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in West Toodyay Category:Pubs in Western Australia Category:Defunct hotels in Western Australia Category:1855 establishments in Australia ","title":"The Queen's Head, Toodyay"},{"id":"54225025","text":".ZADNA (.za Domain Name Authority) is a not-for-profit company that administrates the .za namespace.

Tom Sawyer He also assisted in development of the diesel locomotive while he worked for General Electric, which led him to be known as the \\"Father of the Diesel Locomotive\\".The Sunday Ridgewood News (April 7, 1968) Sawyer was the founder of what is now the modern-day International Gas Turbine Institute (IGTI), and among industry professionals was known as \\"Mr. Gas Turbine\\". Sawyer authored books about gas turbines, locomotives, and atomic power, and was awarded three U.S. Patents. The ASME established the R. Tom Sawyer Award to honor him for advancing gas turbine technology in all of its aspects for over 40 years. The award in his name is the highest award given by the IGTI, and is awarded annually at their international Turbo Expo. == Education and early work == Sawyer was born on June 20, 1901, in Schenectady, New York, but lived most of his life in Ho-Ho- Kus, New Jersey (Ridgewood, Bergen County). He received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Ohio State University in 1923 followed by a master's degree in mechanical engineering in 1930. His undergraduate thesis was entitled \\"Preliminary Design of 60,000 kw Steam Power Station\\". After receiving his undergraduate degree, Sawyer began working for General Electric, where he designed and developed early diesel locomotives. In 1928 while working on his master's degree, Sawyer rebuilt a 1920s Jordan automobile and replaced the gear box with a generator and motor. He thus created an early hybrid electric vehicle which combined the Jordan automobile's internal combustion engine (ICE) with a DC generator that powered an electric motor to drive the axles. 1920's Jordan automobile with R. Tom Sawyer, who successfully converted it to a hybrid-electric in 1928. He then drove it for 60,000 miles in the US and Australia as a demonstration of its capability Sawyer drove the car for 60,000 miles in the United States and Australia as a demonstration of its capability. He determined, however, that the electrical parts were too heavy and expensive to be practical, so he discontinued the project and donated the Jordan car to the Mechanical Engineering laboratory at Ohio State University. Sawyer remained in Australia for a year working as an engineer for Australian General Electric, where he worked on gas-electric railroad cars. In 1929, Sawyer visited Dr. Alfred B√ºchi, the Swiss inventor of supercharging, when Buchi was testing the turbocharger on a large diesel engine in the Sulzer Winterthur plant. It was here that Sawyer first saw a gas turbine without a combustor in the form of the Buchi diesel supercharger. == Career == Sawyer then joined the American Locomotive Company, where he served as head of research working on both diesel and gas turbine projects from 1930 to 1956. While working for General Electric in 1925, Sawyer helped assemble and delivered the very first diesel locomotive sold in the United States. Award for building and delivering the first diesel locomotive sold in the US ‚Äì given to R. Tom Sawyer In 1944 Sawyer applied for one of the first gas turbine powered locomotive patents. The patent was granted in 1948. In 1945, Sawyer published The Modern Gas Turbine which delineated the history and application of gas turbines including a description of initial testing of the Neuch√¢tel 4 MW gas turbine by Brown Boveri which was the first electric power industrial gas turbine. Sawyer worked as a technical advisor to the U.S. Army during the 1950s, where he helped develop application of gas turbines through mechanical drive to a locomotive which was the first step in applying nuclear power to military transportation. Gas turbine locomotive 1149 He was the chief engineer on the project that created the first gas turbine locomotive with mechanical drive that was completed for the army in 1952. Sawyer was instrumental in organizing and presenting the first ASME gas turbine technical papers. During May 8‚Äì10, 1944, ASME's 17th National Oil and Gas Power Conference was held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where there was intense interest in emerging gas turbine technology. On May 7, 1944, the day before the conference, the executive committee of the Oil and Gas Power Division voted to form a Gas Turbine Coordinating Committee (GTCC) to facilitate dissemination of information related to the gas turbine through meetings and the presentation of technical papers. GTCC with Sawyer of the American Locomotive Company as its chairman was the beginning of the IGTI. Sawyer lived in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, which was close to New York City. Sawyer commissioned a jeweler in New York City to make a die to cast a miniature multi-bladed axial-flow turbine \\"wheel\\" lapel pin. Gold turbine wheels from this design have been awarded by IGTI to many volunteers over the years. In 1964, Sawyer contacted the Broadway ASCAP songwriter Arthur Kent, most famous for The End of the World, to compose IGTI's song Onward and Upward with Gas Turbines which was later modernized by a Nashville lyricist. Sawyer remained involved with IGTI until his death in 1986. == Publications, patents, and other activities == Sawyer edited the Gas Turbine International Magazine for many years and served as the editorial chairman. He also served on the board of the American Rocket Society. Sawyer worked as a consultant and independent developer of gas turbines until his retirement in 1972. He authored various books including Introduction to the Gas Turbine Locomotive, Gas Turbine Construction, The Modern Gas Turbine, and co-authored Applied Atomic Power. He also wrote The Diesel and the Gas Turbine which was re-printed from the October 1945 issue of Atomic and Gas Turbine Progress as a booklet for the Engineering Department of the American Locomotive Company. In 1968, The American Gas Turbine Catalog was renamed Sawyer's Gas Turbine Catalog. Sawyer was awarded patents for a Power System (US1871472), Power Plant (US2526424), and a Rotary Engine Power Plant (US2445973). ==Personal life== Sawyer was married to Ruth Ennis Sawyer, daughter of Joseph B. Ennis, who was the vice president and director of engineering for the American Locomotive Company. They had two children and five grandchildren. == The R.

The beer, described by Ore Dock's head brewer as a \\"mid-coast\\" IPA that \\"not as hop-forward as its west coast counterparts, nor is it as malty as what you often find out east,\\" won the 2014 Beverage Tasting Institute World Beer Championships Gold Medal. Ore Dock began bottling its beer in 2014, and selling it outside of Marquette County in 2015. At this time, the brewery had enough capacity to brew 2,500 barrels per year‚Äîhaving expanded shortly before that from 850 barrels. In 2018, Ore Dock sold 1,631 barrels of beer within Michigan, making it the forty-first largest brewer in the state. This total was down from 1,754 in 2017, but up from 1,566 in 2016. == Location == The brewery is located in a former automobile repair shop and the second floor of an adjoining building, which functions as a community and event space. Described as \\"a loft space full of reclaimed barn wood,\\" the spaces include material from the auto garage that inhabited the spaces before the brewery moved in. The upstairs community space, charged with putting on events that emphasize visual arts and musical acts, hosts fundraisers, lectures, weddings, private parties, and musical acts.. == Recognition == In 2013, Ore Dock was ranked by MLive as one of the best new breweries in the state of Michigan. One year later, it was the only brewery from the Upper Peninsula mentioned by Thrillist in a ranking of every state by its beer. In 2017, it was recommended in The New York Times travel section. == See also == *Blackrocks Brewery *Keweenaw Brewing Company == Endnotes  References == * == External links == *Official site *List of beers *Ore Dock Brewing Company (Marquette Magazine) *Ore Dock Brewing Co. hits the shelves *Learning about the Ore Dock Brewing Company‚Äôs green business model Category:2012 establishments in Michigan Category:Companies based in Marquette, Michigan Category:Beer brewing companies based in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan Category:American companies established in 2012 ","title":"Ore Dock Brewing Company"},{"id":"54225231","text":"Nijdam is a Dutch surname that may refer to: *Henk Nijdam (1935‚Äì2009), Dutch cyclist; *Jelle Nijdam (born 1963), Dutch cyclist, son of the latter.

Temporary accommodation for the Enrolled Pensioner Guards was also constructed and surveys were carried out to enable more permanent accommodation to be built close by. The Enrolled Pensioner Guards were men who had either completed their duty of service or who had sustained injury while on active service. They had then volunteered as guards on the ships transporting convicts to Western Australia. Once the men were released from permanent duty, other duties of a peace keeping or military nature were expected of them. Many of these men became warders in charge of convicts. Charles Fitzgerald The decision to turn the colony into a penal settlement occurred after a good many settlers petitioned the Government to do so. The colony had struggled to survive during the 1840s. Governor Charles Fitzgerald supported the proposal and the colony became a penal settlement in 1849. The number of convicts sent to the colony was relatively small to start with. However, all that changed on 28 June 1851 when 293 convicts arrived on board Pyrenees. Their arrival had been unexpected. In addition, each convict was to receive his ticket-of-leave on disembarking at Fremantle. ==Setting up the Depot== Location of the first Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot in 1851 Fitzgerald decided to set up convict hiring depots in areas where men had the best chance of finding employment. Country depots were planned for York, Toodyay and Bunbury and approximately 40 men would be sent to each district. Ticket-of-leave men would then be hired out by local settlers to do whatever work was required by them. The remainder of the men were stationed in the Perth and Fremantle areas. A convict hiring depot was about to be set up in the townsite of Toodyay. Michael Clarkson had been appointed assistant superintendent. The site selected was Avon location 69 and the adjacent lot R1, an area totalling . Lot R1 was a narrow allotment with a fresh water stream flowing through it. It also provided access to Avon location 69 from River Terrace and the Avon River. The properties were originally owned by John Herbert, who had built a goodly sized cottage there. The cottage would provide immediate accommodation for the ticket-of-leave holders. Fitzgerald approved the acquisition of both properties on 4 August 1851. The sale of the properties to the Government had yielded a handsome profit for Herbert. The party of men chosen to travel to Toodyay was held up by floods in Guildford. It was winter and torrential rain was falling. Eventually, on Monday, 18 August 1851, Fitzgerald gave the order to head off. They were under the charge of Clarkson and were accompanied by several bullock teams and their gear. They camped overnight at the Bailup Inn and possibly near Jimperding Hill. The men were required to negotiate the risky descent of Jimperding Hill. It was customary to chain huge logs behind each the wagon to prevent it overtaking the bullocks in front. On the evening of 20 August, the party of approximately 40 ticket-of-leave holders struggled into the Military Barracks in Toodyay. Next morning, the entire party negotiated the rising waters of the Avon River to reach their destination upstream on the other side. The crossing took most of the day and was achieved with great difficulty. The men were aided by ropes when negotiating the deepest parts of the river. After settling in, the ticket-of-leave holders were put to work building straw huts to accommodate the expected arrival of the Pensioner Guards. The straw or rush huts were A-framed in shape and were erected using bush poles and had thatching that reached to the ground. Brushwood, grass tree needles and dry rushes were commonly used for thatching. At one end a canvas drape served as a door. A mud or stone chimney at the other end provided heating. The huts were a good size and surprisingly sturdy and long lasting. ==Enrolled Pensioner Guards== The straw huts, however, were only temporary accommodation as the Pensioner Guards were entitled to the offer of of allotments close to the depot site. The minimum payment of ten pounds required by law was compensated for by an allowance of ten pounds given towards the cost of building a two roomed cottage. The use of ticket-of-leave labour was allowed. Title was granted after seven years. Fitzgerald originally approved the marking out of 22 sites on the northern side of the Toodyay township. When the official survey revealed the existence of a steep hillside, the number of allotments was reduced to thirteen. The arrival of the Pensioner Guards was delayed by further heavy rain and flooding of the Avon River. It was mid-October before they reached their destination, after which the Pensioner Guards were given the task of supervising and directing the ticket-of-leave holders under their command. After the completion of the straw huts, the men were divided into road parties to repair the local roads to the best of their ability. The roads, mere tracks, had been made almost impassable by the recent heavy rainfall. ==Ticket-of-leave holders== Conflict and ill feeling quickly arose between free workmen and the newly arrived ticket-of-leave holders. The free workmen felt that their jobs were being threatened by the rate of pay for ticket-of-leave holders being less than what the free workmen currently received. Before the month was out, a drunken brawl arose at the Bonnie Laddie owned by Alexander Warren. Magistrate Harris was called upon to effect the peace. The offending men were escorted to Fremantle Gaol and banned from returning to the Toodyay district. It was necessary to build a secure gaol near the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot. The lock-up at the Military Barracks was poor and insufficient for the needs of a convict hiring depot. Escapes were too easily made. Heavy drinking at the local inns proved to be the biggest problem. The building planned was, in fact, a lock-up. However, it was generally referred to as the Toodyay Gaol. A number of ticket-of-leave holders were removed from road work to assist with the work at the gaol. ==Transfer to another site== In early 1852, it was decided to transfer the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot to a new and larger site, an area of Crown land designated as Avon location 110. Located approximately upstream, it measured just over in size. Construction of the new convict hiring depot would be overseen by Lieutenant Edmund Frederick Du Cane. Building began in February of that year. For the time being, the Pensioner Guards retained the use of the original depot site (in \\"Old Toodyay\\") for accommodation purposes. The area became known as the Pensioner Guard Barracks. However, the proposed Pensioner Guard allotments close to the former convict depot were sold off and new sites were selected adjacent to the new depot site. The cottages on these new allotments were not fully complete until 1856. Arthur Edward Kennedy The straw huts at the original convict depot site found further use during the years of 1853 and 1854 when an Emigrants' Depot was established in Toodyay. In July, August and September, an average of five men, fifteen women and fourteen children were in occupation at one time. In November 1856, the decision was made to close the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot together with that of York. Governor Arthur Kennedy was anxious to reduce growing debt. The corps of Enrolled Pensioner Guards was therefore no longer required in Toodyay. The Pensioner Guard Barracks were closed and the Government activated its sale. On 19 August 1857, Avon location 69 and lot R1 were sold to John Davidson, a local settler, for the sum of 116 pounds. == Notes  References == Category:Buildings and structures in West Toodyay Category:Pensioner Guards Category:Convictism in Western Australia ","title":"Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot (1851)"},{"id":"54225366","text":"==History== Vishwajyoti Higher Secondary School was initially established in the year 2051 B.S (1994 A.D) by a group of highly experienced professional in the field of education at Pragatinagar ‚Äì 3, Nawalparasi, Nepal, in collaboration with Nawal English Boarding School, established at Rajhar V.D.C. in the year 2039 B.S (1982 A.D) to promote it from Primary Level to Secondary Level and was run under the name of Nawal English Boarding School (NEBS) up to 2056 B.S (1999 A.D).

Although generally referred to as a gaol, it was technically a lock-up, holding prisoners only until they were brought before the resident magistrate (after which, if appropriate, they were transferred to Fremantle Prison). Location of the Toodyay Gaol, 1852 - 1861 Construction of the new gaol began on 23 December 1851. A number of ticket-of-leave holders were withdrawn from the road parties to carry out this work. Other masons and mechanics were on hand. The new gaol was built to a standard plan used also at York. The building was of stone with a shingled roof. Due to the lack of a ready source of lime, it was necessary to use clay as a mortar. It was a large building containing twelve solitary cells with floorboards throughout. An extra cell was added for the holding of Aboriginal prisoners. A two roomed warder's quarters and store were attached. A brick paved exercise yard was laid, and the whole complex surrounded by a high brick wall. No provision was made for a courthouse or office and Magistrate Joseph Strelley Harris was forced to use the gaol storeroom as a substitute. The Toodyay Gaol was the largest building in the township and was completed by December 1852. Pensioner Guard John Jones was appointed as its warder on 8 December 1852 and, even though he was lame, he carried out his duties to the best of his ability. However, further alterations were made to counteract the ease with which Aboriginal prisoners were able to escape. Several cells were lined with boards, the yard extended, and the wall heightened to . Iron rings replaced those made of wood. The Toodyay Gaol remained in use until 1861. By this time, the town of Newcastle had been gazetted, and the police had transferred their quarters to the new townsite. As a temporary measure, a three celled lock-up was constructed within the Barracks of the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot situated in Newcastle. For a number of years, the town of Newcastle found itself without an adequate lock-up.

Lee, 274 U.S. 559 (1927), is a significant decision by the United States Supreme Court protecting prohibition laws. The Court held 1) the Coast Guard may seize, board, and search vessels beyond the U.S. territorial waters and the high seas 12 miles outward from the coast if probable cause exists to believe that the vessel and persons in it are violating U.S. revenue laws, and 2) the Coast Guard's use of searchlights to view contents of a vessel on the high seas does not constitute a search and thus does not warrant Fourth Amendment protections. ==Background== On the night of February 16, 1925, a Coast Guard patrol followed a motor boat owned by Lee from the Gloucester, Massachusetts harbor to a region commonly spoken of as Rum Row which was located approximately 24 miles east of Boston Light (a lighthouse located on Little Brewster Island in outer Boston Harbor, Massachusetts). The patrol approached the motor boat and turned on a searchlight upon reaching the boat. With the help of the searchlight, the patrol observed Lee with two associates (McNeil and Vieria)The first names of Lee, McNeil and Vieria are not found in the record and 71 cases of grain alcohol. The three defendants were arrested and transported to Boston where they were indicted for conspiring to violate sections of the Tariff Act of 1922 and National Prohibition Act. The National Prohibition Act was enacted to support enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which established a nationwide prohibition. The Act provided that \\"no person shall manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, or furnish any intoxicating liquor except as authorized by this act.\\" It did not specifically prohibit the use of intoxicating liquors. The act defined intoxicating liquor as any beverage containing more than 0.5% alcohol. The Tariff Act of 1922 prohibits the import of liquor into the United States and authorizes the Coast Guard to seize, board, and search any vessel suspected to U.S revenue laws. U.S. territorial waters are 12 miles outward from any US coast. The motor boat was seized outside of this twelve-mile territory; therefore, Lee and his co-defendants sued for a writ of error claiming the Coast Guard did not have jurisdiction to board their vessel in international waters. The case was brought before the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit which agreed with the defendants and set aside the conviction. The government appeals the Appellate Court's decision to the Supreme Court. ==Decision== The case was heard before the Supreme Court on March 8, 1927. On May 31, 1927, Justice Louis Brandeis delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court. The Court held the Coast Guard has authority to visit, search and seize an American vessel on the high seas beyond the twelve-mile limit when probable cause exists to believe that U.S. laws are being violated; that it has authority also to arrest persons on such vessel when there is reason to believe those persons are engaged in committing a felony. The Court also held that the use of a searchlight does not constitute a search and thus does not warrant Fourth Amendment protections because the use of a searchlight is comparable to the use of binoculars. The courts have long held that binoculars are not prohibited by the Constitution. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1927 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Taft Court Category:United States Supreme Court cases ","title":"United States v.

It opened on 1 October 1855 with 55 children enrolled. Boarders were received on moderate terms. Location of the Toodyay Valley Government School 1855 - 1864 & 1885 - 1898 Other attempts had been made to establish a school in the town of Toodyay. Lot R19 was set aside for school purposes. A Sunday school was established, where Mrs Harper, Mrs Lukin, Mrs Clarkson and her daughter gave instruction. However, none were successful. When the opportunity arose to set up a government school in Toodyay, a meeting was organised to take place at the Royal Oak on 10 June 1853. The meeting was informed that the Government was offering a sum of 250 pounds to any district wishing to build a school house. All plans needed to be submitted for approval. To qualify for the grant, a special committee had to be formed and approved by the General Board of Education. No fewer than three members should serve on the committee, their principal duties being to ensure that the school was run according to the rules drawn up by the General Board of Education. The community was also expected to raise 300 pounds towards funding the school. The Toodyay School Committee subsequently formed, consisted of the resident magistrate Joseph Strelley Harris, Anglican minister Charles Harper, Samuel Phillips and James Drummond Junior. Because the local community was expected to contribute a reasonable amount to its cost, a further committee was formed to organize the necessary fund raising. The Toodyay committee was an active one and very quickly raised the 300 pounds needed for the community's share of expenses. Plans were drawn up and the site chosen. The committee gained approval to build the outer walls of pug. The school building was planned to contain four good-sized rooms at the front, all shaded by a verandah. To the rear were four smaller rooms in the form of a lean-to. Flooring would be weatherboard. The site chosen was lot R45, owned by Alexander Warren, who had generously donated the use of the land to the school. The Board of Education later introduced a rule stipulating that the land on which a school stood could not be sold for other purposes unless and until it had been specifically released. In November 1854, Mrs Drummond laid the foundation stone for the new school. The ceremony took place at one o'clock and nearly 300 people celebrated with a very large afternoon tea. Many sat on the grassy slopes of the Toodyay Gaol as they viewed proceedings. Further fundraising efforts would follow, including a monster tea party and a two day fete to be held on 25 January 1855. Five hundred people were expected to attend. The school was opened on 1 October 1855, once a teacher had been found. Apart from establishing a building, the chief obstacle in running a school had been the inability to procure a fit and proper teacher. Ticket-of-leave men of good repute often filled the role as schoolmasters. The School Committee thought itself fortunate indeed in obtaining the services of Alfred Grey, a schoolmaster who seemed well qualified. He claimed to have the ability to offer his pupils a good English and classical education which included Greek, Latin, geography, arithmetic, geometry, sciences, writing and drawing. However, Grey proved to be an imposter. In 1856 he was dismissed and the school was closed for a short period of time. In February 1857, Joseph Wylde took up the position of schoolmaster at a salary of forty pounds per annum. The stipend paid by the Government varied according to the number of pupils attending each month. His pupils numbered five boys and seven girls. A weekly fee was also paid by the parents of pupils. However, children of the poor or destitute were admitted free of charge. Books were supplied by the local government and sold to the pupils at cost price. Examinations were held regularly.State Records Office of WA, Acc36, CSR Vol. 299, Fol.29-39. School began at nine o'clock, with a lunch break from twelve until one o'clock. The day finished at three-thirty. Two vacations per year were granted, one about 21 June and the other at Christmas. Good Friday, Christmas Day, the Queen's birthday and the anniversary of the foundation of the colony on 1 June were observed as holidays. Fitzgerald Terrace and the gully created by the stream crossing over it, 2015 In July 1857, the Avon River flooded to a level not seen before. Although the school stood well above the badly swollen river, it sustained a good deal of damage caused by the torrents of water gushing down from a series of steep ridges behind, a phenomenon which can still occur to this day. A gully beside the school was severely eroded, causing the school's foundations to be seriously undermined. The north and west walls had cracked and were in a dangerous condition. Although it was suggested that the pupils be moved to one of the unused Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot buildings, the damaged school continued to be used. Two years later, a similar flood occurred and the school continued to remain open. A teacher's salary was often quite meagre and, for the last three and a half years, Wylde had supplemented his income by keeping the accounts for the Queen's Head. When James Everett was denied the renewal of his publican's license in 1861, Wylde's services were no longer required. Soon after, a disagreement arose between them concerning Wylde's book-keeping entries. It led to ill feeling and several court hearings. However, no misdemeanour was proven. The school was forced to close temporarily when Wylde resigned his position as teacher to become the district constable at Newcastle. Early in 1862, Aquila Bull took up the position of schoolmaster at the Toodyay Valley School with twelve pupils in attendance. Half way through 1864, the lessening numbers of children attending the school caused Bull's salary to be reduced to twenty-five pounds. He resigned to take up the position of manager of Drummond‚Äôs flour mill. The loss of its teacher forced the school to close and subsequently be transferred to Newcastle. However, the school at Newcastle also failed to attract enough pupils and in December 1864 it, too, was forced to close. Lot R45 was released for sale after it was agreed that the land was not suitable for a school building due to the risk of flooding. The Toodyay Valley School reopened in July 1885 after a social revival in the old town of Toodyay brought more children to the area.

It was consecrated in 1859, and served as church, priest's residence, and schoolhouse for the Toodyay Valley Catholic School. It later housed the Toodyay Valley government school. ==Background== The census of 1853 revealed a marked increase in the number of people living in Toodyay who were Catholic. Most of the recently arrived Enrolled Pensioner Guards and Irish immigrants were Catholics, as were other ticket-of-leave holders. In 1854, there were 263 Catholics in Toodyay, which amounted to almost thirty percent of its total population. Raffaele Martelli They had neither church nor chaplain, and Bishop Rosendo Salvado made it his business to move among the local people to serve their needs. He began organizing a parish in Toodyay and selected a site for its church. In November 1855, Canon Raphael Martelli was appointed the parish priest of both York and Toodyay. He would celebrate mass in Toodyay, Northam, York and Bindoon. He travelled everywhere on horse-back. The journeys were especially arduous in the cold, wet days of winter. Regular trips to New Norcia were very dear to his heart. For a while, Martelli lived in an unfinished Pensioner Guard cottage next to the new Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot located upstream from the townsite. When, in May 1856, he was asked to vacate, he moved to an old straw hut belonging to young Pensioner Guard, David Gailey. Martelli's stay in the straw hut was relatively short. He was given permission to occupy the old superintendent's office at the new site of the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot. By August he had moved in. The wooden office was in a very poor state, without windows, no lock and its walls riddled with holes. Gusts of icy wind regularly blasted through. But for a blazing fire night and day, Martelli would not have survived the winter, when nightly temperatures hovered around . The raging waters of the Avon River often isolated Martelli from his parishioners at the Toodyay townsite. On 8 June 1857, lots R51, R52 and R53 were registered on behalf of trustees for the Roman Catholic Church for the building of a Catholic school house, a priest's dwelling and a church. The church would stand on the corner of Charles St and River Terrace. On 8 June 1857, lot R67 was also registered on behalf of trustees for the Roman Catholic Church for use as a Catholic cemetery. The Cemetery was gazetted on 18 August 1857. All lots were situated in Charles St, which is now known as Picnic Hill Road. ==Construction and use as church and school== The foundation stone for the Church of Sancta Maria was laid on Sunday 8 March 1857, with a service witnessed with \\"the most heartfelt joy and sincere piety on the part of the faithful who flocked from every part of the district\\". For the parishioners had little means, and most of the building was being achieved through the efforts of voluntary labour. Built of brick, it measured in length and in width. It contained a fireplace. The church building also contained a small schoolroom and modest accommodation for the parish priest. In February 1858, whilst negotiating the shingles for the roof, Martelli was called upon to return to Fremantle. He did not oversee the completion of the building at Toodyay. By the end of 1858, building was complete. In January 1859, Bishop Serra performed the blessing of the Church of Sancta Maria. That year the church opened its doors to the Toodyay Valley Catholic School. Their teacher was Darby Connors, otherwise known as Jeremiah O'Connor. Darby Connors was an Enrolled Pensioner Guard whose records describe him as \\"exceedingly good\\". Aged 41 years, he was married with four children. Connors had begun teaching children in a straw hut at the old Toodyay Pensioner Barracks. In 1855, he was required to take up his Pensioner allotment, lot S11, in Newcastle. In doing so, Connors reluctantly closed his school. He eagerly took up teaching once more when the Toodyay Valley Catholic School opened in 1859. He taught there until 1863. ==Transfer of the Catholic school to Newcastle== The floods of 1862 caused havoc in the district and the town of Toodyay was inundated yet again. By comparison, the newly established town of Newcastle remained comparatively undamaged, apart from the loss of its bridge. Soon, plans were afoot to build a new Catholic church in Newcastle, and in January 1863 the foundation stone was laid for St John the Baptist Church at Newcastle. Later, the Toodyay Valley Catholic School closed to reopen in Newcastle. The Church of Sancta Maria in Old Toodyay continued to serve the community until approximately 1867, after which it appears to have been no longer in use. In early 1872, Martelli was appointed parish priest for the St John the Baptist Church. He served the community well and was greatly loved. In June 1880, he became unwell while at New Norcia, and he died on 3 August 1880. Ruins of the Church of Sancta Maria, ==Toodyay Valley government school== In 1885, the Toodyay Valley government school reopened in the building of the Church of Sancta Maria, after a social revival in the old town of Toodyay brought more children to the area. Elizabeth McKnight and her sister taught there until October 1898. Mary Ann Markey, a widow, made the old vacant church her home until her death, in 1907, at the age of 84 years. Thereafter, the church building fell into disrepair. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in West Toodyay Category:Roman Catholic churches in Western Australia Category:Defunct Catholic schools in Australia ","title":"Church of Sancta Maria, Toodyay"},{"id":"54225490","text":"The International Christian School of Uijeongbu (), or ICSU, is a Christian international school founded in 1983 in Uijeongbu, South Korea.

Formerly a private of the 77th Regiment, he was 23 years of age. Soon after he was stationed at Toodyay, his pension expired and he was dismissed. A request for reinstatement was denied him. For a while, Forbes earned a living as a carter. In November 1857, Forbes was granted ownership of lot R44. The following year, he borrowed 100 pounds from Henry Saw to build a substantial brick house. The house contained four good-sized rooms, one of which he decided to use as the store. He took care to fence and trench the property, the latter being most necessary due to the periodic flooding of the stream close by. The store stood at , adjacent to the Toodyay Valley School and up- river from the Queen's Head hotel. Forbes claimed it to be the best fitted store in the district. Passing trade and the supply of provisions to the school provided some guarantee of steady income. Forbes supplemented this income with his work as a carter. His main competition came from the supplies offered by James Everett at the Queen‚Äôs Head. On 22 November 1858, Forbes married Margaret Kemp, a young Irish girl who had arrived in May of that year. Almost overnight, Forbes was beset by debts accumulated by his new wife. He made it known that, as from 30 December 1858, he would not be answerable for these debts. In his frustration, he attempted to sell the store. However, his efforts failed. On 23 February 1860, Forbes appeared in the Toodyay Police Court before JS Harris, JP, and L Lukin, JP. He was charged with selling spirituous and fermented liquors from an unlicensed store. The offences had occurred on 22 February. Police Constable Sullivan had visited the store four times that day and each time he had been served by Mrs Forbes. He had purchased and paid for one bottle of gin, one bottle of ale, and one bottle of porter. Further evidence was submitted concerning Forbes stocking and selling items of such like. Indeed, John Herbert was reported to have been seen drinking there. However, John Morris, employed by Forbes, gave evidence to the contrary. Nevertheless, Forbes was found guilty as charged and fined a sum of thirty pounds together with court expenses of nineteen shillings and sixpence. During the next few years, Forbes applied for and was granted several nearby allotments. These included Toodyay sub lot 3 which abutted lot R44 and measured . He also obtained locations 390 and 143, much of which stood to the rear of sub lot 3. On 18 August 1868, Forbes sold the store on lot R44, together with the three other properties within its vicinity, to Saw for 250 pounds. Two years later, Forbes purchased lots R24, R25, R27 and R28, which he eventually sold to John Herbert Snr in 1892. Forbes was able to acquire other land in the Avon Valley, which he farmed for a living. == References == Forbes Category:Settlers of Western Australia Category:Pensioner Guards Category:1828 births Category:1906 deaths ","title":"James Forbes (storekeeper)"},{"id":"54225514","text":"Sam Ferguson's cottage was built in the latter part of the 1800s on lot R12 in the original town of Toodyay, now known as West Toodyay, Western Australia. Its walls were whitewashed and its roof was thatched. Roses, almond trees and a flurry of old English flowers produced such a wonderful display that artists from all around flocked to paint it. The cottage was the home of Samuel Ferguson and his wife Ellen. It was situated on what was originally Toodyay town lot R12 on the west corner of River Terrace (now Toodyay West Road) and what is now called Cottage St. On the opposite corner stood the old buildings of John Herbert's Royal Oak inn. Location of Samuel Ferguson's cottage, West Toodyay, built late 19th century Lot R12 was first granted to George Gooch on 15 March 1852. Earlier, he had found work as a shepherd at Mokine, near Northam, before taking up a pastoral lease with his brother John in the Toodyay district. Two sons, George Joseph and Robert John, were born to George and his wife Eleanor York. Gooch was a man who actively took part in the local affairs of Toodyay. He died in 1861 at the age of 41 years. His wife remarried in 1864, after which all properties were sold. The property of lot R12 was then purchased by John Davis, brother of Charlotte Davis. At the time of his marriage to Jane Thorpe in 1853, he was working as a sawyer. After suffering the loss of part of a leg in an accident he became known as \\"Peg Leg\\", the one legged wagoner. His sister, Charlotte Davis, wife of John Herbert, lived across the road at the Royal Oak. After the loss of his publican's license, Herbert also earned his living as a wagoner. Davis was granted lots R6, R7 and R8 in 1867. He later took up farming in the Toodyay district. After their marriage in 21 November 1894, the cottage became the home of Samuel Thomas Ferguson and his wife Ellen, daughter of Thomas and Rose Cook. Ellen was 22 years of age at the time of their marriage. Samuel Ferguson was the son of Alexander James and Sarah Ferguson and the grandson of Thomas and Jane Ferguson, who had arrived in the colony on 1 February 1831. His grandfather established a property in Toodyay, which he named \\"Rose Valley\\". Samuel Thomas Ferguson was born in Toodyay on 30 April 1871. His marriage to Ellen produced eight children. In addition they fostered twelve year old Sybil Donegan, daughter of George and Ada Donegan, after Ada died. Ellen Ferguson died in 1938 after a short illness. She was aged 66 years. Her funeral was held in St Stephen's Anglican Church, Toodyay, followed by interment in the Anglican portion of the Toodyay Cemetery.

Jack laboured throughout rural Victoria, grape picking at Mildura, driving a tractor in Sea Lake, Victoria and even worked as a diver‚Äôs attendant on the Murray River for a few months until the river flooded. He soon was involved in motor racing activities, and in 1932 moved to Sydney, where he worked for a company testing Chrysler cars.[1][33] By 1933 Jack and his brother Ray had a garage and service station ‚ÄòAuto Service Ltd.‚Äô (unconfirmed) or ‚ÄòMurray Bros‚Äô., at the corner of Roscoe and Gould Streets, Bondi, which they ran until the mid-1930s. At this time, they purchased and moved their business, then called ‚ÄòMurray Bros,‚Äô to 94 Curlewis St, Bondi.[32] During World War 2, for about a year spanning 1944 to 1945, Jack was contracted to serve with the US Small Ships, based mostly at Finschhafen, Papua New Guinea, aboard a maintenance ship called The Half Rufus..[30] After the war Jack and Ray continued their business at 94 Curlewis Street, Bondi, (referred to by all and sundry simply as ‚ÄòThe Garage‚Äô) which they operated together from the mid-1930s to late 1971 when Ray Murray retired. There was a major fire which gutted the Garage late on the night of 30 April 1981. Repairs were made and the roof reinstated. Jack continued to own The Garage until his passing in 1983. The Garage was then owned by Jack‚Äôs widow, Ena Murray (b.23/4/1915 d. 24/7/2005), until her passing in 2005. Jack‚Äôs two sons, John and Philip, inherited the Garage jointly from their mother. From May 2017 The Garage was jointly owned by Jack‚Äôs older son John Vivian Murray and John‚Äôs son, i.e. Jack‚Äôs grandson, John Charles Murray (aka Jonny). Three generations of Murray, including two sets of brothers have continuously owned The Garage since the mid-1930s. In 2017/2018 The Garage was leased by 'Carology'. The Garage has been leased as a mechanical workshop for over 40 years.[32] ==Motor sport== Murray set the Hartley Hill (near Mount Victoria, Blue Mountains) hill climbing record in a Terraplane in 1933.[2][31] In 1937 Jack embarked on an around the world trip travelling through Europe and America. He was a spectator at race events in Britain and also the Avus Circuit in Germany where he saw ‚Äòa little guy who was all pomp‚Äô ‚Äì Adolf Hitler. [32][33] Jack raced at many Australian circuits during his career including Gnoo Blas, Orange where he held the lap record, Adelaide‚Äôs Rowley Park, the Sydney Showground, Mount Druitt, Parramatta Park, Nowra, Marsden Park, Castlereagh Airstrip, Southport, Phillip Island and of course, Mount Panorama. In 1952 Jack won the Australian Sprint Championships held at Castlereagh airstrip driving his Cadillac-Allard J2.[32] In the 1964 Senior Trials Championship Jack came second and Dave Johnson, good friend and fellow inductee into the Australian Rally Hall of Fame won best navigator.[32] Crossroads Alice 1965 'Gelignite' Jack enjoyed testing motor vehicles and oils, as well as travel ‚Äî any opportunity or excuse where a group of mates could get together and set off on an adventure of some kind. He and Evan Green frequently paired up to share the fun. During November and December 1965, the duo undertook just such an adventure, one that became the documentary film Crossroads Alice. The trip was designed as a test of BMC (Austin 1800 and a Morris Mini Deluxe) cars and Castrol oil. The vehicles completed a 12,000-mile (19,312 km) Figure 8 crossing of the Australian continent. Over the years 'Gelignite' Jack competed in seven round Australia trials and many adventure trips testing cars, lubricants and drivers. 'Gelignite' Jack Murray competed in both the 1966 and 1967 Southern Cross Rallies driving a Prince Skyline GT with registration plates JM789.[32] (DNF both events). Car versus Plane 1968 As Jack and Evan Green were preparing to compete in the London to Sydney marathon later that year, the question was: ‚ÄòHow could two rally tested veterans best prepare for days and nights of endless driving?‚Äô Clearly, the answer was: ‚ÄòSpend days and nights endlessly driving. But why not make it interesting, and race a plane as well?‚Äô Another adventure lay ahead. At noon on Friday 26 April 1968, Jack and Evan set off from Essendon Airport, Melbourne, to race a Morris 1100 cc ‚ÄòS‚Äô against a light plane around Australia. The boys drove day and night, living in the car, and managed to circumnavigate the continent in eight days and six hours, covering around 10,000 miles (16,000 km). That was an incredible 197 hours and 40 minutes to complete a drive most of us would spend a year undertaking. The details are a testament to both Jack‚Äôs and Evan‚Äôs endurance and ability to spend many hours behind the wheel. The tachograph showed 192 hours 45 minutes, which included 22 hours 15 minutes of breaks (12 per cent of time), covering 9,682 miles (15,581 km) with an average speed of 91 km/h (if taken on actual driving time) or 80 km/h on average overall. Top speed between Norseman and Carnarvon reached 82 mph (132 km/h). The light plane was restricted to flying during the day only. The plane was restricted to eight hours a day as neither pilot was licensed to fly at night. The car crossed the finish line in Melbourne only eight hours after the plane. [32] Car versus Train 1971 Jack and his radio mate John Pearce teamed up again to undertake a Race the Train dash from Sydney to Perth. This nonstop drive took 46 hours, and the boys ended up beating the train by an easy seventeen hours. [32] Mount Panorama events Jack was a competitor at the 1946 NSW Grand Prix in a Bugatti/Ford Special previously owned by Ron Mackellar.[2] [32] He was fastest overall (1 hr 26 mins 24 secs for the 100 miles) and second-fastest (109 mph, 175 km/h) on the ‚Äòflying quarter‚Äô section, but fifth in the (handicapped) race.[3][35] He declined the prize cheque, as he had his eyes set on representing Australia in the wrestling event of the 1948 Olympic Games, and did not want to lose his amateur status.[4] Jack was NSW State Wrestling Champion in his 84 kg division in 1946. Jack asked the chairman of the organising committee to divide the ¬£65 prize money between the Bathurst and Woolloomooloo Police Boys‚Äô Clubs in order to retain his amateur sportsman/wrestler status. [4][32][35] On Monday 7 October 1946, as competitors battled for position in the NSW Grand Prix of 100 miles, Bill Murray braked heavily for what was then termed Pit Corner at the end of Conrod Straigh ‚Äì but his Terraplane crashed into the sandbags. In the darkness of the evening, as the competitors left the circuit, Alf Najar used a piece of charcoal from a campfire to scratch ‚ÄòMurray‚Äôs Corner‚Äô on the Pit Corner timber fence. That‚Äôs the real story of how an iconic Bathurst location got its name. I notice that as the years pass the latest sponsors‚Äô names are more frequently attached to sections of the course. But to the traditionalists, it will always remain Murray‚Äôs Corner, named after Bill, not his good mate Jack. [32] Jack competed in the 1947 Australian Grand Prix in a Bugatti Type 39/Ford 3.6L known as the Day Special, but was forced to retire having completed 29 of 38 laps. [32][35] Jack competed in the 1948 NSW Hundred at Mount Panorama in the ‚ÄòDay Special‚Äô finishing 9th.[5] [7] The Day Special was variously referred to as a ‚ÄòBugatti-Ford‚Äô or ‚ÄòEdelbrock‚Äô, as the 1925 built, Type 39 Bugatti chassis had been subsequently fitted with either an Edelbrock or Grancor Ford V8 engine. [32] He raced the ‚ÄòDay Special‚Äô again in the 1949 All Powers Long Handicap but did not finish. The Day Special frequently overheated. But Jack fared better in the 1950 New South Wales 100, when he placed fourth, with a flying quarter mile speed of 119.2 mph(192 km/h), the Day Special now equipped with a Grancor V8 engine. [32][35] In March 1951 Jack competed in the REDEX Bathurst 100 in an Allard J2/Cadillac 4.4L. He also drove an Allard J2 in the REDEX 50 Mile Championship in October 1951, but was forced to retire in both of these events.[8][32][35] He drove the Allard/Cadillac in the 1952 Australian Grand Prix, and came fourth, and the Bugatti/Ford Day Special in the 1954 Bathurst 100, when he came seventh.[32][35] The 1967 Gallaher 500 was held at Bathurst Mount Panorama on 1 October 1967. Although he probably didn't realise it at the time, this would prove to be a poignant Bathurst meet for Jack ‚Äì his last race on the Mount Panorama circuit. The year 1967 marked a 21-year career span for Jack racing at Bathurst. He had raced the Mackellar Special, the Day Special, two Cadillac-Allards, a D-Type Jaguar and sedans such as a Ford Pilot, Ford Cortina GT, Morris Elite and Prince Skyline GT. Jack is credited with having the fastest 100-mile race time over the Mount Panorama circuit for 1946. [35] In 1950 Jack won an event recording the fastest lap time, reaching 119 mph (192 km/h) down Conrod Straight. In 1952, driving the Cadillac-Allard J2, Jack placed a credible fourth in the seventeenth Australian Grand Prix. Throughout his 21 years of driving at Bathurst, Jack achieved many scratch, handicap or class placings: first (1), second (2), third (7), fourth (6), fifth (4), sixth (1), seventh (1), ninth (1), thirteenth (1), fifteenth (1) and thirty-fourth (1). Of course, race cars being race cars, there were a few DNFs and DNSs. In 1960, in his D-Type Jaguar, he was clocked at 150 mph (240 km/h) down Conrod Straight. In 1965, almost 20 years after first racing at Bathurst, the ‚Äòold men in wheelchairs‚Äô Jack (58) and Bill McLachlan (48) placed fifth overall and third in class driving a Ford Cortina Mk 1 GT 500. The younger brigade took note. [32] The REDEX Reliability Trials There were three major REDEX Reliability car trials held in successive years: 1953, 1954 and 1955. It is a little-known fact that there was also a series of much shorter REDEX 1000 trials held in the months preceding the long distance REDEX events. In both 1953 and 1954, Jack had class wins in these events ‚Äì a portent of things to come. In 1954 there were also REDEX motorcycle and REDEX plane events. REDEX was a motor vehicle oil additive and Reg Shepheard, an Englishman who came to Australia, owned the selling agent rights. Car clubs and motoring magazines had proffered the idea of a round Australia car trial since before the war, but it was Shepheard‚Äôs offer of sponsorship and his endeavours to promote and advertise REDEX that enabled the trials to become a reality. These events were not races as such, nor were they 'rallies'. Rallies are timed to the second, not minute, and are more often conducted on closed roads, rather than open public roads. The winner of a rally is the fastest car from A to B. The REDEX events were termed ‚Äòreliability trials‚Äô. Very strict rules ensured that vehicles available to the general public were used, with few modifications, and replacement of parts was strictly limited. Along the way, competitors were required to meet and comply with set times established between control points. Being more than five minutes early or late on their scheduled time of arrival at fixed controls attracted a one-point penalty for each minute discrepancy. A margin of three minutes late or early per hour was allowed for secret controls to allow for possible speedometer error, and discrepancies between officials' and competitors' watches. It was a nervous navigator's worst nightmare. The competitors who completed the trials with the lowest number of accumulated penalty points were declared the winners. Elimination sections, used to separate and test both competitors and cars, were a feature of the REDEX trials. Seemingly unrealistic and unobtainable times were often set between control points on these difficult sections. [32] 1953 REDEX 1,000 Mile Trial This 24-hour event was staged over 2 and 3 May, starting and ending in Sydney and ran through the Blue Mountains and the back roads behind the Jenolan Caves. It had been made the ‚Äòhardest ever‚Äô by torrential rain; Murray won his Class A (395 pts lost) and came second overall to D.H. (Peter) Antill (305 pts lost), one of only nine to complete the course.[9] During this trial, at one stage Jack became lost. Australian Motor Sports, June 1953 wrote: ‚ÄòStill no track, and then salvation. A swagman was strolling down the road towards them. Firing a few questions at him and then sweeping him into the back of the Customline, Murray slid the car into the bush at the pointed out place and commenced a fearful dice down to the control. Their at-first willing passenger became petrified in the rear. As the car slithered to a halt at the control the swagman was out like a flash and into the scrub.‚Äô [32] Only in Australia, and certainly only back in the 1950s, would a swagman ever come to the navigational rescue of a competition trial car. [32] 1953 REDEX Reliability Trial Jack Murray and Bill Murray (no relation) failed to finish, their Chrysler Plymouth having rolled between Cloncurry and Mount Isa.[10] When interviewed by a news team shortly after the crash, every second word of Jack Murray's response had to be expurgated, a source of delight to many.[11] The rollover in 1953 gave rise to one of the most frequently told anecdotes about 'Gelignite' Jack Murray. It became Evan Green's favourite story about his larrikin mate. Evan even opened his book Journeys with Gelignite Jack (first published in 1966 by Rigby) with the story: > As another concerned competitor slowed to a stop next to the overturned > wrecked Plymouth in ‚Äô53, the ever-present dust cloud drifted on by. A voice > yelled out: :\\"What happened? You all right?\\" :\\"Got a ring spanner?\\" Jack > called back. \\"Nine-sixteenths SAE?\\" Thinking ... followed by the puzzled > query: \\"A ring spanner. What the hell do you want that for?\\" :\\"I thought I'd > do the brakes while the wheels were up like this.\\" Silence ... then everyone > started to laugh, even the poor \\"No Relation\\" Bill: bleeding, concussed and > nursing a very sore head. [34] It was Jack's signature cheekiness and that typically Australian attitude when faced with adversity that endeared him to so many people. 1954 REDEX 1,000 Mile Trial Murray won this little-noticed 24-hour event losing only 5 points, run entirely within New South Wales,[12] followed by another, sponsored by Kriesler,[13] an Australian manufacturer of car radios and other consumer electronics. 1954 REDEX Reliability Trial Murray and his navigator, the unrelated Bill Murray won this Trial in a 1948, Canadian built, Ford V8 with registration plates JM456, losing no points on the trip. The car was dubbed the ‚ÄòGrey Ghost‚Äô by famous cricketer ‚ÄòGinty‚Äô Lush because of its grey ‚Äòundercoat‚Äô colour. Newspapers and magazine articles often erroneously describe the big Ford V8 as an ‚Äòex-taxi‚Äô. This is not the case. Jack bought the black vehicle second hand and repainted it grey.[32] It was on this trial that Murray gained his nickname, from his occasional celebratory detonation of sticks of gelignite.[14] \\"They christened me 'Gelignite Jack' after the big bang in the tin outhouse at Townsville Showground\\", he is quoted as saying.[15] \\"Gelignite wouldn't hurt a flea out in the open. It's just the same as a cracker, only louder.\\"[1] Bill Murray, navigator and co-driver, was a construction and explosives expert. The two Murrays took boxes of gelignite on the trial with the intention of clearing any fallen trees or other obstacles blocking the narrow outback roads. It was never used or required for this intended purpose. The gelignite became Jack's toy. Despite his 'larrikin' image, Murray was a total professional when it counted, a non-smoker, teetotaler with a powerful, athletic build who never took foolhardy risks. The Murrays, who lost no points on the entire route, were popular winners, and mobbed at the finish line.[16] 1955 REDEX Reliability Trial 'Gelignite' Jack Murray described the 1955 REDEX Trial as a \\"shemozzle\\". The exact details of what took place are contentious. As the trial neared completion, an originally unplanned diversion adjoining Werong Station (near Murrumbateman, Wee Jasper and 12 km south of Yass), designed to determine the winner, meant that some cars and their drivers were bogged for ten hours or more. Jack did not go through the bog section as he summed it up when he saw the first car bogged. So, he turned around and went through a route check the wrong way and thought he would have copped a penalty, but the bog section was eventually cancelled. Jack, with his brother Ray as navigator, was running third at that stage, with the loss of only 36 points. [32] In protest at the issuing of extra instructions in Melbourne, that took cars through the boggy, impassable paddock, Jack did not submit his car for scrutineering ‚Äòwithin the requisite time, and thus Car 46 could not be considered among those competitors who fulfilled all requirements in that direction and therefore cannot be regarded as having finished the Trial.‚Äô He was disqualified. Jack had accumulated 56 road points by the end, thus forfeiting a possible fourth place. Car No 129 (B. Rogers in a Holden) and Car No 36 (N. Klinger in a Standard Vanguard), also protested the officials‚Äô decision to run the field through a mud bog by refusing to submit their cars for scrutiny. As confirmed by Hal Moloney, Australian Trial and Rally Historian: 'Jacks point loss at the Canberra Control was 56 points which had him in 5th place. No cars were penalised for the Werong Station bog. Had Jack checked in at Sydney where Sam Hecker's Holden, originally equal third with Malcolm Brooks Vanguard, was penalised for structural damage at scrutineering, Jack would have ended up 4th outright on 56 points lost except - for the not booking-in/scrutineering fiasco.' Throughout the trial, particularly towards the end and even post-trial, controversy and arguments reigned. Newspaper headlines were full of emotion as they proclaimed REDEX Boilover and Hopeless Mixup. [32] Murray did not attend the Ball, at which the winners should have been announced but were not, due to unresolved protests.[18] It was indeed, a shemozzle. There was no 1956 Redex Trial. 1956 Ampol Trial Murray and his brother Ray Murray were put out of contention when one of the ‚ÄòGrey Ghost‚Äôs‚Äô stub axles and its king pin broke, but he was able to get back on the road with a loss of only 70 points thanks to fellow-competitor Robert Whan, who allowed Murray to cannibalize his own car, which had crashed into a tree.[19] He lost 69 further points when he took a wrong turn after Mt Isa, and ended up at the Mary Kathleen uranium fields.[20] Jack denied he‚Äôd got lost. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got shares in that company,‚Äô he said, ‚ÄòI just wanted to see how it was getting on.‚Äô [32] 1957 Ampol Trial Murray and Neville Vale were forced to pull out shortly after leaving Birdsville when their Fiat 1100 (‚ÄòLittle Ghost‚Äô) broke an axle.[21] Jack walked back into town and when questioned replied that he was ‚Äòtesting some new type of shoes‚Äô. Note: Not to be confused with another competitor John Mornder Murray of Ashgrove, Queensland, who with his daughter Kerry was also in a Fiat.[22] Confederation of Australian Motor Sport Dispute In the mid-1950s a battle for control and administration of motorsport was raging within Australia, and the drivers were caught in the middle. The Sydney-based Trials Clubs of NSW broke away from the Melbourne-based CAMS following a dispute about the allocation of rights to a Round Australia Trial for 1956. The dispute centred around sponsorship by either Ampol or Mobilgas and a power struggle between CAMS and NSW clubs. It affected drivers throughout 1956 and 1957. Thirty drivers, including 'Gelignite' Jack Murray were banned for competing in events which were not CAMS sanctioned. Jack was banned for 2 years. Wheels, the Sport, April 1956, wrote: ‚ÄòWe believe that those who drove in spite of CAMS‚Äô warning in the 1955 Mobilgas Economy Run were harshly treated and that this has been the main cause of the unsightly squabble between the majority of NSW clubs and CAMS.‚Äô Once again, conflict, disagreement and protest were, unfortunately, an integral part of motorsport. 1957 Mobilgas Trial 'Gelignite' Jack Murray never competed in any Mobilgas Trials due to the CAMS dispute, but did enter the 1955 Mobilgas Economy Run together with Bill McLachlan driving a Ford Consul. The boys came last! Clearly, saving fuel and economy driving were neither Bill's nor Jack's fort√©. However, in the 1957 Mobilgas Trial another Jack Murray drove a Chrysler Royal[23] There is often confusion between 'Gelignite' Jack Murray and 'Milko' Jack Murray. The two Jacks were contemporaries, both racing and rally drivers and sometimes even competed in the same events, hence the confusion. The private real estate development \\"Murray's Rise\\" near Branxton, Belford and Pokolbin was named after 'Milko' Jack Murray. 1958 Ampol Trial Once again CAMS was licensing Ampol events. Calmer heads had prevailed and peace had broken out. With 148 starters, the 7,000-mile event focused on eastern Australia. Australian Motor Sports, July 1958, wrote: Jack Murray was only six points down, but during the next day's stage to Adelaide a misread signpost took him 30 miles off course along a bush track, and the howling rainstorm mingled with his tears at Burra, where he shed a whole 75 points. At Port Augusta he was seen chasing navigator Dave Johnson with an axe. Jack's great mate and fellow Rally Hall of Fame inductee Dave Johnson, fortunately, was too quick for an axe-wielding Jack back in 1958. Armstrong 500 Murray drove a Simca Aronde in the 1960 Armstrong 500 held at Phillip Island (DNF), a Morris Major Elite in the 1963 Armstrong 500 held at Mount Panorama (15th), and a Ford Cortina Mk.I GT500 in the 1965 Armstrong 500 (3rd in Class D and 5th overall). Gallaher 500 Murray drove a Prince Skyline 1500 in the 1966 Gallaher 500 (DNF) and the 1967 Gallaher 500 (13th in Class, 34th overall) production car races. The Armstrong 500 and Gallaher 500 races preceded the series of Hardie-Ferodo 1000 races held at Bathurst, which in 2018 are referred to as the Bathurst 1000 or simply the Great Race. The Mount Panorama circuit is an Australian motorsport icon. 1964 Ampol Trial: 'Gelignite' and 'Cracker' Jacks The 1964 Ampol Round Australia Trial, covering 7500 miles, attracted 200 entrants. It commenced on 14 June 1964 and ran for two weeks. This was an important trial for a number of reasons, not least of which was that 56-year-old 'Gelignite' Jack Murray would face some very special competition ‚Äì namely his twenty-year-old son John, under the moniker ‚ÄòCracker Jack‚Äô. John had ‚ÄòJack Murray Jnr‚Äô written on the side of his car, and his mate Peter Barnes was the navigator. The results were interesting, to say the least. ‚ÄòCracker‚Äô Jack Murray, driving a lime- green Valiant sponsored by Milo lost 262 points and placed thirty-third. 'Gelignite' Jack in Car No 54C with Roy Denny as navigator placed fortieth in a Peugeot 404 Plate HYT 276, with the loss of 333 pts. The junior apprentice had ‚Äòdone‚Äô the senior master! The engines were hardly cool before the boys at The Garage called their sign-writer mate to record on The Garage walls the momentous win by 'Cracker' Jack. [32] 1968 London to Sydney Marathon 'Gelignite' Jack took part in this event with Evan Green and George Shepheard as the BMC works team in an Austin 1800,[15] arriving in 21st place. As they raced across the Nullarbor and into South Australia, Murray's and Green's Car No 31 was the race leader in the Flinders Ranges stage. Then tragedy struck, as they ran fifth, only 36 hours from the finish line. An enthusiastic service mechanic over-tightened a wheel bearing, and the hub collapsed near Curnamona, South Australia. Evan commented at the time, \\"But for losing a wheel, Jack Murray, George Shepheard [veteran Australian driver] and I might have won.\\" [32] Another J. Murray (Jack 'Milko' Murray) and Bert Madden came 54th in an HK Holden Monaro, sponsored by Maitland Motors.[24] 1970 World Cup Rally Jack participated in this event, which ran from London to Mexico City,[1] but did not finish. Jack and Evan Green, as drivers, teamed up with Hamish Cardno (Motor Magazine) as navigator in the London to Mexico Marathon. Car No 92 was a British Leyland works entry Triumph Mk.2 2.5PI. Right from the start a blockage problem with the fuel injection system emerged. This recurring problem was later attributed to a valve guide disintegrating and shedding crumbs of metal. A crash in France in which the Triumph was driven over a cliff and hit some trees did not help matters. With Cardno driving, the Triumph left the road, rolling and spinning down a hill near Rouaine in the French Alps. Fortunately, no one was injured. The car was pulled out, hammered into shape and the boys drove on. (The Courier-Mail, April 1970) It took the Andes, however, to finally put Car No 92, out of the rally. The Triumph did not arrive at the Santiago checkpoint within the time limit and was eliminated. 1977 London to Sydney Marathon Jack took part in this event in a Peugeot 504TI, Car No 68, with other Australians Bruce Mudd and Geoff Perry but did not finish. Evan Green competed separately, in Car No 39 sponsored by Endrust Australia Ltd, and drove a Range Rover. While showing initial promise, Car No 68 was plagued by bad luck that culminated in a crash involving a tractor and other mayhem near Agra, India. 1979 Repco Trial This was to be 'Gelignite' Jack Murray's last competitive motorsport event, held in August 1979. Jack, his elder son John with mate Jeff d‚ÄôAlbora competed in a Dick Smith sponsored Holden Commodore No.28, with number plates JM456 as used on the old 'Grey Ghost', finished 23rd or 29th, depending on your source. ==Family== John Eric Murray married Ena May Byrne on 3 July 1942 at the (Anglican) Church of St Jude, Randwick;[1] Jack purchased a block of three home units and the family home was at 3/24 Derby Street, Vaucluse. Jack and Ena had two sons; John Vivian Murray (b. 1943) and Philip Eric Murray (b. 1954). [32] Jack and Ena Murray remained married until Jack's death in 1983. However, in 1958, 'Gelignite' Jack Murray met Dorothy Rosewell (born 1931), real estate agent, business woman and fellow competitor in the Ampol Trial of that year. They fell in love. Their relationship blossomed, grew and also endured until Jack's death. It was a love that spanned 25 years. In many ways Murray led dual lives and crammed the experiences, travel, sports and sheer zest for life of at least two men into his 76 years. [32] In early December 1980 Jack was hospitalised with blood circulation problems, and had his right leg amputated above the knee.[15 'Just as well I can ski on one foot!' was Jack's first comment. 'Gelignite' Jack Murray was admitted to St Vincent's Hospital in October 1983 with a cardiovascular disease and died ten weeks later on 11 December 1983.[15] ==Other interests== 'Gelignite' Jack's sporting interests and achievements were eclectic and far ranging. In his own words, at different times throughout his life he was 'engaged in various sports with various successes': cycling; VFL schoolboy football; stock car racing; hill climbing motor races; circuit car racing; car endurance events; Australian and NSW Grand Prix racing; international and Australian rally driving; wrestling; boxing; crocodile, kangaroo and buffalo hunting; ocean boat racing and waterskiing ‚Äì to name most, but not all. Jack even raced a bathtub once, plug in. As a young man, Murray was a champion amateur wrestler[26] and was a member of the North Bondi Surf Lifesaving Club. [32] During an amateur wrestling career spanning seventeen years (1930‚Äë46), Jack won no fewer than thirteen NSW State Championships: 74 kg: 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933 and 1934; JE Murray was NSW State Champion five times. 84 kg: 1930, 1931, 1935, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1945 and 1946; JE Murray was NSW State Champion eight times. [32] In both 1930 and 1931, Jack not only won the lower weight division but also competed in and won the next higher weight division, defeating considerably larger opponents. If he had not lost two crucial matches to his close friend, Jack ‚ÄòSpud‚Äô O‚ÄôHara, Jack would have represented Australia at both the1934 London Empire Games and at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. [32] In 1964, 'Gelignite' Jack Murray and Keith Whitehead won the inaugural Sydney‚ÄëNewcastle‚ÄëSydney Ocean Race, in a Bertram boat called Tact. [32] Murray was an expert waterskier. Jack was not the first person to waterski in Australia. However, due to his pioneering involvement, including securing sponsorship for the initial Bridge to Bridge ski race, and his extensive promotion and participation in the sport, he is often referred to as the ‚Äòfather of waterskiing‚Äô in Australia. Jack was a life member of the NSW Water Ski Association and holds the distinction of being one of a group of seven who first barefooted in Australia.[32][33] 'Gelignite' Jack Murray together with Canadian born scientist Professor Harry Messel taught Wernher Von Braun, former Nazi SS Officer and \\"father of the American space program\\" to waterski on the Hawkesbury River. [32] 'Gelignite' Jack's favourite ski locations were originally Jervis Bay, then subsequently the Hawkesbury River, near Sydney and Shoal Bay, Port Stephens. ==Recognition== *He was the subject of a book Journeys with Gelignite Jack, Rigby Limited, first published 1966, by his lifelong friend, eminent motor racer and motoring journalist Evan Green about an outback journey they undertook for the Castrol company.[28] A new edition, Hit the Road, Jack, was published in 1991 by Pan Macmillan *On 3 March 1978, the Guest of Honour on the popular TV show This Is Your Life was 'Gelignite' Jack Murray. The show was hosted by Roger Climpson and shown on the Channel 7 network. *In April 1984 a monument bearing his name was erected at Shoal Bay, New South Wales, where he holidayed regularly.[11][32] *Jack featured as a major character in Dust and Glory, a 1990 novel by Evan Green. The action of the novel takes place in the fictitious 1956 REDEX Trial (the last REDEX Reliability Trial was in 1955) and several real-life characters appear apart from Murray, notably the radio star Jack Davey, who in the book wants to be taken seriously as a rally driver not for his celebrity value.[29] *In 2013 'Gelignite' Jack Murray was inducted into the Australian Rally Hall of Fame. [32] *In March 2016 'Gelignite' Jack Murray was an inaugural inductee into the Australian Motor Sport Hall of Fame. (Confederation of Australian Motorsports, CAMS). The CAMS Hall of Fame incorporates all facets of the sport. A gala dinner was held in Melbourne prior to the 2016 Australian Grand Prix. The induction was accepted on Jack's behalf jointly by younger son Phil and Jack's grandson, Jonny Murray who enjoyed a successful rally career, most notably with Subaru. 'Gelignite' Jack Murray, son John Vivian Murray and grandson John Charles \\"Jonny\\" Murray (born 1981) ‚Äì the motorsport rally gene was shared by three generations of Murrays. *In 2017, Peter Carey's novel A Long Way from Home tells the tale of a REDEX Trial, mentions 'Gelignite' Jack and features a character called 'Dangerous Dan' who has 'Gelignite' Jack's penchant for explosives. ==Biography== Foreword by Dick Smith. ==References== 1\\\\. 2\\\\.

Hecht is a research scientist, the associate director for research management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Haystack Observatory, and the deputy project director for the Event Horizon Telescope. He served as the lead scientist for the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer instrument on the Phoenix Mars lander, and as the principal investigator for the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE) instrument on the Mars 2020 rover. Hecht obtained an AB in Physics from Princeton University, an MS from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1982. Hecht joined the staff of California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1982, where he researched microelectromechanical systems, surface and interface science, scientific instrument development, and planetary science. He co-invented the Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy system and published several highly- cited papers on metal-semiconductor interfaces, for which he received the newly renamed Lew Allen Award for Excellence in 1990. At JPL, as the supervisor of the Microdevices Laboratory's In-Situ Exploration Technology Group, he developed the concept for the Deep Space 2 micro-landers, which flew to Mars in 1999. He was later named the project manager, co-investigator, and project scientist for the Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) instrument for the cancelled Mars Surveyor 2001 mission. The MECA instrument was later flown as the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer on the Phoenix mission to Mars in 2007, with Hecht as lead scientist and co- investigator, and was instrumental in the discovery of perchlorate in martian soil. Based on that work, Hecht published highly-cited papers on the chemistry of martian soil and the existence of water on Mars. After almost 30 years at JPL, Hecht began working for MIT's Haystack Observatory. In 2014, the MOXIE instrument, for which Hecht is the principal investigator, was selcted as one of the instruments on the Perseverance rover for the Mars 2020 mission.

The logs used to be transported out of Yilan through the Lanyang River. In 1921, the agency purchased a Taiwan Sugar Railway from Taiwan Sugar Factory and used it as Luodong Forest Railway to transport the timbers. In 1982, the government adjusted its policies on forestry industry and the production from the area started to decline. In 1994‚Äì2001, the Third Luodong Town Urban Planning Review designated the area to be a special forestry industry culture site. In 2004, the Forestry Bureau unveiled a plan to turn the area into a culture park.

It has been founded during the 12th century and currently has around 3,500 followers, comprising around 95% of the Armenians in Cyprus. The diocese is under the jurisdiction of the Holy See of Cilicia of the Armenian Church. The seat of the diocese is the Holy Mother of God Cathedral of Nicosia. The prelacy building is situated near the cathedral, on 47 Armenia Avenue, Strovolos, Nicosia.Holy See of Cilicia PrelaciesArchbishop Khoren Doghramadjian is currently the primate vicar of the diocese, serving since March 2017.Mahdessian and Doghramadjian visit SyllourisHis Holiness Aram I appoints Archbishop Khoren Toghramadjian Pontifical Vicar of Cyprus ==History== The building of the Armenian Prelature of Cyprus in Strovolos, Nicosia The Armenian Diocese of Cyprus was established in 973 by Catholicos Khatchig I and ever since it has maintained a continuous presence on the island. In the years that followed, some of its Prelates participated in important church synods, such as Tateos (who participated in the Council of Hromkla in 1179), Nigoghaos (who participated in the Synod of Sis in 1307) and Krikor (who participated in a conference of Greek Orthodox Bishops in Cyprus in 1340). The antiquity of the Armenian Church in Cyprus was confirmed by a bull of Pope Leo X, which was issued in 1519 after multiple discords, according to which the Armenian Prelate would be senior to and take precedence over the Maronite, Jacobite and Coptic Prelates.Armenian Diocese of Cyprus Historically, the Prelature has been under the jurisdiction of the Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia, while today it is the oldest theme that falls under its jurisdiction. In the past, for various reasons, it was at times under the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem (1775‚Äì1799, 1812‚Äì1837, 1848‚Äì1861, 1865‚Äì1877, 1888‚Äì1897, 1898‚Äì1908), the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople (1799‚Äì1812, 1861‚Äì1864, 1877‚Äì1888, 1897‚Äì1898, 1908‚Äì1921), even the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin (1864‚Äì1865). Cyprus was the place of refuge for two exile Patriarchs of Constantinople, Archbishop Tavit Areveltsi (1644-1648) and Senior Archimandrite Krikor Basmadjian (1773-1775). The current Prelate, a Catholicosal Vicar General, is as of 2014 Archbishop Nareg Alemezian. The parish priest in Nicosia is Fr. Momik Habeshian (since 2000), while the parish priest in Larnaca and Limassol is Fr. Mashdots Ashkarian (since 1992). For centuries, the Prelature building was located within the Armenian compound in Victoria street in walled Nicosia; when that area was taken over by Turkish-Cypriot extremists in 1963‚Äì1964, the Prelature was temporarily housed in Aram Ouzounian street (1964‚Äì1968) and, later on, in Kyriakos Matsis street in Ayios Dhometios (1968‚Äì1984). Thanks to the efforts of Bishop Zareh Aznavorian and with financial aid from the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, the new Prelature building was erected in 1983, next to the Virgin Mary church and the Nareg school in Nicosia, by architects Athos Dikaios & Alkis Dikaios; it was officially inaugurated on 4 March 1984, during the pastoral visit of Catholicos Karekin II. By initiative of Archbishop Varoujan Hergelian, in 1998 the basement of the building was renovated and the ‚ÄúVahram Utidjian‚Äù Hall was formed; previously a store room, it became a reality from the proceeds of the auction in 1994 of the art collection that Vahram Utidjian had donated to the Prelature in 1954. It was inaugurated on 3 February 1999 by Catholicos Aram I; numerous charity, communal and cultural events take place there. The Prelature‚Äôs consistory houses a collection of ecclesiastical relics, some of which were previously in the old Virgin Mary church or the Magaravank. The Armenian Ethnarchy of Cyprus with Catholicos Aram I (2008) The current Charter of the Prelature, first drafted in 1945 and ratified in 1950, consists of 102 articles and, in its present form, applies as of 3 September 2010. The administration is exercised by the Armenian Ethnarchy (‘±’¶’£’°’µ’´’∂ ‘ª’∑’≠’°’∂’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂) through the Diocesan Council [‘π’•’¥’°’Ø’°’∂ ‘∫’∏’≤’∏’æ (Temagan Joghov), consisting of the Prelate, two priests and twelve elected lay persons - 7 for Nicosia, 3 for Larnaca, 1 for Limassol and 1 for Famagusta] and the Administrative Council [’é’°÷Ä’π’°’Ø’°’∂ ‘∫’∏’≤’∏’æ (Varchagan Joghov), presided by the Prelate and consisting of seven lay persons appointed by the Temagan], currently chaired by Sebouh Tavitian (as of 2007) and John Guevherian (as of 2011), respectively.

The original title is Ricette veterinarie e georgiche / raccolte per bene dei proprietari delle terre, e dei contadini dal proposto Lastri autore dei dodici calendarj, ossia Corso completo di agricoltura pratica. == Summary == The work, as introduced by the title, is a collection of recipes for animals and agriculture products. It is organized in two parts, each of which contains twenty-five recipes. In both volumes the topics treated are mixed but only eight of all the recipes deal with animals and veterinary medicine; as of the agricultural ones, which are forty-two, the most important and relevant topic is the wine and the methods for its conservation. Despite this thematic division, the two themes are integrated with each other and together they represent advices and remedies that concern the whole country life.  Georgic recipes  These kind of recipes represent the heart to the work by Lastri in both volumes. The first of all, Per purgare una Stalla dove siano state Bestie attaccate da mal contagioso, o altri luoghi infetti (To clean a stall where has been beasts attacked by infectious disease, or other infected places), deals with treatments that need to be applied in order to purify the air after hosting infected animals. The ones that deals with wine are ten and there are other four recipes that talks about vinegar and the preservation of the barrels. According to this, two relevant recipes are Della Riponitura delle viti in luogo delle vecchie (The repositioning of the Screws in place of the old ones) and Per fare un vino simile pressoppoco a quello delle Canarie (To make a similar wine pressurized to that of the Canaries): the first one concerns the rotation of crops, so the advice, whenever is possible, is to change the placing of the vines if they are in fields already used for the same crop or different crops because this is the reason of their short life; in the second one, instead, is inserted a feature present in many recipes: doing something in a similar way as it is done in another country/city. Another topic is the one about the preparation and cultivation of figs, truffles, strawberries, fennel, hams but also recipes for mustards and disinfection from ants.  Veterinary recipes  These recipes are a small number. One of them is the first recipe of the whole work and another one is the last. The first volume begins with Per la guarigione delle ferite cagionate ai Montoni dalle Spine (For the healing of the wounds caused by the Spine Plugs): as you can understand from the title, the case treated is very specific regarding the subject to take care of but also the contest, as in every veterinary recipes. The particularity of this case is that the author presents two different methods to cure the same disease: it's the only case in both volume. The last recipes of all is Contro il morso delle vipere, e dei rettili che mordono le pecore nelle mammelle (Against the bite of the vipers, and the reptiles that bite the sheep in the breasts): this one is very basic and it explains how to prepare a curative unguent with vinegar, Armenian boletus, scorpion oil and leaves. In the first part we can find also Per avere pollastre molto grasse e con poca spesa (To have very low fat and little expense): this one, unlike the others, is not about a curative methods but it explains how to reach a very wanted result in that epoch; so it has a positive valence. == Editions == * Lastri, M., 1793.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has green and white flowers with darker green or brown markings and a dorsal sepal with a long thread-like tip. ==Description== Pterostylis laxa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of 12 to 25 bright green, egg-shaped leaves lying flat on the ground, each leaf long and wide. Flowering plants have a single flower long and wide which leans slightly forwards on a flowering stem high with between three and five stem leaves. The flowers are green and white with darker green or brown markings. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal has a thread-like tip long. The lateral sepals are erect or backswept, held closely against the galea, have thread-like tips long and a flat sinus with a central notch between their bases. The labellum is long, wide, dark-coloured, curved, pointed and visible above the sinus. Flowering occurs from January to April. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis laxa was first formally described in 1968 by John Blackmore from a specimen collected in the Upper Grose Valley. The description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (laxa) is a Latin word meaning \\"loose\\" or \\"slack\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The antelope greenhood grows among grasses on slopes in forest in north-eastern Victoria and in eastern New South Wales as far north as the Northern Tablelands. ==References== laxa Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of the Australian Capital Territory Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1968 ","title":"Pterostylis laxa"},{"id":"54226069","text":"Cairneyella is a genus of at least two ericoid mycorrhizal and root-associated fungi that is, to date, endemic to Australian plants, mostly from the family Ericaceae.

It includes a variety of crimes committed by more than 100 of the world's most notorious criminals. From Jack the Ripper to Jeffrey Dahmer, the book is a study of international true-crime history that covers shocking stories through infographics and research that lays out key facts and details. It examines the science, psychology and sociology of criminal behavior. It profiles of villains, victims and detectives. Each clue is listed for readers to follow investigations from start to finish, and studies the police and detective work for each case. In a Q&A; article for CrimeCon.com's blog with Scott, the author described the crimes detailed in the book as \\"run[ning] the gamut‚Äîfrom nonviolent cons to gangland-style criminals, to white-collar offenders‚Äîwith a complete representation starting with the first known homicide committed against a Neanderthal man.\\" ==Critical reception== Rolling Stone magazine's description, in an August 2017 interview with co-author Scott about the book, wrote that it is \\"an encyclopedic treatment of the topic (that) makes for excellent companion reading. A compelling compilation of human trickery and awfulness, it covers crimes from arson, art forgery and kidnapping to bank robbery, drug trafficking and, of course, murder, with many of the entries accompanied by helpful illustrations.\\" Reader's Digest listed it as one of its \\"Best New Books You Should Read This April,\\" describing it as \\"everything you ever wanted to know about some of the most audacious, hideous, hilarious and mysterious acts of crime in one explosive book, filled with graphs, illustrations, quotes and timelines. This highly addictive encyclopedia of crime ... is a trivia goldmine and a helpful guide allowing you to put events into context.\\" Culture Magazine in Germany wrote that the book \\"is lushly illustrated, readable and entertaining.\\" In September 2019, Flagler County, Florida sheriff's deputies discovered a copy of the book in the car of a couple arrested on attempted theft charges, noting that the book did not help the suspects carry out the crime. == References  External links == * Publisher's The Crime Book page Category:Dorling Kindersley books Category:2017 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:British non-fiction books Category:English non-fiction books Category:Non-fiction books about criminals Category:Books by Cathy Scott Category:Crime reference works ","title":"The Crime Book"},{"id":"54226168","text":"Mohammad Naeimipour () is an Iranian engineer and reformist politician who served a member of the Parliament of Iran from 2000 to 2004 representing Tehran, Rey, Shemiranat and Eslamshahr.

He worked for United Kingdom Customs until he emigrated to New South Wales, where he was appointed Comptroller of Customs for the colony. In NSW, he also became Superintendent of Distilleries. He was appointed Colonial Treasurer and Collector of Customs on 5 January 1840 for New Zealand, and later that month moved to the Bay of Islands in the north of New Zealand, arriving aboard with William Hobson and other officials (including Willoughby Shortland and Felton Mathew). His annual salary was ¬£600, the same as it was in Sydney. He was a witness and signatory to the Treaty of Waitangi. When the General Legislative Council was formed in May 1841, Cooper became a member due to role as treasurer. In May 1842, he resigned from his position as Colonial Treasurer and returned to Sydney. Cooper was later secretary and treasurer to the Shire of Ballan west of Melbourne. His health deteriorated for the last two years of his life and he died in Geelong, Victoria, on 7 April 1867, at the home of his son-in-law. His son, George Sisson Cooper, had a long career in the New Zealand civil service; from 1870 to 1892, he was Under-Secretary for the colony. Cooper was a beekeeper and was one of the first who tried to establish honeybees in New Zealand.

Songkitrat was a champion Muay Thai fighter in Thailand with over 50 fights before becoming an orthodox boxer. He made two unsuccessful attempts at the NBA World Bantamweight title to Jimmy Carruthers and Robert Cohen in May and September 1954, both to audiences over 60,000. == Career == On December 30, 1949, Songkitrat debuted against Mok Kai Khoon in the Happy World Arena, Singapore. The first time he challenged the World Champion was against Australian Jimmy Carruthers on May 2, 1954, at the Charusathian Stadium. More than 60,000 spectators attended, including King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit of Thailand Songkitrat was sponsored partly by the Royal Thai Police Department. The stadium was open roofed, and as it was monsoon season and raining, both competitors fought barefoot, and were forced to dodge falling light globes as they exploded from gusts of wind. This is the first recorded match in modern world boxing history where boxers removed their boots. On September 19, 1954, Songkitrat challenged World Champion Robert Cohen at the Nimibutr Stadium, National Stadium. His nose was broken during the seventh round, but he fought on, only to lose through points after 15 rounds. On March 9, 1955, he fought Ra√∫l Mac√≠as at Cow Palace, in California, and lost.

Aernout van Overbeke (15 December 1632 ‚Äì 19 July 1674) was a Dutch writer and humorist. His works include burlesque letters detailing his travels and a collection of jokes. His Rym-wercken was very popular and was reprinted nine times after his death. ==Life== He was born in Leiden, where his Antwerp-born parents had settled after marrying in Frankfurt and spending a period in Amsterdam. His family was quite wealthy, with a townhouse on the Rapenburg and a country residence in Alphen aan den Rijn and receiving illustrious guests such as Vossius and Barlaeus. However, Aernout's father later got into financial difficulties, which seem to have affected his health - he died in 1638. Van Overbeke entered Leiden University aged eleven and completed his legal studies there on 10 March 1655 with a disputation or thesis entitled De transactionibus. On 23 January 1659 he became a lawyer for the Court of Holland. He incurred many debts around this time, for example by writing a translation of the psalms into poetry for the Lutheran church at his own expense and then distributing it for free. It was probably his financial problems that led him to apply to work for the Dutch East India Company, becoming a fiscal lawyer for it and later becoming president of the Council of Justice for Batavia. Van Overbeke returned to the Netherlands in 1672 and little is known of his life and work after that date. He died in Amsterdam on 19 July 1674 and was buried in his family vault at Leiden a week later. == Works == *De psalmen Davids in Nederduytsche rymen gestelt. Amsterdam : Borrit Jansz.

His parents were Johannes Cornelis van Heel (a cobbler) and Maria Clasina Blesting. He entered the Franciscan order and was ordained a priest on 26 March 1933. Later that year he left for China as a missionary, where he took the name Hu Yong-Sheng. The young friar joined a group of about 20 Franciscan friar from the Netherlands in the south of Shanxi province, where they had been serving as missionaries for the Roman Catholic church since the 1890s. On 13 September 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japanese troops invaded Shanxi province. Some 2000 people sought refuge with the church of Shitougeta (currently Changzhi) in Yuanqu County, where van Heel was the parish priest. On 8 October 1938, when Japanese soldiers demanded that the women in the church be handed over to them, he refused to comply. He was found dead the next morning. On 17 June 2017, a monument for van Heel was erected at his grave. It has an inscription in Chinese which, in English translation, reads: AEMILIANUS VAN HEEL, Franciscan missionary, born 1907.06.08 in Leiden, Holland. Came to China in 1933. From 1937 worked as a priest in Shitou (Chang Zhi) Church in Yuanqu. He protected thousands of refugees, especially women, from Japanese troops and was murdered 1938.10.08 in retaliation.

Four years after contacting him initially, Eric Welles-Nystrom of Luaka Bop went to Nigeria to find him and got Onyeabor to accept an album to be released. Welles-Nystrom noted that compiling the music was supposed to take \\"a month, that was five years ago.\\" ==Release== Who is William Onyeabor? was released on by Luaka Bop on October 29, 2013.

As well as disease, insect and virus resistance some of the research projects focus on traits particularly crucial for Africa like drought resistance and biofortification. In 2010, after nine years of talks, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) produced a draft policy on GM technology, which was sent to all 19 national governments for consultation in September 2010. Under the proposed policy, new GM crops would be scientifically assessed by COMESA. If the GM crop was deemed safe for the environmental and human health, permission would be granted for the crop to be grown in all 19 member countries, although the final decision would be left to each individual country.

It represents the southern section of the Erfurt‚ÄìMagdeburg(‚ÄìBerlin) connection, the shortest regional connection between these major Thuringian and Saxony-Anhalt cities. The timetable number of 335 applies to the whole route from Erfurt to Magdeburg, including the Sangerhausen‚ÄìErfurt section. == Route== The railway starts in Sangerhausen on the southern edge of the Harz in Saxony-Anhalt. After having crossed the Thuringian border a few kilometres to the south, it reaches Artern on the Unstrut. The line crosses the Unstrut and follows the river through the Diamantene Aue lowlands to the Th√ºringer Pforte (Thuringian Gate) at Heldrungen. Beyond this gorge of the Unstrut, between the ridges of Hainleite to the west and Schm√ºcke to the east, the line enters the Thuringian Basin. It passes through agricultural lowlands via S√∂mmerda to Erfurt. == History== The railway line was built by the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company (Magdeburg-Halberst√§dter Eisenbahngesellschaft). It was opened in 1880, with the first section opened from Sangerhausen to Artern on 15 July. The second section was opened from Artern to Erfurt on 24 October 1881. The line then became the third north-south link between central Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt and the Harz region. Previously completed were the Thuringian Railway from Halle in the east and the Wolkramshausen‚ÄìErfurt railway in the west. It served above all the traffic between Magdeburg (then capital of the Prussian Province of Saxony and Erfurt (then seat of a government district and the third largest city in the Province of Saxony). It was taken over by the Prussian government in 1886. A second track was built between Erfurt and S√∂mmerda, but the second track was dismantled in 1946 to provide reparations. The railway was modernised and electrified at the end of the 1990s. The Sangerhausen‚ÄìArtern and S√∂mmerda‚ÄìErfurt sections are now double-track. == Operations== S√∂mmerda station In passenger transport, two services now operate on 120-minute cycles, jointly providing an hourly service. The Regional-Express 10 (Magdeburg‚ÄìErfurt) service is operated by DB Regio with Siemens Desiro Classic (class 642) diesel multiple units and the Regionalbahn 59 (Sangerhausen‚ÄìErfurt) service is operated by Abellio Rail Mitteldeutschland with Talent 2 electric multiple units.

Although the use of the term in architectural history dates from the 1980s, Victorian architects and writers are recorded as using the word 'real' to describe their intentions,Neale, John Mason and Webb, Benjamin (1843). The symbolism of churches and church ornaments, p. xix. T.W. Green, Leeds. and ‚Äòunreal‚Äô to describe architecture they disapproved of.Pugin, A.W.N. (1843). An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture, p. 20, John Weale, London. Realism is most closely associated with Augustus Pugin and in particular with his 1841 book The True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture. The message of this book was that the appearance of buildings and all their details should directly derive from their construction and use. As Pugin put it: The effect of this message was that Gothic Revival architects responded to the then- prevalent low standards of construction by emphasising the constructional role and physical qualities of the materials they used. This meant in practice that brick and stonework replaced stucco or cement render in the design of quality buildings, and in the best cases details from eaves to door handles were especially designed to form a coherent set for each project. Realist houses, such as those designed by Pugin himself, were intended to make their essential construction method obvious through simple observation; the best example is Pugin‚Äôs rectory at Rampisham, Dorset, designed in 1845. With the rapid spread of Pugin‚Äôs ideas through influential and prolific architects including George Gilbert Scott,Brooks, Chris (2000). Gothic Revival, p. 251. Phaidon, London.

Routledge, London. in the mid-nineteenth century, Realist architecture appeared in nearly every town and village in England, at least in the form of a restored (in fact, often largely rebuilt) parish church.Brooks, Chris (2000). Gothic Revival, p. 251. Phaidon, London. The architectural historian Chris Brooks first referred to Realism in his book Signs for the Times of 1984,Brooks, Chris (1984). Signs for the Times, chapter 12. Routledge, London. and then again, offering the alternative 'reality', in his widely read Gothic Revival of 2000.Brooks, Chris (2000). Gothic Revival, p. 305. Phaidon, London. Brooks compared Pugin‚Äôs concept of the 'real' to that of Victorian authors and painters: In Brooks‚Äô usage, the word also implies investing inanimate objects with real human characteristics, for example with 'honesty', an idea that was popular with late nineteenth-century arts and crafts architects.Voysey, C.F.A. (1915). Individuality, p. 11. Chapman & Hall, London) These architects sometimes believed that a realist approach to material had a \\"religious\\" approach to it comparable to that of Pugin fifty years beforehand. Realism can be seen as a pragmatic, non-intellectualising British variant of the Functionalism or Rationalism that was developing over the same period in European architecture.Aslet, Clive (2011). The Arts and Crafts Country House, p. 128.

It is now a private residence. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. ==History== Olive Township was established in 1857. By 1861, the township had been divided into four school districts, but no school houses had yet been built. At some point over the next five years, a log schoolhouse was constructed for District No. 1, located approximately one mile east of the current location, at what is now the corner of Stanton Street and 108th Avenue. In 1866, work began on this frame schoolhouse to replace the log structure. Construction was completed in 1867. (note: large pdf file) In the early 1870s, a railroad line which soon became the Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad was built through the township, and stations were established at various points. In 1872, James Sawyer platted a village named Ottawa Station at this location. Although the village was never very substantial, in 1876 the school district purchased the present site of the school and moved the school to its current location. In addition to school functions, the building served as a social center for the surrounding residents. The ladies' aid, ice cream socials, and nearly all other community events were held at the school. In addition, non-denominational church services were held here until the early 1900s. In 1887, a belfry was added to the school, and in 1898, a new front porch. The school district continued to use the school until 1958, when the district was absorbed into the Zeeland public school system. In 1960, the school was sold to a private individual, and in 1994 it was converted to a private residence. ==Description== The Olive Township District No. 1 School is a one-story gable-roof one-room school covered with clapboard, measuring 36 feet by 26 feet. It has an open belfry and a turned-column front porch on the front. The front facade has a double- entry door but no windows. Each side contains five square-head double-hung six-over-six windows, of which three are original and two were added in 1935. A rear garage extension was added to the building in 1994/96 during renovation. On the interior, the interior was a single classroom with a maple floor, vertical tongue-and-groove boarding on the walls up to window sill height, and plastered upper walls and ceiling. Small toilet areas were located in one corner. During renovation, much of the interior finishing was retained, including the blackboards and light fixtures. The toilet area was converted to a single bathroom, and a kitchen and bedroom added. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ottawa County, Michigan Category:School buildings completed in 1867 ","title":"Olive Township District No. 1 School"},{"id":"54227074","text":"PK (born 3 July1989 as Joosep Vau) is an Estonian Alternative hip hop, Cloud rap and Emo rap artist.

This article details the various pieces of legislation governing religious activities in China. For a more detailed look at the topic of freedom of religion in China, see article: Religious freedom in China. == 1982 Constitution (last amended in 2004) == (see Constitution of China) Article 36 of the Chinese constitution explicitly deals with religious affairs. It states: \\"The People's Republic of China has freedom of faith and religion No state organization, social group or individual may force a citizen to accept or not to accept a religious faith, nor can they discriminate against either religious or non-religious citizens. The state protects normal religious activities. No one may use religion to make an attack on the order of society, harm the physical health of citizens, or impede the activities of the state's education system. Religious groups and religious affairs shall not be subject to the power of foreign domination.\\" http://news.newsxc.com/folder696/2014-12-04/200429.html, retrieved May 4th 2017 Banning discrimination against religious citizens in China is usually not interpreted to mean that positions in the government or military are equally open to believers in religions. Communist party membership is often a prerequisite for many government or military positions, and the communist party will frequently not allow religious believers to be members on account of their religious beliefs. 'Normal religious activities' is interpreted to mean religious activities carried out by religious bodies that have official government approval. Religions that are not legally permitted to exist in China, like the Falun Gong or Jehovah's witnesses are not protected by the constitution. Religious groups that are not registered by the government, like Catholics who are part of an underground church or protestant house churches, are not protected by the constitution. Furthermore, religious activities by approved groups that do not conform to the many regulations governing religion in China are also not protected by the constitution. 'impede the activities of the state's education system' is usually interpreted to mean that educational institutions in China are not permitted to teach religion to students. What this means is that religion can be taught as a subject, but actual religious teaching (ie. teaching that is intended to help a person to follow a particular religious faith) is considered to be a form of 'impeding the activities of the state's education system' and as such, it is banned by the constitution. 'the power of foreign domination' is usually interpreted to mean that religious bodies in China may not be under the control of foreigners. For example, Roman Catholics may not be under the control of the Pope and the bishops of China must not be subject to the Vatican. == 2004 Regulations on Religious Affairs== (see Regulations on Religious Affairs) In 2004, the Chinese government issued a detailed set of regulations governing religious activities in China. These regulations replaced a previous set of regulations from 1994. The regulations required that religious sites, religious ministers, religious schools, religious publications and collective religious activities in general needed government registration or approval, and the regulations set out the procedures by which registration or permissions were to be given. Most of these activities or items were placed under the supervision of religious affairs departments at different levels of the Chinese government and religious bodies in China were obligated to accept government supervision from these departments. The regulations also gave a number of protections to religions in China. For example, it banned Chinese citizens from going to approved religious sites with the purpose of disrupting religious activities or of trying to spread atheism. It also guaranteed the lawful rights of believers in carrying out religious activities within approved religious sites. One of the key parts of the document is chapter 3, governing 'religious activity centres'. In article 12, it states: \\"Article 12 ‚Äì Collective religious activities of believing citizens, in general should be held in the registered religious activity centre (Buddhist temple, Taoist temple, mosque, church and other fixed religious activity centres), under the management of the religious activity centre or the religious organization, conducted by the religious ministers or others who meet the relevant rules of the religion, and done in accordance with the religious creeds and canons.\\" While the text of the document itself places no explicit universal ban on religious activities from taking place outside of approved religious sites, these regulations are usually interpreted to mean that religious activities involving a large number of people are not allowed to be conducted outside of an approved religious site. There is no definition given as to how many people constitute a 'collective religious activity', however, the regulations in article 6 state: \\"Article 6 - The establishment, alteration or cancellation of religious groups shall be handled in accordance with the <> The statutes of religious groups should conform with the relevant rules of the <>. Religious groups that conduct activities in accordance with the statutes, are protected by the law.\\" The 'Regulations on Administration and Registration of Social Groups' (Á§æ‰ºöÂõ¢‰ΩìÁôªËÆ∞ÁÆ°ÁêÜÊù°‰æã) are a group of regulations from 1998 governing the registration of any social group (whether religious or not) within China, and those regulations themselves state that a minimum of 50 persons is required in order to make the application to become a registered group. These regulations concerning religious sites in China are usually interpreted to mean that things like house churches or other similar sites where believers of a particular religion congregate in large numbers on a regular basis to conduct religious services or religious activities, are not permitted to legally exist. Things that involve tiny numbers of believers, like religious believers who read scriptures or pray at home, are usually not interpreted to be banned by these regulations. Similarly, the burning of joss paper, a traditional Chinese religious practice wherein people will burn fake paper money or similar things as a ritual offering to dead ancestors or Taoist gods, is actually widely practiced in the open public in China (literally on the city streets themselves), but these laws are usually not interpreted to forbid this. ==1994 Rules on the Religious Activities of foreigners in China== (see Administrative Rules for the Religious Activities of Foreigners within the borders of the People's Republic of China) These rules from 1994 are rules governing the religious activities of foreigners within China. The rules protect the rights of foreigners in China to attend religious services or participate in religious activities at approved religious sites. The rules even allow for foreigners to engage in religious preaching or teaching within approved religious sites, so long as they do so with the permission of the approved Chinese religious group. However, these rules also place a number of restrictions on foreigners in China. They do not allow for foreigners to engage in missionary activities, such as ordaining new religious ministers or converting Chinese citizens to their religion. Foreign missionaries who come to China are permitted to carry out preaching or religious services within approved religious sites, by these rules, so long as they have the permission of the Chinese religious group, however, outside of the approved religious sites, they are not permitted to carry out most kinds of missionary activities. They can be a religious 'presence', but they cannot engage in preaching in the open public. ==2000 Implementation instructions on Rules for Religious Activities of foreigners == (see Detailed Instructions on the Implementation of the Administrative Rules for the Religious Activities of Foreigners within the Borders of the People's Republic of China In 2000, the Chinese government issued guidelines regarding the rules for the religious activities of foreigners. These guidelines reiterated, clarified and expanded many of the things from the previous rules. Included among the things mentioned were such things like the explicit banning of foreigners from making religious publications in China, banning foreigners from spreading religious materials in China, banning foreigners from running religious training classes and requiring foreign religious ministers (other than visitors) that preach at Chinese religious sites to be registered with the government. These instructions provided guidelines for how relations between foreigners and Chinese should occur in the religious sphere, such as rules regarding foreign teachers hired by Chinese religious schools, rules regarding Chinese ministers that give religious rites to foreigners or rules regarding foreign students that study at Chinese religious schools. The rules once again allowed for foreigners to take part or engage in religious activities at approved religious sites, including preaching or teaching, so long as the relevant rules and guidelines were followed. It once again also did not allow for foreigners to convert Chinese citizens or ordain Chinese citizens as religious ministers. ==2006 Procedures for the Registration of Religious Ministers== These rules from 2006 simply detail the procedures used in order to register religious ministers in China. Religious ministers who do not conform to these procedures are not permitted to serve in Chinese religious bodies. ==References== Category:Chinese law ","title":"Chinese Laws on Religious Activities"},{"id":"54227264","text":"An observation tower in Vandavaru Vandaravu (Malayalam:‡¥µ‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡¥±‡¥æ‡¥µ‡µÅ,Tamil: ‡Æµ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Æ±‡Ææ‡Æµ‡ØÅ) is the highest peak in the Palani hills (Western Ghats) in Tamil Nadu, India.https://www.britannica.com/place/Vandaravu It shares border between Devikulam taluk in Idukki district and Kodaikanal taluk in Dindigul district.

A British-New Zealand production, it is based on the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege in London and stars Jamie Bell, Abbie Cornish, Mark Strong and Martin Shaw. The siege situation is presented from three perspectives: that of negotiator Max Vernon (Mark Strong), SAS leader Rusty Firmin (Jamie Bell) and BBC news reporter Kate Adie (Abbie Cornish). The film was released on 4 August 2017 to mixed reviews and was subsequently streamed by Netflix.https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-09-01/6-days-netflix-trailer/, Netflix reveals trailer for Iranian Embassy siege drama 6 Days ==Plot== On Day 1, 30 April 1980, six Iranian Arabs storm the Iranian Embassy located at 16 Princes Gate, Kensington in London and hold at least 26 hostages. Notable persons have been summoned by the incident, including SAS members led by Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin, BBC reporter Kate Adie, and Chief Inspector Max Vernon of the Metropolitan Police. The authorities receive a call from the terrorists' leader, Salim, demanding the release of 91 Arab prisoners in Iran, or else they will kill a hostage at noon the following day. On Day 2, Max negotiates with Salim by phone, saying that Max will help him by any means to avoid violence. The SAS team prepares to storm the building just before noon, but Salim releases one hostage, due to illness. After Max brings food to the terrorists, Salim reluctantly agrees to extend the deadline by 48 hours, demanding safe passage to Heathrow Airport accompanied by ambassadors from the Arab League. On Days 3 and 4, Salim calls again, demanding to speak with the ambassadors. Salim's right-hand man, Faisal, takes one hostage to be killed. However, the Iranian authorities refuse to be part of the negotiation. Salim calls Max, demanding to speak to the BBC, and Max reluctantly agrees. Afterwards, Salim reluctantly releases another hostage. Meanwhile, the SAS team prepare a plan for rescuing the hostages while they are aboard the bus en route to the airport, but this plan is vetoed by the Prime Minister, who is adamant that the government will not give in to any of the terrorists' demands, even cosmetically. Reluctantly, the SAS return to the original plan of storming the building. On Day 5, as per Salim's demand, the BBC World Service broadcasts the terrorists' statement, giving the reason for their actions as the oppression by the Iranian government in Arabistan. Hearing the news, Salim thanks Max and releases two hostages. On Day 6, Faisal kills a hostage after the demand of bringing the bus is not met. With that, Home Secretary Whitelaw authorises the SAS operation and Vernon is instructed to do anything to stall or distract the terrorists from the assault. During the assault, led by Firmin, Salim and four of the other terrorists are killed, at the cost of one of the hostages and none of the SAS men. While the hostages are being led outside, Firmin recognises Faisal hiding among them and shoots him in the stomach before Faisal can use a grenade. Outside the Embassy, the hostages are detained and searched, revealing the sixth and last terrorist trying to hide among them, and he is arrested. A shaken Vernon telephones his wife to reassure her that he is safe, and the SAS team rides back to Hereford, hearing the Prime Minister's effusive praise of them and the Metropolitan Police on the radio. ==Cast== * Jamie Bell ‚Äì Rusty Firmin * Mark Strong ‚Äì Max Vernon * Abbie Cornish ‚Äì Kate Adie * Martin Shaw ‚Äì John Dellow * Ben Turner ‚Äì Salim * Emun Elliott ‚Äì Roy * Andrew Grainger ‚Äì Ray * Colin Garlick ‚Äì John McAleese * Ronan Vibert ‚Äì MI6 Spokesman * Tim Downie ‚Äì Jimmy * Matthew Sunderland ‚Äì Tom Lovett * Ryan O'Kane ‚Äì Snapper * Michael Denkha ‚Äì Mustapha Karkouti * Joel Beckett ‚Äì Copper 3 * Martin Hancock ‚Äì Bill * John Henshaw ‚Äì Police Spokesman * Tim Pigott-Smith ‚Äì William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw * Robert Portal ‚Äì Michael Rose * John Ramm ‚Äì Tony Crabb * Jeff Szusterman ‚Äì Male Translator * Jared Turner ‚Äì Tommy Palmer ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 63%, based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.

Johns was born in Devon but the family moved to London when he was very young and then to Ashford, Middlesex, near Ashford Manor Golf Club. Johns was an assistant to Harry Cawsey at Ashford Manor before moving to Southdown Golf Club near Shoreham-by-Sea in 1907. Johns was runner-up in the 1908 Sussex Professional Tournament, losing to Jack Rowe 5&3 in the final. Johns first came to prominence in the 1909 Open Championship. He led after the first morning with a 72 and was second at the end of the day. Despite a poor third round he finished fourth, a shot behind the runners-up. His 72 remained the lowest round of the Championship. Within weeks of the Open he became the professional at Ashford Manor, replacing Harry Cawsey who was moving to a new position in Skegness. Johns completed a good season by qualifying for the final stage of the 1909 News of the World Match Play, reaching the quarter- finals. He won ¬£10, the same as he earned by finishing fourth in The Open. He had less success in the period until the start of World War I, although he reached the final of the Southern Professional Foursomes Tournament in 1911. In April 1915 became the professional at Purley Downs near Croydon, replacing James Kinnell. This was perhaps a temporary appointment as he was re-appointed in April 1919, after serving during World War I. Kinnell was killed during the war. Johns remained at Purley Downs until shortly before his death. Johns had a return to form in the 1920s. He finished in the top 20 of the Open on four occasions and also reached the semi-final of the 1922 News of the World Match Play, losing to George Gadd at the 19th hole. In 1925 he won his only important event, the Daily Mail Tournament, winning ¬£300 and a gold medal. Johns had only qualified for the event through two playoffs. After the Southern section qualifying round he was one of 15 players scoring 79 who had a 9-hole playoff for one remaining place in the main event. Johns and James Ockenden tied with the best score and then played another 9-hole playoff the following day. Johns had a younger brother, Jack (1891-1918), who was also a professional golfer. Jack was also at Ashford Manor and then at Southdown from 1913.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. It is one of the few houses in the area still standing that survived the disastrous 1871 forest fire that decimated Holland. The house has been restored to how it would have appeared in 1871, and is operated by the Holland Museum as the Settlers House Museum. ==History== Holland was first settled by Dutch immigrants who arrived in 1847, led by Rev. Albertus C. Van Raalte. Van Raalte platted the \\"West Addition,\\" where this house is located, in 1867. Although the construction date of this house is not recorded, beginning in 1867, ship's carpenter Thomas Morrissey and his wife Anna paid taxes on this lot at a rate suggesting that this house existed at the time. However, they did not actually purchase the lot until 1870. (note: large pdf file) The Morriseys sold the house in 1870 to Hermanus Boone, and moved to Saugatuck, Michigan, where Thomas died the following year. Boone likely did not live in the house, but rather rented it out. In 1873 Boone sold the house to David and Hermina Dangremond Bertsch. Bertsch worked at the tannery owned by his brother John and Isaac Cappon, whose own house is nearby. The Bertsches lived in the house until 1880. The house was sold multiple times over the next ten years; later owners included fire insurance agent Hermanus Dangremond and his wife Emma, bookseller/stationer Leendert Kanters and his wife Minnie, Heinrich and Annie Eigner, and Nancy Charter. The Charter family owned the house from 1890 to 1952, renting it out to various tenants. Stephen and Margearet Boneburg purchased the property in 1952, and lived until Margearet Boneburg died in 1996. The city of Holland purchased the house in 1996 with the intent of restoring it to be a historic house museum. The house is now open seasonally from mid-May through September, along with the nearby Isaac Cappon House. ==Description== The Morrissey House is a one- and-one-half-story balloon frame side-gable hall and parlor house with a lean- to addition in the rear. The house has clapboarded walls, plain corner boards, and raking cornices without returns. The front facade has a center entrance flanked by square-head six-over-six windows with board frames. The original portion of the house measures 24 by 15 feet; the addition nearly doubles the house's depth. Most of the house is supported by brick piers, but a small section has a dirt-floored cellar underneath. On the interior, the original section contains a main room and bedroom. An enclosed staircase access the upper floor. The addition contains a kitchen and pantry. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ottawa County, Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1867 ","title":"Thomas and Anna Morrissey House"},{"id":"54227728","text":"The 2017 Israeli Final Four was the concluding tournament of the 2016‚Äì17 Israeli Basketball Super League.

The Act was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump on March 23, 2018, which will cut about a third of US foreign aid payments to the PA. On 24 August 2018, the United States cut more than $200 million in direct aid to the PA. Also in August 2018, the United States stopped giving aid to UNRWA, representing a aid cut of US$300 million. In February 2019, the US confirmed it stopped all USAID to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, in a step linked to new anti- terrorism legislation. The Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA, P.L. 115-253), passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump on October 3, 2018, came into force in February 2019, and allows Americans to sue in US courts those receiving US foreign aid over alleged complicity in \\"acts of war\\". The US has stopped providing more than $60m in annual funds for the Palestinian security services at the request of the PA because of a fear of such lawsuits. The stopping of funding for security services has raised some concerns.US legislation seeks to restore USAID projects to Palestinian areas ==Background== The bill was named in honor of Taylor Force, a native of Lubbock, Texas who graduated from the New Mexico Military Institute (a secondary school) and then West Point in 2009 and served tours of duty in both Afghanistan and Iraq.http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Victims/Pages/Taylor- Force.aspx After completing his service, Taylor entered the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University to study for an MBA. He was murdered in Israel in 2016 by a Palestinian terrorist. At the time of his murder, he was visiting Israel as part of a Vanderbilt University study group examining global entrepreneurship. He was killed on March 8, 2016 in a terrorist attack by a Palestinian from the West Bank city of Qalqilya, a stabbing attack in Tel Aviv that injured eleven people. Because the killer died while committing an act of terrorism, the killer's relatives are paid a monthly pension equal to several times the average monthly Palestinian wage. The pension, paid by the Palestinian Authority Martyr's Fund, is part of a Palestinian Authority policy to pay a monthly cash stipends to the families of Palestinians killed, injured or imprisoned for involvement in attacking, assisting in attacking, or planning to attack Israel, or for other types of politically-inspired violence, including riots, violent demonstrations, and throwing rocks. ==Bill== The bill was co-sponsored in the United States Senate in 2016 by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Dan Coats (R-Indiana), and Roy Blunt (R-Missouri). On August 3, 2017 the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations passed the advancement of the bill by a vote of 16‚Äì5. The Bill, passed on March 23, 2018 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, ends American aid to the Palestinian Authority unless the Authority ceases to pay stipends to the terrorists and their families, including the families of successful suicide bombers. Democrats, initially reluctant to support the Bill on the grounds that the payments were necessary to keep the West Bank from political upheaval, became more inclined to support the bill in 2017. ==Discussion== The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal endorsed the bill on the grounds that it would force the government of Mahmoud Abbas to end a policy of \\"rewarding terrorism.\\" Legal scholar Thane Rosenbaum described the stipends the Act moves to end as \\"lavish incentives to commit violence.\\" The Palestinian Authority argues that if it ceases to make such payments families will suffer from poverty; others refute this assertion by pointing out that American foreign aid could be distributed on the basis of need, instead of as a reward for murder and attempted murder. The PA also argues that if it stops rewarding terrorists and their families, Hamas will step in to make such payments and gain power in the West Bank. ==ReferencesExternal links== * H.R.1164 - Taylor Force Act Category:United States foreign aid Category:Palestinian terrorism Category:Terrorism laws Category:Acts of the 115th United States Congress ","title":"Taylor Force Act"},{"id":"54227849","text":"Lovena Fox is a singer from Vancouver, British Columbia.

She began playing the saxophone at the age of nine and left school six years later to perform with the travelling all-female septet Archie's Juveniles. She performed in the Middle East in 1947 and flew to Germany the following year. Smith and her husband Jack Peberdy joined Freddy Randall's band in 1950 before leaving seven years later to form their own quintet. Her time with Randall saw her travel the United States with some success in the country's hit parade. Her newly formed quintet found regular work and Smith later performed with the Ted Heath Orchestra and alongside Kenny Baker. Her career ended in 1985 and did not recover sufficiently to resume performing. ==Biography== Early life and career Smith was born on 6 July 1929 in Sileby, Leicestershire. She began studying the piano from the age of six and started to play the saxophone (purchased by her father Gerald) three years later. Smith's talent was noticed by a local village resident who paid for her education fees to allow her to attend the private Stoneygate School in Leicester. She began to play jazz in her teenage years, and she performed in local clubs, leading to reprimands by her headmistress. Smith left school when she was 15, and at the prompting of her father, auditioned for the travelling all-female saxophone septet Archie's Juveniles. Following performances for troops in the Middle East in 1947 with the pianist Billy Penrose, which saw her tour bus attacked, she toured with an all-female band led by Rudy Starita and flew to Germany to perform for officials taking time off from the Nuremberg trials. Smith later joined the Ivy Benson Orchestra in 1948 and flew into Berlin to perform for troops when the city's blockade started. She married the trumpeter Jack Peberdy in August 1950 (after being introduced to him by her father at the saxophonist's 19th birthday party). Smith joined Freddy Randall's band the same year, and she and her husband worked full-time for the trumpeter from 1953 to February 1957. In 1956, the band travelled to the United States, in exchange for the visit of Louis Armstrong to the United Kingdom. Racial tensions were high in the era and in one theatre in North Carolina where she was performing the band was evacuated because of a bomb. Smith toured with the same programme as Bill Haley & His Comets, and found some success when her recording of Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered reached the American hit parade, garnering admiration with some of the country's famous musicians. Smith was voted one of Britain's best tenor-saxophone players in a 1957 Melody Maker poll. That same year, Randall became ill and disbanded the group, leading Smith and Peberdy to form their own quintet which included the pianist Brian Lemon. With Smith leading, the couple toured as support acts for the comedian Tony Hancock; Smith enlivened Hancock by performing \\"Abide with Me\\" out of tune. She found work into the summer seasons with visits to Guernsey and Cliftonville, and the band were residents on the SS Franconia. The band toured Australia and New Zealand, performed in the United States, made regular broadcasts on television and radio, and she had her own programme on Radio Luxembourg. The quintet was disbanded in 1964. Smith played and sang with the Ted Heath Orchestra, and at this period of time, was now appearing in clubs and festivals in a solo capacity in Europe. Her high quality performances led her to working with the trumpet virtuoso Kenny Baker and the two worked alongside each other for the rest of her career. A sextet called \\"The Best of British Jazz\\" was formed in the 1970s when two former Ted Heath musicians, trombonist Don Lusher and drummer Jack Parnell joined her and Baker. The band recorded two albums, including Exactly Like You in 1981. ==Last years== Smith appeared with Eggy Ley's Hotshots in the 1980s and was seen performing at several jazz festivals. The band ceased playing in 1985 when Smith became ill and Peberdy cared for her with the couple returning to Sileby in 1988.

However, Babington's father died of alcoholism when he was aged 10, so the family were forced to sell their estate in Cork. Babington, his mother and two siblings were continuing to live at Kenley Court, where they had been living in Surrey, in reduced circumstances, whilst Babington attended Reading School, having originally been set to go to Eton College.Anthony Patrick Babington, the Independent, 21 June 2004Anthony Patrick Babington, The Daily Telegraph, 25 May 2004 Anthony Patrick Babington, The Guardian, 19 May 2004 ==Military service== Babington was commissioned as an officer and served in the Second World War with the Royal Ulster Rifles and then the Dorset Regiment. In 1944, Babington was injured in the Battle of Arnhem and left for dead until slight movements were detected. It was widely believed that Babington would never be able to walk or talk again, but whilst recuperating at St Hugh's College, Oxford he was able to learn to speak and write, using his left-hand, and eventually to walk. He was later awarded the Croix de Guerre for his war service.Catalogue number WO 373 Recommendations for Honours and Awards, 0263: BABINGTON, ANTHONY ==Legal career== He was called to the Bar by Middle Temple in 1948, and was eventually appointed a Bencher in 1977.

Konstantin was a passionate collector and always hunted for masterpieces in France and Italy in order to re-sell it in Russia. On one occasion he even sold a large portrait of Nicholas I to the tsar himself with the help of Charles de Morny, the ambassador of France to Russia. Morny was married to Sophia Trubetskaya (the illegitimate daughter of Tsar Nicholas I). The couple became friends with Konstantin and from time to time they bought works of art and jewelry from him. He and Sofia Sergeyevna Trubetskaya often discussed the idea of creating a cultural centre, or a gallery where Konstantin would be able to exhibit his art collections. One day Sophia said: \\"I want to build an island of Russian culture in France\\". This idea was very important to Konstantin and he suggested Monry to make a magnificent gift to his wife Sophia for a birthday. Monry built the seaside town of Deauville to celebrate their love. Deauville in fact became for many years the epicenter for Russian culture in France. In 1912 Deauville witnessed the golden age of the Diaghilev Ballet Company.

It traditionally uses pork belly slow- cooked until very tender in soy sauce, vinegar, black peppercorns, garlic, bay leaves, and fermented black beans (tausi) sweetened with muscovado sugar. It also commonly includes hard-boiled eggs and banana blossoms. ==Origin== Humba is derived from the Chinese red braised pork belly (h√≥ngshƒÅor√≤u, also called hong ma or hong ba) introduced to the Philippines via Hokkien immigrants, but it differs significantly from the original dish in that Filipino humba has evolved to be cooked closer to Philippine adobo, using a lot more vinegar. Humba also does not traditionally use rice wine, ginger, chilis, or five-spice powder; and it commonly use additional ingredients like banana flowers or pineapples, which are absent in the original dish. Regardless, traces of its Chinese origin is still evident in the primary use of fermented black beans (tausi), an uncommon ingredient in Filipino cuisine. Humba is sometimes inaccurately referred to as the \\"Visayan version of adobo\\", largely because of how humba became cooked closer to adobo over time. But they have different origins and refer to different dishes. Humba is a specific dish usually restricted to pork belly, while adobo is a cooking process that can be used to cook a variety of ingredients from meat to vegetables. In the central and southern islands of the Philippines, both humba and adobo exist and are not confused with each other. ==Description== Humb√† in pineapple The defining ingredient of humba is the fermented black beans (tausi), without which it is basically just a slightly sweeter Philippine adobo. Like adobo it has many different variants, but it is relatively easy to prepare albeit time- consuming. The most basic humba recipe uses fatty cuts of pork, usually the pork belly (liempo). It is marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. The pork is then saut√©ed with the garlic. Once the meat is half-cooked and lightly browned, water is added with the rest of the ingredients along with fermented black beans and muscovado sugar (or some other sweetening agent). Banana blossoms may also be added. It is then allowed to simmer for a few hours until the meat is very tender. Alternatively, it can be cooked in a pressure cooker to cut down the cooking time. Hard-boiled eggs may be added before serving. It is eaten with white rice. ==Variants== Humba can sometimes be prepared with chicken, in which case it is more or less identical to Philippine chicken adobo, except for the use of tausi. It can also be prepared with pineapples as the sweetener, which again makes it very similar to another Filipino dish, the hamonado. A similar dish to humba is pata tim, which is also derived from h√≥ngshƒÅor√≤u. But pata tim does not use vinegar or tausi and primarily use pork hock with p√©chay and mushrooms. ==See also== *Philippine asado *Paksiw *Kare-kare ==ReferencesFurther reading== Category:Philippine pork dishes ","title":"Humba"},{"id":"54228141","text":"Beautiful Accident () is a 2017 Chinese comedy-drama film directed by Ho Wi Ding and co-produced by Chen Kun.

It was held at Wembley Stadium on 6 August 2017. The match was played between Chelsea, champions of the 2016‚Äì17 Premier League and Arsenal, who beat their opponents to win the 2017 FA Cup Final. Watched by a crowd of 83,325, Arsenal won the Shield 4‚Äì1 on penalties, after the match finished 1‚Äì1 after 90 minutes. The shoot-out was notable as the ABBA system was trialled for the first time in English football; the format sees teams take back-to-back penalties rather than alternating. This was Arsenal's 22nd Shield appearance to Chelsea's 12th. For Arsenal, Alexandre Lacazette made his competitive debut, while Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott started as substitutes. Their squad did not include Alexis S√°nchez, Laurent Koscielny and Mesut √ñzil ‚Äì all absent for differing reasons. Midfielder Cesc F√†bregas started against his former team, playing alongside N'Golo Kant√©. New signings √Ålvaro Morata, Antonio R√ºdiger and Willy Caballero were all named on the bench. Striker Diego Costa was omitted from the Chelsea squad as he did not feature in manager Antonio Conte's pre-season preparations. After a subdued first half, Chelsea took the lead in the 46th minute when Victor Moses scored. A late challenge by Pedro on Mohamed Elneny resulted in the Chelsea attacker being shown a red card; from the free-kick Arsenal were awarded, substitute Sead Kola≈°inac scored on his debut. As there were no further goals, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Thibaut Courtois and Morata missed their penalties, leaving Giroud to score the winning one. ==Background== Founded in 1908 as a successor to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, the FA Community Shield began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League, although in 1913 it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI. In 1921, it was played by the league champions of the top division and FA Cup winners for the first time. As part of a sponsorship deal between The Football Association (FA) and American restaurant chain McDonald's, the match was officially referred to as \\"The FA Community Shield supported by McDonald's\\". It was televised live in the United Kingdom on BT Sport 1, with highlights shown later that night on BBC One. The FA brought forward the kick-off time an hour earlier to avoid a fixture clash with the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 Final. Chelsea qualified for the 2017 FA Community Shield as winners of the 2016‚Äì17 Premier League. The turning point in their season came in September 2016, following successive defeats, first at home to Liverpool and then away at Arsenal. Manager Antonio Conte adopted a 3‚Äì4‚Äì3 formation which saw Chelsea embark on a 13-match winning run. The club won the Premier League with two matches to spare, and later set a new divisional record for the most wins (30). Chelsea later faced Arsenal in the 2017 FA Cup Final, on course to complete a domestic double for the second time in the club's history. A disciplined display by Arsenal, however, saw Ars√®ne Wenger's side triumph and secure a Community Shield spot. Like Conte, Wenger had adopted a similar tactical change during the season, playing three defenders at the back. Arsenal's noteworthy performance in the cup final was attributed to the formation switch. The 2017 edition was the first competitive fixture in English football to trial the ABBA penalty shoot-out system, provided scores were level after 90 minutes. The format is similar to a tiebreak in tennis, and is designed \\"to prevent the team going second from having to play catch-up.\\" Unlike a traditional penalty shoot-out, which sees Team A and Team B alternate spot-kicks in an ABAB pattern, the ABBA format follows an 'AB BA AB BA' order. ==Pre-match== The Premier League trophy (left), the FA Community Shield and the FA Cup displayed on the Wembley Stadium pitch Chelsea were making their twelfth appearance in the Community Shield; prior to this they had won four (1970, 2000, 2005, 2009) and lost six, most recently in 2015 against their present-day opponents. By contrast, Arsenal made their 22nd Community Shield appearance, and won 13, including one shared in 1991. Both clubs were meeting for the third time in the Shield; their first encounter 12 years ago ended 2‚Äì1 in Chelsea's favour. Conte used his press conference to reiterate the need for Chelsea to strengthen their squad ahead of the new season: \\"We have a small squad, I think only one player is not enough to improve our team. We need more players that are not top level like Neymar, but we need to improve our squad.\\" He spoke of the importance of winning the fixture as it presented the first trophy of the season and hoped the spectators would see a \\"good game\\" against Arsenal. Conte ruled Eden Hazard and Ti√©mou√© Bakayoko out of the match with injuries and confirmed Victor Moses would play; the right-wing-back was sent off in the cup final and his one-match suspension carried over to the new season. Following a review by the FA in August, Moses was made available for the Community Shield fixture, but served a ban against Burnley on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. Wenger told reporters that he saw the Community Shield as \\"...a good opportunity to repeat the performance from the [FA Cup] final and give competition to players who need it.\\" When assessing his opponents Chelsea, he noted they had kept the \\"basis of the squad\\", and felt Bakayoko was a solid addition. The future of Alexis S√°nchez was a major talking point throughout the summer; Wenger adamantly told the press: \\"My decision is clear, he will stay. He will accept that.\\" Midfielder Francis Coquelin was ruled out by injury, while Sanchez, Laurent Koscielny, Aaron Ramsey and Mesut √ñzil were sidelined. Bobby Madley was selected as the referee for the Shield match; he had been the fourth official of the Cup final between the two sides. Both clubs received an allocation of approximately 28,300 tickets. Arsenal were housed in the east end of Wembley Stadium, while Chelsea fans occupied the west. Ticket prices were advertised at a cost of between ¬£20 and ¬£45 ‚Äì juniors and seniors received concessions of up to ¬£10. Proceeds from the match went to those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire in June; families of the victims, survivors, and emergency services personnel were invited to the event as guests. ==Match== Team selection The teamsheets showed both clubs lined- up with a three-man defence. Michy Batshuayi led the Chelsea attack, either side of Pedro and Willian. Midfielder Cesc F√†bregas started against his former side, partnering N'Golo Kant√© in midfield, while Moses and Marcos Alonso were deployed as wingbacks. Defender Gary Cahill played his first competitive game as club captain; he officially took over the responsibility from John Terry in July. Forward Alexandre Lacazette made his competitive debut for Arsenal, alongside Danny Welbeck and Alex Iwobi. Defender Per Mertesacker, whose performance against Chelsea in the Cup final earned plaudits, was named in the starting eleven. Chelsea's new signings Antonio R√ºdiger and √Ålvaro Morata began the game as substitutes, while Arsenal included Sead Kola≈°inac and Reiss Nelson in their matchday squad. Summary Per Mertesacker was substituted in the first half, having suffered a head injury. The stadium observed a period of silence in memory of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire; wreaths were laid on the pitch in memory moments before kick-off. Chelsea got the match underway in their home strip of blue, but found their time on the ball limited as Arsenal dictated play. In the seventh minute Iwobi used his pace to get the better of Chelsea defender David Luiz, but his cutback failed to reach Lacazette‚Äôs feet, instead hitting the striker's body and deflecting wide. Arsenal came forward moments later, when Granit Xhaka's pass went over the Chelsea defence and found a roaming Welbeck. The striker‚Äôs header was easily caught by Thibaut Courtois in goal. By the midway point of the first half, Chelsea had enjoyed bouts of possession with Pedro and Batshuayi testing their opponents. Arsenal created the first real chance of the game in the 22nd minute; Lacazette spearheaded a counter-attack and his curling shot went around Cahill and against the post. Lacazette was involved in another move two minutes later, finding Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in space, but the England player was intercepted by Moses. Mertesacker required medical attention the 27th minute after colliding with Cahill. The defender was taken off with a head injury and replaced by Kola≈°inac, who played as left full-back. Chelsea gathered momentum as the half drew to a close; Pedro had a shot saved by ƒåech, and Willian appealed for a penalty when he fell to the ground in the penalty box after a challenge from H√©ctor Beller√≠n. The referee, Madley, however booked the midfielder for simulation. Thibaut Courtois missed his penalty in the shoot-out, sending the ball over the crossbar. In the opening minute of the second half, Chelsea went a goal ahead. A poor clearance by Xhaka from a corner allowed Cahill to head the ball back in the Arsenal box. Moses, rushing in, used his chest to control the ball, before shooting past ƒåech. Arsenal found it difficult to create clear-cut chances, as Chelsea controlled possession. Mohamed Elneny‚Äôs effort just before the hour mark was well-handled by Courtois, while Welbeck minutes later had his opportunity snuffed out by Luiz. Wenger brought on Giroud and Walcott for Lacazette and Iwobi in the last 30 minutes. Conte also made an attacking substitution, replacing Batshuayi for Morata. The turning point of the match came in the 80th minute; a late challenge by Pedro on Elneny resulted in the Chelsea attacker being shown a red card. Arsenal were awarded a free-kick and from that they scored the equaliser. Xhaka‚Äôs delivery met Kola≈°inac, whose header went across Courtois and into the net. No further goals meant the game was decided by a penalty shoot-out. The first three penalties were scored ‚Äì Cahill for Chelsea, and Walcott and Nacho Monreal for Arsenal, before Courtois kicked his over the bar and Morata saw his go wide. Oxlade-Chamberlain converted his and Giroud scored the winning penalty to give Arsenal a 4‚Äì1 win in the shoot-out.

For Chelsea, it was the fourth time in a row they had lost in the Shield. Conte was puzzled as to why the referee chose to book Willian, joking had he spoke to Madley \\"...we would stay and finish the game at 9 p.m.\\" He was disappointed in the manner his team had lost the match, having a man sent off, and called on his players to focus ahead of the new season. Conte also defended Courtois's spot kick, saying \\"He is one of the best players [at the club] at taking penalties.\\" Wenger was heartened by Arsenal's performance, describing the victory as \\"...an encouragement. Not more than that.\\" He was unsure whether Pedro deserved to be dismissed, but felt his team were growing in the second half and \\"always looked dangerous.\\" Of the new season he said, \\"We have had some bad starts recently in the last four years in the first game of the Premier League.

In addition to a graduation chamber piece P√°ll wrote his BA thesis on Estonian composer Arvo P√§rt about whom he has later given lectures and radio programs P√°ll continued his studies in 2007 at the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre, under Helena Tulve, a renowned composer with distinctive musical aesthetics. There he obtained a master's degree in 2009 and a PhD in 2014. In 2013 P√°ll moved back to Iceland, but maintained a close contact with Estonia. He adopted his teacher's intuitive method of composing and preserved a status in the Estonian music life. Supremacy of Peace for string orchestra represented Estonia at the International Rostrum of Composers in Prague in 2013 and The ISCM World Music Days in Ljubljana. == Professional career == Since returning to Iceland, P√°ll's music frequently depicts movements in nature paralleled to similar processes within human psyche, particularly present in Quake, a piece for solo cello and chamber orchestra. The piece is a Los Angeles Philharmonic and the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra co-commission for S√¶unn √ûorsteinsd√≥ttir as a soloist. First premiere was in the Elbphilharmonie, conducted by Jonathan Stockhammer, and then in the Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles by the LA Phil New Music Group at the Reykjav√≠k Festival. Conducted by Dan√≠el Bjarnason. P√°ll revisited his indie roots, orchestrating two songs of Iceland's leading band Sigur R√≥s, Takk... and Gl√≥s√≥li for the Reykjav√≠k Festival in Los Angeles, April 2017, where Esa-Pekka Salonen conducted Sigur R√≥s and The LA Philharmonic Orchestra three consecutive evenings. P√°ll reaches out for touch points with other forms of art. For the opening ceremony of CYCLE Music and Art Festival in K√≥pavogur, August 2015 P√°ll built his string orchestra piece Spiegeltunnel on a mirror sculpture of the same title by √ìlafur El√≠asson, ‚Äúa conceptual Danish-Icelandic artist concerned with sensorial experience and perception‚Äù. P√°ll's 6-part cycle for a string quartet and soprano, Nature Poems, builds upon the surrealist poetry of Sj√≥n, ‚Äúa mainstay in Icelandic culture‚Äù . The piece was performed at Nordic Music Days in Reykjav√≠k, October 2011. == Discography==  Nostalgia  In June 2017, P√°ll released his first composer album Nostalgia. The title piece, written for Una Sveinbjarnard√≥ttir on solo violin and the Iceland Symphony Orchestra conducted by Ilan Volkov, was premiered at Dark Music Days 2013. The album was released by Smekkleysa, or Bad Taste, ‚Äúoriginally an experimental cultural organization that is now a fully active record company, also prolific in releasing new Icelandic classical music\\". == Awards == Quake for cello and orchestra was selected as the most outstanding work at the International Rostrum of Composers in Budapest 2018. P√°ll Ragnar received the grant from the memorial fund of Kristj√°n Eldj√°rn in 2018.

The Russian and Romanian Jews who farmed the area beginning in 1905 arrived as refugees fleeing pogroms and persecution. They had never farmed before, due to restrictions against Jews owning land in their native countries. Despite this lack of experience and the many rocks and boulders that peppered their claims, with the assistance of their German- Russian neighbors, and hard work and persistence, the great majority of them were successful enough to buy their land outright prior to the five-year waiting period contained within the Homestead Act of 1862, or to own their land at the five year mark. Over the course of the next 20 years, these Jewish farmers moved off their farms to carve out their livelihoods. Though many remained as shopkeepers in the smaller towns in the Dakotas, a significant number chose to eventually move closer to larger Jewish educational and social centers. Established in 1913, the cemetery remains as the only physical evidence of the largest Jewish agricultural settlement in North Dakota, South Dakota, or Montana. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in 2015, and re-dedicated with explanatory plaques in 2017. It is the only remaining Jewish homesteader cemetery in the Dakotas that has been continually cared for by the descendants of those buried, and the Ashley residents hired by the descendants to maintain the grounds. ==Background== Russian and Romanian Jewish immigrants who fled to America to escape pogroms in their home country, began staking homestead claims in McIntosh County, North Dakota in 1905, arriving two decades into the county's homesteading immigration flux. What they found was a stark landscape of rocky soil and severe weather conditions. They lived either in sod houses, made of earth and grass, or dug out holes in the ground and covered them with manure for protection against the elements. Nevertheless, they persevered, seeing the fruits of their labors in agriculture, livestock and dairy farming. These settlers also maintained their Jewish religion and culture despite living in this remote area. The first Jewish congregation was formed by lay leader Kiva Bender, buried in the cemetery, who also formed the first Jewish farming cooperative in the area. Two rabbis, Rabbi Julius Hess and Rabbi Ostrowsky, later served the Ashley/Wishek and other nearby North Dakota rural areas. ==The cemetery== The Ashley Jewish Homesteaders Cemetery is located approximately three miles north of the city limits of Ashley, North Dakota. The first burial marked with a monument was that of Lipman Bloom in 1913. The last burial was of Maxine Sally Becker in 1932, about the time the community itself disbanded. The cemetery is the only remaining physical evidence that the community existed. The site contains 22 monuments, with epitaphs inscribed in the Hebrew language and symbols meaningful in the Jewish religion, as well as unmarked graves. Infants were buried in a separate area in accordance with Jewish tradition of the time. According to the National Park Service, Ashley was the largest Jewish agricultural settlement ever in North Dakota, with the largest number of marked graves of Jewish homesteader families in either North or South Dakota. National Register of Historic Places ==NRHP and other recognition== The cemetery was added to the NRHP in North Dakota on November 17, 2015. North Dakota governor Doug Burgum declared May 21, 2017 \\"North Dakota Jewish Homesteaders Day\\", to honor the re-dedication ceremony held by descendants of those buried in the cemetery.; ==References in literature== On March 19, 2019, Still, a biography/memoir about five generations of the Bender (Bendersky) family, co-written by Rebecca E. Bender and her late dad, Kenneth M. Bender, was published by North Dakota State University Press. In following the Bender family from Odessa, Russia to Ashley, North Dakota, and beyond, the book provides detail regarding the Ashley Jewish Homesteaders Cemetery, as well as the Ashley Jewish community, and the overt and subtle challenges to faith that were faced by the Jewish homesteaders and their descendants.

In America, Ireland and Australia voluntary hospitals were established later. They can be distinguished from municipal hospitals which were publicly owned, and private hospitals which were run commercially. They were initially financed by public subscription. A voluntary hospital may also be a charitable hospital. ==United Kingdom== By the middle of the 18th century there were five in London: (St Barts, Guy's, St Thomas', Westminster and St George's). They provided free medical care to those who could not afford it. They were \\"amongst the chief sources of the advancement of medical science\\". They were the earliest teaching hospitals. St Mary's Hospital, London was the last to be founded in England, in 1851. The 1851 census recorded 7,619 patients in hospital in England and Wales. At that time those who could afford it were generally cared for in their own homes. In 1901 there were 39,184 hospital patients. Standards of care, and of nursing in particular had improved as formal training was established and staffing ratios improved. Nursing was almost entirely by women. Even in 1937 there were less than 100 male nurses employed in the voluntary hospitals. In 1900 there were about 11,000 nurses working in voluntary hospitals, some of whom were sent out to do domiciliary nursing. In 1937 there were more than 33,000, mostly actually in the hospitals. They worked longer hours for less pay than nurses in the municipal hospitals. After the First World War the hospitals began to admit private paying patients and by 1921, 171 of the provincial hospitals had pay beds. Plaque on the wall of Manchester Royal Infirmary Public collections, Hospital Saturday Funds and flag days to support the hospitals continued in the UK until the 1930s. The voluntary hospitals of Manchester in 1929 were these: the Royal Infirmary, St Mary's Hospitals, the Royal Eye Hospital, the Royal Children's Hospital, Ancoats Hospital, the Northern Hospital, the Ear Hospital, St John's Ear Hospital, the Hospital for Consumption, the Hospital for Diseases of the Skin, the Christie Cancer Pavilion, the Radium Institute, the Jewish Hospital, the Babies' Hospital and the Dental Hospital; the Salford voluntary hospitals were Salford Royal Hospital and Greengate Hospital.The Book of Manchester and Salford written for the ninety-seventh annual meeting of the British Medical Association in July 1929.

It was the fifth final of the Gillette Cup, the first English domestic knock-out competition between first-class sides. Both teams were making their first appearance in the final. Kent were regarded as pre- match favourites given their good form all season, in both one-day and first- class cricket. Kent won the toss and chose to bat first. Both opening batsmen, Mike Denness and Brian Luckhurst scored half-centuries to help them score 193 runs. They were bowled out with two balls of their innings remaining; Roy Palmer and Bill Alley took three wickets each for Somerset. When Somerset batted, a few players made good starts, but none managed to make half- centuries or above. Peter Robinson achieved their highest score, with 48 runs. The county were eventually dismissed for 161, granting Kent victory by 32 runs. The victory was the start of a successful period of cricket for Kent, who won eleven trophies between 1967 and 1979. ==Background== The Gillette Cup was introduced in 1963 in response to falling crowds at County Championship matches. The competition was designed to replicate first-class cricket as much as possible, but allow for a game to be completed, with a result, in one day. The finals in both 1963 and 1964 were sold out, demonstrating the success of the competition. Neither Kent nor Somerset had won the Gillette Cup during its four-year history. Somerset had been losing semi-finalists during the 1966 competition, while Kent had never before made it beyond the second round of the tournament. If Kent won, it would be their first competition victory since the 1928 County Championship, while Somerset had never before won a county tournament. In his preview of the match for The Times, John Woodcock opined that Kent were the favourites, as long as they could cope with Bill Alley, the Somerset all-rounder. Kent were in the midst of a successful 1967 season, and started the day with the prospect of winning not only the Gillette Cup, but also the County Championship. They sat atop the Championship table with 176 points, though Yorkshire could secure the trophy with points from their final match of the season. ==Route to the final== Kent received a first round bye, and joined the competition in the second round, facing Essex. Kent batted first and posted a total of 239 for eight, aided by scores of 66 from both Colin Cowdrey and Brian Luckhurst. During Essex's reply, Norman Graham bowled well to take four wickets and restrict the opposing batsmen to 19 runs from his 12 overs, helping Kent to a 42-run victory. In their quarter-final match against Surrey, Alan Dixon took seven wickets for 15 runs, while Graham and John Shepherd also bowled economically to bowl Surrey out for 74 runs. Writing for The Times, A. A. Thomson opined that although Dixon's bowling was \\"magnificent\\", the opposition batting was equally poor. In a facile chase, Kent lost four wickets, but reached their winning total in less than half the available overs to win by six wickets. In their semi final against Sussex, good batting performances from Luckhurst, Shepherd and Cowdrey helped Kent to a total of 293 for five. In response, Sussex were bowled out for 175. The wickets were shared amongst the Kent bowlers, but Alan Brown and Derek Underwood were particularly miserly. Unlike Kent, Somerset did feature in the first round, in which they faced Leicestershire. Mervyn Kitchen and Graham Burgess each batted well to propel Somerset to a score of 251 for nine. Leicestershire were then bowled out for 160 runs after just 46.3 overs, giving Somerset a 91-run victory. Somerset's second round match against Warwickshire, in Birmingham, took three days to complete. Somerset batted first again, and scored 206 for eight. No batsmen particularly stood out; Roy Virgin, Bill Alley and Colin Atkinson all made scores in the forties, while Kitchen scored 35, and no other batsman reached double figures. Warwickshire then reached 84 for four just short of halfway through their overs when the game was postponed due to inclement weather. Cricket at the time was not played on Sundays, and no further play was possible on Monday, so the game continued on Tuesday, when economical bowling from Fred Rumsey, along with the wickets taken by Alley on the first day, helped to restrict Warwickshire to 181 runs. Somerset batted first again in their quarter final match against Northamptonshire, but only managed to score 184 runs. No Somerset player managed to score more than 40 runs during the innings. The Somerset bowlers played well in comparison; Rumsey took four wickets, while Alley conceded only eight runs from his twelve overs, and Northamptonshire were bowled out for 148. Somerset once again had no stand-out batting performance in their semi-final; Kitchen was their highest scorer with 40 runs, as they posted 210 for seven in a rain- interrupted innings which continued into the second day of the match. Three of the Somerset bowlers, Ken Palmer, Rumsey and Alley all conceded less than two runs per over to help their side limit Lancashire to 110 runs, and give Somerset a 100-run victory. ==Match== Summary alt=Mike Denness Played in front of a sell-out crowd of 20,000 people at Lord's, Kent captain Colin Cowdrey won the toss and chose to bat first. Mike Denness and Brian Luckhurst opened the batting for Kent. Denness began by scoring quickly, accounting for 50 of the team's 78 runs after just over an hour of the match, before being caught behind by Geoff Clayton off the bowling of Bill Alley. John Woodcock, writing in The Times described Denness' contribution as being \\"the one innings of quality\\" in an \\"ordinary\\" match. Luckhurst played a patient innings, and shared a second-wicket partnership of 60 with Shepherd. Once their top-order batsmen were out, Kent collapsed from 138 runs for the loss of one wicket to 150 for seven. Cowdrey, Dixon, Stuart Leary and Alan Brown were all dismissed for scores of one or less. A late partnership between Alan Knott and Alan Ealham, who scored 21 and 17 respectively before both were run out, helped to push Kent's score on to 193 all out after 59.4 overs, two deliveries short of the full 60-over innings. Somerset's bowling was led by Alley, who took three wickets and conceded 22 runs from his 12 overs. Woodcock described his bowling during the match as being of \\"the utmost cunning\\". Somerset's other bowlers fared less well; Roy Palmer also collected three wickets, but was expensive, conceding nearly five runs per over. In Somerset's batting innings, Woodcock suggested that the team needed just one top-class performance to grant them victory after restricting Kent's score well late in their innings. Peter Robinson, opening with Roy Virgin, played well to score 48 runs, but that was the highest score that any Somerset player would manage. Each of the other top-order batsmen made starts, but none could convert them to big scores; Virgin got 17, Mervyn Kitchen 15 and Terry Barwell 24. Alley, identified by The Times as a key player for Somerset before the match, only scored one run before being caught behind square on the legside by Brown from the bowling of Shepherd. Graham Burgess provided some runs in the middle-order, but lacked support from his batting partners; of the five batsmen who were below him in the batting order, only Geoff Clayton added more than two runs to the score, and he only totalled eight. Derek Underwood finished as Kent's leading wicket- taker in the match, though his three wickets came late in the innings, as he had been held back against the top-order, as Cowdrey was concerned he might concede too many runs. Somerset were all out for 161 runs, with 54.5 overs bowled, giving Kent a 32-run victory.

She also painted watercolours of ancient architecture and sculpture. In 1916, she was a founding member of the Society of Women Artists (Kvindelige Kunstneres Samfund). ==Early life and education== Born into the wealthy Danish-Jewish Henriques family in Klampenborg north of Copenhagen, Marie Henriques was the daughter of Martin Henriques (1825-1912) and Therese Abrahamsen (1833-1882). She shared her artistic talents with her paternal uncles and with her elder brother, Robert Henriques (1858-1914), a musician and writer. After taking private painting lessons in Denmark, she spent six months with her father in Paris where she studied under the Belgian Alfred Stevens, the Norwegian Christian Krohg and the French artist Othon Friesz. On returning to Copenhagen, she was fortunate to be able to attend the Women's School which had just been established at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. She studied there under Viggo Johansen, graduating in 1893. ==Career== Etruscan sarcophagus (1928) Henriques, who had travelled frequently as a child, later also visited Italy, Spain, North Africa, England, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Egypt. Of particular note were her stays in Greece where she spent long periods from 1910 to 1913. Both at home and abroad, she exhibited watercolours and oils depicting scenes from her travels. Henrigues' early work was in the Realist style but during her stay it Paris it became increasingly Impressionist. A visitor to Skagen, she appears to have been inspired by the work of Anna Ancher. She later created coloured lithographs of architectural scenes in Denmark and Greece as well as woodcuts of ancient Greek, Egyptian, Etruscan and Roman art. Many of her architectural and archaeological works were acquired by the Department of Archaeology and Ethnology of the University of Copenhagen. In 1916, Henriques was a founding a member of the Society of Women Artists (Kvindelige Kunstneres Samfund) where she served on the board until 1935. In the 1930s, she was also a member of the Royal Academy's Council and of the board of the Kunstforeningen Art Society. In 1934, she was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat. ==Personal life== Henriques never married and had no children. She lived on the second floor at Frederiksholms Kanal 20 in Copenhagen. In October 1943, she had to flee her apartment to escape the Gestapo. She was hiding at the Montebello Sanatorium in Helsing√∏r where she died. She was buried in the Mosaisk Vestre Jewish Cemetery in Copenhagen. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Marie Henriques som kunstner og menneske by Kristian Hvidt Category:Danish women artists Category:19th-century Danish painters Category:20th-century Danish painters Category:1866 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Danish women painters Category:People from Gentofte Municipality Category:19th-century women artists Category:20th-century women artists Category:Jewish Danish artists ","title":"Marie Henriques"},{"id":"54228338","text":"Winifred Fairfax Warder, from a 1921 publication.

The series focuses on schoolteacher Paula Denny (Denise Gough), who after a chance encounter with handyman James Moorcroft (Tom Hughes), finds her life turned upside down and the safety of everyone she cares about in danger. Filmed in Dublin and Belfast and produced by Cuba Pictures, the series immediately drew comparisons from viewers and critics alike with fellow Northern Irish thriller The Fall. The series was commissioned in September 2016 by former controller of BBC drama, Polly Hill. Alongside Gough and Hughes, the series also stars Owen McDonnell as police officer Mac, and Edward MacLiam as Paula's love interest, fellow teacher Philip Byrden. The series was directed by Alex Holmes and produced by Peter Norris, known for his work on former BBC2 stablemate Line of Duty. Gough said of her character: \\"This woman is acting out in this way that so many of us do and not apologising for it. Also I love the connection to her family.

The story's short introductory paragraph informs the reader of a complaints book which is there on the desk at a railway station. There are twenty entries in it, none of them having anything to do with the book's purpose. Chekhov's story was inspired by the complaints book of one of the stations of the Donetsk Railway that had amused him. Although the names in the story are fictitious, and the author changed some of them when he had his work published, a lost cigarette case in one of the entries is asked to be given to \\"Andrei Egorich\\".

Yossi Kuperwasser is an Israeli intelligence and security expert. Formerly, Kuperwasser served as the head of the research division in the Israel Defence Force (IDF) Military Intelligence division and Director General of the Israel Ministry of Strategic Affairs. At the moment, Kuperwasser is a Senior Project Manager at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA) specializing in the security dimensions of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. == Career == After completing his conscription (compulsory military service) as a Rifleman in a Light Infantry Regiment, Kuperwasser was commissioned as an Officer in the Artillery Corps in 1976, in a position in which he was a Forward Observer embedded with frontline Infantry, Special Forces and Armoured Corps teams during the 1978 South Lebanon conflict and the 1982 Lebanon War. During his stint as a young officer in the Artillery, he also completed a licensed course on flying observer Helicopters and was for a time an \\"Air Observer\\" i.e a helicopter pilot spotting targets for the Artillery. In 1985 he became a Battery Commander of a Self-Propelled Artillery unit. In 1987 he was seconded to the Military Intelligence Directorate, in which he served in many different capacities. For two-years, beginning in 1992, he was the Assistant Defense Attache for Intelligence at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C.. Four years later, Kuperwasser became an Intelligence Officer at the IDF's Central Command for three years. Following this position, Kuperwasser immediately assumed the role as Head of the Analysis and Production Division of the IDF Directorate of Military Intelligence. According to his profile IDC Herzliya's International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, during his time in this role \\"He has a significant role in determining Israel's coping methods with terror as well as regional developments, and sharing such analysis with the US and other foreign entities.\\" In response to an interview The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg did with former President Barack Obama in 2015, Goldberg republished Kupperwasser's critique in its entirety. \\"I received any number of interesting responses, but few were as comprehensive as that of Yossi Kupperwasser,\\" Goldberg stated. Kuperwasser concluded by asserting: > In short, even though Israel, under Prime Minister Netanyahu, remains > committed to the formula of ‚Äútwo states for two peoples, with mutual > recognition,‚Äù the implementation of this idea at this point is irrelevant. > The PA‚Äôs poor governance and the general turmoil in the Middle East render > any establishment of a Palestinian state right now unviable. President Obama > admitted as much, reluctantly, but continued to criticize Netanyahu instead > of betraying his optimist paradigm. Netanyahu‚Äôs realism would stray too far > from the path Obama, and other Western leaders, have set in front of them. > But while Obama and the optimists offer their critiques, Netanyahu and the > realists will be on the ground, living with the consequences the optimists > have wrought. Beyond his military experience, Kuperwasser has dedicated much of his time in recent years to academic and journalistic endeavours.

His research initially centered in the area of myocardial protection and led to the introduction of blood cardioplegia, which is currently used by over 85% of surgeons in the United States and 75% of surgeons worldwide for adult and pediatric heart operations. He was a member of multiple surgical societies, including the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, American Surgical Association, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. He was Professor of Surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ==School and early career== Gerald D. Buckberg received his Cardiothoracic training at the UCLA Medical Center. He began his training at Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he studied with Alfred Blalock, world renowned for developing a procedure to help children with Blue Baby Syndrome (where insufficient blood travels to the lungs due to congenital heart defects). Buckberg went on to receive subsequent research training (following completion of his clinical heart surgery residency) at the Cardiovascular Institute at the University of California, San Francisco, where he worked with Julien Hoffman to discover a novel way to study blood supply in small regions of the heart and in other organs. This method (called radioactive microspheres) was seminal and continues to be used worldwide, despite its origin 44 years ago. Buckberg was called to active duty in the Air Force in 1967, during the Viet Nam war, and then joined the faculty at UCLA. ==Medical pioneer== Buckberg's early research led to the development of blood cardioplegia that dramatically elevated the safety of open heart surgeries around the world.https://www.pubfacts.com/author/Gerald+Buckberg His innovations included a device to deliver cardioplegia, novel catheters for administration either forward (via arteries) or backward (via veins), and a new cardioplegic solution. He continued developing new simplified techniques to rapidly and safely distribute cardioplegia solutions to all segments of the heart to better ensure their protective effects. Subsequent investigative studies by Buckberg's team led to a new approach in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) that restores healthy function and avoids the development of congestive heart failure that often follows heart attacks. Additional specialized techniques were developed to save and restore early function to heart muscle in heart attack patients after time intervals that were previously thought to cause unavoidable and irreversible damage (i.e., more than 6 hours). Additional studies conducted by his team showed that employing blood cardioplegic techniques in surgical treatment of patients in shock following an acute heart attack, lowered mortality to below 10%, from the over 50% death rate previously associated with conventional methods. These new techniques continue to be tested internationally to verify their improved outcomes in heart attack patients who might otherwise sustain irreversible loss of heart muscle. Buckberg introduced the concept of \\"unintended reoxygenation injury\\" when blue babies (cyanotic) are placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine) to correct the congenital defect causing cyanosis. This study called attention to the role of active interventions, including antioxidants, to limit this injury, and provided the first evidence of a new biochemical pathway that causes this damage. In 1998, Buckberg organized the RESTORE team, a group of leading surgeons and cardiologists from the U.S., Europe, Asia, and South America, to treat and correct congestive heart failure by altering ventricular geometry (as opposed to conventionally treating symptomatology).https://www.jtcvs.org/article/S0022-5223(07)01279-2/pdf The groundbreaking surgical approach restores cardiac size and shape, whereby the failing heart's dilated spherical shape (like a basketball) is again made elliptical (like a football) and was built upon the contributions of Vincent Dor of Monaco. Initial success was found in 1198 congestive heart failure patients, and followed by an additional 5,000 highly successful surgeries worldwide. This research led to an NIH trial to study geometric changes in CHF patients, on which Buckberg was co-principal investigator and directed the Surgical Therapy Committee. The basis of this structural correction in congestive heart failure patients is linked to an innovative helical heart concept that has been studied experimentally by Buckberg, based on the theories of Francisco Torrent-Guasp. https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/5/2/33/htm Buckberg's continued research into this understanding of cardiac structure/function would later lead to the production of a DVD describing the Helical Heart. It was honored with the 2005 FREDDIE award (recognizing excellence in medical documentaries, videos, and CD-ROMs from around the world) in the category of Basic and Clinical Science, as well as Surgeon General's award for Outstanding Health Professional Entry. In addition, Buckberg created a ballet, The Cardiac Dance; Spirals of Life, in 2007, in partnership with the College-Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati. The dance revealed how helical heart structure affords a deeper comprehension of heart function and the treatment of heart diseases.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckjzEJsFjHE DVDs of the performance were forwarded to departments of cardiac surgery in the United States and Canada.http://faculty.otterbein.edu/jmerkowitz/Site/Music_files/CardiacDanceNote.pdf Further innovative studies by Buckberg's teams achieved additional breakthroughs in treating sudden death syndrome, remedying disorders relating to the septum, and improving pacemaker effectiveness. Buckberg received the American Association for Thoracic Surgery Scientific Achievement Award in May 2007, the highest award the Association bestows to honor an individual for scientific achievements in thoracic surgery. Buckberg was recognized for his seminal contributions in the field of myocardial preservation and elucidating the anatomy and pathophysiology of heart failure. In June 2018, Gerald Buckberg published Solving the Mysteries of Heart Disease: Life-Saving Answers Ignored by the Medical Establishment, which follows his career as a cardiac surgeon and researcher. Written to inform the general public of the existence of medical advances in the cardiac field, many of which have yet to be adopted, the book describes Buckberg's discoveries and tells the stories behind each of them. Buckberg was interviewed about his book by Barry Kibrick on his Emmy-winning series, Between the Lines, in September 2018. They discussed Buckberg's journey as a researcher dedicated to finding solutions to heart disease and its complications ‚Äì solutions which, once adopted by the healthcare field, could transform heart treatments and improve outcomes for people worldwide. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOd1Grk8MgQ) A few weeks after the airing of his Barry Kibrick interview, Buckberg died from leiomyosarcoma cancer on September 20, 2018. ==Personal life== Buckberg was a marathon runner as well as a marathon ocean swimmer, and continued daily morning swims in UCLA's Masters Swim Club until his death. Having been married to Ingeborg, Buckberg is survived by two daughters and four grandchildren. ==Honors and awards== ‚Ä¢ Earl Bakken Scientific Achievement Award, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (2000) ‚Ä¢ Daniel Drake Award, University of Cincinnati (2000) ‚Ä¢ Invited Basic Science Lecturer, American Association of Thoracic Surgeons (2001)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wCKaUzoM-U https://www.jtcvs.org/article/S0022-5223(02)00169-1/abstract ‚Ä¢ Distinguished Alumni Award Recipient, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (2001) ‚Ä¢ Appointed Faculty Associate at Caltech to study the helical heart (2003) ‚Ä¢ Freddie Award for DVD of ‚ÄúThe Helical Heart,‚Äù International Health & Medical Media Awards (2005) ‚Ä¢ Scientific Achievement Award, American Association of Thoracic Surgeons (2007) ‚Ä¢ Honorary Degree, Doctor of Science, Ohio State University (2007) ‚Ä¢ Honorary Degree, Doctor of Science, University of Cincinnati (2007 ‚Ä¢ Gibbon Award for Outstanding Contribution to Science and Practice of Extracorporeal Circulation (2008) ‚Ä¢ Longmire Legacy Award (2008) ‚Ä¢ Honorary Membership in the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2009) ‚Ä¢ Clarence Crafoord Lecture, Denmark (2009) ‚Ä¢ Associate Foreign Membership of French National Academy (2010) ‚Ä¢ RAMS Academician Bakoulev Prize, Moscow (2015) ‚Ä¢ UCLA Lifetime Achievement and Chairman's Award (2018) ==References== Category:1935 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American thoracic surgeons Category:David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA faculty Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:University of Cincinnati College of Medicine alumni ","title":"Gerald Buckberg"},{"id":"54228629","text":"Zubovce (, ) is a village in the municipality of Vrapƒçi≈°te, North Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 762 inhabitants.

In a 2015 commentary on research by Angus Deaton and Anne Case on rising death rates among middle-aged white Americans, Meara and Jonathan S. Skinner explored possible explanations including racial differences in opioid prescriptions and financial pessimism. Meara appeared alongside Case on The Diane Rehm Show to discuss their findings. Opioid use A 2014 study which Meara helped to lead found that roughly 4 million disabled Americans were prescribed painkillers including codeine, morphine, OxyContin and vicodin, and that one fifth of those prescriptions were for doses high enough to risk serious side effects or overdose. A 2016 study led by Meara found that laws restricting the prescription, dispensation and receipt of opioids had no discernible effect on disabled Medicare recipients and had not reduced the frequency of overdoses. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Dartmouth College faculty Category:Health economists Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:Women economists Category:21st-century economists ","title":"Ellen Meara"},{"id":"54228658","text":"Nancy Peregrim Marion is the George J.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 20 resources, which included 16 contributing buildings and four non-contributing buildings. with This district reflects a typical central business district found in a Midwest town. It represents a transitional period from a frontier town to a settled community, and from the horse as the primary means of transportation to the automobile and mechanized farming. Most of the buildings in Oxford's business district were constructed between 1883 and 1917. Some replaced the wood frame structures from the town's frontier days, while others replaced those destroyed by a major fire that consumed the north side of the district in 1890. They are one to two stories in height, and their exteriors are composed of common brick. While simple in composition, many feature ornate decorative cornices. The Italianate and Romanesque Revival styles dominate. Oxford began informally in the 1850s by workers who serviced the engines on the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad, which was replaced by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific. The town itself was platted in 1868, and it experienced significant growth in the 1870s. Four additions were added to the town in that decade alone. ==References== Category:Historic districts in Johnson County, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Johnson County, Iowa Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Italianate architecture in Iowa Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Iowa ","title":"Oxford Commercial Historic District"},{"id":"54228678","text":"James Donald Feyrer (born May 27, 1968) is a Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College, and the vice-chair of Dartmouth's Department of Economics. His research focuses on economic growth, macroeconomics and productivity. == Education == Feyrer graduated from Stanford University in 1990 with a B.A. in Mechanical Engineering and from Brown University in 2001 with a Ph.D. in Economics. == Career and research == Feyrer was previously a visiting associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As of 2010 he was also a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research. His work has been published in journals including the Journal of Economic Perspectives, Population and Development Review, the Quarterly Journal of Economics and The Review of Economics and Statistics. He is a co- editor of the Journal of Development Economics. A 2005 working paper by Feyrer found a correlation between economic productivity and the proportion of its workforce who were aged between 40 and 49. In 2012 the National Research Council's Committee on the Long-Run Macroeconomic Effects of the Aging U.S. Population described Feyrer's conclusions as \\"implausible\\"; however in 2016 Jason Furman, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Executive Office of the President, said that research since 2012 supported Feyrer's results. A 2011 study by Feyrer and Bruce Sacerdote found that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a stimulus package designed to protect and create jobs, had a positive effect on employment. Their methodology involved comparing stimulus spending with employment growth at the state and county level in the 20 months following the passing of the legislation, and comparing state-level spending and employment on a month-by-month basis. Dylan Matthews of The Washington Post named Feyrer and Sacerdote's study one of the nine \\"best studies\\" on the Recovery Act. A 2013 National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Feyrer, Dimitra Politi and David N. Weil found that the introduction of iodized salt in the United States in 1924 resulted in a 15-point increase in IQ in iodine-deficient areas, and a 3.5-point increase nationally. A 2015 study led by Feyrer found that the expansion of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the United States resulted in an increase in employment, most of which was centered on the county where fracking occurred. The study found that 13 percent of the total value of production from fracking stayed within the county, and 36 percent within 100 miles of the well. == References == Category:Dartmouth College faculty Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Brown University alumni Category:Growth economists Category:Macroeconomists Category:21st-century economists Category:Living people Category:1968 births ","title":"James Feyrer"},{"id":"54228684","text":"Bruce Sacerdote is an American economist and the Richard S.

Chatharina Verdussen, the aunt of Jan Peeter Verdussen, also was a painter. Horse market Little is known about his training and period of activity in Antwerp.

Casanova, 1972, p. 246 Verdussen remained in Turin until 28 February 1746. Jan Peeter Verdussen subsequently moved to France. He likely travelled to Rome some time after his departure from Turin and before moving to France. He is first recorded in Marseille in 1744.Jan Peeter Verdussen, Cavalier at a blacksmith's forge with a horse being shod at Sotheby's He was active in Marseille where in 1759 he became a member and later a director of the local Academy.Jan Peeter Verdussen, A camp with resting horsemen at Dorotheum He was later in Avignon, where he died on 31 March 1763. ==Work== Jan Peeter Verdussen painted mainly battle scenes, incidents of camp life and equestrian paintings. He also painted landscapes with hunting scenes and gallant companies. He painted a few genre scenes. The chronology of his work is not well established.Jan Peeter Verdussen, Poultry market at Palace on the Water During the battle Verdussen's style was eclectic. He was influenced by the leading Dutch battle painter Philips Wouwerman. At the same time his work showed the influence of the Bamboccianti, the Dutch and Flemish genre painters of low life themes active in Rome in the 17th century. Other influences were the French rococo painter Nicolas Lancret and battle scenes by the Flemish battle painter Adam Frans van der Meulen who was active in France and his pupil the French painter Jean- Baptiste Martin. While some of Verdussen's battle scenes are generic and do not depict a particular battle, a number of his paintings illustrate historical battles of his time. During his residence in Turin as the court painter of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia he was commissioned to depict the victories of his patron. He thus painted a number of renderings of the Battle of Guastalla. These works decorated in 1745 the Battle Gallery in the Royal Palace in Turin. Subsequently, these works were erroneously attributed to Hyacynthe de La Pegna, a Flemish battle painter from Brussels, who was a court painter in Turin at the same time as Verdussen. Later the payment receipts for the paintings were rediscovered and proved that they were painted by Verdussen. The two paintings representing the Battle of Guastalla were probably executed in 1743 and are now in the Sabauda Gallery in Turin. Three peasants leaving their horses to go to the hostel Verdussen painted a number of genre scenes. Example are his scenes of markets, depicting respectively a Horse market (Alte Pinakothek in Munich), a Fish market and a Poultry market (both in the Palace on the Water). Verdussen etched a series of 12 plates, which are known under the title Horses and landscapes. They represent various scenes with horses in nature engaging in activities such as hunting, battle, cart pulling and agricultural work. One work does not depict horses but three cows near a river.Jan Peeter Verdussen at the Rijksmuseum == References External links== * Category:People from Antwerp Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish war artists Category:Flemish genre painters Category:Equine artists Category:Flemish printmakers Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1763 deaths ","title":"Jan Peeter Verdussen"},{"id":"54228732","text":"Steven F.

The solar wind is composed of plasma and contains both ions and free electrons. The electrons, in particular, scatter incident sunlight via Thomson scattering, and clouds of plasma can therefore be photographed using visible light. Heliospheric imagers are simple in principle -- they are simple visible light cameras placed inside deep optical baffles. However, the solar wind features are extremely faint -- as little as 0.1% of the brightness of the background starfield and zodiacal light -- and therefore heliospheric imager data require extensive post- processing to remove these backgrounds. Heliospheric imagers are generally flown in space because the Earth's atmosphere itself interferes with the signal even at night. Terrestrial features such as clouds, aircraft, moonlight, small variations in dust and moisture content of the air column, and even high altitude airglow and aurora, can obscure the desired solar wind signal. Instruments flown to date include the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) flown on a USAF satellite in high polar orbit, and the HI imagers that formed part of the SECCHI instrument suite on board NASA's twin STEREO spacecraft in deep space.

A connection with the CNJ Chester Branch also existed. In the early 1950s DLW abandoned and tore up their Chester Branch from the CNJ connection near Chester to Succasunna. In 1983 Conrail planned to abandon the branch line, but Holland Manufacturing and Westinghouse Elevator purchased the line to continue rail services to their facilities. In 2009, Morris County, New Jersey, purchased the line and leased rail operations to M&E.; Branching off from Lake Junction, it ends in Succasunna. DRRV freight service uses this line to access the High Bridge Branch at Ferromonte Junction. The line was rehabilitated in 2010 with the use of federal stimulus funds obtained by the line's new owner, Morris County Department of Transportation. Starting in July 2017 the line was leased to DRRV.

The line ends west of U.S. Route 206 in Flanders. Originally excluded from the Conrail system in 1976, the line remained in service under a subsidy agreement by local authorities until 1981. Morris County purchased the line from the state in 1982. There was talk New Jersey Transit would use the line to connect their lines at High Bridge and Lake Junction to Hacketstown in 1983 but the plan fell through.

Playing together on a variety of stages, the duo joined together to release their debut album, Riverman's Daughter, in the fall of 2013. They traveled The Great River Road, writing new songs for the album, which was later produced by Grammy-winner Malcolm Burn. The Grahams announced their third studio album 'Kids Like Us', which was the final album to be produced with Richard Swift, and it was released 27 March 2020. ==History== In late 2012, The Grahams, a creation of artistic expression by Alyssa and Doug Graham, was born, and a historical musical journey began. The couple quickly identified their mission, to create an authentic direction through music, writing, filmmaking, and story telling. Their first album, Riverman‚Äôs Daughter, was the result of a long and winding journey to the heart of America, and during that time sacrifice and loss coupled with their rigorous journey came the inspiration to write. ‚ÄúThroughout their tours and travels, Alyssa and Doug Graham wrote the 12 songs that comprise the work as they made their way along the Great River Road that parallels the Mississippi. They stopped in various juke joints, exchanging stories and playing music with the locals. At the end of their journey, they holed up in a houseboat in rural Louisiana where the Mississippi spills into the Atchafalaya swamp, and periodically invited friends and musicians onboard to help them hone the material.‚Äù Including lifelong friend and writing partner, Bryan McCann Riverman's Daughter was recorded in RCA studios, (then owned by Ben Folds) with Malcom Burn at the helm. The album was complemented with imagery by photographer David Johnson Riverman's Daughter was released digitally worldwide, on CD, and on Vinyl in the US and Canada on September 3, 2013. The marketing campaign, coordinated by CEN, included PR, radio promotion, video promotion, touring, sales initiatives, licensing outreach and more. At radio the album debuted on the Americana radio charts four different times from late 2013 to early 2014, a feat that promotion man Al Moss had never seen in his long career. It would eventually spend a total of 12 weeks in the Top 40. A number of on-air radio broadcasts were also arranged. In 2015 the AMA charts combined Internet radio with the terrestrial stations. During the Riverman's Daughter release this was not the case. On the Terrestrial side there were 2561 spins during the charting period and approximately 500+ spins on the internet side. The album was supported by music videos for the songs ‚ÄúRevival Time,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Good Man,‚Äù ‚ÄúDown by The River,‚Äù ‚ÄúCathedral Pines,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarni Hawkins.‚Äù In the summer and fall of 2014, and around their Australia tour, The Grahams conceived of their next creative enterprise, which again incorporated a journey through a historical American musical landscape. In preparation for their sophomore album the band traveled the country by rail, not only visiting iconic musical destinations, but traveling by one, as the railroad had been the conduit for inspiration for many of the forefathers of American roots music. In addition, the band came up with the idea to document part of their rail journey on film, and to recreate the new songs in a live setting at iconic recording studios along the way. With the new album being recorded with Grammy nominated producer Wes Sharon in Norman, Oklahoma, and a documentary film and live recordings in the works, 2015 would see the release of three major creations by The Grahams; their second album Glory Bound, the musical documentary by North Mississippi Allstars' Cody Dickinson, Rattle the Hocks, and the live in studio album Rattle the Hocks. Prior to release a tour ensued to test the waters of the new material and show the film in club settings. Beginning the new year with 30A, FAI & SXSW & two shows at the AMA Music Conference. In 2015 the band played over 75 shows, 15 of which featured the Rattle the Hocks film as the opener. The band played four in-store performances and performed at the RED party at the AEC retail convention. During the year the band shared the stage with Ray Wylie Hubbard, Leon Russell, Parker Milsap, The Wood Brothers, and the Black Lillie‚Äôs, John Fullbright, among others. Rattle the Hocks was submitted for all appropriate film festivals and was screened at five; San Jose, Napa; Crossroads, Chagrin and Raindance (UK). The band performed at Chagrin and Raindance, playing the historic 100 Club. In August 2019, the band announced plans to release a new album, 'Kids Like Us', in early 2020, written during their motorcycle journey down Route 66. The first single from the album 'Just What You Deserve' was released in June, followed by 'Bite My Tongue' in September. Third single 'Heartbroken Town' was released November 2019 and was accompanied by a music video shot at the famed Abbey Road studios in London, during a break from touring that summer. Fourth single 'Painted Desert' premiered with Billboard in January 2020. The title track to the album ,'Kids Like Us' was worked at US triple A commercial and non-commercial radio stations nationwide following the album's release (March 27 2020), and the video for the track debuted with BandsInTown, May 2020. == Selected discography == * 2013 ‚Äì Riverman's Daughter ‚Äì (3Sirens, CEN) *2015 ‚Äì Rattle the Hocks ‚Äì (3Sirens, CEN) *2016 ‚Äì Glory Bound ‚Äì (3Sirens, CEN) *2017 ‚Äì The Grahams and Friends ‚Äì (3Sirens, CEN) Source: All Music == External links == * Official Site == References == Category:American rock music groups ","title":"The Grahams"},{"id":"54229037","text":"Luis Daniel Gonz√°lez Cova (born 22 December 1990) is a Venezuelan footballer who plays as a midfielder for Atl√©tico Junior. ==International career== Gonz√°lez made his senior international debut in a 1‚Äì0 friendly win over Costa Rica.

Zair were independent whip-makers founded in the 1830s in Birmingham until they were bought by Swaine & Adeney in 1927. ==History== In Pigot's Commercial Directory of 1837 John Zair is listed as a whip-maker trading at 8 Exeter Row, Birmingham, in the heart of the manufacturing quarter by Gas Street Basin.Prior suggests that he was probably born in Gnosall, Staffordhire, but in the 1861 census, his place of birth is given as Birmingham. See In Good Hands, p. 84. Recorded still in the 1841 census as whip-maker, he was by 1849 trading from 280 Great Colmore Street as a \\"manufacturer of every description of whips\\". John Zair was something of a philanthropist: he served as governor of the Queen's Hospital and was an annual subscriber to the Lying-In Hospital and the Eye and Ear Dispensary and made donations to good causes. His two sons George and John Jr would later take over the business and become the G. and the J. of the company name. They had their own factory built in Bishop Street, possibly to drawings by the Birmingham firm of architects and surveyors, James & Lister Lea, who managed the building's affairs until well into the twentieth century. When John Zair Jr retired in 1893, George carried on with the assistance of his son George Percy. The silver mark of \\"G&J.Z.;\\" was registered with the Birmingham Assay Office in 1884. George Percy Zair took over running the firm after his father died in 1914. Having successfully steered the firm through the war, he incorporated the firm as G. & J. Zair Ltd in 1924. By the end of 1926 he and his widowed mother, who between them held most of the shares, decided to sell the company to Swaine & Adeney Ltd. George Percy stayed on as manager of the Birmingham factory with an annual salary and a share bonus and became a director of Swaine & Adeney Ltd. The Zair name was kept alive and the whips continued to be made in Birmingham, as well as some other Swaine & Adeney leather goods. The making of whips for other companies and outlets also continued. The premises in Bishop Street remained in the ownership of George Percy and his mother and was leased out to the new parent company. On George Percy's retirement in 1947 the building was sold to Sir Robert Gooch, Bt of Benacre Hall, Suffolk.In Good Hands, p. 88. He leased it to G. & J. Zair until 1965, when Swaine, Adeney, Brigg & Sons Ltd took the decision to concentrate their manufacturing at their new Great Chesterford factory in Essex. At that point the use of the Zair name was discontinued. ==Output== Besides quality gift and presentation whips, the firm made more utilitarian whips in vast numbers for sale at home and abroad. Whips were made to meet the requirements and climates of their customers. Whips with flywhisks were popular in countries where flying insects were a nuisance. Long stock whips were essential for the cattle ranchers of South America and Australia. Whips conforming to the differing regulations of equine sports in various countries were also made. The firm's success at the world's fairs in Sydney and Melbourne reflected its concern to meet local needs. John Zair Jr went to Melbourne to assess the market for himself. There he learnt the benefits of kangaroo skin that was to become one of the firm's most important leathers. The trade-mark of the kangaroo holding a whip was registered soon afterwards. Zair also manufactured whips for local companies to sell abroad under their own names, such as Brace, Windle & Blyth, saddlers of Walsall; William Middlemore, saddler of Birmingham. The firm also made whips branded for retailers abroad such as Greatrex of Johannesburg and Kopf Manufacturing Company of New York. ==Awards at world's fairs and other exhibitions== * 1879 Sydney International Exhibition: wins first special prize for its whips * 1880 Melbourne International Exhibition: wins first prize for its whips * 1883 Cork Industrial Exhibition: \\"medal for whips well finished and turned out\\"Cork Industrial Exhibition, 1883: Report of Executive Committee, Awards of Jurors, Statement of Accounts, p. 402. ==Trade-marks== * Stag's head (in use since at least 1870) * Kangaroo holding a whip (from c. 1880) * Merle & Co.

The name \\"High Sierra\\" refers to the High Sierra region in California. Like with Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion and El Capitan, the name also alludes to its status as a refinement of its predecessor, focused on performance improvements and technical updates rather than user features. Among the apps with notable changes are Photos and Safari. ==System requirements== macOS High Sierra runs on the following Macintosh computers: * iMac: Late 2009 or later * MacBook: Late 2009 or later * MacBook Pro: Mid 2010 or later * MacBook Air: Late 2010 or later * Mac Mini: Mid 2010 or later * Mac Pro: Mid 2010 or later macOS High Sierra requires at least 2 GB of RAM and 14.3 GB of available disk space. HEVC hardware acceleration requires a Mac with a sixth-generation Intel processor or newer: * iMac: Late 2015 27\\" or later, Mid 2017 21.5\\" or newer * MacBook: Early 2016 or later * MacBook Pro: Late 2016 or later * iMac Pro External graphics processor support requires a Thunderbolt 3-enabled Mac: * MacBook Pro: Late 2016 or later * iMac: Mid 2017 or later * iMac Pro It is possible to install High Sierra on many older Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple. This requires using a patch to modify the install image.macOS High Sierra Patcher Tool for Unsupported Macs ==Changes==  System   Apple File System  Apple File System (APFS) replaces HFS Plus as the default file system in macOS for the first time with High Sierra. It supports 64‚Äëbit inode numbers, is designed for flash memory, and is designed to speed up common tasks like duplicating a file and finding the size of a folder's contents. It also has built‚Äëin encryption, crash‚Äësafe protections, and simplified data backup on the go.  Metal 2  Metal, Apple's low-level graphics API, has been updated to Metal 2. It includes virtual-reality and machine-learning features, as well as support for external GPUs. The system's windowing system, Quartz Compositor, supports Metal 2.  Media  macOS High Sierra adds support for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), with hardware acceleration where available, as well as support for High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF). Macs with the Intel Kaby Lake processor offer hardware support for Main 10 profile 10-bit hardware decoding, those with the Intel Skylake processor support Main profile 8-bit hardware decoding, and those with AMD Radeon 400 series graphics also support full HEVC decoding. However, whenever an Intel IGP is present, the frameworks will only direct requests to Intel IGP. In addition, audio codecs FLAC and Opus are also supported, but not in iTunes.  Other  Kernel extensions (\\"kexts\\") will require explicit approval by the user before being able to run. The Low Battery notification and its icon were replaced by a flatter modern look. The time service ntpd was replaced with timed for the time synchronisation. The FTP and telnet command line programs were removed. The screen can now be locked using the shortcut Cmd+Ctrl+Q. The ability to lock screen using a menu bar shortcut activated in Keychain Access preferences has now been removed. The 10.13.4 update added support for external graphics processors for Macs equipped with Thunderbolt 3 ports. The update discontinued support for external graphics processors in 2015 or older Macs, equipped with Thunderbolt 1 and 2 ports. Starting with 10.13.4, when a 32-bit app is opened, users get a one-time warning about its future incompatibility with the macOS operating system.  Applications   Final Cut Pro 7  Apple announced the original Final Cut Studio suite of programs will not work on High Sierra. Media professionals that depend on any of those programs were advised to create a double boot drive to their computer.https://larryjordan.com/articles/important-caution-about-apples-high- sierra/  Photos  macOS High Sierra gives Photos an updated sidebar and new editing tools. Photos synchronizes tagged People with iOS 11.  Mail  Mail has improved Spotlight search with Top Hits. Mail also uses 35% less storage space due to optimizations, and Mail's compose window can now be used in split-screen mode.  Safari  Safari has a new \\"Intelligent Tracking Prevention\\" feature that uses machine learning to block third parties from tracking the user's actions. Safari can also block autoplaying videos from playing. The \\"Reader Mode\\" can be set to always-on. Safari 11 also supports WebAssembly.  Notes  The Notes app allows the user to add tables to a note. A note can be pinned to the top of the list.  Siri  Siri now uses a more natural and expressive voice. It also uses machine learning to understand the user better. Siri synchronizes information across iOS and Mac devices so the Siri experience is the same regardless of the product being used.  Messages  The release of macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 (and iOS 11.4) introduced support for Messages in iCloud. This feature allows messages to sync across all devices using the same iCloud account. When messages are deleted they are deleted on each device as well, and messages stored in the cloud do not take up local storage on the device anymore. In order to use the feature, the user has to enable two-factor authentication for their Apple ID. == Reception == Reception of macOS High Sierra was reportedly positive.  Problems  macOS High Sierra 10.13.0 and 10.13.1 have a critical vulnerability that allowed an attacker to become a root user by typing root in the username of the password prompt and not entering the password. This was fixed in the Security Update 2017-001 macOS High Sierra v10.13.1. When it was first launched, it was discovered that the process named \\"WindowServer\\" had a memory leak, leading to much slower graphics performance and lagging animations, probably due to some last-minute changes in Metal 2. This was fixed in macOS 10.13.1. macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 had an error that caused DisplayLink to stop working for external monitors. Only 1 monitor is able to be extended, if using 2 external monitors, they can only be mirrored. This also seems to be an issue with the beta version of Mojave. DisplayLink have said they are working with Apple to resolve the issues but as of the most recent macOS High Sierra update, the issue still persists. ==Release history== {  -  ffd760;\\"  Previous release  3d4;\\"  Current release } {  - !

It is a monotypic genus, containing the single crust fungus Rhodonia placenta. A brown rot species, R. placenta is found in China, Europe, and North America, where it grows on decaying conifer wood. ==Taxonomy== The genus was circumscribed by Finnish mycologist Tuomo Niemel√§ in 2005 to contain the single species Rhodonia placenta. This crust fungus has undergone several changes in generic placement since it was originally described as a species of Polyporus by Elias Magnus Fries in 1861. Although often placed in Oligoporus or Postia, molecular analysis has revealed that this species is phylogenetically distant from those genera, appearing instead in a separate clade near Antrodia. Synonymy Rhodonia placenta has acquired an extensive synonymy in its taxonomic history. In addition to having been transferred to several polypore genera, it is considered to be the same species as Poria incarnata described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794, as well as Petter Karsten's Bjerkandera roseomaculata (1891), and Physisporus albolilacinus (1892). Other taxonomic synonyms include William Alphonso Murrill's Poria monticola, Dow Baxter's Poria carnicolor (1941), and Lee Oras Overholts' Poria microspora (1943). *Polyporus placenta Fr.

During the administration of J.P. van Limburg Stirum, Hendrik Freerk Tillema recommended to move the capital of Dutch East Indies to Bandung due to its natural conditions and hilly terrain, making it easier to defend. The idea was gradually accepted and began to be implemented by the Dutch colonial government in early 1920s after it was supported by Prof. J.

He was an advocate for the use of service dogs. He also raised awareness about PTSD and its impact on veterans. He was also known for his New York Times Bestselling memoir, Until Tuesday: A Wounded Warrior and the Golden Retriever Who Saved Him, co-written with author, Bret Witter, in 2011. Tuesday, Luis's servce dog and the subject of the eponymous book, passed away on the evening of September 24, 2019. == Biography == Montalvan was born in Washington D.C., and grew up in Potomac, Maryland. He is Cuban-American. When he was 17, he joined the United States Army, though he was discharged. He was later in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps while he attended the University of Maryland. In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq. On December 21, 2003, Montalvan describes how he was stabbed by a knife at a checkpoint in Al- Waleed. However, other members of the military have disputed the exact details of how Montalvan was injured and exactly what happened that night. An Associated Press report also disputed Motalvan's description of the event and other descriptions written in his memoir, Until Tuesday. Montalvan addresses these differences in his book. He served two tours of duty in Iraq and obtained the rank of captain. He completed a total of seventeen years of service, and was honorably discharged. He was awarded two Bronze Star Medals, the Purple Heart, the Army Commendation Medal for Valor and the Combat Action Badge. Montalvan was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in July 2007. After leaving the military, he experienced anxiety so severe, he was unable to leave his home. He began drinking heavily and was in chronic pain. In 2008, he met Tuesday, a golden retriever and a service dog. Tuesday was almost a washout from the service dog program, but he was a good match for Montalvan. Tuesday also helped him meet Senator Al Franken, who later introduced legislation to provide service dogs to veterans. In 2009, Montalvan sued McDonald's for refusing to allow his dog to enter a restaurant in New York City and being hit with garbage can lids when he attempted to film the interaction. The suit settled out of court in June 2010. Also in 2010, Montalvan graduated from Columbia Journalism School. Montalvan said that Tuesday was a constant companion and that the dog was able to know when he having a nightmare. Montalvan's dog, Tuesday, made it possible for him to walk because he experienced sudden spells of vertigo. Tuesday also retrieved items that Montalvan was unable to reach. Tuesday won the 2013-2014 American Kennel Club Award for Canine Excellence. The owners of the winners of the award receive $1,000 to donate to a pet-related charity of their choice. In early 2016, Montalvan's right leg was amputated above the knee and described his difficulties on a webpage on which he raised money for a procedure called osseointegration, which fuses a titanium rod directly into the bone to attach to a prosthesis. Montalvan died at a hotel in El Paso, Texas on December 2, 2016; his dog was not with him when he died. Police officers found his body in the Indigo Hotel when they were called in for a welfare check. An autopsy report released by the El Paso County Medical Examiner's Office in January indicated that Montalvan had died by suicide, through overdosing on pentobarbital. Before he committed suicide, he left Tuesday with a family in Northeast El Paso. == Work == Montalvan's book, Until Tuesday: A Wounded Warrior and the Golden Retriever Who Saved Him, written with Bret Witter in 2011 describes his struggles with PTSD, combat injuries and his experiences with his service dog. Montalvan started to receive thousands of letters from people who have described how their own pets or service animals had saved their lives after Until Tuesday came out. Publishers Weekly felt that Until Tuesday was \\"most compelling when zoning in on specifics, especially related to his psychological disorder.\\" Montalvan shared with the Wisconsin State Journal that it was important to him to write this book in order to describe what it was like to have his health deteriorate after coming back from war. The book made it to the Top 20 in the New York Times Bestseller list. Montalvan was featured in Ben Selkow's documentary film about PTSD, Above Ground, in 2015. Montalvan also wrote two children's books, Tuesday Tucks Me In: The Loyal Bond Between a Soldier and His Service Dog, and Tuesday Takes Me There: The Healing Journey of a Veteran and his Service Dog. Tuesday's Promise, written with Ellis Henican, was released in May 2017. Montalvan has appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman, NPR, CNN and C-SPAN. He has also been published in the New York Times and the Huffington Post. Montalvan had brought Tuesday to several schools to teach students about his journey. == References  External links == * Official site * Veteran's Voices - Until Tuesday (2015 video) * Until Tuesday (2011 book trailer) Category:1973 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Disability rights activists from the United States Category:American veterans' rights activists Category:American male writers Category:People from Potomac, Maryland Category:People from Washington, D.C.

She is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and the director of the T&C; Chen Center for Systems Neuroscience. She won a MacArthur \\"Genius\\" fellowship in 2018. Tsao was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2020.http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/2020-nas-election.html == Early life and education == Tsao was born in Changzhou, China before her family immigrated to the United States when she was four. She grew up in College Park, Maryland and attended Springbrook High School. Her interest in science and in visual neuroscience in particular was inspired by her father, a machine vision researcher. She completed her B.S. in biology and mathematics in just three years at Caltech in 1996. She then worked with Margaret Livingstone at the Harvard Medical School, where she received her PhD in 2002 and continued to work as a postdoctoral fellow. In 2004 she received the Sofia Kovalevskaya Award from the Humboldt Foundation, which allowed her to start her own independent research group at the University of Bremen in Germany in 2006. In 2009 she joined the faculty at Caltech. == Career and research == As a PhD student working with Margaret Livingstone, Tsao began by studying stereopsis in macaques using single-unit electrophysiological recordings. She then became interested in using fMRI, a technique usually used to visualize the activity of brain areas in humans, to image brain regions in macaques. She collaborated with Roger Tootell to use fMRI to image brain regions involved in depth perception, and then collaborated with Winrich Freiwald, a postdoctoral fellow working with Nancy Kanwisher at MIT, to combine single-unit electrophysiology with fMRI to study face perception in macaques. Similar to the fusiform face area identified in humans with, they discovered a series of small brain areas, referred to as the macaque face patch system, that contain neurons which are selectively activated by faces. Tsao and her lab have continued to make significant advances in understanding the specific facial features that cause neurons in these face patches to be activated. In 2017, her lab \\"cracked the code\\" of how our brains recognize faces, identifying the feature dimensions that cause face-selective neurons in different face patches of the IT cortex to respond to faces. Thus, the images of faces presented to the monkeys could be precisely reconstructed from face-selective neurons' activity. Tsao was named in MIT Technology Review's TR35 list in 2007. She is serving on the Advisory Committee to the NIH Director (BRAIN Initiative Working Group 2.0) established in 2018, the group that advises on allocation of $1.511 billion toward neuroscience research. ==See also== * List of neuroscientists ==ReferencesExternal links== *Tsao Lab *Caltech Neuroscience Category:Living people Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:American people of Chinese descent Category:Educators from Changzhou Category:Harvard University alumni Category:American neuroscientists Category:American women neuroscientists Category:California Institute of Technology faculty Category:Howard Hughes Medical Investigators Category:MacArthur Fellows Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Scientists from Changzhou Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences ","title":"Doris Tsao"},{"id":"54229338","text":"Paloheimo is a Finnish surname.

It is the eleventh in the Church Mice series. It chronicles the scrapes of the church mice as they try to find a home for a stray dog, a quest which soon comes to involve an easily lost diamond ring. It was published by Pan Macmillan. ==Plot== Humphrey's attempts to point out the hole in the ozone layer are disrupted by the arrival of Percy, a dog who is now living as a stray, having formerly been a Christmas present. After learning that he has nowhere to live, the church mice invite him to live with them until he finds a new home - to the great disgust of Sampson the church cat. The mice initially dismiss his attitude as 'anti-dog talk', but soon come to regret their decision after Percy eats their entire week's cheese supply, leaving them to subsist on the discarded scraps of food which are thrown over the churchyard wall. The following morning, the mice meet a young girl named Polly, who immediately becomes fond of Percy. Seeking to find Percy a new home as quickly as possible, the mice and Polly decide to introduce him to her wealthy parents who live in a large house nearby. Polly's parents are having a garden party, and the scheme soon goes awry: Percy urinates on the flowerbed, Sampson flirts with a pretty pet cat belonging to Polly's mother and the mice steal food off the guests' plates. They are ordered to leave and to never return. Not to be put off, Humphrey attempts to teach Percy how to be a good dog so that he might win the hearts of Polly's parents. Percy's attempts to do so merely cause even more chaos around the house and furthers their dislike of him. Humphrey and Arthur then hit upon an idea: they will steal Polly's mother's valuable antique diamond ring and have Percy 'find' it. The two mice (aided by Sampson) successfully swipe the ring during the night and leave it on the pavement for Percy to find. Unfortunately, before Polly's parents reach it, it is picked up by a shady neighbour, who then sells it. Desperate to have Percy off their hands in order to begin eating adequately again, the mice infiltrate the jeweller's shop at night and retrieve the ring, but are promptly arrested by the police. At the police station, the sergeant is at first willing to let the mice off with a police caution, since 'as they were church mice, they couldn't be that bad', but after he describes their incursion into the jeweller's as 'a foolish prank', Humphrey (whose idea it was) is indignant to hear it described as such, and insults the sergeant, who promptly has the mice locked up. They manage to escape from the cell and hide under the sergeant's helmet, then recover the ring by slowly manoeuvring the helmet across the desktop and over the ring, then back again. The sergeant then puts the helmet on and departs. Outside, Sampson ambushes the sergeant and removes the helmet, letting the mice escape. The next morning, the mice leave the ring outside the church and again get Percy to 'find' it. Yet before he can do so, the ring is stolen by the jackdaw who lives at the top of the church tower. Sampson and the mice then try to recover it by sending Percy onto the outside of the tower to raid the jackdaw's nest, using the parson's stole as an improvised safety harness. Just after finding the ring, Percy is attacked by the jackdaw and falls off the tower, causing Sampson and the mice (who are holding the other end of the stole) to be pulled off with him. They land safely after becoming caught on a statue in the churchyard. Bowled over by 'a person who'd risk his life for a diamond ring', Polly's mother gladly gives him a home, to the great delight of the mice. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Select Illustrations.

At the time he was ranked as the best Heavyweight in the world by Ring magazine (Wladimir Klitschko was 8th). Klitschko had won four fights in his comeback from his shock defeat to Lamon Brewster while trying to regain the WBO title he had lost to Corrie Sanders in 2003. The two men had fought six years earlier with Wladimir winning via a unanimous decision. ==The fight== The fight was a one sided affair with Klitschko dominating Byrd before Klitschko's right hook finished off the American 41 seconds into round 7, the second time Byrd was floored in the fight. ==Aftermath== Byrd had originally planned to fight then reigning WBA champion Nicolai Valuev;https://www.livefight.com/news.php?news_id=4931&y;=2016&m;=04 he would instead go on to lose to Alexander Povetkin before briefly returning to the light heavyweight division and ultimately retiring in 2010 with the record of 41‚Äì5‚Äì1. Klitschko held the IBF title for a record-breaking 3,507 days before his defeat at the hands of Tyson Fury in November 2015.

Consequently, the date of 1750 (sometimes misprinted as 1756) for the production of for the production of Traetta's opera has been taken over by Florimo, Wotquenne, Dent and many others. But as long as a (possibly misprinted) date, given so many years after the vogue of the opera was over, remains the only evidence for a production in 1750, it seems to be safer to adopt the date of the earliest extant libretto, it seems to be safer to adopt the date of the earliest extant libretto (which mentions Traetta as the composer)....\\" ==Plot== The plot is largely the same as the traditional Buovo d'Antona chivalric tale, but with dramatic alterations by Goldini. The basic story of the return to Antona from exile of the knight Buovo (tenor) to reclaim his estates and his beloved Drusiana (soprano) from the usurper Maccabruno (castrato) remains.Fanfare Volume 18, Issue 5 1995 p.364 \\"The opera tells of a knight (Buovo) who has been exiled from his native city of Antona by the usurper Maccabruno. The latter has not only confiscated Buovo's estates but his fiancee. Drusiana, as well. At least she would like to accede to Maccabruno's wooing but she feels some guilt about abandoning her exiled fiance. She promises that if Buovo doesn't turn up alive within a period of three years she will become Mrs. Maccabruno.\\" Romantic conflict occurs in the wavering affections of Drusiana for her former lover and the usurper, and her new rival for the affections of Buovo in Menichina (contralto), a miller's daughter. Comic incidents occur around Buovo's friend Striglia (tenor), and his sweetheart the garden maid Cecchina (soprano), as well as interventions by Menichina's father the miller Capoccio (tenor). The plot concludes with Buovo reclaiming his estates, but marrying the miller's daughter while Drusiana is held to her earlier decision to be married to Maccabruno, despite Buovo having returned before the three years grace she originally required. Traetta responded to the conventional division of heroic and comic characters in Goldoni's libretto with music suitable for opera seria for the noble couple, Buovo and Drusiana - then Buovo and Menichina, such as ABA da capo arias, and with more lightweight AABB arias for the non-noble couple, Striglia and Cecchina, and the other buffo roles. ==Recordings== *Buovo d'Antona Howard Crook (Buovo d'Antona); Daniela del Monaco (Menichina), Orchestra of the Teatro la Fenice, Venice Alan Curtis recorded 1993, 2 CDs, Opus 111 ==References== Category:Operas Category:1758 operas Category:Operas by Tommaso Traetta Category:Libretti by Carlo Goldoni Category:Bevis of Hampton ","title":"Buovo d'Antona (Traetta)"},{"id":"54229447","text":"Kilkenny Hill is a mountain in the Central New York region of New York, USA.

It has been introduced to China where it has become invasive. In its native range it causes little damage, but in China it is a destructive pest and has killed more than six million pine trees. ==Description== The eggs are cylindrical with rounded ends, white, opaque and shiny, and about long. The larva is a white, legless grub, with a brown head and brown tip to the abdomen. As it grows, lateral rows of pale brown tubercles become apparent. The fully grown larva is long. The pupa is white; it is exarate, the antennae and legs being free and not enclosed in a cocoon. The adult beetle is long and about twice as long as it is wide. When it first emerges from the pupa it is tan, but it soon turns dark reddish-brown. ==Distribution== D. valens occurs in North and Central America. Its range extends from Canada and the northern and western parts of the United States, southwards to Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. In the mid-1990s it was accidentally introduced into China, probably in wood packaging material, where it became established; an outbreak occurred in Shanxi Province in 1999, and it has since spread to Hebei, Henan and Shaanxi Provinces. It has a wide potential host range that could allow it to spread to other parts of China and more widely across Eurasia. ==Host range== In North America, this bark beetle attacks white fir (Abies concolor) and various species of spruce (Picea) and pine (Pinus). In China it mainly attacks Manchurian red pine (Pinus tabuliformis) and sometimes Chinese white pine (Pinus armandii). Evidence that a tree has been attacked is provided by \\"pitch tubes\\" on the trunk; these appear at the holes made by the beetles and are formed of a mixture of resin and frass, varying in colour according to the species of the tree. Attacked trees exhibit shortened needles, poor retention of needles, poor growth, a sparse crown and dead branches. They may also show changes in the colour of the needles, which progressively change from green to yellowish-green, yellow, chestnut and red, by which time the tree has died. ==Life cycle== In the southern parts of this beetle's native range, it may be active all year and there may be one or two overlapping generations. In more northerly regions, it may be active from May to October and have a single generation each year, or larvae may take more than a year to mature. On living trees, the beetles excavate a hole within a metre or two of the ground. On stumps or recently dead trees, the presence of the beetles can be seen from the frass they produce which is mixed with dried resin. On successfully reaching the cambium layer, a pair of beetles mate and the female excavates a vertical gallery, on one side of which she lays her eggs in small clusters. The beetles continue to enlarge their galleries. When the eggs hatch, the larvae tunnel out a large communal gallery in the phloem and cambium which becomes filled with frass. When they have completed their development, after two months or more, they pupate in individual cells in this chamber, or in short side galleries. The rate of development is dependent on the temperature. Galleries can be formed in the lower part of the trunk and the upper part of the root system, and it in the roots that the beetles hibernate in the winter. With the arrival of warmer weather in spring, the beetles bore their way out of the trunk and disperse, finding suitable host trees by detecting the ethanol, monoterpenes and pheromones produced. ==Impact== In its native range, D. valens infests the stumps of newly felled trees, as well as attacking trees stressed by such things as drought, wildfire or root disturbance. In China the beetle infests healthy as well as stressed trees, the heaviest attacks being in Shanxi Province at altitudes of between . Here forests have been widely planted to reduce erosion and prevent million of tonnes of soil being washed each year into the Yellow River. An area of planted with Pinus tabuliformis since 1900 has been affected by the beetles, with six million trees being killed. Older stands of this tree have been attacked while more recently planted forests in general have not. The low winter rainfall in these mountains has stressed the trees and warm winters have encouraged the beetle's survival. A European species of bark beetle, Dendroctonus micans, which attacks spruce trees, is specifically preyed on by a predatory beetle Rhizophagus grandis. Research in China has shown that R. grandis will also attack D. valens, and the predatory beetle is being mass reared for release in China in a biological control programme for this invasive pest. ==References== Category:Woodboring beetles Category:Scolytinae Category:Beetles of North America Category:Beetles described in 1860 Category:Taxa named by John Lawrence LeConte Category:Insect pests of temperate forests ","title":"Dendroctonus valens"},{"id":"54229486","text":"The Bank of Portales on Main Street in Portales, New Mexico, which has also been known as Citizens National Bank;Portales News Tribune Building, was built in 1902 or 1903 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. left It is a two-story commercial building.

Sixty-four teams participated in the competition, including all teams from the previous year's Bundesliga and the 2. Bundesliga. The competition began on 17 August 2018 with the first of six rounds and ended on 25 May 2019 with the final at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, a nominally neutral venue, which has hosted the final since 1985. The DFB-Pokal is considered the second-most important club title in German football after the Bundesliga championship. The DFB-Pokal is run by the German Football Association (DFB). The defending champions were Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt, after they defeated Bayern Munich 3‚Äì1 in the previous final. Frankfurt were knocked out of the competition in the first round by fourth- division side SSV Ulm, losing 1‚Äì2. Bayern Munich won the final 3‚Äì0 against RB Leipzig for their 19th title. With the win, Bayern completed their 12th domestic double, and therefore played away to 2018‚Äì19 Bundesliga runners-up Borussia Dortmund in the 2019 DFL-Supercup in August 2019. Because Bayern qualified for the Champions League through the Bundesliga, the sixth-place team in the Bundesliga, VfL Wolfsburg, earned qualification for the group stage of the 2019‚Äì20 edition of the UEFA Europa League, and the league's third second round spot went to the team in seventh, Eintracht Frankfurt. ==Participating clubs== The following 64 teams qualified for the competition: {  - D6E2B3; text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"width:33%\\"  Bundesliga the 18 clubs of the 2017‚Äì18 season  style=\\"width:33%\\"  2.

The 36 teams of the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, along with the top 4 finishers of the 3. Liga automatically qualified for the tournament. Of the remaining slots, 21 were given to the cup winners of the regional football associations, the Verbandspokal. The 3 remaining slots were given to the three regional associations with the most men's teams, which at the time were Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and Westphalia. The runner-up of the Lower Saxony Cup was given the slot, along with the best-placed amateur team of the Regionalliga Bayern. For Westphalia, the winner of a play-off between the best-placed team of the Regionalliga West and Oberliga Westfalen also qualified. As every team was entitled to participate in local tournaments which qualified for the association cups, every team could in principle compete in the DFB-Pokal. Reserve teams and combined football sections were not permitted to enter, along with no two teams of the same association or corporation. Draw The draws for the different rounds were conducted as following: For the first round, the participating teams were split into two pots of 32 teams each. The first pot contained all teams which had qualified through their regional cup competitions, the best four teams of the 3. Liga, and the bottom four teams of the 2. Bundesliga. Every team from this pot was drawn to a team from the second pot, which contained all remaining professional teams (all the teams of the Bundesliga and the remaining fourteen 2. Bundesliga teams). The teams from the first pot were set as the home team in the process. The two-pot scenario was also applied for the second round, with the remaining 3. Liga and/or amateur team(s) in the first pot and the remaining Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams in the other pot. Once again, the 3. Liga and/or amateur team(s) served as hosts. This time the pots did not have to be of equal size though, depending on the results of the first round. Theoretically, it was even possible that there could be only one pot, if all of the teams from one of the pots from the first round beat all the others in the second pot. Once one pot was empty, the remaining pairings were drawn from the other pot with the first-drawn team for a match serving as hosts. For the remaining rounds, the draw was conducted from just one pot. Any remaining 3. Liga and/or amateur team(s) were the home team if drawn against a professional team. In every other case, the first-drawn team served as hosts. Match rules Teams met in one game per round. Matches took place for 90 minutes, with two halves of 45 minutes. If still tied after regulation, 30 minutes of extra time were played, consisting of two periods of 15 minutes. If the score was still level after this, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. A coin toss decided who took the first penalty. A total of seven players were allowed to be listed on the substitute bench, with up to three substitutions being allowed during regulation. After approval by the IFAB in 2016, the use of a fourth substitute was allowed in extra time as part of a pilot project. From the quarter-finals onward, a video assistant referee was appointed for all DFB-Pokal matches. Though technically possible, VAR was not used for home matches of Bundesliga clubs prior to the quarter-finals in order to provide a uniform approach to all matches. Suspensions If a player received five yellow cards in the competition, he was then suspended from the next cup match. Similarly, receiving a second yellow card suspended a player from the next cup match. If a player received a direct red card, they were suspended a minimum of one match, but the German Football Association reserved the right to increase the suspension. Champion qualification The winner of the DFB-Pokal earns automatic qualification for the group stage of next year's edition of the UEFA Europa League. As winners Bayern Munich had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League by winning the Bundesliga, the spot went to the team in sixth, VfL Wolfsburg, and the league's second qualifying round spot went to the team in seventh, Eintracht Frankfurt. As Bayern won both the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal, completing a double, the runner-up of the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund, hosted the 2019 DFL-Supercup at the start of the next season. ==Schedule== The Olympiastadion in Berlin hosted the final All draws were generally held at the German Football Museum in Dortmund, on a Sunday evening at 18:00 after each round (unless noted otherwise). The draws were televised on ARD's Sportschau, broadcast on Das Erste. From the quarter- finals onwards, the draw for the DFB-Pokal der Frauen also generally took place at the same time.

It is the sequel to the 2014 game Monument Valley. It was released for iOS in June 2017, and released for Android in November 2017. ==Gameplay== Monument Valley 2 is presented in an isometric view. The goal is to guide Ro and her child through mazes that include elements of optical illusions and impossible objects. The player can tap on the screen to move either Ro or her child (depending on the chapter) or to trigger changes in the architecture of the level to complete the puzzle. ==Development== Monument Valley was a critically successful game, achieving more than 30 million downloads by June 2017, which led to growth within Ustwo Games. While their next title, Land's End switched to virtual reality, and the lead developer of Monument Valley, Ken Wong, had left to form his own studio, many of the new talent hired into Ustwo were eager to work on a new Monument Valley title, leading to the studio to start on Monument Valley 2s development. The sequel became more story-driven than the first, featuring a mother and her daughter. This partially was in response to player feedback from the first game. Ustwo studio head Dan Gray said that they found people found affinity for story elements that they hadn't purposely placed at the forefront, leading them to shift direction in the sequel. The change was also inspired by the fact many of the developers from the first game had become parents in the intervening years, and the characters resonated with them more. This subsequently inspired some of the art-shifts in the game away from the M.C. Escher-styled roots as to reflect moods associated with the puzzles, such as one stage where the mother and daughter are separated, presented in a grey, Brutalist structure to reflect the emotional toil of the separation. Further, the development team recognized that playable mother-and-daughter characters are not a frequent aspect of video games; Gray said that most games introduce the mother character to simply provide knowledge, whereas they wanted the mother to be \\"very influential and powerful\\" within the sequel. Level designs also came from various imagery that the team's artists had carried with them, and ranged from a number of sources, including abstract and modern art, locations they had visited, and even modern popular icons such as Kim Chi and Nicki Minaj. Monument Valley 2 for iOS was first revealed at the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5, 2017, and was made available that same day. A version for Android was released on November 6, 2017. In addition, Ustwo worked with Tencent to prepare special version of Monument Valley 2 in China with optional localized storyline and social features. As of September 2019, Ustwo games has a small team starting work on Monument Valley 3. == Reception == Monument Valley 2 received mostly positive reviews. On Metacritic, which assigns a score based on the average scores of other critics, the game received a score of 83 out of 100, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Polygon gave the game a score of 8 out of 10, calling it an \\"accomplished, charming game, though it stops just short of greatness\\" and saying it \\"successfully replicates the original's charm and vibrancy\\". Destructoid gave the game a score of 8 out of 10, praising the game for its improvements from its predecessor, noting \\"the puzzle design is two-steps above from the previous title.\\" Gamezebo gave the game a score of 4.5 stars out of 5 praising the game's \\"phenomenally expressive storytelling with visuals and audio meshing seamlessly\\", the game's \\"new mechanics and old ones freshened up with dual protagonists\\" and that the game invites the player to explore and pays it off\\". However, like the game's predecessor, the main criticism Monument Valley 2 faced was the game's short length. Within a year, the game sold nearly 3.5 million copies, with total revenues over . Due primarily to its \\"free to start\\" release in China, the game had been downloaded more than 30 million times. Total downloads of both Monument Valley and its sequel were over 80 million as of September 2019. The game was nominated for \\"Best Mobile Game\\" in Destructoid Game of the Year Awards 2017. It won the award for the same category in IGN Best of 2017 Awards, whereas its other nominations were for \\"Best Puzzle Game\\" and \\"Best Art Direction\\". The game came in second place for \\"Best Puzzle Game\\" in Game Informer Reader's Choice Best of 2017 Awards. The Verge named it as one of their 15 Best Games of 2017. Accolades { + - ! Year !!

There she began her dance studies at the Conservatory. Her father was from Seville and her mother was from Melilla. When she was 16 she was awarded a three-year- scholarship by the Andalusian Dance Company (Compa√±√≠a Andaluza de Danza, CAD) in Seville that was directed and coordinated by Jos√© Antonio Ruiz.

In this show, the artist used four costumes made by students of the CEADE design school who used materials such as paper, plastic, metal and burlap in a way to produce ethical fashion, which recycles materials to give them a new use. In 2013 she participated as solo dancer in the Festival Internacional de M√∫sica y Danza de Granada with the show Flamenco Hoy, directed by Carlos Saura. This show was premiered in 2009 in the Veranos de la Villa de Madrid festival. It was Saura‚Äôs tribute to flamenco and to flamenco dancer (bailaor) and choreographer Antonio Gades, as well as to flamenco singers (cantaores) Manolo Caracol and Antonio Mairena. In September 2014, she danced in the show Lo cort√©s no quita lo gallardo, by Jose Maria Gallardo Del Rey, during the III Festival Internacional de M√∫sica de C√°mara Ciutat de Cullera. On 6 November 2014 she presented her third show called Callej√≥n del agua, a production in which she compiles events of different shows and of her life, accompanied by flamenco singers Juan Jose Amador and Miguel Ortega, guitar player Jesus Guerrero and percussion player Jorge P√©rez \\"El Cubano\\". On 13 September 2015 she premiered the show Los Pasos Perdidos in the Torre de Don Fadrique (Seville) theatre. The show was described as a \\"suite of dances without a storyline where the whole technique is at the service of feeling.\\" Until 2016 she has been a solo dancer in the Ballet Flamenco de Andaluc√≠a company, directed by Rafaela Carrasco. On 3 March 2017 she collaborated with David Coria's company in the show El Encuentro at the XXI edition of the Festival de Jerez. On 21 March 2017 she performed at the Teatro Central in Seville in the 20th edition of Flamenco Viene del Sur, sponsored by the Culture Department of Andalusia (Consejer√≠a de Cultura), with the show Una Mirada lenta, which portrays her 15 years of work in the world of Flamenco dance, since here beginnings with Antonio \\"El Pipa\\". For that show, she had David Coria as a guest artist. ==Awards== Ana Morales won the first prize of ‚ÄúMalague√±as‚Äù free dance in the ‚ÄúBaile Flamenco de La Perla de C√°diz‚Äù national contest.

It was published on April 18, 2017, by Dey Street Books, an imprint of HarperCollins. Lichtman predicted to The Washington Post that after ascending to the presidency, Trump would later be impeached from office. He developed this thesis into a set of multiple arguments for Trump's predicted impeachment. Lichtman argues in the book that Trump could face impeachment for reasons including: complicity of conspiracy with foreign governments, crimes against humanity for the U.S. neglecting global warming, and violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the constitution barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. He provides the reader with an overview of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and links between Trump associates and Russian officials, asserting such ties could be used in efforts to impeach President Trump. He uses the Watergate scandal as the backdrop to compare Trump's reactions to criticism with those of Richard Nixon during Nixon's impeachment process. The author discusses assertions of sexual misconduct against Trump, and delves into some of his legal affairs stemming from them. Lichtman places the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recordings within a larger context of public degradation of women. The Financial Times gave The Case for Impeachment a positive review, writing: \\"Lichtman's powerful book is a reminder that we are only at the start of the Trump investigations.\\" The Washington Post called it \\"striking to see the full argument unfold\\". New York Journal of Books recommended it as a resource, \\"if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought\\". CounterPunch characterized the work as \\"a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act\\". The Hill gave the author praise, writing: \\"Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year.\\" CBC News consulted law scholars who said Lichtman's impeachment prediction was unlikely, especially with a Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. ==Contents summary== The Case for Impeachment sets forth multiple arguments why President Trump's actions warrant impeachment from office. The author organizes the book into subsets of different grounds for impeachment. These include complicity or conspiracy with foreign governments. Lichtman explains to the reader the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the constitution, barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. The author contends impeachment could be brought for actions by the president intended to benefit himself financially based on inside information about economic dealings. Lichtman observes the president has not garnered knowledge from a study of earlier key events in U.S. politics: \\"A president who seems to have learned nothing from history is abusing and violating the public trust and setting the stage for a myriad of impeachable offenses.\\" Lichtman compares and contrasts Trump's actions with the Impeachment of Richard Nixon stemming from the Watergate scandal. Discussion of prior impeachment proceedings for presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are placed within historical context, and the book makes comparisons between Trump and Richard Nixon. The author writes that Trump's decisions threaten American values: \\"Even early in his presidency, Donald Trump exhibits the same tendencies that led Nixon to violate the most basic standards of morality and threaten the foundations of our democracy.\\" Lichtman argues that Trump's failure to learn from Nixon's negative example will harm his presidency, noting: \\"They also shared a compulsion to deflect blame, and they were riddled with insecurities.\\" He criticizes what he documents as Trump's disregard for veracity: \\"Neither man allowed the law, the truth, the free press, or the potential for collateral damage to others to impede their personal agendas.\\" Lichtman feels Trump and Nixon's potential political success can be viewed as stifled by a perceived need for covert decision making devoid of critical viewpoints: \\"They obsessed over secrecy and thirsted for control without dissent.\\" The author provides an overview of actions taken by Trump before his presidency that could also lead to his downfall, including possible violations of the Fair Housing Act, the operations of Trump University, and donations or lack thereof related to the Donald J. Trump Foundation. With regard to the Foreign Emoluments Clause, the author outlines for the reader the basis for impeachment with discussion of Trump and Trump family debt, trademark negotiations with China, and financial transactions in the Philippines, arguing these obligations could allow foreign powers control over the Trump Administration. In a proposal that the author acknowledges is unlikely, he submits the International Criminal Court could potentially prosecute the president for crimes against humanity related to reneging on agreements to combat climate change. Legally this would not have significant standing on its own for impeachment in the U.S. however, the author suggests that it could provide the moral impetus for legislators to take further actions instead. The Case for Impeachment devotes a chapter to assertions of sexual misconduct made by women against Trump, and details some of Trump's legal affairs stemming from them. Lichtman describes Trump as driven by lust, and places the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording within a larger context of public degradation of women. Events contained in the discussion of this topic are later contrasted with the fact that despite such details, Trump garnered a majority of white female voters' support compared to his opponent Hillary Clinton. Lichtman takes the reader through Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and links between Trump associates and Russian officials, and writes that President Trump: \\"stands a chance of becoming the first American president charged with treason or the failure to report treason by agents and associates\\". He likens the multiple investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the House Intelligence Committee, and the Senate Intelligence Committee into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, and Trump associates' links a \\"Sword of Damocles\\" awaiting Trump. The author concludes these investigations could have disastrous impact for the president: \\"Neither Republicans nor Democrats in Congress will tolerate a compromised or treacherous president. Impeachment and trial will be quick and decisive.\\" ==Research and composition== Allan Lichtman In September 2016, Lichtman used a forecast model he had developed earlier to predict that Donald Trump would win the US presidential election. Lichtman had published the book The Keys to the White House in 1996 about a system he created, inspired by earthquake research, to predict the outcome of US presidential elections. His model accurately forecast the popular vote winner of all the US presidential elections from 1984 to 2012. Lichtman shared his 2016 election prediction in September in interviews with The Washington Post and Morning Joe on MSNBC. After his 2016 election prediction was borne out, President-elect Trump sent Lichtman a letter of thanks, writing: \\"Professor ‚Äì Congrats ‚Äì good call.\\" On November 11, 2016, three days after Trump won the 2016 US presidential election, Lichtman reiterated to The Washington Post another prediction he had made in September 2016 ‚Äì that Trump would be impeached as president. He predicted this reasoning that a Republican controlled US Congress would rather have a more stable Mike Pence elevated from Vice President of the United States to the presidency. He explained to The Washington Post: \\"They don't want Trump as president, because they can't control him. He's unpredictable. They'd love to have Pence ‚Äì an absolutely down-the-line, conservative, controllable Republican.\\" Lichtman elaborated on the likelihood of his impeachment assessment: \\"I'm quite certain Trump will give someone grounds for impeachment, either by doing something that endangers national security or because it helps his pocketbook.\\" Lichtman was engaged in writing the book in February 2017. His representative from HarperCollins publishers told Time magazine that Lichtman's thesis focused on: \\"not a question of if President Trump will be impeached, but a question of when\\". During the writing process, Lichtman focused his efforts on outlining a thesis explaining why Trump was vulnerable to being removed from office, due to concerns about links between Trump associates and Russian officials, and possible conflicts of interest tied to his global financial dealings. Whereas his September 2016 prediction of a Trump win in the US presidential election was based on a tested prediction model, his basis for the impeachment thesis was more of a qualitative analysis. Lichtman explained to Steve Scully of C-SPAN his reason for writing the book, \\"I wrote it as a deep historical analysis for the history of the impeachment process prior to the presidency. I wrote it so people could arm themselves with the knowledge of when Trump might have crossed the line to begin impeachment.\\" In an interview with GQ magazine, Lichtman explained his thought process for predicting a Trump impeachment: \\"it is based on a deep study of history, including Trump's parallels to his impeached predecessors; a study of the process of impeachment; a study of Trump's vulnerabilities\\". He explained why he chose to write the book at this particular point, emphasizing it was to provide a guide for the public, and \\"because impeachment is a political process that occurs outside of the courts. It is responsive to the people, and if impeachment is going to take place, it will be because the American people demand it.\\" Lichtman said because there were many potential unlawful activities, \\"I believe he is more vulnerable than any early president in the history of the nation.\\" ==Release and reception== Prior to finishing the book, Lichtman had a contract with Dey Street Books to publish it in the US with a publication date of April 18, 2017. On March 3, 2017, the publisher William Collins bought the rights to publish and sell the book in the UK and Commonwealth excluding Canada also for release in April. The contract was reported as being a \\"significant deal\\". The Case for Impeachment was first published in hardcover format on April 18, 2017, in the US. It was also released in e-book and audiobook formats. The UK Commonwealth edition was published in London. Within the first seven weeks after the book was first published, 10,000 copies were purchased for sale. The Washington Post journalist Carlos Lozada wrote in a review that on reading the book, it was \\"striking to see the full argument unfold and realize that you don't have to be a zealot to imagine some version of it happening\\". He concluded: \\"Lichtman's case for impeachment is plausible, certainly, but it is far stronger as an argument for why Americans never should have elected Trump in the first place. Yet we did. So it may not be too soon for this book, after all. It may be too late.\\" Joy Lo Dico reviewed the book for the London Evening Standard writing: \\"His argument races through 200 pages, with steam for more.\\" New York Journal of Books contributor Basil Smilke Jr. reviewed the book favorably, writing: \\"The Case for Impeachment is a good backdrop for conversations that will likely remain a part of our national dialogue for some time ‚Äì or if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought.\\" AM Joy host Joy-Ann Reid said it was a \\"fascinating book,\\" particularly because Lichtman had been one of the only prognosticators to correctly predict Trump would win the 2016 election. Joe Scarborough on Morning Joe called the book \\"liberal catnip\\". Writing for the Financial Times, Edward Luce gave the book a positive review, concluding: \\"Lichtman's powerful book is a reminder that we are only at the start of the Trump investigations. The US system takes a long time to gather speed. Once it does, it can be hard to stop.\\" In a review for CounterPunch, Charles R. Larson wrote: \\"What is so compelling about The Case for Impeachment is the plethora of acts by Donald Trump that in a sane world would have brought him down long before he even ran for president.\\" Larson recommended the book to potential readers: \\"you need to read The Case for Impeachment, a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act committed by the child in the White House\\". Brent Budowsky reviewed the book for The Hill and praised it, writing: \\"Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year.\\" He agreed with the premise that the book should start a wider debate in the public: \\"I am suggesting that Professor Lichtman is right: America should now begin a serious debate about how far is too for the leader of the land of the free and the home of the brave.\\" CBC News interviewed academics including constitutional law expert and resource for the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Susan Low Bloch, who were skeptical of some of the book's arguments. Bloch opined that impeachment was not as easy as was thought: \\"You are undoing a national election, and I can't think of anything more serious politically than undoing an election. Whether you like Trump or not, he's now the president until he's done something impeachable ‚Äì which he hasn't, so far as we know.\\" ==Aftermath== Lichtman was interviewed about his book after President Trump fired FBI director James Comey. He told Newsweek this added to the evidence that Trump may have engaged in obstruction of justice, and compared it to the Watergate scandal. He reminded The National that support for impeachment grew after Nixon fired his special prosecutor. Lichtman remarked to Salon that Comey's firing and circumstantial evidence of 2016 election coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia were reasons for impeachment. He explained public opinion in 1974 changed the viewpoints of Nixon's Republican comrades towards impeachment. Lichtman elaborated that impeachment was possible even with a Republican-controlled Congress. He pointed out impeachment grew likely if Republicans felt Trump hurt their election chances. Lichtman emphasized to AM Joy, the first adage of politicians was to safeguard their careers. He commented to Mic and Newsweek the chance of impeachment grew after Comey's Senate Intelligence Committee testimony about his memos, and said the evidence was stronger than that in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Writing in The Hill Lichtman said that Paul Ryan's assertions that some of the president's actions could be excused because of ignorance or naivety were indefensible, and would not stand. On December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives impeached Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Neither were reasons for impeachment he cited in the book. The Senate acquitted Trump on February 5, 2020. ==See also== * Impeachment March * Trump: The Kremlin Candidate? ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * (video at YouTube) * * ==External links== * , dedicated website for book at www.thecaseforimpeachment.com * , by book publisher * Category:2017 in American politics Category:2017 non-fiction books Category:Books about United States legal history Category:Aftermath of the 2016 United States presidential election Category:American political books Category:Books about democracy Category:Books about politics of the United States Category:Books about the 2016 United States presidential election Category:Books by Allan Lichtman Category:Books about Donald Trump Category:Impeachment in the United States Category:Criticism of Donald Trump ","title":"The Case for Impeachment"},{"id":"54229791","text":"Gorna Banjica (, , ) is a village in the municipality of Gostivar, North Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 4423 inhabitants.

It was the 18th round of the 2001 CART FedEx Championship Series season. Gil de Ferran took his second win of the season for Team Penske after starting on pole position and leading every lap ahead of Dario Franchitti and Memo Gidley. de Ferran inherited the lead of the drivers' standings from Kenny Br√§ck by virtue of his win here and at the previous race at Rockingham, a lead he would not relinquish for the rest of the season. The difficult road course on the streets of Houston meant that little on-track passing could occur, and de Ferran's position throughout the race was rarely in jeopardy. Franchitti was one of the few that could muscle his way through the field despite being hit by H√©lio Castroneves at the start of the race, taking his third podium finish at Houston in four starts and his third podium of the season. Gidley, after starting 23rd, used pit strategy to move his way through the field and take his second podium of the season and his career. The race saw multiple incidents and crashes as drivers struggled around the temporary circuit. Alex Tagliani, despite running near the front for the entire race, crashed from 2nd place with just seven laps remaining. Oriol Servi√† and Michel Jourdain Jr. also crashed on Lap 37, with Servi√†'s car ending up on top of Jourdain's.

Jones, 109 U.S. 513 (1883), is an important decision by the United States Supreme Court which provides the power to take private property for public uses, in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, to the government of the United States. However, once the government exercises of the right of eminent domain and after a fair determination of the amount of compensation, any unforeseen damage to the property as a result of activities prior to the purchase but realized only afterwards is to be compensated by the government per any legislative decree.United States v. Jones, . ==Background== In the mid-1800s, there were efforts to establish a navigable shipping route between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. One of those efforts was to improve navigation on the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers and in constructing a canal to unite the rivers. In 1846, the United States government ceded land to the State of Wisconsin for the purpose of implementing this plan. The project was awarded to a corporation known as the Green Bay and Mississippi Canal Company. There were several delays in the project and construction of several of the dams were plagued with issues. In 1870, the government had grown weary of the delays and, in July, 1870, the United States Congress passed an act \\"for the improvement of water communication between the Mississippi River and Lake Michigan by the Wisconsin and Fox Rivers;\\" which authorized the government to exercise of the right of eminent domain to take back the property ceded in 1846, and any other property necessary to complete the project.United States v. Jones, 109 U.S. at 514. The amount of compensation for the land to be claimed by its eminent domain was determined and the property became the property of the US government in 1872. After 1872, severe floods destroyed property on lands which had not been claimed by the US government. These floods were a result of the construction of dams by the Green Bay and Mississippi Canal Company prior to United States ascertaining the property. The property owners sued the United States government for damages caused by the floods and the case was heard in Wisconsin state courts.United States v. Jones, 109 U.S. at 515-17. The case was set for a jury trial. The United States objected to the case claiming the state court had no jurisdiction to try a cause in which the United States were a party. These objections were overruled and the trial resulted in a verdict for the property owners for $10,000.United States v. Jones, 109 U.S. at 517-518. The government appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, where the verdict was affirmed. Following the decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the US government appealed to the United States Supreme Court. ==Decision== The case was submitted to the United States Supreme Court on October 11th, 1883 and Justice Stephen Johnson Field delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court which affirmed the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The Court based its opinion on a bill which was passed by Congress and approved on March 3rd, 1875 which provides that the value of any property ascertained through the right of eminent domain will be determined by the laws of the State wherein the property lay. The provisions of the act of 1875, with reference to the property overflowed by dams constructed in the improvement of the navigation of Fox and Wisconsin rivers, that the compensation to be made shall be ascertained in the mode and manner prescribed by the laws of the State, and constitute a sufficient waiver of the United States general immunity of process. Thus, the Court determined that the US government must provide compensation according to the laws of Wisconsin.United States v. Jones, 109 U.S. at 520-521. In 1874, the Wisconsin Legislature passed a law providing for ascertaining the compensation to be made for damages caused to lands by their being overflowed or otherwise injured or taken by the United States. This Wisconsin law provides that the US government is liable for any damages resulting from the property. The Court determined that this law applied to the US government. Therefore, the Court determined that the proceeding in the Wisconsin state courts were valid and upheld the verdict by the jury which awarded the property owners compensation from the US government. ==Significance== Federal Courts have cited the Jones decision in over 600 decisions as a guideline on applying the US government power and obligation under the Fifth Amendment to take private property for public uses, generally termed the right of eminent domain. It has also been cited to stress a common lesson, caveat emptor or ‚Äúlet the buyer beware‚Äù, even when the government is the buyer. The Fox‚ÄìWisconsin Waterway was completed in 1876, but after the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. As the Illinois and Michigan Canal became the primary passageway between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River, use of the Fox‚ÄìWisconsin Waterway was never substantial and it slowly died out, and by 1951, the passage was closed. == References External links== * Category:1883 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Waite Court Category:Fox‚ÄìWisconsin Waterway Category:Takings Clause case law Category:United States federal jurisdiction case law ","title":"United States v.

On 5 February 2014 he became a member of the Parliament of Wallonia following the death of Damien Yzerbyt. == Life == Idesbald Cauchie was born in Schaerbeek in north- central Brussels but grew up in the countryside. He trained and qualified as a vet after which, in 1975, he moved to Ellezelles, a small town in the countryside across the Franco-Belgian border to the east of Lille. He has worked for more than thirty years as a rural vet in the Wallon province of Hainaut. Following the example of his wife, he became a member of the local council in Ellezelles in 2000 as a representative of the centrist Humanist Democratic Centre (\\"Centre d√©mocrate humaniste\\" / cdH) party. Since 2006 he has been the mayor of Ellezelles, which in administrative terms is a grouping of rural parishes with a total population of approximately 6,000 people. He retained his mayoral post at the 2012 elections. In the regional elections of 2009 he was the first reserve candidate for the Tournai-Ath-Mouscron. In February 2014 Damien Yzerbyt, who had been elected to the assembly, died of pancreatic cancer and Idesbald Cauchie took on the position, taking Yzerbyt's seat in the Wallon parliament and on the parliamentary committees on which he had served. In the scheduled regional elections of May 2014 Cauchie's name appeared on the party list, but not high enough up on it for him to secure re- election. == Personal == An interviewer in 2014 pointed out to him that Cauchie had come to politics rather late in life. He replied wryly, \\"my wife stood [in the local elections] twice before I tried it.

On 12 June, the Syrian Army sent technicals, anti-aircraft guns and artillery pieces mounted on trucks to the area.VIDEO: Syrian Army sends nearly 100 military vehicles to defeat ISIS in eastern Hama Four days later, government forces restarted the offensive, capturing the large hilltop of Tal Dabbart Debah and then shifting their attention to the Aqareb Dam.Syrian Army advances against ISIL in east Hama During 18 June, the Army captured four villages north of Uqayribat, along the road between Ithriya and Al-Saan.Syrian Civil War Map On 13 July, Desert Hawks alongside NDF and Liwa al-Quds secured villages of Um Tuwaynah, al- Hardaneh and al-Qatshiyah, south of Salamiyah-Ithriyah road, thus securing the supply line to Aleppo city. ==References== Category:Conflicts in 2017 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Russia Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2017 Category:June 2017 events in Syria Category:Hama ","title":"East Hama offensive (2017)"},{"id":"54229946","text":"HomePod is a smart speaker developed by Apple Inc. Designed to accompany other Apple devices such as the iPhone and Mac, the HomePod is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service.Apple inc. HomePod - Apple. Retrieved 2 February 2019 It is sold alongside the smaller and lower-priced HomePod Mini. The original HomePod was announced on 5 June 2017, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, its launch was later delayed from December 2017 to early 2018. Apple began taking orders on 26 January 2018, and formally released it on 9 February that year. It incorporates beamforming and eight speakers and is sold in two colors: White and Space Gray. The original HomePod received mixed reviews: it was praised for its design and sound quality compared to other speakers of its price, and criticized for lack of third- party support and high price compared to other smart speakers. Additionally, the silicone base on the bottom of the device was found to occasionally damage wooden surfaces. As of August 2018, the HomePod had sold an estimated 1 to 3 million units. == Overview == Specifications The HomePod has a rounded, cylindrical shape, and has a small touchscreen on its top. It has seven tweeters in its base and a four-inch woofer (Apple does not specify Hz frequency range) towards the top, as well as six microphones used for voice control and acoustic optimization. The system-on-a-chip is the Apple A8, which Apple previously included in the Apple TV HD and iPhone 6. Siri can be used to control the speaker and other HomeKit devices, and can be used to conduct text messaging and voice calls from an iPhone. The HomePod mainly supports Apple's own platforms and technologies, including Apple Music, iTunes Store purchases and Match, iTunes podcasts, Beats 1 radio, and AirPlay (with limited third- party support for internet radio services iHeartRadio, Radio.com, and TuneIn coming in the fall of 2019), while an iOS 11 device is required for initial setup. HomePod can serve as a sound bar within a home entertainment system when selected through an Apple TV. The HomePod does not officially support audio-in from Bluetooth sources. Andrew Faden has developed a solution he calls \\"BabelPod\\" to allow line in and Bluetooth input to the HomePod through the use of a Raspberry Pi. AirPlay 2 and multi-room, multi-speaker support were announced in February 2018, and released in September 2018 in iOS 12 along with additional features such as multiple named timers, Find my iPhone, Siri shortcuts, the ability to make, receive and screen phone calls directly on the HomePod, and the ability to search for songs using the lyrics. HomePod initially lacked support for allowing multiple users to use the device, but multi user support was eventually added with the release of iOS 13.2 https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204753 The 13.4 software update, released in March 2020, updated the OS from an iOS code base to a tvOS based system. Greenhouse gas emissions for production, expected use and recycling for the HomePod are estimated at 146 kg CO2e.  Reception  The HomePod received mixed reviews. The review from The Verge praised the HomePod's automatic acoustic calibration system, and felt that it sounded \\"noticeably richer and fuller\\" than competitors such as the Sonos One (described as sounding \\"a little empty\\") and Google Home Max (described as being a \\"bass-heavy mess\\"). The review from Ars Technica stated that the sound quality of the HomePod was \\"pretty good, rich and full for its size, better than the Sonos One but probably not $150 better, [and] a galaxy ahead of the Echo.\\" Its lack of support for third-party services and platforms was criticized, with Ars Technica arguing that it gave the device \\"intense inflexibility\\". Siri on the HomePod was also criticized for its limited functionality in comparison to assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant; The Verge cited the inability to actually place phone calls from the speaker (they must be made on an iPhone and transferred to the HomePod), set multiple timers at once, or distinguish between multiple voices, and only supporting basic commands when using AirPlay, among other limitations. Multiple reminders can be used in lieu of multiple timers, albeit with less precision than a timer. All these issues have been fixed in iOS 12, released on 17 September 2018. The Verge gave HomePod a 7.5 out of 10, writing that it \\"does more to make music sound better than any other speaker of this kind has ever done before\\", but that consumers should consider other options \\"unless you live entirely inside Apple's walled garden and prioritize sound quality over everything else.\\" Wired shared similar criticisms over its lack of Siri functionality and support for third- party services, concluding that the HomePod would be of little interest to those who are not heavily invested in Apple's software and hardware ecosystem. It was reported by some owners that the HomePod's silicone base stained oiled wooden surfaces with a white \\"ring\\" mark. Although Apple states that \\"it is not unusual for any speaker with a vibration-dampening silicone base to leave mild marks when placed on some wooden surfaces\\", and that the marks would eventually \\"improve\\" on its own, Stuart Miles (founder of the British technology blog Pocket-lint) reported that in his experience, the stain occurred after only about 20 minutes of use on a wooden surface, and that he had to sand and re-oil the surface to remove it. John Gruber criticized Apple for this abnormality, remarking that he had never seen an Apple product damage surfaces in such a manner before, and that it \\"seems like an issue that should have been caught during the period where HomePod was being widely tested at home by many Apple employees.\\"  Sales  Strategy Analytics estimated that 600,000 HomePods were sold in first quarter of 2018, making Apple the fourth best selling smart speaker brand after Amazon, Google and Alibaba, giving Apple a 6% market share in the industry. The HomePod also has 6% market share in the United States according to a report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners and sold an estimated 700,000 units worldwide in the second quarter of 2018. Also in the second quarter of 2018, Strategy Analytics estimated that the HomePod outsold all smart speakers that cost more than $200, giving Apple a 70% market share in premium brand smart speakers. As of mid 2018, the HomePod had sold an estimated 3 million units. Sales increased 45% in Q4 2018, with Apple selling 1.6 million units that quarter. In April 2019, Apple reduced the price to USD $299. ==See also== *Apple speakers ==References External links == * * Apple press release Category:Apple Inc. hardware Category:Products introduced in 2017 Category:Smart speakers ","title":"HomePod"},{"id":"54229950","text":"J√©r√©my Villeneuve (born 25 April 1994) is a footballer who plays for French club Le Puy, as a midfielder.

It was founded on April 27, 2015, in Spain, by Alvaro Luna of Madrid and Tono Brusola of Valencia. Through its online platform, investors choose where, when, and how much to invest into Spanish real estate opportunities recommended by experts. ==History== In 2008, the Spanish real estate bubble popped, and prices dropped by some 40%. Prices eventually began to level out again in 2014. Around that time, Luna and Brusola began looking for investment opportunities. However, at this time, foreign investors dominated Spanish commercial real estate opportunities. Of the ‚Ç¨ 10.2 billion invested in Spanish commercial real estate in 2014, half came from foreign investors. This made it more difficult for smaller, local investors to get into the market. Luna and Brusola found that most of their investors were able to contribute only a small amount. \\"We said, 'To do this we really should have a crowdfunding site. How weird that there isn't one,'\\" recalled Brusola in a 2015 article. Housers' first two investment opportunities offered the week the company opened were an apartment in Madrid and a storefront in Valencia. Crowdfunders were required to invest at least ‚Ç¨ 500 to participate. In September 2015, Housers acquired its first apartment. This was the first real estate purchase in Spain ever to be purchased entirely through crowdfunding. 49 crowdfunders bought the apartment for a total of ‚Ç¨ 62,000, an average of about ‚Ç¨ 1,265 ($1,427) each. They spent an additional ‚Ç¨ 80,500 (about USD ‚Ç¨ 1,642 each) for taxes and renovations. The crowdfunders planned to rent the apartment for ‚Ç¨ 450 per month, splitting profits based on investments. Housers anticipated a total gross return of 67.8%, or ‚Ç¨ 33,123, over five years, on this first property. ==Growth== Since its inception in 2015, Housers has grown to employ 42 individuals in nine different departments. Though created and based in Madrid, Spain, Housers is now present in Milan, Italy and Lisbon, Portugal. A 2015 article credited Housers with \\"helping to get the Spanish real estate market back on its feet, using crowdfunding from everyday people.\\" In 2017, Housers became the first real estate crowdfunding company in Spain to be authorized by the Comisi√≥n Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), a government regulating agency similar to the United States' Securities and Exchange Commission. Services Housers handles the legal and administrative aspects of investment and advertises that \\"you can make the most of your money from your home's sofa.\\" One review summarized the business thus: \\"From as little as ‚Ç¨ 50, Housers crowdfunding platform can create and manage your own property portfolio with 'interesting' results.\\" Investors' contributions are safeguarded by a private financial institution, and can be withdrawn at any time. As of May 2017, Housers had about 43,000 crowdfunders. About 65% of these investors decide to diversify their investments by contributing to other Housers projects. Properties Since its inception, Housers has raised almost 23 million euros for collective financing of 94 properties: * 73 in Madrid * 9 in Barcelona * 7 in Valencia * 2 in Palma de Mallorca * 1 in Marbella * 1 in Sevilla * 1 in Meco, Spain Housers \\"expects to exceed 160,000 users and reach 90 million euros of collective financing for the acquisition of 300 properties in Spain, for subsequent rental and sale,\\" according to one article. ==Opportunities== Housers offers three types of crowdfunding opportunities: Buy-to-Sell opportunities When crowdfunders raise the sale price for the property, they buy it. They must keep their investment until the sale price is raised and the property is sold. When they sell the property, each of the crowdfunders gets their investment back. Saving opportunities Crowdfunders each buy a portion of the property and get a monthly income check. The property is not sold right away. It also does not have a fixed sale price. Instead, it is treated as a longer source of savings income. The crowdfunders decide when they want to sell the property. Sales opportunities Crowdfunders purchase social shares of the real estate company investing in the property. They must keep their investment until the sale price is raised and the property is sold. Once the property is sold, the crowdfunders get a share back. Accessibility Proponents of crowdfunding say that it \\"evens the playing field and offers regular people a ticket to a profitable investment class from which they were once barred.\\" Rodrigo Ni√±o, a Colombian developer who developed one of the first real estate crowdfunding projects, described the benefits thusly: Economic market Many of Housers' properties are in Barcelona and Madrid, which have been described as \\"key investment hubs.\\" Barcelona, in particular, was a hotspot of real estate investment during 2016. A 2015 guide explains Spain's unique advantages to investors: Additionally, as of 2015, the Spanish market featured both \\"rock-bottom prices\\" and strong economic growth potential, making it a promising environment for real estate crowdfunding. Returns Brusola claims that some of Housers' properties return a 60% 70% investment over four years: \\"These are small but very profitable deals.\\" ==Requirements== Crowdfunders must have both: * A monthly income to invest; and * A real asset to use as collateral. There is no cost to join Housers and no membership fee, though investors do pay a 12.5% fee on the profits they earn. Membership is open to any individual of legal age, either from Spain or a foreign country; and to legal entities registered in Spain. Participants must invest at least ‚Ç¨ 50 per investment opportunity. Most participants can invest as much as they choose in a given opportunity. The organization's \\"accredited investors\\" their wealthiest, most aggressive investors may spend no more than ‚Ç¨ 3,000 per project, or ‚Ç¨ 10,000 in 12 months. ==Criticisms== Real estate crowdfunding has its critics. For example, real estate developer Lane Auten opines: When Housers performed an equity raise via Crowdcube in 2017, multiple investors draw criticism to the company's valuation suggesting that it was too high. ==External links== * Housers: Funding and organizational details * Housers Italy: Organizational details ==References== Category:Real estate companies of Spain ","title":"Housers"},{"id":"54230000","text":"Reƒçane (, ) is a village in the municipality of Gostivar, North Macedonia. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 1054 inhabitants.

It was released on December 14, 2017. It is one of four desktop computers in the current Macintosh lineup, sitting above the consumer range Mac Mini and iMac, and serves as an all-in-one alternative to the Mac Pro. ==Overview== The iMac Pro was introduced at WWDC on June 5, 2017 and was released in December 2017. Apple billed it as \\"the most powerful Mac ever made\\". Its starting price is $4999. It includes an 8-, 10-, 14-, or 18-core Intel Xeon processor, 5K display, AMD Vega graphics, ECC memory, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet. It includes a custom Apple T2 chip to store encrypted keys, and a custom version of macOS that allows the user to lock down the booting process. On March 19, 2019, options for 256 GBIn this article the unit symbol 'GB' is used to mean 1024^3 bytes (1 GiB) of memory and a Vega 64X GPU were added. On August 4, 2020, Apple discontinued the 8-core model and made the 10-core model, previously an upgrade option, the base model. Design The iMac Pro's chassis is carried over from the 27-inch iMac introduced in 2012 but is only available in a darker \\"space gray\\" finish. Unlike the white accessories that come with the iMac, the iMac Pro comes with a black Magic Keyboard with a numeric keypad, and a black Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad. Repairability The processor, memory, and storage are not soldered and can be removed. Unlike the 27-inch iMac, the iMac Pro does not have a memory access port, though memory can be upgraded by Apple Stores and authorized service providers. User replacement of memory is possible as it is not soldered, though it requires disassembling the display and voids the warranty. The iMac Pro is the first model to be equipped with Apple's T2 co- processor. This results in a non-user-replaceable solid state drive as the SSD modules are paired cryptographically with the T2 chip, even though the SSD is not soldered on the motherboard like many MacBook models. It theoretically can be replaced as it is possible to remove it, although doing so requires an extensive disassembly, and only some drives are compatible. The iMac Pro's stand is user-replaceable with a VESA mount kit sold by Apple. The mount uses zinc screws that may be prone to breaking. Although the VESA adapter is branded as an Apple product, it is actually a licensed OEM product and Apple does not provide support for it.

Shot from a low angle, the photograph depicts three Israeli paratroopers framed against the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem, shortly after its recapture by Israeli forces in the Six-Day War. From left to right, the Israeli soldiers photographed are Zion Karasenti, Yitzhak Yifat, and Haim Oshri.Yossi Klein Halevi, \\"The Photograph: A Search for June 1967\\", Azure (Summer 2007) The soldiers were reservists of the 66th Battalion, 55th Paratroopers Brigade. Prior to taking the photograph, Israeli photographer and photojournalist Rubinger had been at el-Arish on the Sinai Peninsula when he heard a rumor that something big was going to happen in Jerusalem. He hopped aboard a helicopter ferrying wounded soldiers to Beersheba, although he did not know its destination at the time. His car happened to be there, and he drove the rest of the way, at one point asking a hitchhiking soldier he had picked up to drive because he was too sleepy. He arrived in the Old City and after visiting quickly with his family, made his way to the wall. The space between the wall and the buildings in front of it was very narrow, so he lay down to get a shot of the wall itself, when the paratroopers walked by and he took several shots of them. Twenty minutes later, IDF Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren arrived on scene with a shofar and a Torah scroll, whereupon Goren was hoisted upon the shoulders of the soldiers. It was an emotional scene and Rubinger by far preferred that one, though his wife Anni told him \\"the one of the three soldiers\\" was better. As part of his agreement with the Israeli Army allowing him front-line access, he turned the negatives over to the government, who distributed it to everyone for a mere I¬£2 each. It was then widely pirated as well. Although Rubinger was upset about his work being stolen, the photo's widespread distribution made it famous. The image engenders such a strong emotional component that it has become an icon of Israel. Israeli Supreme Court Justice Misha'el Kheshin declared in 2001 that the photo had \\"become the property of the entire nation\\". ==References== Category:1967 in art Category:Six-Day War Category:Black-and-white photographs Category:Western Wall Category:Military history of Jerusalem Category:1967 photographs Category:1960s in Jerusalem Category:People notable for being the subject of a specific photograph ","title":"Paratroopers at the Western Wall"},{"id":"54230097","text":"The Midway Service Station at 38797 U.S. Highway 70 in Kenna in Roosevelt County, New Mexico, was built in 1938.

Ana began performing at the age of eight years old when she participated in the TV show T√∫ s√≠ que vales. Despite her young age, she managed to go to the final and to create her own fan base. At the age of nine, Ana became part of the TV show Gjeniu i vog√´l. In addition to that, she won the second prize at the National Children's Festival in Shkod√´r. Ana participated in the second series of The Voice Kids Albania where she gave a very impressive and confident performance in the Blind Auditions of the song Evil Like Me from the Disney movie, Descendants. All judges turned their chair, and she picked Miriam Cani as her coach. She finished in the top 6. In 2019, she auditioned for Britain's Got Talent. Don't Touch My Tree \\"Don't Touch My Tree\\" (originally Mos ma prekni pem√´n) is a song performed by Albanian child singer Ana Kodra. It represented Albania in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2017. ==At Junior Eurovision== During the opening ceremony and the running order draw which took place on 20 November 2017, Albania was drawn to perform tenth on 26 November 2017, following Georgia and preceding Ukraine. Voting The results of the 2017 Junior Eurovision Song Contest were determined by national juries and an online audience vote. Every country had a national jury that consisted of three music industry professionals and two kids aged between 10 and 15 who are citizens of the country they represent. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The first phase of the online voting started on 24 November 2017 when a recap of all the rehearsal performances was shown on junioreurovision.tv before the viewers could vote. After this, voters also had the option to watch longer one-minute clips from each participant's rehearsal. This first round of voting stopped on Sunday, 26 November, at 15:59 CET. The second phase of the online voting took place during the live show and started right after the last performance and was open for 15 minutes. International viewers could vote for a minimum of three countries and a maximum of five. They could also vote for their own country's song. These votes were then turned into points. The number of points was determined by the percentage of votes received. For example, if a song received 20% of the votes, thus it would receive 20% of the available points. The public vote counted for 50% of the final result, while the other 50% came from the professional juries.

It is a systematic, consequence- driven approach that is based upon industry standards such as ISA 62443-3-2, ISA TR84.00.09, ISO/IEC 27005:2018, ISO 31000:2009 and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-39. The name, cyber PHA, was given to this method because it is similar to the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) or the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) methodology that is popular in process safety management, particularly in industries that operate highly hazardous industrial processes (e.g. oil and gas, chemical, etc.). The Cyber PHA methodology reconciles the process safety and cybersecurity approaches and allows IT, Operations and Engineering to collaborate in way that is already familiar to facility operations management and personnel. Modeled on the process safety PHA/HAZOP methodology, a cyber PHA enables cyber risks to be identified and analyzed in the same manner as any other process risk, and, because it can be conducted as a separate follow-on activity to a traditional HAZOP it can be used in both existing brownfield sites and newly constructed greenfield sites without unduly meddling with well established process safety processes.2018 AIChE Spring Meeting and Global Congress on Process Safety Proceedings The method is typically conducted as a workshop that includes a facilitator and a scribe with expertise in the cyber PHA process as well as multiple subject matter experts who are familiar with the industrial process, the industrial automation and control system (IACS) and related IT systems. For example, the workshop team typically includes representatives from operations, engineering, IT and health and safety as well as an independent facilitator and scribe. A multidisciplinary team is important in developing realistic threat scenarios, assessing the impact of compromise and achieving consensus on realistic likelihood values given the threat environment, the known vulnerabilities and existing countermeasures. The facilitator and scribe are typically responsible for gathering and organizing all of the information required to conduct the workshop (e.g. system architecture diagrams, vulnerability assessments, and PHAs) and training the workshop team on the method, if necessary. A worksheet is commonly used to document the cyber PHA assessment. Various spreadsheet templates, databases and commercial software tools have been developed to support the cyber PHA method. The organization‚Äôs risk matrix is typically integrated directly into the worksheet to facilitate assessment of severity and likelihood and to look up the resulting risk score. The workshop facilitator guides the team through the process and strives to gather all input, reach consensus and keep the process proceeding smoothly. The workshop proceeds until all zone and conduits have been assessed. The results are then consolidated and reported to the workshop team and appropriate stakeholders. == References  External links == * Safety requires cybersecurity * Security process hazard analysis review * Integrating ICS Cybersecurity with PSM * Cyber Security Risk Analysis for Process Control Systems Using Rings of Protection Analysis * aeCyberPHA Risk Assessment Methodology * Building Cybersecurity into a Greenfield ICS Project * Intro to Cyber PHA * Video: Cyber Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) to Assess ICS Cybersecurity Risk presentation at S4x17 * Video: Consequence Based ICS Risk Management presentation at S4x19 * Unsolicited Response Podcast * Cyber PHA for SIS Security * How Secure are your Process Safety Systems? * Process Safety & Cybersecurity * Securing ICS * Safety Requires Cybersecurity * The Familial Relationship between Cybersecurity and Safety * Cybersecurity Depends on Up-to-Date Intelligence * Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Category:Impact assessment Category:Evaluation methods Category:Risk analysis methodologies ","title":"Cyber PHA"},{"id":"54230170","text":" Claudine was launched at Calcutta in 1811. She made two voyages transporting convicts to Van Diemen's Land in 1821 and New South Wales in 1829. In between, she made one voyage under charter to the British East India Company (EIC). Her captain deliberately grounded her in November 1840 to survive a storm, but she was able to return to service. She was broken up in 1849. ==Career== Claudine initially traded as a country ship and then to India under a license from the EIC. Later she became a free trader. In 1814 Claudine was admitted to the Registry of Great Britain.Naval Chronicle, Vol.33, p.400. On 2 November 1815 Claudine, Welch, master, and Juliana, Horblow, master, sailed from Batavia. They were at Anjer Roads on 10 November, with Claudine having run on a coral reef the day after leaving Batavia. The two vessels narrowly escaped being wrecked on \\"Pulo Bahec\\", but escaped with minimal loss. They then separated after transiting the Sunda Strait. Claudine put into the Cape on 24 December, leaving on the 26th. She rejoined Juliana on 7 January 1816, and touched St Helena the next day; the two vessels finally parted at Ascension Island. On 9 February Claudine ran into bad weather 35 leagues off St Michael's Mount. At 8:43 pm on 10 February Claudine experienced an earthquake that lasted four or five seconds; the crew had to jettison some cargo to stay afloat in the subsequent waves. Claudine and Juliana arrived in the Downs shortly thereafter.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5052. Claudine sailed on to Antwerp, where she grounded at Lillo. She was gotten off without major damage.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5055. On 12 April 1817 Claudine struck a reef near Palau Mansalar (), off the west coast of Sumatra.India Directory (1836), p.78. Then in September 1818, Claudine pioneered the northern route through the Torres Strait as she sailed from Port Jackson to Batavia.India Directory (1838), p.676. Van Diemen's Land and Port Jackson Claudine made a trading voyage in 1820 from London to Hobart and then Sydney. She sailed from Sydney on 10 May 1820 under the command of Captain John Welsh. He discovered Claudine's Reef in the Coral Sea ().India Directory (1838), p.670. On 16 May he navigated Elizabeth's Reef ().India Directory (1838), pp.668-9. He then sailed past Murray Island, Queensland, in the Torres Strait on the way to Batavia. From Batavia she returned to England. Convict voyage to Van Diemen's Land (1821) Captain John Crabtree sailed Claudine on 24 August 1821 from Woolwich. She sailed via Tenerife and Rio de Janeiro to Hobart Town, arriving on 15 December. She embarked 160 convicts, one of whom died on the voyage. EIC voyage (1824-5) Captain George Nichols sailed from the Downs on 16 June 1824, bound for Bengal. Claudine arrived at Calcutta on 23 October. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 2 January 1825. She reached Madras on 26 January and St Helena on 12 April. She arrived at East India Dock on 5 June.British Library: Claudine. Her owners registered Claudine in London on 18 January 1826.

Convict voyage to Sydney (1829) Captain William Heathorn sailed Claudine from London on 24 August 1829, and she arrived at Sydney on 6 December. Captain Patterson and 26 rank-and-file of the 63rd Regiment of Foot provided the guard. She embarked 180 convicts, two of whom died on the voyage. Claudine then sailed to Madras on 31 December. ==Later career and fate== Claudine and Westminster ashore near Margate; Claudine is in the foreground. Artist:William Henry Bartlett A storm on 21‚Äì22 November 1840 led Captain Brewer to beach Claudine ashore near Ramsgate. The captain of Westminster did likewise. The two vessels were unloaded of their cargo and then refloated some weeks later. Both returned to service after repairs. Claudine was repaired in 1840 and Lloyd's Register notes that damage was repaired and references \\"Margate\\". At the time of the grounding her owner was still Heathorne.

Despite their name, they had a dangerous reputation and are regarded by many historians as some of the most fearsome roller coasters ever built. ==Characteristics and design== Patent for Traver's Cyclone coaster design. Note the undulating track diagrammed in lower section of diagram. Robert Cartmell described Traver's coasters as embodying \\"the reckless spirit of the 1920s\\". They were built with fully steel frames which had laminated wood and steel tracks. Wood was laminated between 6 and 9 boards thick, depending on the coaster. The steel frames were fabricated in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and then shipped by rail to their building sites. The building sites were typically on level ground, and in many cases were by beaches or piers. The main exception, The Palisades Cyclone, suffered increased maintenance problems as a result. The laminated wood also had problems with moisture at many locations. The geometry of Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters was extreme compared to other roller coasters of the time period. The coasters featured very tight turns, spirals, and figure eights. These elements drew inspiration from the swoops and spirals of earlier Prior and Church roller coasters like The Bobs. Curves on Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters were often banked to much steeper angles, with some approaching 85 degrees. Beyond the many curves, another element common to the steel-framed Traver coasters were undulating \\"jazz tracks\\", meaning that Traver's Cyclones had almost no straight track in their entire course. ==Marketing== The benefits of a steel- framed structure was one of the biggest selling points which was put forward by the Traver Engineering Company. Quicker (and therefore less costly) set-up times were one promoted aspect of the all-steel frames. A resistance to fire and rot were other advantages over wood that were advertised for Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters. Despite the advertisement of low maintenance costs, however, these coasters were actually quite demanding on a maintenance crew. What little wood there was experienced moisture problems, and the coasters were not wholly invulnerable to fire either. The Palisades Park Cyclone, for example, was damaged when the wooden track on the coaster partially burned. ==Examples and related coasters== Predecessors and prototypes The model line of Jazz Railways (built at Rocky Glen Park and other locations) was marketed by Traver as the first roller coaster to utilize a completely steel frame. Its stretches of rapidly undulating track were also an innovative feature that saw use in the later Traver Cyclones. The next step towards the Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters was the Sesquicentennial Cyclone at the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia (and several other later locations). The installations of this coaster used the steel frame design introduced with the Jazz Railway, but began to add in the extreme elements which were characteristic of the \\"Terrifying Triplets\\" and the Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters more generally. The main difference was the scale. The Sesquicentennial Cyclone was larger than the Jazz Railways, but smaller than the \\"Terrifying Triplets\\". The Terrifying Triplets The Terrifying Triplets was a nickname given to three roller coasters which were opened or built by Traver in 1927. The Crystal Beach Cyclone was the first coaster to open, followed by the Revere Beach Lightning and then the Palisades Cyclone. Each coaster had the characteristic steel-frame structure with wood-laminated steel track which was typical of Traver-designed coasters. The rides were comparatively short in duration but notorious for their lack of straight track. Their trains had five 4-seat cars, which differed from the ten 2-seat cars of the Sesquicentennial Cyclone.. These heavier cars are also thought to have exacerbated maintenance problems on the Terrifying Triplets. Other Giant Cyclones The least well known Giant Cyclone Safety Coaster was the Zip at Oaks Amusement Park in Portland, Oregon. The Zip was a compact version of the \\"Terrifying Triplets\\". The coaster opened the same year (1927) as Traver's other Cyclones, but the track length was shortened because of space concerns at the park; it also used shorter trains. ==References== Category:Wooden roller coasters Category:Roller coasters manufactured by Traver Engineering ","title":"Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters"},{"id":"54230193","text":"Clinton Emil \\"Clint\\" McElroy, Jr. ( , born August 10, 1955) is an American podcaster, comic book writer and former radio personality.

He was a member of National Hot Rod Association for sixty years. == Racing career == Bradley started racing in Southern California in 1946, competing on dirt tracks and in illegal street races, with a Deuce roadster. Ford.carstalks.com (retrieved 5 May 2017) His first dragster used Ford Model T frame rails and a Ford flathead V8; built in 1952, it hit a speed of . He set records beginning in 1956 and was still doing so until a few years ago. He recorded twenty-eight wins in Top Eliminator in 1956 alone. He drove the tube-chassised Gene's Brake Shop Special digger in 1961. Running on gasoline, Bradley would cheat, hiding nitro in the fuel line to pass scrutineering; nitro had been banned as unsafe for racing by NHRA in 1957. Track officials routinely tore down the carburetors and intake manifold, and tested the front-mounted fuel tank, without finding anything amiss. This car would take Bradley to 50 Top Eliminator titles and a number of track records during 1957 and 1958. At the Colton Dragster Invitational (Bradley's home track) in 1957, Bradley defeated Emory Cook (in the hemi-powered Cook and Bedwell digger). He lost in the semi-final at the NHRA Fuel and Gass Championship in Bakersfield, California, in 1959, but won that year's Southern California Championship, hosted by the Pomona Valley Timing Association. Bradley also drove a twin-engined car which used a pair of flattys, in a chassis welded up in Bradley's garage, built with the assistance of long-time partner Max Romero. This car ran 100% nitro, and turned in a pass of 8.98 seconds at . He campaigned this car from 1958 to 1962. Bradley used a high-gear-only transmission in all his dragsters, which resulted in bogging off the starting line when combined with the flathead's poor low-rpm torque. It was because of this he used the nitro. Unlike other racers, Bradley continued to campaign a flatty-powered digger, earning him the nickname \\"Mr. Flathead\\". Bradley retired from professional racing, but continued to run a 9-second flathead-powered exhibition car on California's nostalgia drag racing circuit into his late 70s. This car uses eight-plug billet aluminum cylinder heads Bradley designed himself. He was inducted into the International Drag Racing Hall of Fame in 1994. == Family == Bradley's wife, Jeanne, died in 1998. He had two children, Frank and Lori, and five grandchildren, Mona and Travis (from his son's marriage), and Nichole, Holly, Tige from his daughter's. Bradley is buried at Riverside National VA Cemetery, Riverside, California. ==Notes== Category:Dragster drivers Category:1925 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Sportspeople from San Bernardino, California Category:Racing drivers from California Category:American naval personnel of World War II ","title":"John Bradley (drag racer)"},{"id":"54230207","text":"Piombino, 24 August 1901, start from Porta a Terra Piombino‚ÄìLivorno was the first motor racing held in Tuscany, on August 24, 1901. ==History== This race involved the Committee of the Livornese Summer Party, the Municipality of Piombino, the Municipality of Livorno, the family Della Gherardesca, the family Ginori and the Touring Italian Club. This competition was supported by the Michelin pneumatic firm, which offered monetary prizes to winners; moreover, the King Vittorio Emanuele III from Savoia supported it as well by giving medals to the best racers. Originally, the race was supposed to take place between Grosseto and Livorno, an approximate distance of 150 km. But the road was impassable due to abundant precipitation, resulting in the track being reduced to 82 km by beginning the race at Piombino. The race was part of a great event, which lasted three days. On Saturday, August 24, 1901, the contestants raced from Piombino to Livorno on the ancient Via Aurelia for the \\"Gran Premio di Sua Maest√† il Re.\\" On Sunday, August 25, the plan predicted a parade to the Cisternone from Antignano to Livorno; whereas, on Monday August 26 competitors had conducted the short-distance race of 500 Meters from Antignano to San Jacopo, and a competition of ability at the circle of Ardenza. ==The race== The vehicles registered for the competition were divided into various categories: The first category included large vehicles weighing over 1000 kg, the second category included light vehicles weighing less than 1000 kg, the third category consisted of small vehicles weighing no more than 450 kg, the fourth category included tricycles, and the fifth category was reserved for motorcycles. The contestants raced in turn according to the following order: large vehicles, tricycles, light vehicles, small vehicles, and motorcycles. The starting times had all been anticipated several hours beforehand at 7:30 due to poor road conditions. Not a single motorcycle arrived at the finish line: Renzo Mazzoleni, who drove Ceirano 2 ¬º HP, had given up in Vada; whereas, Emanuele Rosselli, who used a Rosselli 2¬º HP, had given up as well shortly after the start because the road was impassable. The Piombino ‚Äì Livorno tournament had been the first event won by Fiat, as a result of the victory by novice racer Felice Nazzaro. His first victory was obtained while driving the Fiat 12 HP property race of Conte Camillo Della Gherardesca, making a record at 1:49:54 with an average of 44,77 km/h. Despite the poor weather, the competition was a great achievement. Even though the tram remained in service along the route, no accidents occurred during the race. ==Anecdotes== The Cotta‚ÄìMorandini duo signed up for the race with a Darracq while traveling from Torino to Livorno. The two had been arrested by RR. Carabinieri in La Spezia due to a telegram which ordered the arrest of the first driver, who was believed to be responsible for an accident. However, they were released just 10 hours later when another telegram made clear the true nature of the accident, but by that time they were already too late to proceed with the race.

He was in charge of the program at Minnesota‚ÄìDuluth before coaching at Moorhead High School for over thirty years. ==Career== Shercliffe played for Minnesota‚ÄìDuluth for three seasons in the early 1960s shortly after they elevated their program to the upper classification. he joined the staff at his alma mater as an assistant in 1967 and was promoted to head coach when Bill Selman accepted the position at Saint Louis. In his first three seasons behind the bench the Bulldogs produced middling records, hovering around the .500 mark. His fourth year saw the team post its first ever 20+ win season but followed it up with a horrible 10-24-4 record. The fact that he had gone 1-9 in conference tournament play over his five-year tenure also contributed to him leaving after the 1974‚Äì75 season. A year later Shercliffe was introduced as the new head coach at Moorhead High School. He remained at the position for ten years before turning control over to Terry Cullen but stayed on as an assistant for another 21 seasons. After retiring in 2007 Shercliffe resurfaced as an assistant with the Fargo Force in 2010, staying with the team for four seasons before retiring once more in 2014. ==Head coaching record== College ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Canadian ice hockey coaches Category:High school ice hockey coaches in the United States Category:Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey coaches Category:Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey players Category:United States Hockey League coaches Category:Ice hockey people from Saskatchewan Category:Sportspeople from Regina, Saskatchewan ","title":"Terry Shercliffe"},{"id":"54230216","text":"Gifford Hill is a small mountain chain in the Central New York Region of New York.

Only magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquakes appear on the list. Lower magnitude events are included if they have caused death, injury or damage. Events which occurred in remote areas will be excluded from the list as they wouldn't have generated significant media interest. All dates are listed according to UTC time. Maximum intensities are indicated on the Mercalli intensity scale and are sourced from United States Geological Survey (USGS) ShakeMap data. Activity generally was slightly below average with 14 events reaching magnitude 7 or greater. The largest event was off the coast of Portugal in February and measured 7.8. Other parts experiencing large events were Indonesia and Russia. The Americas had no events above magnitude 7 which is an uncommon occurrence. Of the 4,000 deaths from earthquakes two events dominated. Southeastern China had an earthquake of magnitude 5.7 in July which contributed 3,000 of the total.

Following In Boundlessness (1895), it features 77 poems, most of which were based upon the author's impressions of his 1896-1897 European journey which took him to Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain, where he read Russian poetry in Oxford.

The book, divided into several cycles, was constructed as if it were a musical composition, poems linked both rhythms and inner associations. It bore the first marks of Nietzschean motifs and heroes, notably the \\"Elemental Genius,\\" who transcends his own humanity in order to break free from all restrictions. Silence was praised by Prince Alexander Urusov who recognized it as a work of a great talent who was beginning to forge his very own, distinctive style in poetry.Makogonenko, Darya.

It was written in the days when the drama of the Fridtjof Nansen's Fram expedition (1893-1896) was in the focus of the world media's attention. Balmont saw the North Pole as a symbol of unattainable Absolute and Nansen's endeavor as an ultimate challenge of human spirit. The epigraph for the poem comes from Elena Blavatskaya's book Voice of Silence: \\"The Soul, before it starts to learn and dares to recollect, has to merge with Silent Voice and wait until Voice of Silence starts speaking to inner mind.\\"–ü—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ —á–µ–º –¥—É—à–∞ –Ω–∞–π–¥–µ—Ç –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∏–≥–∞—Ç—å –∏ –¥–µ—Ä–∑–Ω–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–∏–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ç—å, –æ–Ω–∞ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∞ —Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–∏—Ç—å—Å—è —Å –ë–µ–∑–º–æ–ª–≤–Ω—ã–º –ì–ª–∞–≥–æ–ª–æ–º, ‚Äî –∏ —Ç–æ–≥–¥–∞ –¥–ª—è –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–µ–≥–æ —Å–ª—É—Ö–∞ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å –ì–æ–ª–æ—Å –ú–æ–ª—á–∞–Ω–∏—è. * \\"Don Juan\\" (–î–æ–Ω –ñ—É–∞–Ω).

In 1723 Shipton was elected captain of Merry Christmas, and he subsequently captained ships such as Royal Fortune, York, and John and Mary. Forced to beach his vessel on western Cuba by pirate hunters, in early 1726 he was found ashore in his bed and presumed to have died shortly afterwards. ==History== Shipton was a crewman serving under notoriously cruel captain Edward Low, who had captured the merchant ship Merry Christmas in 1723. Rejoining briefly with George Lowther, who had once been Low's own captain, they took the Delight off the Guinea coast and gave it to Francis Spriggs to command. Two nights later Lowther and Spriggs abandoned Low. Shortly afterwards Low killed the ship's quartermaster while he slept, infuriating the crew. They placed Low and his supporters in a small French sloop they'd taken near Martinique and set them adrift. Shipton was then elected captain of Merry Christmas. By June 1724 Shipton and Merry Christmas returned to the Caribbean and rejoined forces with Spriggs onboard Delight. They put into a small island to careen, where Shipton burned Merry Christmas and transferred to the captured sloop Royal Fortune. After Spriggs and Shipton took several more vessels near Belize, Shipton transferred to the newly rearmed prize ship York. HMS Diamond, under commander James Windham, had heard rumors about Spriggs and Shipton's piracies and sailed to Belize to investigate. Drawing them out, Diamond fought both pirates in a desperate but inconclusive action in August 1724. The pair sailed north, taking ships off South Carolina before returning to the Bay of Honduras. Here Shipton took another vessel, John and Mary, forcing its crew to follow him back to Roat√°n. The prize crew mutinied, killing the pirates Shipton left on the prize and sailing back to Newport, Rhode Island, where they were tried and exonerated. After plundering several more vessels alongside Joseph Cooper, Shipton met Diamond once more, alongside HMS Spence, a captured Spanish ship manned by Diamonds crew. Spriggs managed to escape again, and Cooper blew himself up rather than face capture, but Shipton was forced to beach his vessel on western Cuba and flee inland with his remaining crew ‚Äì thought to number only 13 men, 9 white and 4 black. Diamond and Spence were still hunting them, and in early 1726 they found both Spriggs and Shipton ashore. The English vessels island-hopped, landing soldiers ashore who captured Shipton - found in his bed - and almost all of Spriggs' men. Shipton is presumed to have died shortly afterwards, though Spriggs may have gotten away. ==See also== * Philip Ashton, a sailor forced into service by Edward Low who later escaped and survived as a castaway for over a year.

It is primarily raised in the French Mediterranean countryside for lamb meat. ==Characteristics== The Rouge du Rossillon is of Algerian descent, and came to France in the 18th century, and was likely introduced to France via Spain. The Rouge du Rossillon is a medium fine-wool breed. The males typically weigh 75‚Äì100 kg and stand 75‚Äì90 cm tall, while ewes normally weigh around 55‚Äì65 kg and stand 65‚Äì75 cm tall. In terms of coloration, the Rouge du Rossillon typically has white wool with red colored head and legs. The sheep are extremely hardy, and are able to survive all year outside. They can also thrive at high temperatures, and can live in climates with temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius. However, they also do well in colder climates with scarce food supplies. ==Uses== The main use of the Rouge du Rossillon is meat. Traditionally, lamb meat has accounted for about 95% of income from raising Rouge du Rossillons. The lambs are usually sold when they are still fairly light, around 28‚Äì30 kg. Lambs sold when they are heavier are commonly considered to be too fatty and are not as desirable on the market. The rest of the income comes from wool sales They were historically milked, with the milk often being used for cheese production, but this is not common today. Rouge du Rossillon are not raised by transhumance, with herds mostly being sedentary. from mid-October to march the herds graze on residual plants left over from crop harvests. They are often raised alongside Lacaune sheep. ==Conservation status and efforts== Today, the Rouge du Roussillon is endangered, largely due to a general decline in livestock raising in its native region. There is an estimated world population remaining of around 5,900 reproductive females. However, there has been considerable improvement in recent years in terms of its population numbers. A 1974 study estimated its population at only 750 ewes and 25 rams. In 1981, national protection actions were implemented to protect the breed, and from 1994-2001 a conservation program was launched in Grand Causses regional natural park in France. == References == Category:Sheep breeds originating in France ","title":"Rouge du Roussillon"},{"id":"54230322","text":"The Cyprus School of Architecture (CYSOA) is private school of architecture located in Lemba near Paphos.

Her father, was the Director of the Mint of Finland. Her mother, Marie M√ºller (1837‚Äì1927), was German. Swedish was spoken at home. Her desire to become an artist received her family's wholehearted support.Riitta Konttinen s. 18‚Äì19 From 1880 to 1884, she initially attended the drawing school of the Finnish Art Association (now the Academy of Fine Arts), but also studied privately with Maria Wiik and attended classes in St.Petersburg from 1883 to 1885. She was briefly a student at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris on two occasions. She also made study trips to Spain and Italy with the money she earned copying old classics. Upon returning to Helsinki, she became an art teacher.Kaija Valkonen ‚Äì Elina Koivunen s. 96. Portrait by Hanna Pauli, 1885 Portrait of Juhani Aho, 1891 In 1890, she met the writer, Juhani Aho, at the studios of Anna Sahlst√©n. Soon, they were enamored of each other; attending concerts, going to the theater and taking trips into the countryside. In 1891, they were married, took their honeymoon in St. Petersburg, and settled in Ullanlinna.Kaija Valkonen ‚Äì Elina Koivunen s. 86.. She took the name Brofeldt rather than Aho because that was still her husband's legal name. Their home became a cultural meeting place that welcomed such notables as Jean Sibelius, Pekka Halonen, Arvid J√§rnefelt, Werner S√∂derhjelm. Albert Edelfelt, Axel Gall√©n and Eero J√§rnefelt.Kaija Valkonen ‚Äì Elina Koivunen s. 87. She was occasionally criticized for \\"masculine\\" habits such as smoking a pipe and wearing trousers. They also travelled about extensively until she became pregnant, then bought a home in Hausj√§rvi. Self-Portrait, 1890 Their first child, Heikki (who would later become a filmmaker) was born in 1895. Venny's younger sister, came to help with the housekeeping and Venny's recovery. But, soon, it became clear that a relationship was developing between her and Juhani. In 1896, Venny went to Berlin to study new methods in wallpaper design and was in no hurry to return, as she trusted them.Kaija Valkonen ‚Äì Elina Koivunen, s. 79. Eventually though, it became a crisis and Juhani took a trip to Paris to let the situation settle down. Tilly went to Switzerland \\"for her health\\". Juhani joined her there, but had already decided to continue his marriage. In 1900, their second son , who would also become a writer, was born. The triangle continued until 1902, when Tilly gave birth to Juhani's son, . Juhani set them up in J√§rvenp√§√§ and visited frequently. She set up a small nursing home to support herself. Apparently none of this was known to the rest of their family and friends until Antti published his autobiography in 1951. To add to their difficulties, in 1903 the Russian Governor-General, Nikolay Bobrikov had Juhani placed on the blacklist after his brother, , ran afoul of the censorship laws and had to flee the country. Facing the possibility of being sent to Siberia, they decided to leave Finland and, from 1903 to 1904, lived first in Tyrolia, then Venice and Florence. They returned to Helsinki after Bobrikov was assassinated.Kaija Valkonen ‚Äì Elina Koivunen s. 93. In 1907, Juhani had his name legally changed to Aho as a patriotic gesture. Venny chose to retain her hyphenated name. In 1910, she and Juhani collaborated on a picture book for children. He began spending much of his time in Tuscany while she remained in Helsinki. After his death in 1921, she began travelling, often as a representative of his sons' photography and filmmaking company, Aho & Soldan. Painting outdoors in the 1930s When the was completed in 1933, she became its honorary spokesperson. During the Winter War, she moved to a cottage in Lohja, where she died in 1945. Just before her death, she burned all the correspondence between Juhani and Tilly, who had died in 1931.

He was a much loved public figure, especially in Cork, where he is commemorated by the Berwick Fountain on the Grand Parade in Cork city. He presided over the official inquiry into the Dolly's Brae conflict in 1849. ==Early life== He was born in Leixlip, County Kildare, younger son of the Reverend Edward Berwick (1750-1820), vicar of Leixlip, by his first wife Anne Bermingham of Monkstown, County Dublin. His mother died shortly afterthe his birth. Two years later his father remarried Rebecca Shuldham, daughter of Pooley Shuldham, of Ballymulvey, County Longford and had at least two more children, Elizabeth Mary Berwick (died 1868) and Edward Berwick, President of Queen's College, Galway, from 1849 to 1877. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and was Treasurer of the Trinity College Historical Society from 1823 to 1831. He entered Gray's Inn in 1823, was called to the Irish Bar in 1826 and became Queen's Counsel in 1840. He became Third Serjeant in 1855 and Second Serjeant in 1858. He became a Bencher of the King's Inn in 1856. ==Battle of Dolly's Brae== Dolly's Brae, the site of serious civil unrest in 1849, which prompted an official inquiry chaired by Walter Berwick On 12 July 1849, the long-standing tensions between the Orange Order and the local Roman Catholic community in south County Down erupted into a skirmish , following an Orange Order march at Dolly's Brae, near Rathfriland, in which several people were killed (the official count was about thirty deaths, though this figure has been disputed). The incident is generally called the Dolly's Brae conflict, or the Battle of Dolly's Brae. The public outcry over the deaths led to the establishment of a Government inquiry which Berwick chaired. His report was highly critical of the local magistrates, especially Lord Roden, for failing to prevent the violence. As a result three magistrates, including Roden, were removed from the Bench. The inquiry also led to the enactment of the Party Processions Act 1850, which prohibited all political processions in Ireland. The measure proved to be equally unpopular with all political parties and was repealed in 1872. ==Cork: the Berwick Fountain== For several years he was the Assistant Barrister for the East Riding of County Cork, which in effect meant that he was the Chairman of the Court of Quarter Sessions for Cork. He acquired a reputation for integrity and impartiality, and became a much-loved figure in Cork. He was one of the first judges to expound the notion of the suspended sentence. When he was made judge of the Irish Court of Bankruptcy in 1859, the people of Cork paid a heartfelt tribute to his good service to the city. Berwick, greatly touched by the tribute, responded by commissioning the Berwick Fountain \\"in remembrance of the great kindness shown to me by all classes in Cork\\". It was completed in 1860 and still stands on the Grand Parade, although it was moved from its original site in 2007. Berwick served as the Bankruptcy judge until his death. In his last years he lived at St. Edmundsbury, Lucan, County Dublin He was a founder member of the Stephen's Green Club, and an active campaigner for the establishment of the National Gallery of Ireland. ==Death: the Abergele rail disaster== In August 1868 Berwick and his sister Elizabeth Mary were returning from a holiday in Switzerland. At Euston Station they took charge of a young girl called Louisa Symes, who was apparently a distant relative. They boarded the Irish Mail to Holyhead. At Abergele in North Wales, two runaway carriages from a goods train ahead crashed into the Irish Mail, causing what was then the worst train disaster in British history. In the resulting inferno 33 people died, including Berwick, his sister and Louisa Symes. All the victims were buried in a common grave, and a memorial was erected to commemorate the disaster. Memorial to the 33 people who died in the Abergele Train Disaster, among whom were Walter Berwick and his sister Elizabeth Mary Berwick. ==See also== *Abergele rail disaster *Dolly's Brae conflict *Grand Parade, Cork *Party Processions Act ==Sources== *British Almanack and Companion 1869 *Hart, A.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, and its boundaries were increased in 2004. At the time of the boundary increase it consisted of 246 resources, which included 201 contributing buildings, one contributing structure, and 44 non-contributing buildings. Brown and East Ronalds Streets are both part of the city's original plat when it was laid out as the capitol of the Iowa Territory. They are located on the north edge of the plat. Its significance is derived from the settlement patterns here, the development of a major transportation corridor, the neighborhood's affiliation with the University of Iowa and its growth around the turn of the 20th century, and the architectural styles and forms that are found here from the 1850s to the 1920s. with Many of the city's Bohemian-immigrant population lived here. Businessmen and blue-collar workers lived side by side to each other, as did professors from the University of Iowa. The old Military Road was routed on Brown Street, and after it was paved with bricks in 1907, it became the preferred route for funeral processions to Oakland Cemetery. Most of the popular architectural styles from late 19th and into the 20th century are found here. The most popular house form is the American Four-Square. Other popular styles include Queen Anne, Italianate, and the Greek Revival. The houses are both one and two stories in height, and wood-frame construction is prominent with rubble stone foundations. Some exteriors are clad in brick. Four houses have been individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Charles Berryhill House (c. 1850-1865), Vogt House (1890), Bohumil Shimek House (c. 1890), and the Arthur Hillyer Ford House (1909). ==References== Category:Historic districts in Iowa City, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Iowa City, Iowa Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Queen Anne architecture in Iowa Category:Italianate architecture in Iowa Category:Greek Revival architecture in Iowa ","title":"Brown Street Historic District"},{"id":"54230418","text":"State Route 175 (SR 175) is a state highway entirely in Hancock County, Maine that travels for . The shape of the route is an unusual U-shape and travels along the peninsula surrounded by Blue Hill Bay, Eggemoggin Reach, and Bagaduce River. The route is signed as north-south but has two northern termini: at State Routes 15, 172, and 176 in Blue Hill, and at SR 166 in Penobscot. The transition point of the directional signage occurs about from the Blue Hill terminus. ==Route description== SR 175 begins at a roundabout in Blue Hill. The roundabout's legs include SR 15/SR 176 to the southwest and northeast, Beech Hill Road to the northwest (which connects to SR 177), and SR 172 on the southeast and northeast legs. SR 172 and SR 175 together head southeast from there on a concurrency, both routes signed as south, through a commercial shopping area, but this gives way to a stretch of some houses lining both sides of the road. later, SR 175 splits off from SR 172 at Blue Hill Falls and heads east and south on Falls Bridge Road. The first sign for \\"North SR 175\\" is found just past this intersection. The road now runs very close to the Blue Hill Bay and crosses over several small fingers from the bay. It travels south along the Blue Hill Neck peninsula passing through the hamlet of South Blue Hill. It then enters the town of Brooklin where it travels through the settlement of North Brooklin and bending towards the southwest at Herrick Bay. In the center of Brooklin, the road turns towards the west to follow Eggemoggin Reach. SR 175 begins to curve to the north to follow the short Benjamin River. Past West Brooklin, the road turns to the west again to cross the river and enter the town of Sedgwick. Upon entering the town, SR 175 reaches the town center of Sedgwick. It executes a pair of sharp bends to the south at High Street and continues west past some houses. It intersects SR 172 at its southern terminus. Reach Road and SR 175 continues west but makes a sharp curve to the south at Cross Road. At Sargentville, SR 15 meets SR 175 and the two routes together head north along Caterpillar Hill Road. The road climbs along the side of the hill of the same name before descending and entering an annex of Brooksville. At Black Corner, SR 175 turns off of SR 15 and heads west along Coastal Road towards the center of Brooksville. Before reaching the center, SR 175 turns onto Bagaduce Road while SR 176 begins and continues west along Coastal Road. As the road name implies, it follows the Bagaduce River on its west side. Upon reaching North Brooksville, the road reaches SR 176 which had followed the other side of the peninsula. The two roads form a concurrency northeast along Bridge Road. It crosses the river, re-enters Sedgwick, and comes to a T-intersection at Southern Bay Road. SR 176 heads southeast while SR 175 continues northwest into the town of Penobscot. Now heading along the east side of the Bagaduce River, the road heads through a mostly wooded area with some houses lining the road. At the settlement of South Penobscot, SR 176 reaches the western terminus of SR 177\\\\. Through here, it passes a market, but mostly houses. The road continues northwest into the center of Penobscot where it passes a church and additional houses. In front of Penobscot's town hall, SR 199 intersects SR 175 and then both head west forming a wrong-way concurrency alongside Northern Bay. The road curves around the north side of the bay and its coves before SR 175 breaks away from the concurrency after . SR 175 heads almost due west towards the Penobscot Bay passing through a mostly wooded area before ending at SR 166, Castine Road. Along its concurrency with SR 15, SR 175 is part of the state highway system therefore maintained by Maine Department of Transportation (MaineDOT) year-round.

The same thirteen teams from 2016 returned for the 2017 season, and the divisional alignment remained the same. The playoff format for this season was slightly altered, reducing the number of teams that make it from eight to six. This meant a bracket structure where the top seed in each division earned a first- round bye, with the second and third-seeded teams battling in a one-game \\"Wild Card\\" matchup. Another change for the 2017 campaign was moving the All-Star Game farther back in the summer, to July 30, more than a week later than prior seasons. The NECBL All-Star Game's 23rd edition was played on July 30 at Joe Wolfe Field in North Adams, Massachusetts, home of the North Adams SteepleCats.

The Concerned Officers Movement (COM) was an organization of mainly junior officers formed within the U.S. military in the early 1970s whose principal purpose was opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Very quickly, however, it also found itself fighting for First Amendment rights within the military. It was initiated in the Washington, D.C. area by commissioned officers who were also Vietnam Veterans, but rapidly expanded throughout all branches and many bases of the U.S. military, ultimately playing an influential role in the opposition to the Vietnam War. ==Founding== Concerned Officers Movement first leaflet issued for GI Rally for Peace and Justice in Washington, DC March 14, 1970COMs genesis sprang from the participation of Marine Captain Bob Brugger in the November 1969 March on Washington against the Vietnam War. The Washington Post carried an article about Bob and his wife that caused his superior officers to enter an unsatisfactory mark for loyalty in his fitness report and generated supportive phone calls from other officers. Brugger's opposition to \\"blind patriotism\\" and his stand against racism at home and in Vietnam had struck a chord with other officers who read the article. Over several months a group of officers agreed to work together and on March 14, 1970, they participated as Officers' Resistance in a G.I. Rally for Peace and Justice in Washington, D.C. By the end of March 1970 they had changed their name to the Concerned Officers Movement. Early members who signed the first published newsletter were LT Jim Crawford, USN, CPT Ed Fox, USA, CPT Gerry Giovaniello, USAR, LTJG Tono Hixon, USNR, LTJG Phil Lehman, USNR, LTJG Randy Thomas, USNR; LTJG Robert Nechin USAR; CAPT Larry Wasser, USMC, and CPT Bob Gaines, USAR. Other early members were 1LT Louis Font, a West Point honor graduate, who received extensive national media coverage for his stand against the war and CAPT Mike Mullen, USMCR who was one of the contacts on the organization's first leaflet (see image to right). COM's first newsletter, published in April 1970, described the organization's political views: While stating they were \\"loyal, responsible military officers\\", they supported \\"a cease-fire and the rapid disengagement of American troops from Southeast Asia\\", opposed the \\"preponderant share of national resources devoted to the military\\", and called for the \\"free expression of dissenting opinion\\" within the military. ==Media coverage and growth== The fact that military officers had formed a group openly speaking out against the war and the U.S. military was unprecedented and quickly reached the national media. On June 3, 1970, The New York Times announced that the \\"antiwar movement has reached the United States military officers corps.\\" \\"Calling themselves the Concerned Officers Movement, about 25 officers based in Washington, most of them Navy men, have banded together to provide a forum for what they say is growing disillusionment among their ranks with the Indochina war.\\" COM continued to grow and on September 26, 1970, 28 members representing about 250 others on active duty from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps held a press conference in Washington, D.C. to announce \\"their intention to speak against the war in Vietnam\\" and \\"to encourage other officers to express antiwar opinions\\". Font told the press, \\"I reject this war....I have asked myself time and again: 'When the law becomes a crime, consensus and conformity becomes a crime, am I to condone it?' My answer is no.\\" Major Albert Braverman, a physician at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, stated that COM had active chapters at the Marine base at Camp Lejeune, NC, at Navy and Marine bases in Norfolk, VA, Pensacola, FL and San Diego, at Army bases at Fort Bragg, NC, and Fort Jackson, SC, at the Air Force base in Grand Forks, ND, and in Iceland and Hawaii. They also read an open letter to Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird demanding an immediate withdrawal from the war written by LTJG John Kent, USN, an Annapolis graduate, all-American wrestler and jet fighter pilot, and signed by 29 officers of the San Diego chapter of COM ranging in rank from Ensign to Lieutenant Commander. COM carried out a variety of antiwar activities throughout 1970 and 1971. It published a newsletter, which by the fourth issue was called COMmon Sense, distributing it throughout the armed services. It bought newspaper ads calling for an immediate withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, wrote leaflets, printed posters and held press conferences. COM's Norfolk Naval Base chapter paid for a billboard outside the base that read Peace Now. Ad placed by the Fort Bragg COM Chapter in the Washington Post Sept 13, 1971 == Military retaliation == Initially, many COM members wanted to stay within the military and felt they had a right to express dissenting views. In fact, their third newsletter argued that responsible dissent \\"can and must be allowed to exist in the military, if it is to keep pace with the times in which we live.\\" \\"We believe that such expressions of our convictions are within our rights, and that in expressing them, we are following our obligations as officers to defend the Constitution.\\" The organization felt the armed forces were an insular and hidebound world and explored ways to establish the right of free speech for active duty servicemen, both officers and enlisted. The military, however, disagreed and in many cases reprimanded, discharged and transferred COM members soon after their participation became known. Within three weeks of their September 26, 1970 press conference many COM members were facing retaliation. One Navy doctor in the San Diego chapter was discharged on 48 hours' notice after making his membership known. Official military spokespeople blamed budget cutbacks or force reductions, but COM members were told privately they were being discharged due to their membership. The New York Times quoted a Pentagon spokesman who denied the existence of a \\"purge\\" of antiwar officers, but then went on to admit the military did get concerned when these officers \\"go public\\". He argued that public statements \\"[d]raw the radicals to them like bees to honey\\", making them \\"duck soup for radicals\\" and raising \\"questions about the officers' reliability.\\" Ironically, some members who did want to get out were forced to stay in the military against their will and given orders transferring them to remote military bases like Adak, Alaska or even Vietnam. As a result, COM had a high turnover rate as the military discharged or transferred its members. This, combined with its focus on active duty officers, meant the national organization was relatively short-lived, tapering off considerably by the end of 1971. ==Controversial activity== In early 1971 COM created quite a stir by holding press conferences on both coasts calling for an investigation into the military's top brass for possible war crimes. Under the auspices of The National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam (Citizens Commission of Inquiry), COM held press conferences on January 12 in Washington, D.C. and January 20 in Los Angeles calling for an investigation into the \\"responsibility for war crimes of key military figures\\", including Generals William Westmoreland and Creighton Abrams, and Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. While formally they were only calling for an investigation, they presented evidence of war crimes and catastrophic environmental damage, leaving the impression they were accusing their own commanders of war crimes. The Washington, D.C. COM members involved were CPT Robert Master, USA, CPT Grier Merwin, USA, Fox, Font and LTJG Peter Dunkelberger, USN. In Los Angeles were LT Norman Banks, USAF, LTJG Ted Shallcross, USN, LT James Skelly, USN, and Kent. Later that same year COM members used the military's own practice of encouraging the wearing of uniforms to religious services to conduct antiwar demonstrations in uniform, a prohibited activity under military regulations. , DoD Directive 1334.1, \\"Wearing of the Uniform\\". On April 23, 1971, ignoring warnings from higher ups that their actions would be considered a political demonstration, COM organized a memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral involving more than 250 officers in uniform honoring all the war dead, on both sides of the war. On May 2, 45 officers and enlisted men from the San Diego Chapter wore their uniforms to a similar antiwar \\"religious\\" event in Exposition Park in Los Angeles led by a prominent antiwar Episcopal minister, George Regas. As one of the men who participated later recalled in his memoir: \\"Thus, with one of our men playing the haunting lament on his bugle that is heard at military funerals, we marched with [a] coffin draped with the flags of the Viet Cong, North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and the United States.\\" No one was ever reprimanded or punished for these actions, probably because the military decided it would be better to ignore the whole thing and pretend it never happened. == The San Diego Chapter == The San Diego COM, located in the principal homeport of the Pacific Fleet,, Naval Base San Diego may have been the most active chapter and was certainly the longest lasting, continuing actively until late 1973., Liberty Call, Concerned Military Newsletter 1973 The Chapter was initiated by Kent and local antiwar activist Jeannie Boyle and formally founded in July 1970 by Kent, LT Harold Appel, USN, Skelly and Shallcross., San Diego COM Leaflet Announcing Formation Very quickly it broadened its outreach to include enlisted men and women and by 1972 had changed its name to Concerned Military. On May 15, 1971, which they called Armed Farces Day, they hosted the touring FTA \\"political vaudeville\\" antiwar show, known to most GIs as the \\"Fuck The Army\\" Show, featuring Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Peter Boyle, Dick Gregory, and Country Joe McDonald. The show, held in the auditorium of San Diego High School, was a tremendous success with a capacity crowd of over 2,400 enthusiastic sailors and marines, and contributed to the growth and reputation of the chapter. Efforts to stop an aircraft carrier Poster used for the Constellation Vote They also joined with other antiwar activists in major efforts to mobilize opposition to the departure for Vietnam of several aircraft carriers. The first of these projects attracted antiwar activists from all over California and was aimed at trying to keep the USS Constellation from sailing. The project was initiated by a group called San Diego Nonviolent Action, which united with COM to focus on the role of aircraft carriers. They had the initial goal of stopping the Constellation from returning to Vietnam through education and non-violent activity like a blockade or by preventing military personnel from getting to the naval base. Very quickly, this effort expanded into a multi-faceted campaign., San Diego Nonviolent Action Anti-Aircraft Carrier Initial Statement; accessed December 23, 2017. Constellation Vote As veteran antiwar activists, including Joan Baez and David Harris, became involved, Harris suggested organizing a citywide referendum on whether the Constellation should set sail.Joan Baez Wearing Stay Home For Peace T-Shirt, Joan Baez Prior to Singing at a Constellation Vote Rally This Constellation Vote became a major antiwar campaign over several months that led to a citywide straw vote in late September 1971 with 54,721 votes counted. Over 82% of voters elected to keep the ship home, including 73% of the military personnel who voted. While not a \\"real\\" vote, the impact on public opinion was appreciable. Constellation Vote PosterThe Connie Vote: The USS Constellation and the Peace Movement in San Diego, 1971, The Bob Fitch Photography Archive at Stanford University. Even an unsympathetic observer deemed the overall effort to stop the Constellation \\"an impressive campaign\\", and the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet was quoted as saying \\"never was there such a concerted effort to entice American servicemen from their posts.\\" A considerable amount of research was conducted into the role of aircraft carriers in modern warfare by Professor William Watson of MIT who was then a visiting Professor of History at UC San Diego. He argued in a widely distributed pamphlet that aircraft carriers had become weapons \\"used to crush popular uprisings and to bully the weaker and poorer countries of the world.\\", Attack Carrier: The Constellation Papers, September 1971 Creative protest methods The involvement of large numbers of antiwar officers and enlisted men created significant debate in the traditionally pro-military town. It also permitted creative methods not normally available to other antiwar groups, such as the CONSTELLATION STAY HOME FOR PEACE banner frequently seen being towed over the city by recently retired navy flight instructor LT John Huyler, and the Constellation Vote stickers found everywhere on board the USS Constellation, including in the captain's personal bathroom.Constellation Vote Logo, Constellation Vote Logo Used on Stickers and FlyersPraxis Underground Newspaper V.1 No.7, October 6, 1971 p.9, \\"Stay Home For Peace Stickers\\" Land GI in Brig Bathroom stickers weren't the only complication the Captain had to deal with. Over 1,300 of the ship's sailors signed a petition requesting the FTA Show be allowed onboard. The captain refused this request but then got himself in hot water by intercepting and destroying 2,500 pieces of U.S. mail sent by antiwar activists to crewmembers. Faced with a possible court of inquiry and health problems, the captain was removed from command before the ship sailed. Connie 9 When the Constellation actually did sail for Vietnam, no visible blockade occurred but nine of its crew publicly refused to go and took sanctuary in a local Catholic church, Christ the King, with the support of COM members and other activists. The \\"Connie 9\\" as they were quickly dubbed, were soon arrested in an early morning raid by US Marshals and flown back to the ship, but within weeks were honorably discharged from the navy., Kitty Litter (USS Kitty Hawk Newsletter) 1972 This action led to other Stop Our Ship (SOS) campaigns in San Diego and other California ports in a wider effort to prevent navy ships from heading to Southeast Asia. \\"A strong resistance movement within the Seventh Fleet was led by COM and its local chapter.\\", Stop Our Ship Leaflet (USS Coral Sea), Stop Our Ship Petition (USS Coral Sea) ==Significance== At its height, COM had as many as 28 chapters in all the military branches and has been estimated to have \\"had approximately 3,000 members, including many supporters from the enlisted ranks.\\" At one point it even had a chapter in the Pentagon. It had no formal leadership, although various people stepped forward at different times to play central roles. COM did not attract the media attention as dramatically as its more well-known partner and ally, Vietnam Veterans Against the War, but it played a key and underappreciated role in the antiwar movement of the early 1970s. The fact that officers not only resisted the war, but spoke out publicly and formed a significant organization, speaks to the depth of the anti-Vietnam War and anti-U.S. military sentiment in the U.S. at the time. ==See also== * GI's Against Fascism * GI Coffeehouses * Movement for a Democratic Military * Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War * Presidio mutiny * Sir!

He also served as suffect consul in 102, replacing Lucius Licinius Sura as the colleague of the consul who opened the year, Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus; both Justus and Servianus closed their nundinium at the end of April. Justus is known as a correspondent of Pliny the Younger, and is the addressee of Tacitus' Dialogus de oratoribus. Ronald Syme questioned in a 1957 essay the rationale behind Tacitus addressing his work to Justus instead of, for example, Pliny the Younger. Syme's answer was that Justus at the time of the dedication was a young adult who had become cynical of the craft of rhetoric. Syme further pictures Justus as a viri militares (unlike Pliny), and as \\"an enlighted and cultivated person [who] had deserted eloquence for the career of provinces and armies\\" despite the scant evidence for Justus' role in governing provinces or leading armies.Syme, \\"The Friend of Tacitus\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 47 (1957), pp. 131-135 == Origins == There is no exact information on the origins of Justus. Syme and Werner Eck believe that he came from a senatorial family of Gallia Narbonensis. However, other authorities cite epigraphic data that Justus was from the Iberian Peninsula, pointing out that there are more inscriptions that mention a person of the gens Fabius in those provinces: whereas there are only 50 such inscriptions in Gallia Narbonensis, in the provinces of Hispania there are over 300 inscriptions.Fran√ßoise Des Boscs-Plateaux, Un parti hispanique √† Rome? ascension des √©lites hispaniques et pouvoir politique d'Auguste √† Hadrien, 27 av. J.-C.-138 ap. J.-C. (Madrid: Casa de Vel√°zquez, 2006), p. 535 Historian A. Kaballos notes that a number of senators bearing the gentilicum \\"Fabius\\", originated from Spain. As for which province Justus came from, an inscription has been found in Lusitania mentioning a Fabius Justus of the tribe Galeria. According to the researcher Francoise de Bosque-Plateau, our Justus came from the Spanish city of UliaDes Boscs-Plateaux, Un parti hispanique √† Rome?, p. 186 (Montemayor, C√≥rdoba). == Life == From the correspondence Pliny published, he mentions Justus in one letter and wrote two more to him. In a letter to Voconius Romanus, wherein Pliny gloats over the discomfort the delator or informer Marcus Aquilius Regulus felt following the death of Domitian in the year 96, Pliny mentions that Justus was one of the people Regulus approached to intervene on his behalf with Pliny, hoping to stave off Pliny's prosecution of the former informer.Pliny, Epistulae, I.5.8 Of the two letters he wrote to Justus, the first was a light-hearted reproach for not writing him, while the second apparently was written after Justus responded to Pliny's first letter, accepting Justus' explanation that during the present summer he was too busy and looking forward to the winter months when Justus would have more time to write, while promising to send some of his own writings which the other had apparently asked for.Epistulae, I.11, VII.2 Syme writes he fails to detect in the two letters addressed to Justus \\"a common friendship\\" with him that Pliny had with Tacitus, another of his correspondents: \\"He stood closer to Tacitus than did the other consular orator. Pliny favoured Tacitus with a long epistle defending long orations (I.20). Fabius has the dedication of the Dialogus which declared that eloquence is not needed any more.\\"Syme, \\"Correspondents of Pliny\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte,34 (1985), p. 359 Evidence for his career begins after Justus completed his nundinium as suffect consul. On the eve of Trajan's Dacian War, Justus was appointed governor of Moesia Inferior in 105, replacing Aulus Caecilius Faustinus; he held this post after the conclusion of the war, until 108.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), 341-345 Syme would date the two letters Pliny wrote him to his administration of Moesia Inferior, thus explaining why Justus had been too busy to write. Once his term in Moesia Inferior was completed, Justus was assigned that same year to Syria, which he governed for four years, until 112.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 346-352 Syme speculates he may have died in Syria, thus denied a second consulship. == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:2nd-century Romans Category:2nd-century Roman governors of Syria Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Lower Moesia Category:Roman governors of Syria Category:Fabii ","title":"Lucius Fabius Justus"},{"id":"54230825","text":"Dukh Sukh is a Pakistani Drama.

In a subsequent shoot-out with a police tactical unit, Khayre was killed and three police officers were wounded. Police consider the siege an act of terrorism. ==Siege== On 5 June 2017, Yacqub Khayre made a telephone booking for a female escort through an escort agency to meet in an apartment at the Buckingham International Serviced Apartments. At 4:00pm, the 36-year- old escort arrived by taxi and attended at apartment 11 as arranged and was taken hostage by Khayre and held captive in the bathroom. Khayre was armed with two shotguns. At approx. 4:10pm, the escort managed to free herself and made a phone call to Victoria Police via 000. Shortly after, Khayre phoned police stating it was a hostage situation, no one was to attend apartment 11 otherwise the hostage would die, the receptionist was dead and that there was a bomb on the premises. In the foyer of the complex, Khayre fatally shot the receptionist, 36-year-old Kai Hao. Khayre around this time tampered with the GPS ankle monitor, which he was wearing as a condition of his parole. At approx. 4:44pm, Khayre called police again making similar statements as the previous call. Specialist police were called in: the Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT) arrived first, followed by the Special Operations Group (SOG) who took over tactical command. At 5:04pm, police located the receptionist dead in the foyer. At 5:41pm, Khayre made a phone call to Seven News stating \\"This is for IS, this is for al-Qaeda\\". At approx. 6:02pm, Khayre emerged from apartment 11 exiting the front of the complex. Yelling and running, he fired a Nikko sawed-off over-under shotgun twice at SOG officers, who exchanged fire and killed him. Three SOG officers were shot including one suffering a hand injury and another facial injuries. The hostage was freed in the apartment by police and had not been harmed during the ordeal. ==Perpetrator== Born in Somalia, Khayre arrived in Australia at age 3 in 1991 as a refugee via a Kenyan refugee camp and grew up in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. Whilst at secondary school in Year 12 his grandfather died. He subsequently dropped out of school and began using drugs and alcohol, including ice to which he became addicted, and started committing criminal offences. The crimes including burglaries and thefts, assaults and an armed robbery with a knife.DPP v Khayre [2012 VCC 1607] (12 October 2012) County Court of Victoria. In April 2009, he travelled back to Somalia, where he is alleged to have undertaken military training with the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab, with a view to participating in Somali insurgency against that country's government. Whilst in Somalia, he successfully sought from a sheikh a fatwa, a religious order, that police alleged was to authorise a terrorist attack in Australia. After he returned to Australia in July 2009, he was charged, along with others, with conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack on the Holsworthy Army Barracks. At his trial, his lawyer argued that the fatwa was to do with fraud and obtaining money to support Al-Shabaab in Somalia. He was acquitted in December 2010 having spent 16 months in prison on remand. He committed further criminal offences and in 2011 returned to prison including for possession of a firearm. In 2012, he committed a home invasion for which he was sentenced to five years imprisonment and was released on parole in December 2016 (he set two fires whilst in prison). ==Investigation== The Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police Graham Ashton stated that police were treating the siege as a terrorist incident given the comments made by Khayre referring to ISIS and al-Qaeda and also given his past involvement with the Holsworthy Barracks terrorist plot. Ashton stated that police did not know if the crime was spontaneous or was planned, and if so, whether it was a deliberate attempt to lure police to the scene to ambush them. Detectives established that the unregistered shotgun used in the siege was illegally trafficked on 19 May 2017 for $2,000 to a middle man for Khayre. ==Reactions== Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull stated Australia faced \\"a growing threat from Islamist terrorism\\" and that he would push states to reform parole laws, questioning how a person with a history of violence was allowed on parole. The ISIL propaganda outlet Amaq declared the gunman was a soldier of Islamic State and that the attack was to target citizens. The Islamic Council of Victoria described it as a \\"horrendous crime\\" and stated they understand \\"that the police are investigating this as a potential terrorist attack but note that the perpetrator himself appeared to be confused as to who he was acting on behalf, claiming allegiance to both ISIS and al-Qaeda, known enemies.\\" On 16 June 2017, the Minister for Justice Michael Keenan announced that following recent events that a national firearms amnesty would commence on 1 July 2017 to hand in unregistered or unwanted firearms stating the national security environment had deteriorated with terror attacks using illegal guns including the shooting of Curtis Cheng in 2015 and the Lindt Cafe siege in 2014. The firearms amnesty is Australia's first national amnesty since 1996 following the Port Arthur massacre. ==See also== * 2018 Melbourne stabbing attack ==References== Category:2017 crimes in Australia Category:2010s in Melbourne Category:Crime in Melbourne Category:Hostage taking in Australia Category:June 2017 crimes Category:June 2017 events in Australia Category:Terrorist incidents in Australia Category:2017 murders in Oceania Category:2010s murders in Australia Category:Terrorist incidents in Australia in the 2010s Category:Terrorist incidents in Oceania in 2017 ","title":"2017 Brighton siege"},{"id":"54231058","text":"Parastratiosphecomyia is a genus of flies in the soldier fly family (Stratiomyidae). ==SpeciesN.E.

Williams, stabbing him over 200 times. He was serving time at the penitentiary for a gang murder he committed in Arizona. Con-ui's criminal past is lengthy, being arrested in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Pennsylvania. His charges include dozens of charges of drug use, distribution, trafficking, aggravated assault, robbery, attempted murder and murder. ==Criminal past== Con-ui was at Canaan serving an 11-year prison sentence stemming from a 2003 guilty plea for his role in a drug ring run by the New Mexican Mafia prison gang. Following that sentence, he was set to begin serving a life sentence after pleading guilty in 2008 to first-degree murder in Arizona. In that case, Con-ui allegedly baited friend and fellow gang member Carlos Garcia into meeting him at a Phoenix laundromat. There, two men ambushed and shot Garcia, who managed to slip away before one of the men fired four rounds into his head. Court documents claim Con-ui also agreed to or participated in several separate, uncharged incidents while incarcerated between 1999 and 2010, including stabbing another inmate with a homemade knife and assaulting another inmate with a food tray. While out of jail in 2013, court documents allege Con-ui agreed to participate in the murder of a law enforcement officer but was arrested in Arizona before the murder could be carried out. ==Murder of Eric Williams== Con-ui was incarcerated at United States Penitentiary, Canaan from 2009 till the stabbing in 2013. On 25 February 2013, Con-ui kicked corrections officer Eric Williams down a flight of stairs. Con-ui then descending the stairs pulled out 2 shanks made out of an unknown object, he then attacked Williams for 11 minutes, while other prisoners watched, none stopping Con-ui. Williams was stabbed 203 times, his body having been kicked dozens of times and head slammed into the floor, killing him. Finally, a fellow corrections officer who entered looking for Williams found him at the bottom of the stairs with Con-ui standing over Williams' body. First Aid was administered by other corrections staff, but was unsuccessful. Williams' body was transported to an area hospital and Con-ui was immediately taken into custody. Con-ui was asked by another officer why he did it, with Con-ui simply responding \\"He disrespected me.\\" Murder trial Con-ui was jailed at ADX Florence, a super-maximum federal prison in Fremont County, Colorado, nicknamed the ‚ÄúAlcatraz of the Rockies.‚Äù Con-ui's trial began on June 5, 2017 with opening statements being held at the Federal Courthouse in Scranton, Pennsylvania. During the first day a 12-minute video showing the graphic attack was played in front of the court room. Con-ui was seen having his eyes covered by his hands and the Williams family left prior to the video stating \\"We didn't want to see our son, husband and friend like that.\\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Francis Sempa told the jury, \\"Eric Williams was two hours from shift end and going home. He never made it home.\\" Defense attorneys fully admitted to jurors that \\"Jessie is guilty of murder beyond all doubt\\" and focused on trying to keep him from being sentenced to death. On July 10, 2017 the jury found Con-ui guilty, however the death penalty could not be agreed on by the jury and his sentence was automatically reduced to life in prison without the possibility for parole. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1977 births Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American male criminals Category:21st-century American criminals Category:Inmates of ADX Florence category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by the United States federal government ","title":"Jessie Con-ui"},{"id":"54231228","text":"The Caves of Keash The Bricklieve Mountains are an upland area located in south County Sligo, Ireland.

It was to be located on Cannon Hill Lane in Merton, in south-west London. ==Plan== Railway bridge over Cannon Hill Lane, the site proposed for the station The station was to have been built on the W&SR;'s planned surface railway line in Surrey (now south-west London) from Wimbledon to Sutton. The station was to be built on a bridge where the railway crosses Cannon Hill Lane. The construction of the railway was approved in 1910. In 1911 the UERL agreed to provide funding for the line's construction and to operate its train services by extending the UERL's District Railway (DR) from Wimbledon station. Delays in the purchase of land along the railway's route and the outbreak of war prevented the works from commencing and the permission was extended several times with a final extension granted in 1922. Following the war, the UERL presented new proposals to construct an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;, now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden in tunnel where it would come to the surface and join the W&SR; route. Both DR and C&SLR; trains would run to Sutton. The plan to extend the C&SLR; was opposed by the Southern Railway (SR), the operator of the mainline services through Wimbledon and Sutton. A settlement between the companies agreed that the extension of the C&SLR; would end at Morden and the W&SR; would be taken over and its route would be constructed by the SR. When the Wimbledon to Sutton line was constructed by the SR in the late 1920s, Cannon Hill station was omitted from the line's stations with the nearest station being to the north at Wimbledon Chase. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Unbuilt London Underground stations Category:Proposed London Underground stations Category:Unopened tube stations in the London Borough of Merton ","title":"Cannon Hill tube station"},{"id":"54231347","text":"Vennu Mallesh is an Indian singer from Achampet, Telangana who is best known for his songs on YouTube.

The material in question originated with the National Security Agency (NSA). On June 3, 2017, while employed by the military contractor Pluribus International Corporation, Winner was arrested on suspicion of leaking an intelligence report about Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections to the news website The Intercept. The report suggested that Russian hackers accessed voter registration rolls in the U.S. with an email phishing operation, though it was unclear whether any changes had been made. Concerns were raised that The Intercept's handling of the material exposed her as the source and contributed to her arrest. Twice denied bail, Winner was held at the Lincoln County Jail in Lincolnton, Georgia. * * On August 23, 2018, Winner was sentenced to five years and three months in prison as part of a plea deal. , she is incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Ft. Worth, Texas. ==Early life and education== Winner grew up in Kingsville, Texas, and was a top-ten GPA 2010 graduate of H. M. King High School, where she learned Latin at school, studied Arabic in her free time, and played on the soccer and tennis teams. == Personal life == Journalist Kerry Howley has described Winner during adolescence as shy, intellectually adept, \\"almost comically mature.\\" Prosecutors characterized her as a person who \\"hates America\\" based on private messages with her sister, although Winner served in the United States Air Force for six years and received a commendation in October 2016 for \\"removing more than 100 enemies from the battlefield.\\" The sudden loss of her biological father, Ronald, in December 2016 had a devastating impact on Winner's life. Her father's influence early in her life had extensively shaped Winner's worldview on many topics including politics, history, philosophy, and religion. After the September 11 attacks, Winner was encouraged by her father to seek out answers about the geopolitical motivations behind the attacks. She also discussed with him current events such as the Syrian Civil War, and later donated to the White Helmets, volunteers helping civilians caught up in that war. Following military service, Winner applied for jobs with NGOs in Afghanistan, hoping to use her Pashto to dialogue with refugees. However, her search for overseas employment was frustrated by her lack of post-secondary education. == Career == Winner in 2010 Winner served in the United States Air Force from 2010 to 2016, achieving the rank of senior airman (an E-4 paygrade) with the 94th Intelligence Squadron. After two years of language and intelligence training, she was posted to Fort Meade, Maryland. She worked as a cryptologic linguist, being fluent in the Persian language and in Dari, the Persian dialect spoken in Afghanistan, as well as in Pashto. Assigned to the drone program, she listened in on intercepted foreign chatter to provide U.S. forces with intelligence. Winner was awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal for \\"aiding in 650 enemy captures, 600 enemies killed in action and identifying 900 high[-]value targets.\\" A month after being honorably discharged from the Air Force in November 2016, Winner moved to Augusta, Georgia, where she taught at CrossFit and at a yoga studio. Winner applied for jobs with NGOs in Afghanistan, hoping to use her Pashto to dialogue with refugees. However, her search for overseas employment was frustrated by her lack of post-secondary education. Still possessing a top-secret security clearance, Winner was then hired by Pluribus International Corporation, a small firm that provides services under contract to the National Security Agency. On February 13, 2017, Pluribus assigned her to work at Fort Gordon, a U.S. Army post near Augusta, where she had once been stationed while in the Air Force. Assigned to translate documents relating to Iran's aerospace program from Persian, Winner was employed by Pluribus at the time of her arrest for unauthorized disclosure of classified documents. It was while translating these documents that Winner came across the classified document she ended up mailing to The Intercept. Federal agents found her diary during a search of her home, in which she allegedly expressed support for Taliban leaders and Osama bin Laden. The U.S. magistrate judge who presided over Winner's bail hearing said: \\"She seems to have a fascination with the Middle East and Islamic terrorism,\\" and quoted her writing: \\"It's a Christlike vision to have a fundamentalist Islamic state.\\" However, one of the prosecutors at her bail hearing said: \\"The government is not in any way suggesting the defendant has become a jihadist or that she is a Taliban sympathizer.\\" == Intelligence report leak, arrest, role of The Intercept, sentencing and confinement == Winner was arrested on June 3, 2017. The Department of Justice announced her arrest on June 5, shortly after The Intercept published an article describing Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election by hacking a U.S. voting software supplier and sending spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials just days before the November 8 election. The Intercept story was based on a top-secret May 5, 2017, National Security Agency (NSA) document leaked to them anonymously. The Intercept had contacted the NSA on May 30 and sent copies of the documents in order to confirm their veracity. The NSA notified the FBI of the situation on June 1. According to media coverage published in VICE, an official FBI report said the documents \\"appeared to be folded and/or creased, suggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space.\\" Next, the NSA did an internal audit, confirming that Winner was one of six workers who had accessed the particular documents on its classified system, but only Winner's computer had been in contact with The Intercept using a personal email account. On June 3, the FBI obtained a warrant to search Winner's electronic devices, and she was arrested. Both journalists and security experts have suggested that The Intercept handling of the reporting, which included publishing the documents unredacted and including the printer tracking dots, was used to identify Winner as the leaker. When her house was searched and she was initially questioned, Winner stated that she had a pink AR-15, a 9mm Glock, and a 15gauge shotgun, as well as two pets: a foster dog and a cat. She stated she \\"wasn't trying to be a Snowden or anything\\". In an 'Affidavit in Support of Application for Arrest Warrant' dated July 5, 2017, FBI Special Agent Justin C. Garrick stated: Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, called on the public to support Winner,\\" offering a $10,000 reward for information about a reporter for The Intercept who had allegedly helped the U.S. government identify Winner as the leaker. Assange wrote on Twitter that \\"Winner is no Clapper or Petraeus with 'elite immunity'. She's a young woman against the wall for talking to the press.\\" Winner was charged with \\"removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet.\\" On June 8, 2017, she pleaded not guilty to a charge of \\"willful retention and transmission of national defense information\\", and was denied bail. Prosecutors alleged she may have been involved in other leaks of classified information, and might try to flee the country if released. The U.S. Justice Department lawyers also argued that her defense team should not be allowed to discuss any classified information, even if it was in news reports published by the media. On August 29, 2017, Winner's attorneys filed a motion in U.S. District Court to suppress her statements to law enforcement, arguing that Winner was not read her Miranda rights before being interrogated by the FBI on June 3. On October 5, 2017, Judge Brian Epps denied a second request from her defense attorneys that bail be set. In December 2017, The Intercept reported that Winner's defense team was allowed to discuss the case with her, including its classified aspects, in a \\"Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility\\" (SCIF). First Look, the parent company of The Intercept, helped fund her defense, and was still paying her legal bills. On January 31, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a lower court order blocking Winner from posting bond, determining that no combination of conditions would reasonably assure her presence at trial, thus ensuring that she remains in jail until her trial, which was scheduled to begin on October 15, 2018. A \\"Stand with Reality\\" campaign was formed by representatives from Courage to Resist, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Freedom of the Press Foundation with the goal of \\"raising public awareness\\" to ensure that Reality Winner receives a fair trial. Billie Winner-Davis, mother of Reality Winner, called on members of the public to join this campaign. On June 21, 2018, Winner asked the court to allow her to change her plea to guilty and on June 26 she pleaded guilty to one count of felony transmission of national defense information. Winner's plea agreement with prosecutors called for her to serve five years and three months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. On August 23, 2018, at a federal court in Georgia, Winner was sentenced to the agreed-upon five years and three months in prison for violating the Espionage Act. Prosecutors said her sentence was the longest ever imposed in federal court for an unauthorized release of government information to the media. The New York Times reported, \\"Under the plea agreement, Ms. Winner will be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, where she can receive treatment for bulimia and be relatively close to her family.\\" On August 24, President Donald Trump tweeted: \\"Ex-NSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over 'classified' information. Gee, this is 'small potatoes' compared to what Hillary Clinton did! So unfair Jeff, Double Standard.\\" Winner expressed appreciation for his support, saying, \\"I can't thank him enough.\\" On August 31, Winner said she will ask Trump for clemency as a result of his tweet, and that her legal team was already working on her pardon application. In 2019, The Guardian compared Winner's case to those of Daniel Everette Hale and of Henry Kyle Frese. On April 24, 2020, a federal judge rejected Winner's request to commute the remaining 19 months of her 63-month sentence and be released to home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Winner's lawyer argued that her history of respiratory illness and immune system compromised by bulimia makes her highly vulnerable to the virus. Two inmates had tested positive before being transferred to the federal medical center where (under the terms of her June 2018 guilty plea agreement) Winner is housed to meet her special needs; they were immediately quarantined and never entered the general population. The government insisted that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) \\"has taken aggressive action to mitigate the danger and is taking careful steps to protect inmates' and BOP staff members' health.\\" The judge found that Winner did not exhaust her administrative remedies through the BOP, which he held has sole authority to grant her compassionate release. On July 20, 2020, it was reported that Winner had tested positive for COVID-19. , Winner was recovering from the coronavirus, although still experiencing occasional shortness of breath. ==In popular culture== In 2019, Tina Satter staged the play Is This a Room, based on the transcript of Winner's interview by the FBI. Is this a Room was given its Dutch premiere at the 2019 Noorderzon Festival in Groningen in the Netherlands, and was further presented in New York City at the Vineyard Theatre later that year. In December 2019, production of a biopic film about Reality Winner (to be directed by Susanna Fogel) was announced. An excerpt from Is this a Room was aired in the March 13, 2020 episode of This American Life. == See also == * Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections * Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (January‚ÄìJune 2017) * Edward Snowden * Daniel Ellsberg * Katharine Gun == References  External links == * FBI Affidavit in Support of Application for Arrest Warrant (Case 1:17-mj-00024-BKE / Filed 06-05-2017) * Transcript of FBI interview Category:1991 births Category:21st-century American military personnel Category:Linguists from the United States Category:American prisoners and detainees Category:Living people Category:National Security Agency people Category:People from Augusta, Georgia Category:People from Kingsville, Texas Category:People associated with Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections Category:United States Air Force airmen Category:Yoga teachers Category:American whistleblowers Category:Criminals from Texas Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government Category:21st-century American criminals Category:Persons convicted under the Espionage Act of 1917 Category:American female criminals ","title":"Reality Winner"},{"id":"54231658","text":"Scott H.

She argues that Jews tend to draw upon these sensibilities in their daily lives, even if they do not practice any of the ritual aspects of Judaism. The notion has been used to understand contemporary Judaism and the future of the community, as well as having been incorporated in various educational programs, both youth and adult. ==Women of the Wall== Ochs has been a major figure in the Women of the Wall (WoW) movement, a movement in Israel to allow women full access to the Western Wall, for almost thirty years.Goktepe, Katherine. ‚ÄúWomen of the Wall: An Interview with Vanessa Ochs‚Äù Iris: A Journal About Women (2003): 16-20.

When her father joined the National Institutes of Health, her family moved to Maryland.Fleichman, John (February 2009). \\"ASCB Profile: Janet Iwasa\\" (PDF). ASCB Newsletter: 39‚Äì41. Retrieved 10 December 2017. Iwasa was the youngest child in the family, and she grew up determined to be different from her two older brothers. Her father's career in physics inspired her to become a scientist herself. In high school, she participated in a summer internship at the Institute for Genomic Research. In 1999, she graduated with great honor from Williams college with bachelor's degrees in Biology and Asian Studies.Janet Iwasa, Ph.D., University of Utah, Curriculum Vita In her junior year at Williams, she joined Professor Robert Savage's lab, studying the formation of segmented patterns in leeches on a cellular level.rpsci98 - BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, https://science.williams.edu/wp- content/blogs.dir/72/files/RS98html/RepSci98Web-BIOLOGY.html. In 2006, she received her PhD in cell biology from the University of California, San Francisco for her research on the actin cytoskeleton. Iwasa became invested in microscopy during her first year at UCSF. In Dyche Mullins' lab, she studied actin networks in motile cells. During lab meetings with Ron Vale's group, she gained knowledge about kinesin structure and function. When she viewed a kinesin animation by Graham Johnson, she was inspired to pursue 3D animation. With Dyche's approval, Iwasa began taking animation classes at San Francisco State University.Iwasa, Janet H. \\"Crafting a Career in Molecular Animation.\\" Molecular Biology of the Cell, vol. 25, no. 19, 29 Oct. 2014, pp. 2891‚Äì2893. NCBI, . After graduation, she studied animation at the Gnomon School for Visual Effects in Hollywood, California. She was the oldest student in her Gnomon animation course, as well as the only woman. She applied her skills in animation to biology, bringing cellular functions and interactions to life. == Career and research == In 2006, Iwasa began working as a postdoctoral fellow under Jack Szostak with Harvard University and the Massachusetts General Hospital.\\"Szostak Lab: Former Post-Doctoral Fellows\\". Molecular Biology. Harvard Medical School. Retrieved 10 December 2017. In 2007, Iwasa gained teaching experience at Harvard Medical School with a course named \\"Visualizing Molecular Processes with Maya.\\" In this course, she worked as a teaching assistant, writing tutorials and supervising projects. She also worked with another software platform at Harvard called Massive, adapting a program designed for video game animation to depict the process of nucleation elongation. In 2008, Iwasa created and presented a multimedia exhibit for the Boston Museum of Science titled Exploring Life's Origins. In 2008, she became a lecturer in Molecular Visualization for the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School. Her position at Harvard was modeled around her own research interests and her contributions to the scientists at the university. Her work with Joan Brugge and Michael Overholtzer furthered understanding of a newly discovered cellular process called endosis. Endosis involves the invasion of one cell into another, where the intruder proliferates inside the host cell until it is digested by the host or forcibly pushes its way back out. Iwasa's questions and requirements for the model forced researchers to investigate the endosis mechanism in greater detail to accurately engineer an animation of this process. While working with Tomas Kirchausen, she created an animation on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, researching how clathrin triskelions operated and assembled on the inner surface of the plasma membrane to invaginate an extracellular particle. In 2010, Iwasa organized and taught a course on visualizing molecular and cellular processes with 3D animation in Porto, Portugal. In 2013, she joined the University of Utah School of Medicine as a research assistant professor for the Department of Cell Biology. She returned to Portugal in 2014 to teach a 3D animation workshop for scientific animation. In 2014, she also completed a project called Molecular Flipbook, a free, open-source software program designed to animate molecules. In 2016, Iwasa released a life-cycle animation on HIV. Her project used animation to illustrate the molecular mechanisms the virus utilizes to enter into and exit target cells.Iwasa, Janet. \\"Visualizing HIV Entry and Egress.\\"  Publications  In addition to her university work, Iwasa's renowned molecular and cellular visualizations have been featured in numerous scientific journals including Nature, Science, and Cell, as well as the New York Times.Olsen, Erik (15 November 2010). \\"Molecular Animation: Where Cinema and Biology Meet\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 10 December 2017.\\"Janet Iwasa\\". Secret Life of Scientists and Engineers. PBS. Retrieved 10 December 2017. Iwasa's knowledge of cellular animation has also led her to publish several different works of scientific literature. Her work with Robert Savage's Lab led to her first publication in 2000 in Development Genes and Evolution, \\"The leech hunchback protein is expressed in the epithelium and CNS but not in the segmental precursor lineages\\", with co-authors Suver and Savage.Iwasa, J. H, et al. ‚ÄúThe Leech Hunchback Protein Is Expressed in the Epithelium and CNS but Not in the Segmental Precursor Lineages.‚Äù Development Genes and Evolution, vol. 210, no. 6, 19 May 2000, pp. 277‚Äì288. Springer Nature , . Iwasa's work with Savage focused on identifying regulatory genes engaged in the formation of segment patterns in annelids, investigating a gene in leeches called Leech Zinc Finger II (LZF2), considered to be an orthologue of the hunchback (hb) gene in Drosophila. Iwasa, Savage, and Suver concluded that LZF2 likely plays an important part in the morphological progressions of gastrulation and the specification of the central nervous system in leeches but does not contribute to the formation of anteroposterior patterns. In 2007, she published an article on her research at the University of California with Mullins, \\"Spatial and temporal relationships between actin-filament nucleation, capping, and disassembly.\\"Iwasa JH, Mullins RD. Spatial and temporal relationships between actin-filament nucleation, capping, and disassembly. Curr Biol. 2007 Mar 6; 17(5):395-406 Her study with Mullins focused on the lamellipodial network. They concluded that the lamellipodial network incorporates the Arp 2/3 complex and capping proteins during initial assembly, but dismisses these complexes long before the lamellipodial network is actually disassembled. They also reported that the network does not use cofilin, twinfilin, and tropomyosin in assembly. Instead these factors play a role in the network's size. In 2010, Iwasa published \\"Animating the model figure\\" in Trends Cell Biol.Iwasa JH (2010). Animating the model figure. Trends Cell Biol, 20(12), 699-704. In this article, she points out the importance of animations in revealing and teaching scientific concepts, explaining that students are shown to retain more information and show more interest in the material when animations are incorporated into the curriculum. She also pushed the invention of ananimation software engineered exclusively for the scientific research community. In 2015, she released her textbook, Karp's Cell and Molecular Biology: Concepts and Experiments, with co-authors Gerald Karp and Wallace Marshal.Iwasa, JH and Marshall, W (December 2015). Karp's Cell Biology: Concepts and Experiments (8). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and Sons, Inc. In 2016, Iwasa published \\"The Scientist as Illustrator\\" in Trends Immunol.Iwasa JH (2016). \\"The Scientist as Illustrator\\". Trends Immunol, 37(4), 247-50. In this article, she elaborates on the roles of animation in science. She explains that animations help people to understand and process new ideas, communicate their theories and findings to their colleagues, and present information to the public in an engaging manner. She also explains that it is important for biologists to learn how to communicate visually so they can avoid borrowing old models to convey new concepts and ideas. == Recognition and honors == From 1999 to 2004, Iwasa was honored as a member of the NSF Graduate Fellowship. From 2006 to 2008, she was a member of the NSF Discpery Corps Postgraduate Fellowship.

It is also part of Wakayama-shi (City) Wakayama-ken (Prefecture) on the Kansai Peninsula, about a forty-minute train ride south of the Kansai International Airport, which is itself built on an artificial island. The nearest large city is Osaka, Japan, about an hour by train to the north. ==History== Wakayama Marina City is one of ten artificial islands in Wakaura Bay, a feature of the larger Osaka Bay. It was built from fill removed from a nearby mountain, and is disconnected from the coastline, except for two bridges to the mainland. There are also two saltwater canals crossing the island. Construction of the island began in April, 1989. It opened to the public in 1994. Marina City was originally developed by Matsushita Investment and Development Company, Ltd. (MID) and Wakayama Prefecture. It now supports a large marina, run by the Wakayama Marina City Yacht Club, the Wakayama Marina City Hotel (sometimes called the Royal Pines Hotel), the Kuroshio Ichiba (fish market), the Kuroshio Onsen (spa) and Porto Europa, a theme park created by MCA (Universal Studios).http://www.welcomekansai.com/wakayama/wakayama-city/wakayama-marina- city/overview At that time, both MID and MCA were owned by Matsushita Electric Industrial Company (MEI),https://www.britannica.com/topic/Matsushita-Electric- Industrial-Company-Ltd which has been rebranded to Panasonic since 2008.http://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/en080110-6/en080110-6.html MEI bought MCA in 1989. ==Porto Europa== The Porto Europa theme park was created by MCA Planning and Development (P&D;), which was Universal Studios' creative arm prior to its renaming as Universal Creative in 1997. The park was built using American specialty vendors and Japanese construction companies, and opened in July 1994. With a footprint of 4.5 acres (1.82109 hectare), Porto Europa consists of three themed areas: a French, an Italian and a Spanish town. There are three major attractions, a flume ride/dark ride combination, a motion simulator/film ride, and an indoor stunt show which is now closed, with the theater space empty. The smaller attractions at opening included a jazz club, disco, cinema, laser tag, and virtual reality installation. There are also retail outlets, restaurants, and street shows. High Dive High Dive ride under construction The High Dive ride is located in the Spanish Castle portion of the park. The load platform and splashdown pool are located outdoors, below the castle, with an observation deck/splash zone overhead. The ride vehicles ascend into the building, through an automated guillotine door, and into a spiraling fog vortex. Once at the top, the vehicle splashes down into a flume, which curves through the upper story of the building. This is the dark ride portion, which features a number of special effects including fog, blacklight effects, wind, animated figures and a 20 foot high parting waterfall. The vehicles then exit the building and curve around the rear of the castle before being released down the 65 foot slide into the splash pool. The ride system is by Arrow Dynamics. The ride is shown in the photograph reproduced to the right.TCI 1994, p. 48. Seafari Looking across plaza at Seafari Entry, French facade The Seafari simulator ride is in the French-themed village, and occupies the majority of the space in the main building. It features an extensive preshow, including a moon pool with a 29-foot submarine hanging over it, as if it has been launched and recovered from the deep below. Guests move from the moon pool area to the Aqualab where they meet Sammy, a CGI dolphin who appears to be swimming in a 13-foot tank at guests' eye level. From this space, guests move into a 15-passenger themed submarine, which is in the actual motion base theater. The Seafari motion bases are by Hughes Training.TCI 1994, p. 47. The ride film is a 3.5 minute Computer-generated imagery (CGI) short, in color, produced by Rhythm & Hues.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3710138/ At the time, it was considered one of the best CGI animated films ever made. The film was later used at PortAventura Park in Spain, renamed WorldSea Odyssey 4D. It opened there in 1999. Universal Studios owned PortAventura World at the time. Viking Adventure Viking Adventure set under stage lighting, center stage portion The Viking Adventure Stunt Show is also located inside the Spanish Castle, occupying four floors, from the basement to the third level, the same level as the dark ride portion of the High Dive. The theatre space is an indoor amphitheater, featuring curved, steeply raked seating. Immediately opposite is a 110 foot wide curved plaster cyclorama approximately three stories high. The stage and set sits between the two. The rendering in the center left of the opening program gives some sense of the scale. The show itself is actually an adaptation of the Western Stunt Show, formerly at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida. Some of the recycled stunts include the 8.5 ton falling wall, a rotating swaypole which swings an actor over the audience, an exploding well, a slide-for-life, again over the audience, and a high fall onto a wood pile. In the case of Viking Adventure, each stunt is larger and more extreme-looking than their predecessors. New are the moving iceberg, fast elevator, high bridge, and the pool and diving well. The action is supported by massive lighting, sound, pyrotechnic and special effects systems. The lighting, sound and show control systems were advanced state-of-the-art installations at the time. While theme park show control systems have long made use of industrial automation, such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), Viking Adventure was the first to make full use of MIDI Show Control to completely synchronize the mechanical effects, atmospheric effects, lighting console, pyrotechnic controller, and audio system.TCI 1994, p. 49.Kirby 1995, p. 69. Minor attractions Entry to Blue Tone and Club Coyote, Italian village facade Interior of Virtuality (virtual reality attraction) Porto Europa The smaller attractions in the French-themed area include Laser Tech, a laser tag installation, the International Cinema, which featured a 20-minute custom-produced cartoon at opening, and a large French restaurant. The Italian village, located between the French and Spanish buildings, contains the bulk of the retail, an Italian restaurant, Virtuality, a virtual reality gaming space, Monte Carlo, an arcade, Club Coyote, a western-themed discoth√®que, and Blue Tone, a live jazz venue. The Spanish castle, with two major attractions, houses only an American casual restaurant on the deck above High Dive. ==Iron Ride Park & Japan Expo== Part of Iron Ride Park At the time Porto Europa was completed, the area immediately behind the site and across the canal, was empty. During the grand opening, the Japan Expo was held on this site for 72 days.http://www.miami.us.emb- japan.go.jp/en/wakayama.htmlhttps://nippon.zaidan.info/seikabutsu/1996/00645/contents/086.htm The owner has since installed a non-themed ride park, which is often confused with Porto Europa proper. This newer area has more in common with an American state fair and carnival than a theme park. This area features iron rides, including two coasters, merry-go-rounds, water slides, and a Ferris wheel. The coasters are Round and Round (Meisho) and Pinestar (Vekoma). ==Kuroshio Ichiba== Kuroshio-Ichiba An ichiba is a market, of which there are two in Marina City. The larger is a \\"fisherman's wharf\\"-style fish market, which sells both fresh-caught fish and cooked fish dishes. There are small fire pits available both inside and outside to allow guests to cook their purchases on site. Aside from the food, the principal attraction is a whole tuna filleting show. The building itself features 6,767.08 square meters of floor space on four levels. The smaller market is an outdoor farmers market, featuring fruit and vegetables from the local farmers. ==Kuroshio Onsen== Kish√ª Kuroshio Onsen An onsen is a Japanese hot spring bathing facility that can have freestanding facilities or be associated with a nearby inn or hotel. The facility at Marina City (sometimes referred to as Kishu Kuroshio Onsen) is a large stand-alone attraction which can be used independent of the island's hotel and theme park. It features both indoor and outdoor facilities, which includes a sauna and rock bath. The hot spring water comes from a 1500-meter-deep well. ==Wakayama Marina City Yacht Club== The marina consists of approximately 1,100 in-water berths for craft up to 80 feet in length, and on-shore storage for smaller craft on trailers. The usual marina facilities are available, along with amenities including water, fuel, waste disposal and a powered boat lift. The marina opened in July, 1995. The harbor, and island generally, is protected by an extensive breakwater of approximately 920 meters in length. This breakwater is unique in Japan, as public access is permitted on extensive walkways and other public spaces, including a fishing pier. The design is called a \\"water- affinity\\" breakwater by the designer, and features vertical slit caissons and other safety features to allow safe access. == References == Category:Artificial islands of Japan Category:Resort towns Category:Resorts in Japan Category:Amusement park attractions ","title":"Wakayama Marina City"},{"id":"54231996","text":"Marumalarchi () is a 1956 Indian Tamil-language film directed by K.

This decay is extremely unlikely in the Standard Model of particle physics, as it changes the lepton number. Several new theories, especially supersymmetric ones, predict a much more frequent decay. Searching for this decay allows a test of these theories, even if they cannot be tested directly in other experiments like at the LHC. It has also been shown the experiment is sensitive to probe new light dark sector particles such as dark photon. Mu3e is constructed at the Paul Scherrer Institute. It is planned to create the world's most intense muon beam which will allow to analyze two billion decays per second. This rate is necessary to study more than 1016 muon decays in total. Important backgrounds are the decays \\\\mu^+ \\\\to e^+e^-e^+\\\\bar{ u_\\\\mu} u_e and \\\\mu^+ \\\\to e^+\\\\bar{ u_\\\\mu} u_e. To distinguish between signal and background, the detector has a spatial resolution better than 200 ¬µm, a time resolution better than 100 ps and an energy resolution better than 0.5 MeV for the individual electrons. To minimize multiple scattering, the detector is built as light as possible. Semiconductor detectors are used for the spatial and energy resolution, scintillator fibers provide a good timing resolution. The whole experiment is in a magnetic field of 1 Tesla to determine the energy of the particles based on their curvature radius. data taking is expected to begin in 2021. The full rate of two billion muons per second will not be reached before 2026.

The story resulted in efforts by the United States government to prosecute Johnston and other Tribune journalists, an effort what remains the only time the Espionage Act was used against journalists in the United States. No indictment was returned, and grand jury proceedings were sealed until 2016. ==Early life== Johnston was born on Palmers Island near Yamba, New South Wales. He joined the army at 14. After participating in the Gallipoli Campaign during World War I and ten years of working in gold mines in New Guinea, Johnston embarked on a three-year holiday that took him through the United States and Europe. He met dancer Barbara Beck in New York in 1936, married her, and took her on a European tour. While in France he coordinated press dispatches transmitted to and from Europe from a transmitter in Bordeaux, and later the Netherlands. In 1940 as the Netherlands were invaded he escaped to Lisbon and then London, where he worked as a correspondent for the Tribune, covering the Battle of Britain. In late 1940 he was called to Chicago where he impressed the newspaper with his knowledge of events in England. About this time he became an American citizen and was reunited with his wife, who had been repatriated from Paris. Although he was not a trained journalist he was eventually assigned to a press position aboard the USS Lexington in the Pacific. ==War correspondent== Johnston was the only member of the press aboard Lexington when the aircraft carrier took part in the Battle of the Coral Sea in early May 1942. Following the sinking of the aircraft carrier in the battle Johnston was repatriated aboard the USS Barnett with the Lexington executive officer, Commander Morton T. Seligman. Seligman had access to naval communications. One general dispatch in late May dealt with American appreciations of Japanese naval movements in the weeks leading up to the June 1942 Battle of Midway, that implied American foreknowledge of events. Johnston claimed he saw the dispatch, \\"a scrap of paper with doodling on it,\\" which he threw away. Johnston returned to Chicago and published 15 first-hand accounts of the events of the battle. He also wrote an account of the prelude to the Midway action that caused fears in the U.S. Navy that the Japanese would realize that their codes were broken. Tribune publisher Robert R. McCormick and President Franklin D. Roosevelt were longtime adversaries and the story infuriated Roosevelt. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox pressed Attorney General Francis Biddle to prosecute Johnston and others at the Tribune for harm to national security under the Espionage Act. A grand jury declined to indict, because revealing secrets was not then an offence, and also because the Navy could not release evidence for fear of further compromise. The grand jury testimony remained sealed for 75 years until it was released after successful court action by historians. In the meantime, Seligman was blamed by Navy investigators for the security breach, transferred to shore duty, and denied promotion. The investigation was the only instance in which reporters were ever under threat of prosecution under the Espionage Act. Johnston authored a book, Queen of the Flat-Tops, in 1942, that recounted his experiences aboard the USS Lexington. ==Later career== After the war Johnston was a correspondent in Latin America for two years, then returned to Chicago to manage the Tribune's promotions department. In 1955 he became manager of Robert McCormick's Cantigny estate. Johnston died of an apparent heart attack on September 13, 1962, aged 62. His obituary was published on the front page of the Tribune. ==References== Category:1962 deaths Category:Australian journalists Category:War correspondents of World War II Category:Chicago Tribune people Category:Australian military personnel of World War I Category:1900 births Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Stanley Johnston"},{"id":"54232057","text":"Shannon Campbell (born 24 September 1996) is an Australian rules footballer playing for the Brisbane Lions in the AFL Women's. ==Early life== Campbell was born in 1996 in Sunshine Coast, Queensland.

The team is operated by the Kunlun Red Star of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) and began operation in 2017. The KRS Vanke Rays play home games at Shenzhen Dayun Arena in Shenzhen. In response to heightened entry restrictions in Russia amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the team temporarily relocated to Stupino, a Russian town in the Moscow Oblast, for the 2020‚Äì21 season. The team‚Äôs temporary home arena is Ice Palace V. M. Bobrova, which they share with Kapitan Stupino of the Junior Hockey League (MHL). ==History== Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL): 2017‚Äì2019 The Kunlun Red Star women's ice hockey team was established on 5 June 2017, in an effort to improve the China women's national ice hockey team in preparation for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, in association the Kunlun Red Star men's team that had joined the Kontinental Hockey League the previous year. The team signed two players prior to the official announcement of the team in Finnish goaltender Noora R√§ty and American forward Kelli Stack. Red Star announced Digit Murphy, formerly of the Boston Blades as head coach. The team also signed Rob Morgan from Yale as associate head coach but soon after became the head coach of the second Chinese team, the Vanke Rays. With their first round pick in the 2017 CWHL Draft, the Red Star selected Noora R√§ty. The club proceeded to select Alexandra Carpenter in the second round, while the third round saw the franchise select National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) All-Star Shiann Darkangelo. On 21 October 2017, the Red Star competed in their first game, facing the Markham Thunder. Kelli Stack and Baiwei Yu both earned assists on the first goal in Kunlun Red Star history, scored by Zoe Hickel. During the regular season, teams that traveled to China played a three-game series against the Red Star in an effort to reduce travel costs. By season's end, Noora R√§ty was the CWHL's regular season goaltending champion, leading the league in goals against average. In addition, she tied for the league in shutouts with goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer of Les Canadiennes, with six. R√§ty also won the CWHL Goaltender of the Year award, the first European-born goaltender to capture the honor, and Kelli Stack led the CWHL in scoring, the first American-born player to win the Angela James Bowl. R√§ty was also the starting goaltender for the Red Star in the 2018 Clarkson Cup finals in Toronto. Facing the Markham Thunder, the final went into overtime, where Laura Stacey scored with 2:11 left in the 4-on-4 overtime as Markham prevailed by a 2‚Äì1 score for its first Clarkson Cup win. R√§ty recorded 37 saves in the game while Stack scored the only goal of the game for the Red Star. Head coach Digit Murphy left the team in May and Kunlun Red Star named Bob Deraney, formerly the head coach of the Providence Friars women's ice hockey team, as the new head coach on 12 June 2018. Prior to the 2018‚Äì19 season, the CWHL shut down the other Chinese team, the Vanke Rays. On 3 August 2018, Kunlun Red Star changed its name to Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays. Rob Morgan, who served as the head coach of the Vanke Rays during its only season was named as the general manager for the consolidated club. Kunlun Red Star brand was continued to be used by a separate hockey team for the Chinese national players as part of the national team's development in preparation for the 2022 Winter Olympics. In February 2019, the KRS Vanke Rays announced coach Deraney had stepped down and Mike LaZazzera would take over the rest of the season. The team missed qualifying for the final playoff spot via tiebreaker with the Toronto Furies. Following the season, the CWHL ceased operations citing that the league had become financially infeasible, but that the Chinese partnership had kept the league operating during the previous seasons.

Born in Washington, D.C. and raised in neighboring Oxon Hill, Maryland, Reynolds found inspiration in rap and began writing poetry at nine years old. His reading and writing focused on poetry for about 20 more years; he was 17 before he read his first novel cover to cover. He published several poetry collections before publishing his first novel in 2014, When I Was The Greatest, which won the Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe Award for New Talent. In the next four years, Reynolds wrote eight more novels, most notably the New York Times best-selling Track series‚ÄîGhost (2016), Patina (2017), Sunny (2018), Lu (2018),‚Äîand As Brave As You (2016), winner of the 2016 Kirkus Prize, the 2017 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work for Youth/Teen, and the 2017 Schneider Family Book Award. He also wrote a Marvel Comics graphic novel called Miles Morales: Spider-Man (2017). In 2017, Reynolds returned to poetry with Long Way Down, a novel in verse that was named a Newbery Honor book, a Printz Honor Book, and best young adult work by the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Awards. Reynolds was named as the Library of Congress' national ambassador for young people's literature in January 2020. It's a two year position to increase appreciation of youth literature. Reynolds is featured in a YouTube series entitled \\"Write. Rite. Right.\\" where he engages with young writers in an attempt to give them writing prompts to stretch their imagination and to learn to write authentically. == Early life, education and influences == Reynolds was born on December 6, 1983, in Washington, DC, and grew up just across Maryland border in Oxon Hill, a neighborhood where his mother, a special education teacher in a Maryland public school, could afford a house with a yard and enough space for Reynolds, his three siblings, and sometimes other extended family. At nine years old, Reynolds was inspired by Queen Latifah's 1993 album Black Reign to start writing poetry. Outside of her rap, few literary works spoke to his experience of urban life growing up as a black child and then teenager in the 1980s and 1990s, and he didn't start reading books until he was 17. In the meantime, Tupac and Biggie also formed major influences. One of Reynolds's earliest poems dealt with his grandmother's death in 1994 when he was 10. He wrote a few lines in an effort to console his mother, who printed the poem on the program for the funeral, and after that Reynolds wrote poems as each of his grandmother's siblings passed. Moved by these experiences of \\"the power of language\\", he continued to pursue poetry through high school, graduating from Bishop McNamara High School in 2000, and college, even as he received poor grades and discouragement from professors in his English courses at the University of Maryland (he ultimately graduated with a BA in English.) While an undergraduate, Reynolds met collaborator Jason Griffin, who became his roommate. Reynolds was also introduced to spoken word in this period and began performing, including eventually solo shows, and in 2001, his first book came out, a poetry collection called Let Me Speak. During college, Reynolds also worked at a DC bookstore chain called Karibu Books, which specialized in African-American literature. At Karibu he encountered prose that resonated with him for the first time, beginning at the age of 17 with Richard Wright's novel Black Boy, which Reynolds describes as the first novel he ever read. Enthralled with Wright's novel from the first page, Reynolds next began making his way through the great works of African-American literature on the store's shelves, reading James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, and Toni Morrison. While at Karibu he also encountered street fiction, also known as urban fiction, which is a literary genre Reynolds compares to rap's capacity for being \\"raw and honest. For some kids, this was their life.\\" == Writings == Reynolds does not start with a particular age audience in mind; instead he focuses on the trying to write the voice of his characters authentically and lets that dictate who the book would appeal to.Wilde, Susie. \\"Jason Reynolds\\". Audiofile, vol. 26, no. 6, April/May 2018, pp. 22‚Äì23. All of Reynolds' writings feature minority characters, which Reynolds sees as a reflection of the modern world.  Early works  After graduating from college, Reynolds moved to New York with a classmate, Jason Griffin; in 2005, the pair self-published a collaboration, collecting Griffin's visual art and Reynolds's poetry, called SELF. The book earned the pair an agent and then a book contract. Four years later they published My Name Is Jason. Mine Too.: Our Story. Our Way, a memoir about moving to New York to pursue their dreams, expressed through Reynolds's poetry and Griffin's illustrations. They published the book with the HarperTeen imprint of HarperCollins, working with editor Joanna Cotler (after Cotler retired, she referred him to Caitlin Dlouhy, who would become the editor on his next seven books). In the meantime, Reynolds moved home to DC in 2008 after losing his apartment in New York. He worked at a department store‚Äîthe Lord & Taylor in Wheaton, Maryland‚Äîto pay the bills, going to a Border's bookstore on his lunch break to see his book arrive on the shelf in 2009. Next he became a caseworker in a mental health clinic his father directed. Eventually Reynolds returned to New York, again working in retail while he applied to graduate school, unsuccessfully because of his college grades. Nevertheless he began writing a young adult novel‚Äî\\"often while standing at the cash register when business was slow\\" at the Rag & Bone store he managed‚Äîspurred by his friend Chris Myers, son of Walter Dean Myers and himself an author and illustrator. Reynolds had told Chris he had basically stopped writing, but Chris pointed out that with his father aging (the elder Myers died in 2014), there would soon be a shortage of new works written about young black children, particularly black boys. He suggested Reynolds look at some of his father's old works, and The Young Landlords particularly connected with Reynolds; the work gave Reynolds the confidence to \\"write in my voice, use my tongue, my language, my style, and write a story. Before that I always felt like I wasn‚Äôt good enough because I wasn‚Äôt Baldwin, or Toni Morrison, or Richard Wright,\\" but after reading Myers's work, \\"the floodgates were opened.\\" In 2014, Reynolds published When I Was The Greatest (with the Atheneum of Simon & Schuster), a young adult novel set in Reynolds' own neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. For the work, Reynolds won the 2015 Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe Award for New Talent from the American Library Association. In 2015, Reynolds published The Boy in the Black Suit, about a child grieving the loss of his mother. It won a Coretta Scott King Honor from the American Library Association.  All American Boys  Also in 2015, Reynolds published All American Boys, co-authored with Brendan Kiely. The book depicts a black teenager assaulted in a convenience store by a white police officer who wrongly suspected him of stealing. The book is written in two voices, with Reynolds writing from the point of view of the teenaged victim, Rashad Butler, in a hospital bed, while Kiely wrote the character Quinn Collins, a white teenager and family friend of the police officer, who witnessed the violent attack. In a review for The New York Times, Kelka Magoon found both main characters \\"successfully drawn\\" and called the novel \\"a book to be grappled with, challenged by, and discussed. 'All American Boys' represents one voice ‚Äî even better, two voices ‚Äî in a national conversation that must continue beyond its pages.\\" The book arose from personal conversations between Reynolds, who is black, and Kiely, who is white. The two met on a Simon & Schuster book tour in 2013, which coincided with the news that George Zimmerman had been acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin. Though strangers, Reynolds and Kiely began to share their feelings, each finding the other was \\"as frustrated as angry and as confused as I was\\", as Reynolds put it. A friendship developed and the conversations continued with increasing urgency; after a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, Kiely reached out to Reynolds to propose they write a book addressing police brutality and racial profiling. The book won the inaugural Walter Dean Myers Award from the We Need Diverse Books organization, as well as a Coretta Scott King Honor.  As Brave As You  In 2016, Reynolds published As Brave As You, which won the 2016 Kirkus Prize, the 2017 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work for Youth/Teen, the 2017 Schneider Family Book Award, and the 2017 Coretta Scott King Honor. The book describes two African-American brothers from Brooklyn who are sent to spend the summer with their grandfather in Virginia. In The Washington Post, reviewers said, \\"Reynolds deftly blends humor and heart through lively dialogue and spot-on sibling dynamics.\\"  Track series  The Track series follows a different protagonist in each novel, all of whom are members the Defenders, an elite track team. In 2016, Reynolds published Ghost, a National Book Award Finalist for Young People's Literature. Reviewing Ghost in The New York Times, Kate Messner said that in his title character, Reynolds has created a protagonist \\"whose journey is so genuine that he‚Äôs worthy of a place alongside Ramona and Joey Pigza on the bookshelves where our most beloved, imperfect characters live.\\" Ghost was published by the Caitlyn Dlouhy imprint of Atheneum on August 30, 2016. Three more books have followed in the series. Patina (2017) depicts another young star runner, Patina \\"Patty\\" Jones. Patty feels out of place at her nearly all-white private school. Patty and her younger sister live with their dead father's brother and his white wife because their birth mother is unable to take care of them after losing her legs due to diabetes. Critics noted the deft way the book handles many issues including teamwork and non-traditional family structures. This was the first book Reynolds had written with a female point of view.Corbett, Sue. \\"Jason Reynolds: Writing as Fast as He Can.\\" Publishers Weekly, vol. 264, no. 11, 13 Mar. 2017, p. 22. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=lkh&AN;=121811518&site;=lrc- plus. Reynolds wanted to write about the special burdens some teen girls assume in their families. In his New York Times review, Tom Rinaldi called the novel \\"excellent\\". The book was also well received by other reviewers, earning a starred review in Kirkus Reviews, School Library Journal, Horn Book Magazine, and Booklist. The third installment in the series, called Sunny, was released on April 10, 2018. Paste magazine named the audiobook, narrated by Guy Lockard, one of the 13 best of 2018 to date, saying, \\"The whole series is a must-listen, but Sunny is a particular treat\\" thanks to the Lockard's portrayal of the \\"lolling, goofball voice\\" of the novel's first-person protagonist. The fourth installment in the series, called Lu, was released October 23, 2018.  Miles Morales: Spider-Man  Reynolds is the author of Miles Morales: Spider-Man (2017),Johnston, Rich (July 23, 2016). \\"Jason Reynolds To Write A Miles Morales Spider-Man Young Adult Novel\\". Bleeding Cool.Herviou, Nicole (May 20, 2017). \\"Check out this exclusive art for the new Spider-Man novel\\". Mashable. a novel based on the Marvel Comics' Afro-Puerto Rican teen character. Reynolds has described his ambitions for the book as similar to Jordan Peele's approach to Get Out, namely to engage the audience with systemic social issues by \\"distill[ing] it down to a single family.\\" Speaking to School Library Journal, Reynolds said, \\"It was a trip to take these issues I care so much about and figure out what they look like as a person. What do they sound like? How do they dress? How do they act? What do they do?\\" Reviewing the book for the Washington City Paper, Kayla Randall said, \\"The result...was exceptional.\\"  Long Way Down  Reynolds's 2017 book, Long Way Down, is a novel written in verse. It describes a 15-year-old who sees his brother shot to death, drawing on Reynolds's experience of having a friend murdered when Reynolds was 19. Reynolds was moved to write the book by his visits to juvenile detention centers, where he frequently encounters children caught in a cycle of violence that, under slightly different circumstances, might have been his own: Reynolds has said that after his own friend's murder, he and other friends planned to seek revenge but never did so as the perpetrator wasn't conclusively identified, something he looked back on and \\"realized how lucky that was.\\" Long Way Down was named a 2018 Newbery Honor book by the American Library Association, a Printz Honor Book, best young adult work at the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Awards, a Walter Dean Myers Award from the We Need Diverse Books organization, a Coretta Scott King Honor, and a finalist for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work for Youth/Teens. An adaptation by Martine Kei Green-Rogers of Long Way Down was commissioned by the Kennedy Center and performed at the Kennedy Center's Family Theater in October/November 2018. In October 2020, a graphic novel addition of Long Way Down was published with art by Danica Novgorodoff. For Every One On April 10, 2018, Reynolds released For Every One, a work of poetry. He originally performed the poem at the unveiling of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial at the Kennedy Center. Two weeks later, Reynolds occupied three slots on The New York Times best-seller lists for children's literature: two on the young adult hardcover list (Long Way Down and For Every One), and one on the children's series list for the Track series.  \\"Ten Things I've been Meaning to Say to You\\"  Reynold's published a list for teenagers with 10 things he thought they should know about life and their futures. It was posted on May 28, 2018 on Powell's Book Blog.  Look Both Ways: A Tale Told in Ten Blocks  Look Both Ways was published on October 8, 2019. The story is told across ten blocks in different perspectives as middle schoolers walk home from school. On the day of its release, Look Both Ways became a finalist for the National Book Award and later made the New York Times Best Sellers List. Jason Reynolds explained that he wanted to explore kids' autonomy in this book, saying, ‚ÄúIt is a time when they are unsupervised, Reynolds said, and they ‚Äòget to learn about the world on their own, for better or for worse.‚Äô‚Äù  Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You  Reynolds announced Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You in August 2019 in collaboration with Ibram X. Kendi. Releasing in March 2020, Reynold's book is an adaptation of Kendi's book Stamped from the Beginning, which won the National Book Award in 2016. The book is for teens and young adults and serves to start a conversation among them about race and racism in America. Reynolds says, ‚ÄúI think that we have a rare opportunity to give the historical context of how we made it here today. This is the definitive history of race in America from the 1400s to today. It isn‚Äôt about how to fix it per se. It's just about contextualizing why it is the way it is.‚Äù ==Personal life== Reynolds moved back to Washington, DC from Brooklyn in 2016. == Awards and honors == *2015: John Steptoe New Talent Award *2016: finalist, National Book Award for Young People's Literature *2016: Walter Dean Myers Award *Coretta Scott King Award honor in 2016, 2017, and 2018 *2017 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work for Youth/Teen *2018: Newbery Honor *2018: Printz Honor Book *2018: finalist, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work for Youth/Teens *2018: special guest of the Berlin Library FestivalBeaner lives matter(2020) *2018: Edgar Award, best young adult work *2018: Luchs des Jahse (Germany) for Ghost.

He also suggested a \\"new international framework\\" to allow \\"certain democratic countries‚Äîwith similar values and high standards of oversight, transparency and privacy protection\\" to act on urgent counter-terrorism requests. Sheinwald said that the British still struggled to obtain access to data, but since he was appointed, cooperation on the most urgent requests, \\"particularly in the areas of counter-terrorism and other threat-to-life and child-protection cases\\" with the US companies had increased. He remarked: \\"The companies' assistance in these cases has improved, showing the value of active engagement with them.

At the time, it was thought that this bilateral would scrap the need to revive the snooping powers from the 2012 communications data bill which was to require British ISPs to share data from US firms passing over their networks, and so to enforce their compliance.

Palestine has some of the highest rate of solar water heating in the region, and there are a number of solar power projects. A number of issues confront renewable energy development; a lack of national infrastructure and the limited regulatory framework of the Oslo Accords are both barriers to investment. ==Solar power== Solar potential of Palestine It has been estimated that solar sources have the potential to account for 13% of energy usage in the Palestinian Territories. Over half of all households in Palestine utilise solar energy heaters, although only 3% of houses depend on it as their main source. A 710kw photovoltaic plant was commissioned in September, 2014 in the vicinity of Jericho; it is the largest plant in Palestine to date. Research has indicated that, although a very high percentage of Palestinian houses are connected to the central grid, powering remote villages with small-scale photovoltaic systems would be more economically feasible than extending the grid. Israeli authorities seized a solar/diesel hybrid electric system from the Palestinian village of Jubbet ad-Dib in July, 2017. The system was funded by the Dutch government and installed by joint Israeli-Palestinian organisation Comet-ME, leading the Dutch Foreign Ministry to lodge a complaint. The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories told reporters that the solar panels were erected ‚Äúwithout the necessary permits, and that stop work orders had previously been sent to the village authorities,‚Äù although a Haaretz report indicated that the confiscation orders were only delivered during the raid, meaning there was no chance to contest them in court. Residents of the village, located in Area C between a number of Israeli settlements, had been attempting to implement and gain approval for solar power projects since 2009. ==Wind power== It has been estimated that wind energy has the potential to account for 6.6% of energy usage in the Palestinian Territories. ==Biomass== About half of the Palestinian population - mainly in the rural areas, refugee camps, and Bedouins of North and South Governorates - are exposed daily to harmful emissions and other health risks from biomass burning that typically takes place in traditional stoves without adequate ventilation. The majority of individuals exposed to enhanced concentrations of pollutants are women and young children. ==National policy== The Palestinian Energy Authority (PEA) published a 'General Renewable Energy Strategy' in 2012, aiming for 10% of total domestic energy production and 5% of total energy consumption to come from renewable sources by 2020. ==Barriers== There are a number of barriers to development of renewable energy resources in Palestine, including regulatory issues resulting from the Israeli occupation, and this meant the government was unable to achieve its target of 25 megawatts by 2015. However, renewable energy has a large potential to reduce reliance on imported energy and address a number of social issues. ==ReferencesExternal links== ","title":"Renewable energy in Palestine"},{"id":"54232547","text":"At least two vessels have been named Windham (or Wyndham): * Windham was launched in 1800 and made six voyages for the British East India Company before the Chilean Navy purchased her in 1818.

Since her childhood she had composed many songs but had never played in a club or officially released a record. Maria came from a worker-farmer family in which the primary objective was the concreteness of a safe job. So as a teenager she entered the world of work, initially working only during the summer season, then after she turned 20 she began working permanently to pay the rent and to support her studies at the University of Philosophy in Trento and then the specialization in Verona. In those years she never stopped making music but she limited it to her spare time and rather secretly. Around 2004 Maria saw on MTV Italia the rapper J-Ax talking about the online sharing platform for musicians names MYSPACE. Maria decided to join the site under the name of Reiniku. With that name Maria put many of her pieces online and for the first time she came into contact with many other Italian and international musicians and started new collaborations. In the end of 2008, Maria Devigili started to embrace the idea of dedicating herself to the world of music but the work activities to pay rent and the university specialization attendance still took a large part of her time. Towards the end of 2018 pushed by a friend, one late evening under the arcades of Piazza Maggiore in Bologna she played some of her songs on the street for the first time. When someone left 5 Euros in her case, Maria realized that perhaps she could make her songs and pay the rent at the same time. ==The Beginnings of Busking and Life on the Road== And so, in 2009, she left her job to began to dedicate herself entirely to music, first by doing street concerts and immediately afterwards club shows. She also stopped her studies at the University, focusing all of her time and energy on her new career. In that time she was living between Bologna, in the north center of Italy considered \\"the music city\\", an open-mind environment, full of artists, and another city Trento her family's town, a smaller and quiet town not too far from Germany. Famous for the Council of Trent. At the same time, she was participating in numerous contests for emerging songwriters, both local and national. From the beginning Maria immediately attracted attention in the local scene of Trento, When she was asked the question in an interview for a local contest for emerging artists \\"What is jour job? she answered: \\"I'm a musician, I play my songs in the street to pay my rent\\". Manuel Codignoni \\"Maria, vita on the road\\" TGR \\"Il Settimanale\\" 4/3/2010 What shocked the Balogna and Trentino public was also the fact that she was a female musician playing her songs in the streets or in some bars all over Italy, using just the train as a means of transportation and without any roadie support. At the time in Italy it was very rare to even hear about female singer-songwriters and especially in the small town of Trento. For this reason, even before releasing her first official record, in 2011 Maria was already a name in the local scene and often on the newspapers and even on the local TVs. ==From the Premio Pavanello to the Release of the First EP== In early September 2010, Maria Devigili won the Premio Pavanello, national contest for young songwriters Marika Damaggio \\"Premio Pavanello\\" Marika Damaggio \\" Pavanello a Maria Devigili: i Poeti la mia ispirazione The prize was the production of an EP with the label Gulliver Studio Production, which culminated with her first official record release, La Semplicit√†, the 20 November 2011 Katja Casagranda 11.14.2011 \\"La Semplicit√† √® il modo d'essere di Maria Devigili\\" . ==2012: The change of the sound and Motori e Introspezioni== In early 2012 Maria Devigili bought her first electric guitar.

The album was recorded in June 2012 at the Igloo Audio Factory in Correggio (Reggio Emilia) during the days of the Northern Italian Earthquakes. Motori e introspezioni contains the cover of Franco Battiato ‚Äôs song ‚ÄúAria di Rivoluzione\\" and the musical adaption of the poem \\"L‚ÄôAlbatros\\" by Charles Baudelaire. The album was recorded and arranged by Andrea Sologni of Gazebo Penguins and it was released in the autumn 2012 with the digital distribution by Orchard and Audioglobe. ==The Second Album: The Increase in Notoriety in the Italian Indie Scene== During the summer of the 2014 Maria Devigili launched an online fundraising campaign for the production of her second album La Trasformazione. The campaign was launched on the digital platform Music Raiser. The platform was founded by Giovanni Gulino, leader of the historical alternative Italian band Marta sui Tubi and the dj and producer Tania Varuni. The campaign was successful and during the autumn Maria recorded the album in Bologna at the Studio Spaziale with the audio engineering Enrico Baraldi and Rettura.

Maria won the first prize which consisted of playing on the workers' day Festival on May 1 in Piazza Maggiore in Bologna. On that occasion Maria came in contact with Giuvazza, guitarist and producer of Finardi, with which she began a collaboration. Their first works together materialized after some months with the production of the song Inconsapevoli on which Giuvazza did the artistic production. They proposed the song to the popular contest Sanremo Giovani (Sanremo Young) but the song was refused. Giuvazza did the artistic production of other subsequent songs of the songwriter and which are found in her third album Tempus Fugit.

It shares the zip code and postal address of the neighboring village of Bronxville. It was described in a 2001 New York Times article, as ‚Äú... a snug suburban neighborhood in the northeast corner of Yonkers, is in many ways a community frozen in time. The subdivision of narrow and meandering streets exists today mostly unchanged since it was built in the early 20th century...\\" Approved as a subdivision in 1913 and granted landmark status by the city of Yonkers in 1996, the 104-acre, 143-home neighborhood has historical and current associations with the arts, sports, and business. Cedar Knolls is a former artist colony, and composer Jerome Kern and actor Charlie Chaplin each called Cedar Knolls their home for a period in their lives. Residents from multiple professions and all areas of business are now part of the community. == Early history ==  The Lenape Nation  What is today considered Cedar Knolls was originally part of the hunting, fishing, and farming grounds of the Wiechquaeskeck tribe of the Lenape nation. The Lenape were once sovereign over a vast domain stretching along the Middle Atlantic coast from New York to Delaware Bay, between Long Island Sound and the Atlantic coast to the Delaware River valley. This tribe made its settlements on the banks of the rivers that flowed between the surrounding hills and on knolls that held special significance for the Lenape. One of their longhouses actually served as a wintertime school and was located on a knoll overlooking the present site of the Patricia A. Dichiaro School on Bronxville Road, then a major trail.  Colonial era  In 1524, the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano ventured up the estuarial inner harbor of New York and wrote about \\"the river of the steep hills\\". It was another 75 years before Henry Hudson, sailing for the Dutch East India Company, ventured farther up the river that today bears his name. Adrian Van der Donck was issued a royal grant to territory along the banks of the Hudson River encompassing present-day Yonkers. The name \\"Yonkers\\" is generally thought to be derived from a variant of Van der Donck's honorific, Donck-Heer (or Jonkheer). Soon after the surrender of the New Amsterdam colony to the British in 1664, Frederick Philipse was issued a royal grant to the Van der Donck land. On his estate, Philipse built a large manse (restored as Philipse Manor Hall) and attracted settlers to develop the town along the banks of the Hudson River. During the sixteen and seventeen hundreds, Yonkers flourished and became a significant coastal city supported by farming, light manufacturing, and river-based trading. In 1760, pioneer settler Eleaser Hart bought 154 acres of farmland which included a small house erected in 1725 and named it the Cedar Knolls Farm. Incorporating the original house, he erected a larger farmhouse that still stands on Bronxville Road. In present-day terms, the Cedar Knolls Farm extended from the Bronx River west to today's Birch Brook Road and from Palmer Road north to an east-west line corresponding to today's Wiltshire Street.  19th century  Completed in 1852, the New York and Harlem Railroad ran northward from New York City, passing through the Harlem Valley and skirting the eastern boundary of Yonkers. Originally planned to be laid down along what is now Central Park Avenue, the rail bed was diverted through Tuckahoe mid- construction to facilitate the shipment of heavy loads from the highly regarded Tuckahoe marble quarries, active in the years 1818 to 1930. The pure white Tuckahoe marble was used to build the United States Capitol and St. Patrick's Cathedral. The white marble can be seen locally in the 1911 County Bridge where Pondfield Road West crosses the Bronx River and the Bronx River Parkway. Train stations were established every mile or so along the line, and villages developed around them. One of these stations was built in 1844 at the site of a river ford, Underhill's Crossing, which was later renamed Bronxville. Trains ran twice a day in each direction, 90 minutes each way. In 1876, Nathaniel Valentine bought the Cedar Knolls Farm and subdivided it. In the early 1880s, the land between present day Cedar Knolls and Bronxville was subdivided and named Armour Villa. Armour Villa was the first of three artist colonies to be established around the Bronxville train station. The second artist colony was Lawrence Park, developed in Bronxville by William Van Duzer Lawrence in 1889. The third and final artist colony was Cedar Knolls. Its provenance resurfaced in an offering of 1893‚Äì94 that referred to ‚Äú266 Choice Lots Being a Part of Cedar Knolls at Bronxville in the City of Yonkers.‚Äù This subdivision was generally bounded by present-day Bronxville Road, Chatfield Road, Bayberry Street, and Palmer Road. The subdivision offering was never fully actualized as planned, and it contained a large, blank portion referred to as Plat A. Early in the next century, Plat A was to be subdivided as present-day Cedar Knolls. Cedar Knolls in the late 1880s and early 1890s was considered a frontier outpost. The only nearby thoroughfares, Bronxville Road and Palmer Road, were mere paths unconnected with the hamlet of Bronxville and only vaguely connected with Yonkers. There were no other roads, no utilities, no services, and no stores. Just a farm and a train stop, a rowboat's ride away.  20th and 21st centuries  Between 1902 and 1910, title to the Plat A area changed hands several times, finally subdivided as The Cedar Knolls at Bronxville in the City of Yonkers. Map No. 2026, dated May 18, 1910, illustrates a neighborhood nearly identical to today's Cedar Knolls. The boundaries are the same, with the later addition of Adele Lane constituting the only modification to the 1910 plan. By 1911, the subdivision plan was illustrated on a Yonkers city map. Illustrated complete with sewer lines were the first three roads to be built: Swain Street (now Pondfield Road West), Dellwood Road, and Beachbrook Avenue (now Birch Brook Road). Marketing of the subdivision by the ultimate developer of Cedar Knolls, the Merrilees Corporation, first appeared in a local paper (The News) in 1912. By 1912, extensive excavation of an extension of Swain Street allowed for a connection to Pondfield Road in Bronxville. Swain Street was then renamed Pondfield Road West. This coincided with the building of a stately stone bridge, the 1911 County Bridge, over the Bronx River, providing a very marketable access point to and from the Bronxville train station. A second stone bridge over the newly completed Bronx River Parkway was constructed nearby in 1917. Also at this time, a shanty town between the bridges and Cedar Knolls was replaced by the tall brick apartment buildings present along Pondfield Road West. The imposing Colonial Revival house at 98 Pondfield Road West was the first house built in Cedar Knolls. Work on the house had begun by 1911 and was completed in 1913. Other lovely houses quickly followed in an era characterized by craftsmanship, classical lines, and proper proportion. In the 1920s and 1930s, Cedar Knolls had to accommodate its own growth. Automobile traffic and speeds were addressed for the first time with traffic signs and speed limits. The illumination from the original gas-lit street lamps proved inadequate, and in the 1920s the lamps were replaced by the first electric streetlights. With increasing sources of fire, the newly established homeowners association, Cedar Knolls Colony, successfully petitioned the city to build Fire Station 11 at the corner of Bronxville Road and Bayberry Street in 1921, and to install the first fire hydrants in the neighborhood in 1935. The source of the water for the hydrants comes from a 20-foot diameter aqueduct cut through the underlying granite about 250 feet below Cedar Knolls, completed in 1942 as part of the Kensico-Hillview Water Tunnel. In the early 1950s, fearing an onslaught of tract houses being built in Cedar Knolls, the Cedar Knolls Colony successfully petitioned the city to zone Cedar Knolls as S75 lots requiring a minimum 75-foot frontage and 7,500 square feet of acreage for all new construction. Fifty years later, Cedar Knolls Colony would investigate a special zoning overlay to restrict the construction of overly large homes, to keep the neighborhood consistent. In its first 50 years, many of the homeowners in the artist colony of Cedar Knolls were artists, broadly defined. There were noted actors, film studio executives, artists, musicians, lyricists, playwrights, writers, publicists, architects, horticulturists, landscape designers, and dress designers. What became known as modern Broadway began with Jerome Kern, one of the most prolific of American songwriters and playwrights and an early resident of the Cedar Knolls community. He wrote most of his musicals and songs in the library of his home at 107 Dellwood Road. Before Kern, musicals were disjointed vaudevillian reviews. After Kern, Broadway musicals established a story line, often containing pointed social commentary, with music to match. In 1927, he wrote Show Boat, considered to be an American masterpiece and a milestone in the history of musical theater. Cedar Knolls has also been host to many sports figures and people associated with sports, especially during the 1940s and 1950s. Ford C. Frick, ghost writer for Babe Ruth, president of the National League (1934‚Äì1951), founder of the Baseball Hall of Fame (1939), and Commissioner of Baseball (1951‚Äì1965), lived on Dellwood Road during much of this time. Prior to the invention of reliable stop-action photography, artist Lon Keller (Beechmont Ave.) pioneered the drawing of sports figures in action poses for magazines such as Sports Illustrated. He also designed the world-famous NY Yankees logo, incorporating a baseball bat and top hat; Lee McPhail, owner of the Yankees in 1949, wanted a patriotic post-war Yankee logo, and he got it with Lon's use of Uncle Sam's top hat with a red, white, and blue motif. The Yankees needed good legal representation then and attorney Tony Caputo (Pondfield Road West) provided the team with it for many years. In 2004, the triangular park at the confluence of Pondfield Road West and Dellwood Road was officially renamed Darcy Plaza, in memory of Dwight Darcy, a resident who died on September 11, 2001, in the attack on the World Trade Center. In 2005, Cedar Knolls was awarded a state grant for neighborhood beautification. The funds were used to design and purchase period street signs and portal signs. Two bronze plaques were installed on the stone columns on Birch Brook Road. Street signs and posts were installed on each corner borrowing their design from the one remaining gas light stanchion that still stood in Cedar Knolls after the other gas lights had been turned off and removed in the 1920s. == Cedar Knolls Colony == In the spring of 1918, six of the first homeowners met to form the second-oldest homeowners‚Äô association in the City of Yonkers and officially named their association The Cedar Knolls Colony. The original six were William Riggs, Gardner Taylor, Thomas Massey, A. Carlyle Porteus, A. H. Babcock, and Wentworth Hicks, at whose house on Pondfield Road West they first met to form the association. There they elected William Riggs the first president and wrote the first bylaws. The association was initially open only to male residents, with membership by invitation only; therefore, not all homeowners were members. Each prospective member was sponsored for membership and was required to pay an initiation fee. Mandatory annual dues were $5 (equivalent to $100 in today's currency). Special assessments were sometimes imposed for special projects. With time, changing social norms brought a more relaxed style to the Colony. By the 1980s, the formal bylaws gave way to consensus guidelines and practices, membership became available to any adult resident, and dues became voluntary contributions. During its first 50 years, Cedar Knolls Colony was known for its social gatherings and seasonal dances. Cedar Knolls homeowners took great interest in horticulture, gardening, and landscaping. The Colony coordinated directly with five garden clubs in Bronxville and Yonkers and less formally with other clubs in the county. In 1920, the association's newly adopted name was engraved on a sterling silver Tiffany trophy, designed and executed by Louis Comfort Tiffany himself, presented to that year's inaugural winner of the Cedar Knolls Colony Golf Tournament. The trophy allows for perpetual engravings of the names of each year's champion ‚Äì and for a ceremonial swig of champagne by all the contestants. The trophy cup was donated to the Colony by its first winner, Jerome Kern, and is generally known as the Cedar Knolls Colony Jerome Kern Cup. The tournament has been held annually since 1920 with a few interruptions. After World War II, the Cedar Knolls Colony found a way to combine its gardening and gala activities. In 1949, the National Tulip Society designated Cedar Knolls the Tulip Center of Westchester County. The Associated Bulb Growers of Holland donated 5000 tulip bulbs to Cedar Knolls residents for the cultivation of tulips and held an annual tulip contest in Cedar Knolls, which lasted for 25 years. There is no longer a golf club along the western edge, but thanks to the Cedar Knolls Colony, part of that area is now home to a branch of the Yonkers public library and a park with sports fields and tennis courts. Pondfield Road West does not connect with the busy retail thoroughfare Central Park Avenue as originally planned, and the neighborhood remains relatively secluded. To preserve this unique neighborhood, every generation of Cedar Knolls homeowners has indeed \\"cooperated with one another in matters pertaining to mutual welfare.\\" == Architecture and landscape == At the end of the 19th century, controlled, picturesque settings for planned landscapes called the Aesthetic Movement became popular. A reaction to American society's increasing industrialization and urbanization, this movement sought to emphasize the bucolic and restorative qualities of rural home life. In these planned rural landscapes, nature was manipulated for aesthetic purposes. Typically, the often-hilly topography was accommodated by meandering roads and lanes organized to enhance already scenic views, in what was called the curvilinear plan. The curvilinear plan was to become a primary element for developing Cedar Knolls. Starting in 1910, the Cedar Knolls subdivision was executed as planned, embracing a unique period of American architecture, utilizing a curvilinear plan, and resulted in the architectural cohesiveness that exists in Cedar Knolls to this day. The pink granite of Cedar Knolls is distinctive in both quality and color due to the presence of serpentine, an ochreous mineral that laces the rock. This characteristic stone is very apparent throughout the neighborhood in many foundations, fa√ßades, and retaining walls. The soils of Cedar Knolls are composed of the products of decay and erosion of the original igneous and sedimentary rocks. This debris of disintegration was added to residual soils and clays, constituting a soil combination of many ingredients favorable to the growth of plant life. In general, the soil is acidic and requires at intervals the addition of lime and magnesium for bountiful plant growth. The quality of the soil plus the elevation and excellent drainage of the area create a favorable condition for an abundance of plants and trees.  American Period House  Cedar Knolls was planned and primarily developed during the era of the American Period House, 1910 to 1930. It initiated the modern concepts of an open interior plan and a close relationship between house and private recreational garden, clad in a variety of revival architectural styles. The plan of the Period House reflected a change in lifestyle for the middle class American, coinciding with a move away from a household staff. Rooms in a Period House are generally rectangular in plan and are larger than those of typical Victorian-era houses, although there are fewer of them. A standard size Period House in Cedar Knolls customarily has a living room, dining room, and kitchen on the ground floor, with a modest entry hall. A large Period House in the district incorporates a more formal entry space, a second porch, a library or den, and additional bedrooms and baths. The Period House celebrated the arrival of the automobile and the informal freedom for American society that it ushered in. Period Houses in the district constructed pre-1920 are characterized by a detached garage, often a mini-version of the house. By the mid-1920s, garages were an integral element of the house, possibly owing to the improved safety of internal combustion engines. Cedar Knolls is an excellent example of Period House plans incorporating Period Revival Styles in their fa√ßade architecture. Period Revival Styles within Cedar Knolls are primarily Tudor Revival, Colonial Revival, and French Norman Revival, with a smattering of Norman Cottage Revival, Dutch Colonial Revival, Cotswald Cottage Revival, Italian Renaissance Revival, and Mediterranean Colonial Revival. In many instances, Cedar Knolls houses represent eclectic blends of these styles such that no two houses are alike, and few houses exhibit just one style Nearly 80% of the houses in the district were constructed prior to the Depression and World War II, which together interrupted almost all construction in the Knolls for the following 15 years. Consequently, unlike many communities, Cedar Knolls represents an intact and cohesive residential neighborhood populated with Period House, Revival Style residences for the comfortable middle class homeowner. For these reasons, it is architecturally and historically significant. Moreover, Period House communities such as Cedar Knolls became models for post-war suburban communities all across America. == Notable residents == * Jerome Kern * Charlie Chaplin * Ford C.

He has received extensive transmissions of the Nyingma lineages, and teaches in the spirit of the nonsectarian Rim√© movement. He is also the first incarnate lama to earn a Ph.D. in the West, having completed a doctoral program in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies at Harvard University. Widely recognized for his ability to modernize ancient Buddhist teachings for today's challenges, he is dedicated to the value of education in bringing wisdom to life. To realize this vision, he has founded organizations throughout Asia and the United States. Born into a Nepalese Sherpa family, Trungram Gyalwa was recognized by Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa, as the 4th Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche, the reincarnation of the 3rd Trungram Gyalwa. == Birth and recognition == Trungram Gyalwa was born on the mountain of Tsari, near Daporijo, Arunachal Pradesh, India, into a Sherpa family from Nepal. As an infant, Trungram Gyalwa had a transparent abdomen, which eventually led his parents to take him to seek out the 16th Karmapa, supreme head of the Kagyu lineage. In a public audience, even before his parents had a chance to speak with the Karmapa, the 16th Karmapa recognized the child on sight as the ‚Äúintentionally reborn‚Äù manifestation (tulku) of the 3rd Trungram Gyalwa. The 16th Karmapa explained Trungram Gyalwa's marking as a symbol of his predecessor's realization of Mahamudra practice. The 16th Karmapa proclaimed the boy as the 4th Trungram Gyalwa, with the formal name of ‚ÄúTrungram Gyalwa Tulku Karma Tenpai Gyaltsen Trinlay Kunkhyab Pal Sangpo\\" and bestowed him with dharma robes. He gave him Buddhist refuge vows, and wrote a long-life prayer for him. Trungram Gyalwa was enthroned at Rumtek Monastery, the main seat of the Karmapa, in Sikkim, India.  Names  Gyalwa Trulku was the name of the first incarnation of the Trungram Gyalwa lineage. Gyalwa was his personal name; Trulku refers to incarnation. Since this first Trugram Gyalwa belonged to the Trungram teaching lineage and was well respected by people, his full name was Trungram Gyalwa Trulku Rinpoche. This name is quite long, so he often used Gyaltrul, the shortened form of Gyalwa Trulku, making the name Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche. The 4th Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche is also known as Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche, and, to a lesser degree, Drungram Gyaltrul, Tenpai Gyaltsen, Gyalwa Lama, and Gyalwa Trulku. He himself prefers to write Trungram Gyalwa, although his official name is either H. E. Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche or H. E. Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche. In the west, he often uses Trungram Gyalwa Rinpoche, PhD; worldwide, his students simply call him Rinpoche. == Education ==  Early years in Rumtek  Trungram Gyalwa's studies began at Rumtek Monastery at age three. There he received a traditional monastic education, followed by studies on Tibetan and Buddhist literature and philosophy at Jamyang Khang school. He took the vows of a novice monk (getsul), but did not later take full ordination, and returned his novice vows before attending university.  Nalanda  Trungram Gyalwa entered the Karma Shri Nalanda Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies, in Rumtek, where he studied the traditional fields of Buddhist philosophy, logic, epistemology, soteriology, cosmology, codes, debates, history, poetry, Sanskrit, literature, medicine, and meditation. During his time at Nalanda, he, with others, helped to set up and run the Students' Welfare Union of Nalanda. He also served as one of the three main teaching assistants of Nalanda Institute. He earned the title of Ka-rabjampa (\\"one with unobstructed knowledge of scriptures,\\" the Kagyu equivalent of the Geluk Geshe degree) from Nalanda, and also received the degree of Acharya, or Master of Buddhist Philosophy, with First Class Honors, from Sampurnanant Sanskrit University, in Varanasi, India.  Teachings from all traditions  Reflecting the non-sectarian approach of his predecessor, Trungram Gyalwa's teachers come from all four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism (Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, Geluk). He studied with some of the greatest masters of recent years, particularly the 16th Karmapa and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. He received most of his teachings and empowerments from these two Rinpoches and from Khenchen Trinley Paljor Rinpoche (appointed by the 16th Karmapa to be Trungram Gyalwa's tutor). His other Buddhist teachers include the Dalai Lama, Sakya Trizin, the late Ugyen Tulku Rinpoche, the late Khamtrul Rinpoche, Trulshik Rinpoche, the late Kalu Rinpoche, the late Salje Rinpoche and the late Gendun Rinpoche. He studied extensively under Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche and Khenpo Choedrak Rinpoche.Trungram Gyalwa earned his Ph.D from Harvard University in 2004.  Further studies  Besides traditional Buddhist education, Trungram Gyalwa studied liberal arts at Kirkwood College in Iowa, USA, and later at Newbury College in Massachusetts, USA. He worked with Professor Donald Lopez as a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan, and was involved in a teaching exchange program and sutra translation there. Later, he studied Chinese for six months in Taiwan at the Language Learning Center of National Taiwan Normal University. He is fluent in Tibetan, English, Nepali, Sherpa, Chinese, and has a good knowledge of Sanskrit, Hindi and French.  Harvard Ph.D.  Trungram Gyalwa entered the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences as a doctoral student in the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies. His concentration was on Indo- Tibetan Buddhist Studies with special emphasis on comparative studies. He was awarded a Ph.D. in 2004, with a dissertation on Gampopa, the most prominent disciple of Milarepa, focusing on Gampopa's seminal role in the development of the Kagyu School of Tibetan Buddhism.\\"Archived copy\\".

He taught the essence of Naropa's Mahamudra and the practice of Avalokiteshvara. The next year he gave a teaching on the Thirty-seven Practices of Bodhisattvas to the monks of Rumtek, praised by all the khenpos and rinpoches present. Soon after, he performed his first initiation, transmitting the essence of the Kagyupa Long Life Buddha practice. Trungram Gyalwa has given teachings and initiations and helped create groups and centers for Buddhist studies in many countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bhutan, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan and the United States.

During this short visit, he took measures to preserve the Nyengyu tradition - a special oral lineage of Trungram Monastery that was down to only a few transmission holders at that time. For three years, Trungram Gyalwa served as the President of Dharmodaya, the National Buddhist Association of Nepal. In that capacity, he represented Nepal at the 1998 International Buddhist Conference near Sydney, Australia. He is a lifetime advisor to the organization.Dharmodaya Sobha Central Executive Committee 2014-2017, Dharmodaya website. Accessed June 5, 2017.  Teaching wellbeing  In 2004, with his support, monks of the Trungram tradition founded Dharmakaya, a US-based Buddhist church, for the express purpose of preserving and sharing the wisdom teachings. In 2017, an affiliated center opened, offering long- and short-term retreats and the study of Dharma; it is known as the Dharmakaya Center for Wellbeing in Cragsmoor, New York. The Center is based on the fundamental principle that emotional and physical wellbeing are interconnected and equally essential, and serves to foster both through meditative practices.  Philanthropic activities  Early on, Trungram Gyalwa founded the United Trungram Buddhist Foundation, first in Nepal, followed by several other countries, and later, the United Trungram Buddhist Fellowship (UTBF). These organizations share three goals: To preserve the wisdom teachings; to be a vehicle for educational activities; and to help those who most need it, with special emphasis on supporting disadvantaged children in Nepal and other underdeveloped countries. The foundation has been working to fulfill these goals. In the wake of the 2015 earthquake that devastated Nepal, Trungram Gyalwa immediately organized aid for the villagers of Barpak VDC, Gorkha,Trungram Foundation Actively Involved in Barpak, Kathmandu Post, May 30, 2015. the epicenter of the earthquake, providing food, medicine and temporary shelters. He then founded Buddhist Relief Services, with the mission to bring relief to the victims of disaster.  Promoting peace and unity  Trungram Gyalwa inspecting the Buddha statue for the World Center for Peace and Unity, Lumbini Another of Trungram Gyalwa's projects, the World Center for Peace and Unity, at Buddha Shakyamuni's birthplace in Lumbini, Nepal, is intended as a locus for the growth of an all-encompassing non-sectarian spirit, and an example of 21st century Buddhism contributing to a greener world and reviving ancient art and culture. Inaugurated in 2011, it is located in a special development zone connected to the Lumbini UNESCO World Heritage Site. Unlike the other monasteries, it was specifically conceived to be a non-sectarian center for any Buddhist, or non-Buddhist, visitors to Lumbini, regardless of tradition or lineage, and especially for those who were not represented by the nations who built the other monasteries.Green Buddhist Monastery Rises in Nepal, earthtechling.com, March, 2011.

TIA is a highly regarded private English Medium day and boarding school near Kathmandu, Nepal. Its more than 800 students span kindergarten through twelfth grade; many graduate with distinction every year. In 2003, Trungram Gyalwa initiated work on the Trungram Gyalwa Foundation, which was formally established in 2015. The goal of the organization is to foster knowledge and wisdom through multiple channels, supporting the intellectual and emotional development of people the world over. Projects include traditional schools‚Äîexpanding TIA to provide schools for Nepal's earthquake victims; developing a Compassion curricula; preserving ancient teachings; and conducting scientific research into the tangible benefits of values such as compassion, care and tolerance.391x391px  Writing and lecturing  Trungram Gyalwa is a widely sought after speaker, giving teachings and participating in conferences around the United States.

The first Trungram Gyalwa was born in Lhathog, Eastern Tibet, remained a yogi his entire life, known for his meditational attainment, and was given the name \\"Gyalwa Tulku\\". Under his guidance, the Trungram Monastery located at the border of Sichuan and Tibet flourished and \\"Trungram\\" was added to his name. His younger brother and disciple Trinley Rabgye became the first Aten Rinpoche. The second Trungram Gyalwa, Gowa Gyalwa, was both a scholar and an accomplished practitioner, displaying a Ushnisha (crown proturbance).\\"The Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche Lineage\\". Utbf.org. 2005-04-17. Retrieved 2016-05-19. The 3rd Trungram Gyalwa, Gotsa Gyalwa Luntok Thrinlay (1894‚Äì1959), was born in the Wood Horse year in Derge, East Tibet and was recognized by the 15th Gyalwa Karmapa Khakyab Dorje (1871‚Äì1922). He was a heart disciple of Karmapa, respected and remembered among the Tibetans as one of the leading meditation masters of the twentieth century. His knowledge of the Tripitaka and attainment in his meditation and Bodhisattva practice made him a model master. Tens of thousands of people in the thinly populated Tibet - laymen, monks, nuns, scholars, abbots and well known masters of the Kagyu, Nyingma, Sakya and Gelug schools, and the Bon tradition came to receive teachings from him. The broad range of students demonstrated the result of his Rim√© (non- sectarian) practices which enabled him to teach students from different schools in a style most suitable to each one of them. Among these students were Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche,Khyentse, Dilgo: Brilliant Moon, page 100. Shambhala, 2008. family members of the 16th Karmapa, Chagmey Rinpoche, Dzigar Choktrul Rinpoche, Dzigar Thuksey Rinpoche, Zozi Jetrung Rinpoche, Surmang Rolpai Dorje and many more. As a child, the 3rd Trungram Gyalwa was a very active boy who liked to play with dogs. At the age of eighteen, he suddenly became quiet and began to meditate in caves. The rest of his life was spent practicing meditation and helping others. He built many short-term and long- term retreat houses beside the Trungram Monastery. He incorporated Rechungpa's Whispered Lineage (Nyengyu) practice into the Trungram Tradition.\\"Archived copy\\". Archived from the original on July 25, 2011. Retrieved September 24, 2010. Most of the time Trungram Gyalwa stayed in Ngonmo Namzong (Azure Sky Castle), a mountain cave not far from the monastery, doing intensive meditation practice. It is said that he loved to eat the nettles naturally growing around the cave. Khandro Lhamo, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche's wife, describes their visit to Azure Sky Castle: \\"One of Khyenste Rinpoche's main teachers was Drungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche, who lived his entire life in a cave near Ngoma Nagsum. I had never met him before, but one time I accompanied Rinpoche to Drungram Monastery, and we stayed near his cave. His cave was in the middle of a large rock outcropping shaped like a vajra and surrounded by meadows. Five or six hundred of his disciples lived in the surrounding caves and practiced the Guru Rinpoche sadhana. So many people circumambulated the rock that the earth was worn away down to waist level. When I met him, his hair hadn't turned gray yet, so he must have been in his fifties. He would eat only once a week and almost never slept.\\"Khyentse, Dilgo: Brilliant Moon, page 164.

The main complex contains 4 Gurdwaras. The Gurdwara's Sarovar is located on the left hand-side of the bazaar leading up to the main Gurdwara complex. Opposite that there are also lodging facilities available for pilgrims. ==Location== Baka Bakala Sahib is located in the town of Baba Bakala which is in the Amritsar district of Punjab, India. The Gurdwara is on Gurdaspur Road and is 42km away from Amritsar, 46km from Jalandhar and 193km from the state's capital of Chandigarh. It is instantly recognisable by the tall 9-storey Bhora Sahib beside the main Darbar Sahib. ==History== The inside of the Darbar Sahib at Gurdwara Baba Bakala Sahib The lodging facilities available for pilgrims at Baba Bakala The town of Baba Bakala was originally known as Bakkan-Wala (meaning 'Town of the Deer' in Persian) however over time this was shortened to Bakala. The town was originally a mound, where deer were found grazing. In 1664, before passing away in Delhi, the Guru at the time, Guru Har Krishan uttered \\"Baba Bakale\\" which the Sikhs at the time interpreted as meaning that the Guru's successor was to be found at the town of Bakala, close to Amritsar. The Sikhs now had to find the true Guru in Bakala. The Guru was then found by a trader from Jhelum named Makhan Shah Lubana. As a trader, he was on a ship carrying his goods while it became caught up in a furious storm. As he was in danger, he began to pray to God and Guru Nanak Dev Ji for safety. He then vowed that he would donate 500 dinars to the Guru. Unaware of the news that Guru Har Krishan Ji had passed away, Lubana reached Bakala to fulfill his vow. Eager to carry out his promise as soon as possible, Makhan Shah then reached Bakala but was shocked to see many people pretending to be the true Guru. He then came up with a plan to donate 2 dinars to each of the self-proclaimed Gurus, as he knew that the true Guru would demand the full amount that he had promised. None of the imposters demanded the full amount and so Makhan Shah was unable to find the Guru. He then asked around and he heard of a solitarian in the area, who was called Tegh Bahadur Ji, and was the son of Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. Upon placing 2 dinars before this man, the man replied \\"God bless you, my man, however why only two Dinars after pledging five hundred? The Guru is never in need of any thing but a Sikh is expected to keep his pledge to the Guru\\". Lubana thus discovered the true Guru and told him that he would reveal his identity to the World, however the Guru discouraged Lubana to do so as he was hoping to meditate in solitude for longer. Makhan Shah took this as a challenge and climbed the rooftop and shouted that he had found the true Guru. Up until they were found, Guru Tegh Bahadur meditated in solitude for 26 years, 9 months and 13 days, however they were not a recluse and they still attended to family affairs and he also visited the 8th Guru in Delhi whilst he was there. ==Buildings== The cellar (Bhora) in which Guru Tegh Bahadur meditated in solitude Gurdwara Manji Sahib After finding Guru Tegh Bahadur, the Sikh congregation set up the Deewan here. While preaching on the Deewan, the Shia Masand fired at the Guru and the bullet scraped along the Guru's dastaar without causing any harm. Gurdwara Bhora Sahib This is the 9-storey building built above the cellar where Guru Tegh Bahadur meditated in solitude for 26 years, 9 months and 13 days and also where Baba Makhan Shah Lubaba stood and announced that he had found the true Guru. Gurdwara Darbar Sahib This is the place where in August 1664 the Sikh Sangat arrived in Bakala and anointed Tegh Bahadur as the ninth guru of Sikhs. The Sangat was led by Diwan Durga Mal, and a \\"Tilak ceremony\\" was performed by Baba Gurditta on Tegh Bahadur, formally conferring Guruship onto him.

Latin-script alphabets are sometimes extensively used in areas coloured grey due to the use of unofficial second languages, such as French in Algeria and English in Egypt, and to Latin transliteration of the official script, such as pinyin in China. This article discusses the geographic spread of the Latin script throughout history, from its archaic beginnings in Latium to the dominant writing system on Earth in modernity. The Latin letters' ancestors are found in the Etruscan, Greek and ultimately Phoenician alphabet. As the Roman Empire expanded in late antiquity, the Latin script and language spread along with its conquests, and remained in use in Italy, Iberia and Western Europe after the Western Roman Empire's disappearance. During the early and high Middle Ages, the script was spread by Christian missionaries and rulers, replacing earlier writing systems on the British Isles, Central and Northern Europe. In the Age of Discovery, the first wave of European colonisation saw the adoption of Latin alphabets primarily in the Americas and Australia, whereas sub-Sahara Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific were Latinised in the period of New Imperialism. Realising that Latin was now the most widely used script on Earth, the Bolsheviks made efforts to develop and establish Latin alphabets for all languages in the lands they controlled in Eastern Europe, North and Central Asia. However, after the Soviet Union's first three decades, these were gradually abandoned in the 1930s in favour of Cyrillic. Some post-Soviet Turkic-majority states decided to reintroduce the Latin script in the 1990s after the 1928 example of Turkey. In the early 21st century, non-Latin writing systems were still only prevalent in most parts of the Middle East and North Africa and former Soviet regions, most countries in Indochina, South and East Asia, Ethiopia and some Balkan countries in Europe. == Protohistory == The Marsiliana tablet (c. 700 BCE), containing the earliest known Etruscan abecedarium. The Latin script originated in archaic antiquity in the Latium region in central Italy. It is generally held that the Latins, one of many ancient Italic tribes, adopted the western variant of the Greek alphabet in the 7th century BCE from Cumae, a Greek colony in southern Italy ‚Äì making the early Latin alphabet one among several Old Italic alphabets emerging at the time. The early Latin script was heavily influenced by the then regionally dominant Etruscan civilization;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Etrusken. ¬ß2. Taal en schrift\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. the Latins ultimately adopted 22 of the original 26 Etruscan letters, which derived from Western Greek as well. == Antiquity == Along with the Latin language, the Latin writing system first spread over the Italian Peninsula with the rise of the Roman Republic, especially after 350 BCE. For example, the region of Umbria seems to have switched from its own script in the 2nd century BCE to Latin in the 1st.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Umbri√´. ¬ß1. Geschiedenis\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. Next were the lands surrounding the Western Mediterranean Sea: Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, Africa Proconsularis, Numidia, Hispania, and Gallia Transalpina. This continued during the early period of expansion of the Roman Empire (c. 27 BCE ‚Äì 117 CE) in regions such as Illyria, Rhaetia, Noricum, Dacia, Gaul, Belgica, western Germania, and Britannia. The eastern half of the Empire, including Greece, Macedonia, Asia Minor, the Levant, and Egypt, continued to use Greek as a lingua franca, but Latin was widely spoken in the western half, and as the western Romance languages evolved out of Latin, they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet. Despite the loss of the Latin-speaking Western provinces, the Byzantine Empire maintained Latin as its legal language, under 6th-century emperor Justinian I producing the vast Corpus Juris Civilis that would have a major impact on Western European legal history from c. 1100 to 1900.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Corpus Iuris Civilis\\". The Germanic peoples that invaded and gradually settled the Western Roman Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries, most notably the Franks (first as the Merovingian script, later the Carolingian minuscule), adopted the Latin script and spread it further. == Middle Ages ==  Latin Christianisation of Western, Central and Northern Europe  Example of Carolingian minuscule from a 10th-century manuscript. With the spread of Western Christianity during the Middle Ages, the Latin alphabet was gradually adopted by the peoples of Northern Europe who spoke Celtic languages (displacing the Ogham alphabet since the 5th century) or Germanic languages (displacing earlier Runic alphabets since the 8th century) or Baltic languages, as well as by the speakers of several Uralic languages, most notably Hungarian, Finnish and Estonian. The Latin script was introduced to Scandinavia in the 9th century, first in Denmark. It reached Norway during the 11th-century Christianisation, but in two different forms: the Anglo-Saxon Insular script in Western Norway and the Carolingian minuscule in Eastern Norway.  Slavic languages  The Latin script also came into use for writing the West Slavic languages and several South Slavic languages such as Slovene and Croatian,Encarta- encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Kroati√´. ¬ß5. Geschiedenis\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. as the people who spoke them adopted Roman Catholicism. The speakers of East Slavic languages generally adopted Cyrillic along with Orthodox Christianity. The Serbian language has come to use both scripts, whilst the Southeastern Slavic Bulgarian and Macedonian languages have maintained Cyrillic only. == Early modern period == As late as 1500, the Latin script was limited primarily to the languages spoken in Western, Northern, and Central Europe, Iberia and Italy. The Orthodox Christian Slavs of Eastern and Southeastern Europe mostly used Cyrillic, and the Greek alphabet was in use by Greek-speakers around the eastern Mediterranean. The Arabic script was widespread within Islamdom, both among Arabs and non-Arab nations like the Iranians, Indonesians, Malays, and Turkic peoples, as well as amongst Arab Christians. Most of the rest of Asia used a variety of Brahmic alphabets or the Chinese script. Since the 15th and especially 16th centuries, the Latin script has spread around the world, to the Americas, Oceania, and parts of Asia and Africa (until about 1880 mostly limited to the coastal areas), and the Pacific with European colonisation, along with the Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Dutch languages.  Americas  In an effort to Christianise and 'civilise' the Mayans, the Roman Catholic bishop Diego de Landa of Yucat√°n ordered the burning of most Maya codices in July 1562, and with it the near destruction of the Mayan hieroglyphic script. He then rewrote the history of the Mayans in Spanish, and the Mayan language was romanised, leading to an enormous loss in culture. Latin letters served as an inspiration for the forms of the Cherokee syllabary developed by Sequoyah in the late 1810s and early 1820s; however, Latin influence is mainly skin deep with Sequoyah having freely created new syllabograms.  Southeast Asia and Pacific  The Latin script was introduced for many Austronesian languages, including the languages of the Philippines and the Malaysian and Indonesian languages, replacing earlier Arabic and indigenous Brahmic alphabets. During the Dutch rule on Formosa (1624‚Äì1662), the island currently known as Taiwan, the Siraya language was given a Sinckan Latin alphabet by the Dutch, which lasted until the 19th century. == 19th century ==  Africa  The Scramble for Africa (1881‚Äì1914), meaning the rapid occupation, colonisation and annexation of inland Africa by European powers, went hand in hand with the spread of literacy amongst native Africans, as the Latin script was introduced where there were other writing systems or none. Until the early 19th century, the Berber peoples in North Africa had two systems: originally Tifinagh, and, following the spread of Islam, the Arabic script as well. French colonists, particularly missionaries and army linguists, developed a Berber Latin alphabet to make communication easier, especially for the Kabyle people in French Algeria. Since no great body of Berber literature existed, and the colonisers greatly helped improve literacy rates, the romanisation received much support, more so after Algerian independence (1962) when the French- educated Kabyle intelligentsia began to stimulate the transition and especially since the establishment of a standard transcription for Kabylie in 1970. Similar French attempts to Latinise the Arabic language met much more resistance, were unsuccessful and eventually abandoned.  Romania  As a Romance language, Romanian continued to be written in Latin script until the Council of Florence in 1439. Increasingly influenced by Russia as the Greek Byzantine Empire declined and was gradually conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century, the Eastern Orthodox Church had begun promoting the Slavic Cyrillic. In the 19th century, the Romanians returned to the Latin alphabet under the influence of nationalism. The linguist Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu first proposed a simplified version of Cyrillic in 1829, but in 1838, he introduced a mixed alphabet containing 19 Cyrillic and 10 Latin letters, and an [i] and [o] that could be both. This 'transitional orthography' was widely used until the official adoption of a completely Latin Romanian alphabet in Wallachia (1860) and Moldavia (1863), that were gradually united since 1859 to become the Kingdom of Romania in 1881. Romanian intellectuals in Transylvania, then still part of Austria-Hungary, and scholars in Wallachia-Moldavia agreed to cleanse the language from all non-Latin elements (Greek, Magyar, Slavic, and Ottoman), and to emulate French wherever needed.  Russian Empire  Tsar Nicholas I (r. 1826‚Äì1855) of the Russian Empire introduced a policy of Russification, including Cyrillisation. From the 1840s on, Russia considered introducing the Cyrillic script for spelling the Polish language, with the first school books printed in the 1860s. The imperial government's attempts failed, however: the Polish population put up a tough resistance, as it saw its language as expressed in its Latin alphabet as a source of national pride, and threatened to rebel if it were to be abolished. The initially successfully enacted Lithuanian press ban (1865‚Äì1904) outlawed the use of Latin script, whilst encouraging writing Lithuanian texts in Cyrillic. Resistance grew as time went on: Lithuanian books were smuggled into the country, mainly from Lithuania Minor in East Prussia. Although the Russian authorities tried to seize them, they could not stop the rapid increase in forbidden titles from crossing the border. The Lithuanian ban, lifted in 1904, is widely felt to have stimulated the Lithuanian national movement and embracing the Latin script, rather than discouraging it.  Vietnam  A romanization of Vietnamese was codified in the 17th century by the French Jesuit missionary Alexandre de Rhodes (1591‚Äì1660), based on works of the early 16th-century Portuguese missionaries Gaspar do Amaral and Ant√≥nio Barbosa. This Vietnamese alphabet (ch·ªØ qu·ªëc ng·ªØ or \\"national script\\") was gradually expanded from its initial domain in Christian writing to become more popular among the general public, which had previously used Chinese-based characters. During the French protectorate (1883‚Äì1945), colonial rulers made an effort to educate all Vietnamese, and a simpler writing system was found more expedient for teaching and communication with the general population. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that the romanized script came to predominate written communication. To further the process, Vietnamese written with the alphabet was made obligatory for all public documents in 1910 by issue of a decree by the French R√©sident Sup√©rieur of the protectorate of Tonkin in northern Vietnam. == 20th century ==  Albanian  Albanian used a variety of writing systems since its first attestation in the 12th century, especially Latin (in the north), Greek (in the south), Ottoman and Arabic (favoured by many Muslims). Attempts at standardisation were made throughout the 19th century, since 1879 led by the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings, culminating in the 1908 Congress of Manastir when a single Latin script, Bashkimi, was chosen for the whole language. Although the newly adopted Albanian Latin alphabet symbolised a break with Ottoman rule, some Islamist Kosovo Albanians objected strongly against it, preferring to maintain the Arabic script that was found in the Quran, which they held sacred. However, nationalists maintained the Latin alphabet was 'above religion' and therefore also acceptable to non-Islamic and secular Albanians; they would win the argument.  Uyghur  The Uyghur language in China used a Latin-derived alphabet created upon Pinyin spelling conventions, but it was abolished in 1982 and the Arabic script was restored.  Serbo-Croatian  A map showing the expansion of the use of Latin script in areas of former Yugoslavia, primarily amongst Croatians and Slovenes (Roman Catholics), Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) and Kosovars (Albanian Muslims). Cyrillic texts are dominant in areas primarily inhabited by Serbs, Montenegrins, and Macedonians (Eastern Orthodox Christians). This cultural boundary has existed since the dichotomy of the Greek East and Latin West. Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj devised a uniform Latin alphabet for Croatian in 1835, while in 1818, Serbian linguist Vuk Karad≈æiƒá had developed a Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. In the first half of the 19th century, the Illyrian movement to unite all Southern Slavs (Yugoslavs) culturally, and perhaps also politically, was quite strong, and efforts were made to create a unified literary language that would set the standard for all Yugoslav dialects. The Vienna Literary Agreement (March 1850) between writers from Croatia, Serbia and one from Slovenia was the most significant attempt, where some basic rules were agreed upon. In the 1860s, Vuk's orthography gained acceptance in Serbia, while a Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts was founded in 1866 in Zagreb and the first 'Serbo-Croatian' grammar book by Pero Budmani was published in Croatia in 1867. In 1913, Jovan Skerliƒá proposed a compromise for a single writing system and dialect to create true language unity. After World War I, political unity was realised in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but an agreement on scriptural unity for its population was never reached. The post-war Titoist Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia made another attempt at achieving linguistic unity, but the 1954 Novi Sad Agreement only managed to get equality of Latin and Cyrillic, and an obligation for all citizens to learn both alphabets. With the return of ethnic nationalism in the 1980s, the two again became heavily associated with particular variants of the Serbo-Croatian language and thus with national identities. Exacerbated by the Yugoslav Wars that led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, nationalists on all sides resumed insisting Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin were distinct languages in their own right, undermining the project of Serbo-Croatian linguistic unity. The Bosnian language was originally primarily expressed in the Cyrillic-type Bosanƒçica since the 11th century (originally alongside the older Glagoljica), but it was gradually driven extinct in the 18th century after the Ottoman introduction of the Perso-Arabic script-type Arebica (15th‚Äì20th century). Eventually, most Bosnians adopted the Croatian-derived Latinica or Latin script ‚Äìoriginally introduced by the Catholic Franciscans‚Äì in the course of the 20th century, standardised in the 1990s.  Middle East and North Africa  Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk introduced the Latin script in Turkey in 1928. In 1928, as part of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's reforms, the new Republic of Turkey adopted the Turkish Latin alphabet for the Turkish language, replacing a modified Arabic alphabet.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Turkse talen. Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. In the 1930s and 1940s, the majority of Kurds replaced the Arabic script with two Latin alphabets. Although the only official Kurdish government, the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq, uses an Arabic alphabet for public documents, the Latin Kurdish alphabet remains widely used throughout the region by the majority of Kurdish speakers, especially in Turkey and Syria. During the late 20th century decolonisation, Pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism expressed themselves in anti-Western tendencies, including hostility towards the Latin script. It was banned in some places such as Libya after Moammar Gaddafi's 1969 coup, in favour of exclusive Arabic script.  Soviet Union  Since at least 1700, Russian intellectuals have sought to Latinise the Russian language in their desire for close relations with the West. The Bolsheviks had four goals: to break with Tsarism, to spread socialism to the whole world, to isolate the Muslim inhabitants of the Soviet Union from the Arabic-Islamic world and religion, and eradicate illiteracy through simplification. They concluded the Latin alphabet was the right tool to do so, and after seizing power during the Russian Revolution of 1917, they made plans to realise these ideals. Although progress was slow at first, in 1926 the Turkic-majority republics of the Soviet Union adopted the Latin script, giving a major boost to reformers in neighbouring Turkey.Z√ºrcher, Erik Jan. Turkey: a modern history, p. 188. I.B.Tauris, 2004. When Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk adopted the new Turkish Latin alphabet in 1928, this in turn encouraged the Soviet leaders to proceed. The Commission to romanise the Russian alphabet completed its work in mid-January 1930. But on 25 January 1930, General Secretary Joseph Stalin ordered the stop of the romanisation of Russian. The Latinisation of non-Slavic languages within the USSR continued until the late 1930s, however. Most of the Turkic- speaking peoples of the Soviet Union, including Tatars, Bashkirs, Azerbaijani or Azeri, Kazakh (1929‚Äì40), Kyrgyz and others, used the Latin-based Uniform Turkic alphabet in the 1930s; but, in the 1940s, all were replaced by Cyrillic. Post-Soviet states The Russian conquest of Transcaucasia in the 19th century split the Azerbaijani language community across two states, the other being Iran. The Soviet Union promoted development of the language, but set it back considerably with two successive script changes ‚Äì from the Persian to Latin and then to the Cyrillic script ‚Äì while Iranian Azerbaijanis continued to use the Persian as they always had. Despite the wide use of Azerbaijani in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, it did not become the official language of Azerbaijan until 1956.Language Commission Suggested to Be Established in National Assembly. Day.az. 25 January 2011. After achieving independence from the Soviet Union 1991, the new Republic of Azerbaijan decided to switch back to the Latin script. Two other newly independent Turkic-speaking republics, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, as well as Romanian- speaking Moldova on 31 August 1989, Horia C. Matei, \\"State lumii. Enciclopedie de istorie.\\" Meronia, Bucure»ôti, 2006, pp. 292‚Äì294 officially adopted Latin alphabets for their languages. In 1995, Uzbekistan ordered the Uzbek alphabet changed from a Russian-based Cyrillic script to a modified Latin alphabet, and in 1997, Uzbek became the sole language of state administration. However, the government's implementation of the transition to Latin has been rather slow, suffered several setbacks and as of 2017 has not yet been completed. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iranian-speaking Tajikistan, and the breakaway region of Transnistria kept the Cyrillic alphabet, chiefly due to their close ties with Russia. == 21st century ==  Kazakhstan  Unlike its Turkic neighbours, Kazakhstan did not move towards Latinisation after obtaining statehood in 1991. As of 2017 Latin is the official script of Kazakhstan, replacing Cyrillic. This was motivated by pragmatic reasons: the government was wary to alienate the country's large Russian-speaking minority, and due to the economic crisis in the early 1990s, a transition was considered fiscally unfeasable at the time. In 2006, President Nursultan Nazarbayev requested the Ministry of Education and Science to examine the experiences of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, which had all switched to Latin script in the 20th century. The ministry reported in the summer of 2007 that a six-step plan, based primarily on the Uzbekistan model, should be implemented over a 12-to-15-year period at the cost of about $300 million. Aside from integrating Kazakhstan into the global economy, officials have argued it would help the development of a Kazakh national identity separate from Russia. In 2007, Nazarbayev said the transformation of the Kazakh alphabet from Cyrillic to Latin should not be rushed, as he noted: \\"For 70 years, the Kazakhstanis read and wrote in Cyrillic. More than 100 nationalities live in our state. Thus we need stability and peace. We should be in no hurry in the issue of alphabet transformation\\".Kazakhstan should be in no hurry in Kazakh alphabet transformation to Latin: Nazarbayev, Kazinform, 13 December 2007 In 2015, the Kazakh government announced that the Latin script would replace Cyrillic as the writing system for the Kazakh language by 2025.Kazakh language to be converted to Latin alphabet ‚Äì MCS RK. Inform.kz (30 January 2015). Retrieved on 2015-09-28. In 2017, Nazarbayev said that \\"by the end of 2017, after consultation with academics and representatives of the public, a single standard for the new Kazakh alphabet and script should be developed.\\" Education specialists are to be trained to teach the new alphabet and provide textbooks beginning in 2018. The romanisation policy is intended to modernise Kazakhstan and increase international cooperation. President Nazarbayev signed on February 19, 2018 an amendment to the decree of October 26, 2017 No. 569 \\"On translating the Kazakh alphabet from Cyrillic alphabet to the Latin script.\\" The amended alphabet uses \\"Sh\\" and \\"Ch\\" for the Kazakh sounds \\"–®\\" and \\"–ß\\" and eliminates the use of apostrophes.  Turkmenistan  The Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic employed a Latin alphabet from 1928 to 1940, when it was decreed that all languages in the Soviet Union be written in Cyrillic. After gaining independence in 1991, Turkmenistan was amongst several ex-Soviet states seeking to reintroduce the Latin script. Although totalitarian dictator Saparmurat Niyazov, ruling Turkmenistan from 1985 to his death in 2006, announced a decree on 12 April 1993 that formalised a new Turkmen Latin alphabet, the de facto implementation has been slow and incomplete. The original 1993 alphabet had 30 letters, but missed several sounds and did not fit the Turkmen language, so several amendments were made in 1996. The first book in Latin script was printed in 1995, but Turkmen language and literature manuals were not available until 1999; Cyrillic manuals had been banned before Latin ones were available. Although by 2011 the younger generations were well- versed in the Turkmen Latin alphabet through the education system, adults, including teachers, were not given any official training programme and were expected to learn it by themselves without state support.  Canada  In October 2019, the organization National Representational Organization for Inuit in Canada (ITK) announced that they will introduce a unified writing system for the Inuit languages in the country. The writing system is based on the Latin alphabet and is modeled after the one used in the Greenlandic language.  Debates and proposals  thumb  Bulgaria  In 2001, Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner recommended that Bulgaria adopt the Latin script in order to facilitate the country's accession to the European Union. This caused such a scandal that the Veliko Tarnovo University revoked the honorary degree it had previously awarded him (for supporting the Bulgarian viewpoint on the Macedonian language). For many Bulgarians, the Cyrillic alphabet has become an important component of their national identity, and great pride is taken in having introduced Cyrillic into the EU in 2007.With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin and Greek scripts. However, in digital communication using computers and writing emails and SMS, the Latin script has been proposed to replace the Cyrillic. A Bulgarian Latin alphabet, the so-called shlyokavitsa, is already often employed for convenience for emails and SMS messages. Ciphers are used to denote Bulgarian sounds that cannot be represented with a single Latin character (for example, a \\"4\\" represents a \\"—á\\" because they look alike and the Bulgarian word for the cardinal number four, —á—ê—Ç–∏—Ä–∏ ƒç—êtiri, starts with a \\"—á\\").  Kosovo  Despite initial resistance from Islamist Kosovo Albanians (who favoured the Arabic script) against the 1908 Congress of Manastir's resolution to adopt the Latin script to write the Albanian language in, Kosovo Albanians came to accept the Albanian Latin alphabet over the course of the early 20th century. Literacy amongst Kosovo Albanians increased from 26% in 1948 to 96.6% (men) and 87.5% (women) in 2007. The Kosovo Serbs have followed the practice of Cyrillic/Latin digraphia in the Republic of Serbia and continued to use both alphabets after the Kosovo War (1998‚Äì9) and the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence. Article 2 of the 2006 Law on the Use of Languages states that ‚ÄúAlbanian and Serbian and their alphabets are official languages of Kosovo and have equal status in Kosovo institutions,‚Äù but fails to specify which alphabets these are, as neither Latin nor Cyrillic is mentioned. This has often led the (ethnic Albanian- dominated) Kosovo authorities to exclusively use the Serb(o-Croatian) Latin alphabet in its communication with the Serb minority, as it does with the country's other five officially recognised minorities, especially the Bosniaks whose language is very similar to Serbian, but always written in Latin. Although Kosovo Serbs may use either or both alphabets in everyday life, some claim they've got the right to demand the authorities to communicate with them in their preferred alphabet, and accuse the government of violating the law. The present attitudes of the Kosovar authorities have raised concerns over the Latinisation of the Kosovo Serbs against their will, while the government maintains it respects the legal rights of minorities.  Kyrgyzstan  Adopting the Latin script for the Kyrgyz language has been the subject of discussions in Kyrgyzstan since attaining independence in the 1990s. However, unlike in the other Turkic-dominated former Soviet republics in Central Asia, the issue did not become prominent until its great neighbour Kazakhstan in September 2015 and April 2017 confirmed its previous announcements to Latinise the closely related Kazakh language. Before then, the largely Russian-speaking elite of the country saw no reason to, nor did it seek to endanger its good- standing political and economic relations with the Russian Federation. Amongst others, deputy Kanybek Imanaliyev advocated a shift to Latin for 'the development of contemporary technology, communication, education and science.' On the other hand, due to financial constraints, he proposed to postpone the transition to the 2030s or even 2040s. Because Russia is still a very important financial supporter of Kyrgyzstan, other experts agreed it would be unwise for Bishkek to make a move that would culturally alienate Moscow. President Almazbek Atambayev stated in October 2017 that the country would not Latinise any time soon. = ULY = To the east of Kyrgyz language there it is a western China's language that historically was linked to the Kyrgyzstan's language: the Uighur language.Map showing the Turkish languages (and the Uighur territory in China) Here recently has been created the Uyghur Latin script or ULY. This \\"Uyghur Latin Y√´ziqi\\" (ULY) is an auxiliary alphabet for the Uighur language based on the Latin script.An introduction to Latin script Uyghur  North Macedonia  The Macedonian language in its Cyrillic alphabet has been the official language of the Republic of Macedonia throughout the country and in its foreign relations since 1991. However, since the 2001 Albanian insurgency was ended by the Ohrid Agreement, the Constitution of Macedonia has been amended (Amendment V) to mandate the co- official use of the six minority languages and their respective alphabets in municipalities in which more than 20% of an ethnic minority resides. The six minority languages ‚Äì Albanian, Turkish, Romani, Serbian, Bosnian and Aromanian ‚Äì are (with the exception of Serbian) always officially written in Latin script in the municipalities where their speakers constitute a significant minority or even majority.Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia See amendment V In addition, Macedonian is occasionally written in Latin, especially in advertising.  Mongolia  The Mongolian language has been written in the Cyrillic script since 1940. There have been talks to switch the language's alphabet to either the Latin script or the traditional Mongolian script used in China's Inner Mongolia region.  Montenegro  There is ongoing discussion in Montenegro about how to label the \\"Montenegrin\\" language, which is mutually intelligible with the other standardised versions of Serbo-Croatian: Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian. These debates focus on the perceived linguistic differences between Montenegrin and related variants, but also on national and political identification. Montenegro practices digraphia: there are two official Montenegrin alphabets, one Latin and one Cyrillic. In electoral campaigns after 2000, especially the 2006 independence referendum, Latin has come to symbolise closeness to Western countries, including Montenegro's historical ties to Venice, and independence from Serbia; on the other hand, Cyrillic is taken to signify unity with Serbia and closeness to the East. In general, proponents of calling the language \\"Montenegrin\\" ‚Äì including the government ‚Äì tend to favour the Latin script, whereas supporters of \\"Serbian\\" prefer Cyrillic. In June 2016, an incident in which top students in primary and secondary schools for the first time since World War II received their \\"Luca\\" diplomas ‚Äì named after Njego≈°'s poem ‚Äì printed in the Latin alphabet, sparked political controversy. The opposition Socialist People's Party (SNP) accused Education Minister Predrag Bo≈°koviƒá of \\"persecuting Cyrillic\\" and discriminating against pupils who use this script. The SNP was unsuccessful in forcing the minister to resign. The annual June reception of Latin-printed pupil's diplomas in schools continued to cause pro- Serbian organisations including new small opposition party True Montenegro to claim Cyrillic users were being 'discriminated' against, while Education Minister Damir ≈†ehoviƒá stated that schools are obliged to issue Cyrillic diplomas, but only at the request of pupils‚Äô parents.  Serbia  Under the Constitution of Serbia of 2006, Cyrillic script is the only one in official use.Article 10 of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia (English version ) Nonetheless the Latin script is widely used. In May 2017, Minister of Culture and Information Vladan Vukosavljeviƒá proposed several measures to better support the Cyrillic script, which was \\"in danger of falling into disuse\\". He said there wasn't any kind of conspiracy going on against the Cyrillic alphabet, but rather that the spirit of the times, historical circumstances and the decades-long process of globalisation had gradually made Latin the world's dominant script. \\"Especially young people in Serbia are now mostly turning to Latin characters because of the media, the Internet and the logos of world brands.\\" In August 2018, the Ministry of Culture proposed a law to that effect, obliging government institutions to use Cyrillic under the threat of fines, and setting up a Council for the Serbian Language to implement this suggested language policy. The ministry claimed that indifference towards which script to use was not ‚Äúa culturally responsible position‚Äù, and complained that some people had come to ‚Äúuse the Latin script as a symbol of [their] openness and European affiliation‚Äù, arguing that Cyrillic was also one of the European Union's official writing systems and that \\"the EU is a community of peoples with their peculiarities.\\"  Tatarstan (Russia)  In 1999, the Russian Republic of Tatarstan proposed to convert the Turkic Tatar language to Latin script in order to bring it into the modern world of the Internet. There was opposition from both inside and outside Tatarstan, with Tatars arguing it would threaten their national identity and to sever their ties to the past. The Russian State Duma rejected the proposal. President Vladimir Putin said that a Tatar move from Cyrillic to Latin would 'threaten the unity of the Russian Federation'. In 2002, Putin therefore enacted a law that made the use of Cyrillic mandatory for all languages in all autonomous republics of Russia.  Ukraine  In March 2018, Foreign Minister of Ukraine Pavlo Klimkin called for a discussion on the introduction of the Latin alphabet in parallel usage with the traditional Cyrillic one in Ukraine. He did so in response to the suggestion of Polish historian Ziemowit Szczerek. Ukraine's parliamentary committee on science and education responded, with first deputy chair Oleksandr Spivakovsky saying that today in Ukraine there are other, more important issues to work on than a transition to the Latin script. Similarly, philology professor Oleksandr Ponomariv was skeptical whether a full transition to Latin would benefit Ukraine, but did not rule out the parallel use of two alphabets. He pointed to the fact that the Serbian language is also expressed in both a Cyrillic and a Latin alphabet. == See also == *Latinisation of names *Metrication *Romanisation, conversion of a text in Latin (or Roman) letters == References == Category:Latin script Category:History of writing Category:Language geography ","title":"Spread of the Latin script"},{"id":"54232782","text":"Composition 113 is a solo album by composer Anthony Braxton featuring his title piece, for one soloist, a large photograph, and prepared stage, which was released on the Sound Aspects label in 1984.Anthony Braxton discography accessed June 6, 2017Sound Aspects Records Listing accessed June 6, 2017Anthony Braxton Catalog accessed June 6, 2017Filippo, R., Eenciclopedia del Jazz: Anthony Braxton accessed June 6, 2017 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Brian Olewnick stated \\"Composition 113 is not nearly as forbidding or difficult as one might guess at first blush, given its ascetic instrumentation.
