Anarchist Resources Incorporated, a non-profit collective, manages the bookshop building, which also includes meeting space and an inherited library collection, The Fanya Baron Library, that was named in honour of Russian anarchist, Fanya Baron. Australian Ethical Investment uses Jura Books as an example of Socially responsible investing practice, stating that Jura is \\"a major source in Australia for a wide range of affordable books of community and educational interest including the areas of trade unionism, women's rights, environment, permaculture, indigenous peoples' issues, poetry, arts and non-violent revolution.\\" Over the many years of operation Jura has built a collection of more than 4,500 Australian and international posters, believed to be one of the biggest and most complete collections of political posters known to exist in Australia. In 2003 a selection of over 100 political posters spanning from the 1960s to the late 1980s were on display at Jura Books. Jura Books is also used for community meetings and talks. Members of the collective have been involved in organising several successful conferences in Sydney including on Workers Control, 1984 and Social Control, and the 1995 Visions of Freedom conference with guest speaker Noam Chomsky. For many years (1982 to 2013) the anarcho-syndicalist paper, Rebel Worker, was published from the Jura Books premises. It is now published elsewhere.

The village is about six miles south-west of Cambridge, between Harston, Barton and Barrington. The population in the 2001 census was 1,550 people living in 621 households, reducing at the 2011 Census to a population of 1,507 living in 626 households. The main streets in the village are called High Street and New Road which together form an approximate circle around the Manor House. The village contains Haslingfield Primary School and All Saints Church. To find out more about what is going on in Haslingfield today see here History All Saints' Church Haslingefeld appears in the Domesday book with a population of 400, but there is archaeological evidence of people living in the vicinity 3,000 years ago . An Anglo-Saxon cemetery was discovered in the 1870s on Cantelupe Road, but unfortunately not carefully excavated. The name Haslingfield is thought to be derived as follows: -field is an Anglo-Saxon suffix meaning cleared land in site of woods, while Hasling probably derives from the Haeslingas, a local band of people that lived here. The Church of All Saints was consecrated in 1352,'Parishes: Haslingfield', A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 5 (1973), pp. 227-240. Date accessed: 22 October 2009 and while much of the building dates from the 14th Century, the chancel walls date from the 12th century. On White Hill behind the village there used to be a small chapel but all trace has since disappeared. The Tudor manor house was built by Sir Thomas Wendy, lord of the manor at the time, and used to be Haslingfield Hall, a large mansion. Only one wing of the house remains, as the Manor, renovated and extended. The village sign shows Queen Elizabeth I who stayed one night at the Manor in the year 1564. During her stay she is supposed to have lost a ring and a number of ring hunts have been held in recent times. The economy of the community has been based on farming for most of its existence. There was a short period of mining for coprolite,'Parishes: Haslingfield', A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 5 (1973), pp. 227-240.

A transcription of this article is available here as a PDF file. One of the primary characteristics of the 2-step sound – the term being coined to describe \\"a general rubric for all kinds of jittery, irregular rhythms that don't conform to garage's traditional four-on-the-floor pulse\\" – is that the rhythm lacks the kick drum pattern found in many other styles of electronic music with a regular four-on-the-floor beat. Characteristics A typical 2-step drum pattern features beat-skipping kick drums, with a shuffled rhythm or the use of triplets applied to other elements of the percussion, creating a \\"lurching, falter-funk feel\\", and resulting in a beat distinctly different from that present in other house or techno. Although tracks with only two kick drum beats to a bar are perceived as being slower than the traditional four- on-the-floor beat, the listener's interest is maintained by the introduction of unusual snare placements and accents in the drum patterns, or scattered rimshots and woodblocks, as well as syncopated basslines and the percussive use of other instruments such as pads and strings. Instrumentation usually includes keyboards, synthesizers and drum machines. Other instruments added to expand the musical palette include guitar, piano and horns; these additions are almost always sampled. The primarily synth-based basslines used in 2-step are similar to those in the style's progenitors such as UK garage and before that, drum and bass and jungle, but influences from funk and soul can also be heard. Vocals in 2-step garage are usually female, and similar to the style prevalent in house music or contemporary R&B.; Some 2-step producers also process and cut up elements of an a cappella vocal and use it as an element of the track. Much like other genres derived from UK garage, MCs are often featured, particularly in a live context, with a vocal style reminiscent of old school jungle. Influences from hip hop and drum and bass, particularly the techstep subgenre have also been noted by critics. The fact that the scene had a significantly different atmosphere to those that surrounded precursors with less aggression at live events was also noted by some critics. History Early years 2-step rose to prominence as a genre on jungle and garage- based pirate radio stations in London as an evolution of, and perhaps reaction to developments in contemporary genres such as speed garage, with early 2-step shows often airing at \\"mellow moments in the weekend\\" such as Saturday morning or Sunday afternoon. DJs would mix UK garage productions with those of American house and US garage producers such as Masters at Work and Todd Edwards, pitching up the imports to around 130bpm to aid beatmatching. DJs favoured the instrumental (or 'dub') versions of these tracks, because it was possible to play these versions faster without the vocal element of the track sounding odd. Soon, UK producers began to emulate the sound of these pitched- up, imported records in their own tracks. Growing popularity As the popularity of the sound spread, nights dedicated to it began to crop up, especially in London and Southampton. Label owner and dubstep musician Steve Goodman commented on the Hyperdub website on the debut of Forward>>, a highly influential nightclub in 2-step and later derivatives of the \\"UK hardcore continuum\\" – a phrase coined by Goodman to sum up the constant evolution in the hardcore/jungle/garage sound, An archived copy of this article may be found here and later adopted by other writers documenting the scene, such as Martin Clark. Arguably one of the earliest examples of a 2-step track is the 1997 Kelly G remix of \\"Never Gonna Let You Go\\" by Tina Moore, which was a No. 7 hit on the UK Singles Chart. 1999–2000: Mainstream success In 1999 and 2000, 2-step reached the peak of the genre's commercial success. Some critics noted that party organizers favoured 2-step events over nights themed around jungle, drum and bass or other musical precursors because the 2-step nights invited a larger female attendance, and a less aggressive crowd. Much like drum and bass before it, 2-step started to garner crossover appeal, with a collaboration between 2-step producers Artful Dodger and R&B; vocalist Craig David reaching #2 in the UK Singles Chart in late 1999 with the song \\"Re-Rewind\\". 2000–present: Decline From 2000 onwards, 2-step as a genre experienced a decline in popularity, but the more experimental releases in the genre from artists such as Horsepower Productions, Zed Bias, Wookie and Steve Gurley An archived copy of this article may be found here stripped away much of the R&B; influence of the genre. This style took on a number of names including \\"dark 2-step\\", \\"new dark swing\\", and the more general term, \\"dark garage\\". This style became a major influence on later styles of UK garage influenced music, such as grime, as well as becoming a direct precursor to dubstep, which took the emphasis on bass and the instrumental nature of later 2-step compositions to their logical conclusion. In 2006, this latter, more experimental style experienced a resurgence in interest, due to the release of the Roots of Dubstep compilation on Tempa, and producers wishing to revisit the roots of the dubstep sound. Canadian singer The Weeknd's 2016 song \\"Rockin'\\" makes use of 2-step sounds.

Traditionally, there are three movements in a solo concerto, consisting of a fast section, a slow and lyrical section, and then another fast section. However, there are many examples of concertos that do not conform to this plan. History Baroque The earliest known solo concertos are nos. 6 and 12 of Giuseppe Torelli's Op. 6 of 1698. These works employ both a three-movement cycle and clear (if diminutive) ritornello form, like that of the ripieno concerto except that sections for the soloist and continuo separate the orchestral ritornellos. Active in Bologna, Torelli would have known of the operatic arias and the numerous sonatas and sinfonias for trumpet and strings produced in Bologna since the 1660s. He himself composed more than a dozen such works for trumpet, two dated in the early 1690s. Other early violin concertos are the four in Tomaso Albinoni's Op. 2 (1700) and the six in Giuseppe Torelli's important Op. 8 (1709 - the other six works in this set are double concertos for two violins). The most influential and prolific composer of concertos during the Baroque period was the Venetian Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741). In addition to his nearly 60 extant ripieno concertos, Vivaldi composed approximately 425 concertos for one or more soloists, including about 350 solo concertos (two-thirds for solo violin) and 45 double concertos (over half for two violins). Vivaldi's concertos firmly establish the three-movement form as the norm. The virtuosity of the solo sections increases markedly, especially in the later works, and concurrently the texture becomes more homophonic. Concertos for instruments other than violin began to appear early in the 18th century, including the oboe concertos of George Frideric Handel and the numerous concertos for flute, oboe, bassoon, cello, and other instruments by Vivaldi. The earliest organ concertos can probably be credited to Handel (16 concertos, c. 1735–51), the earliest harpsichord concertos to Johann Sebastian Bach (14 concertos for one to four harpsichords, c. 1735–40). In the latter case, all but probably one of the concertos are arrangements of existing works, though Bach had already approached the idea of a harpsichord concerto before 1721 in the Brandenburg Concerto no. 5. Classical The Classical period brought the triumph of the solo concerto over the group or multiple concerto, assisted by the continued rise of the virtuoso soloist and the growing demand for up-to-date works for performance by amateurs. The former trend appears most obviously in the large number of violin concertos written by violinists for their own use. The Classical period also witnessed the rise of the keyboard concerto. Until about 1770, the preferred stringed keyboard instrument was usually the harpsichord, but it was gradually supplanted by the piano. The most important composers of keyboard concertos before Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were Bach's sons. Vienna saw the production of many keyboard concertos. The last decades of the 18th century brought the rise of traveling piano virtuosos. The concertos of this period show a broad transition from Baroque to Classical style, though many are more conservative than contemporaneous symphonies. Most are in three movements, though a significant minority adopt lighter two- movement patterns such as Allegro-Minuet and Allegro-Rondo. Dance and rondo finales are also frequent in three-movement concertos. Additionally, the ritornello form in the fast movements was replaced with the sonata form and rondo forms respectively. Joseph Haydn's concertos are mostly from his early career. Exceptions are the Piano Concerto in D, the Cello Concerto in D, and the Trumpet Concerto. Of Mozart's 23 original piano concertos, 17 date from his Viennese period. They are the crowning achievement of the concerto in the 18th century. Most of the works he wrote for Vienna are of a type that Mozart called grand concertos. These were intended for performance at his own subscription concerts, which were held in sizeable halls. They call for an orchestra that is much larger than a typical concerto of the time, especially in the expanded role assigned to the winds. The orchestra is rendered fully capable of sustaining a dramatic confrontation with the virtuosity and individuality of the soloist. Mozart's approach in these concertos is often clearly symphonic, both in the application of formal symphonic principles, and in a Haydnesque interest in thematic unity in the later concertos. The range of styles and expression is greater than that of most other concertos of the period, from the comic-opera elements of K.467 to the Italianate lyricism of K.488, the tragic character of K.466 and 491 to the Beethovenian heroism of K.503. Ludwig van Beethoven's five piano concertos date from between c. 1793 and 1809, and he also wrote an early concertante work for piano and orchestra in 1784. They are longer than Mozart's concertos, and call for even more virtuosity from the soloist. Beethoven's Violin Concerto (1806) exhibits similar achievements - Mozart's five violin concertos are all early works written in Salzburg in 1775. Romantic Early Romantic concertos include Mendelssohn's two piano concertos (1831–37) and his important Violin Concerto (1844) and Schumann's concertos for piano (1845), cello (1850), and violin (1853). The form of these works is predominantly in the Classical three- movements. Later works in this mould include examples by Johannes Brahms (two for piano - No. 1 from 1858 and No. 2 from 1878 which adds a fourth movement - and one for violin of 1878), Edvard Grieg (piano, 1868), Max Bruch (most famously his Violin Concerto No. 1, 1868), and Antonín Dvořák (piano, violin, cello, 1876–95). In France this tradition is represented primarily by Camille Saint-Saëns (ten concertos for piano, violin, and cello, 1858–1902), in Russia by Anton Rubinstein and Tchaikovsky (three piano concertos, one for violin, 1874–93). A more overtly virtuosic trend appeared in the concertos of brilliant violinists in the 19th century including Louis Spohr and Niccolò Paganini and pianists Frédéric Chopin (two concertos, 1829–30) and Franz Liszt (two concertos, original versions 1839-49). The movement structure in most of these works is in the by-now conventional ritornello-sonata type perfected by Mozart and Beethoven. Liszt's two concertos, however, are unconventional, in that the first concerto's five sections are connected both formally and thematically, and the second utilizes a still freer sectional structure. The first concerto in particular shows the influence of such continuous composite forms as those of Weber's Konzertstuck and Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy. The virtuosity required by all these concertos was facilitated by—and helped to spur—technical developments in the instruments themselves. 20th century Numerous 20th-century compositions were written in the vein of the 19th- century Romantic concertos - and often using its forms and styles - including concertos by Sergei Rachmaninoff (four piano concertos, 1890–1926), Jean Sibelius (violin, 1903), Edward Elgar (violin 1909–10, cello 1919), Carl Nielsen (violin, flute, clarinet), Sergei Prokofiev (five for piano, 1911–32; two for violin 1916-17 and 1935), William Walton (viola, violin, cello), Dmitri Shostakovich (two each for piano, violin, and cello), and Francis Poulenc (organ). The virtuoso tradition mirrored in these concertos is also obvious, though in radically original guise, in the concertos of Béla Bartók. Rachmaninov, Prokofiev and Bartók were all piano virtuosos. The composers of the Second Viennese School also produced several prominent concertos: Alban Berg's Chamber Concerto for piano, violin, and 13 winds (1923–25), not fully serial but incorporating many elements of Arnold Schoenberg's new system; Anton Webern's Concerto for nine instruments (1931–34), originally intended as a piano concerto; Berg's important Violin Concerto (1935); and Schoenberg's own Violin Concerto (1935–36) and Piano Concerto (1942). The neoclassical movement of the period following World War I produced a long series of works that returned to pre-Romantic conceptions of the concerto. Igor Stravinsky's Concerto for Piano and Winds (1923–24) is in this idiom, but his subsequent concertos are more specifically neo-Baroque in character. His Violin Concerto (1931), for example, comprises a Toccata, two Arias, and a Capriccio, and the soloist is treated more as a member of the ensemble than as a virtuoso protagonist. The solo concertos of Paul Hindemith (8 for various instruments, 1939–62) are more traditional than Stravinsky's in their treatment of the relationship between soloist and orchestra. Though hardly neoclassical in the usual sense, Richard Strauss' Horn Concerto no. 2 (1942, written some 60 years after his first) and Oboe Concerto (1945) also reach back to an earlier era, finding nostalgic inspiration in the wind concertos of Mozart. A tendency related to the neoclassical rejection of Romantic and traditional features is the use of jazz elements in many 20th-century concertos. George Gershwin was a pioneer for such works, in for example his Rhapsody in Blue (1924) and Concerto in F for piano (1925). Jazz was a source of inspiration for Aaron Copland's Piano Concerto (1926), Stravinsky's Ebony Concerto for clarinet and jazz band (1945).

It is migratory, wintering in Korea and eastern China, with rare occurrences in western Europe and northwestern North America. Its typical breeding habitat is subarctic deciduous forests and open coniferous woodland, often close to water, although it also occurs in mountains and spruce taiga. It inhabits bushes and shrubs in winter, frequently near streams, but may also be found in dry grassland and woods. The Siberian accentor has brown upperparts and wings, with bright chestnut streaking on its back and a greyish-brown rump and tail. The head has a dark brown crown and a long, wide pale yellow supercilium (\\"eyebrow\\"). All plumages are quite similar. The nest is an open cup in dense shrub or a tree into which the female lays four to six glossy deep blue-green eggs that hatch in about ten days. Adults and chicks feed mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation. In winter, the accentors may also consume seeds or feed near human habitation. Breeding over a huge area, the Siberian accentor has a large and stable population. It is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term. October and November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of this species into western Europe, reaching as far as the United Kingdom. Taxonomy The accentors are a family of small ground-living insectivorous birds, most of which are found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the dunnock is a lowland species. Their relationships with other bird families are uncertain. All accentors are placed in a single genus, Prunella, but within that genus, the Siberian accentor is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian accentors. These are of comparable size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 phylogenetic study indicates that the closest relative of the Siberian accentor is actually the physically dissimilar Japanese accentor. On his return from his pioneering expedition to central and eastern Russia in 1768–1774, the Russia-based German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas formally described the Siberian accentor in 1776 as Motacilla montanella. The accentors were moved to their current genus by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The Siberian accentor has two subspecies: * Prunella montanella montanella, (Pallas, 1776), the nominate subspecies, breeds in northern Russia from just inside Europe eastwards to the Lena River. It also occurs further south, from the Ob to the Amur. * Prunella montanella badia, Portenko, 1929, breeds in northeastern Siberia eastwards from the Lena, and south to the Sea of Okhotsk. \\"Accentor\\" comes from the old scientific name for the Alpine accentor, Accentor collaris. It derives from Late Latin and means \\"sing with another\\" (ad + cantor). The genus name Prunella is from the German Braunelle, \\"dunnock\\", a diminutive of braun, \\"brown\\", and the specific montanella is a diminutive of Latin montanus, \\"mountain\\". Description From John Gould's Birds of Asia, 1850–1883 The Siberian accentor is on average long and weighs . The adult of the nominate race has brown upperparts and wings, with bright chestnut streaking on its back and a greyish-brown rump and tail. There are two narrow whitish bars on the folded wings. The head has a dark brown crown, a long, wide pale yellow supercilium, a blackish patch behind the eye and grey sides to the neck. The underparts are ochre yellow, becoming strongly buff on the flanks and greyish on the lower belly. There are rich chestnut streaks on the sides of the breast and the flanks. The iris is a warm red-brown, the sharply pointed bill is dark and the legs are reddish. All plumages are similar. The female has slightly duller underparts with weaker streaking, and the juvenile is overall duller with brown spots on the breast and chest. Juvenile birds in autumn also show more wear to the tail feathers and the tertials that cover the folded wing, and they often have a duller iris colour than the adults. The subspecies P. m. badia is somewhat smaller and darker than the nominate form, with richer brown upperparts, deeper buff underparts, and rustier flank streaks. Adults undergo a complete moult between July and September after breeding has finished. Juvenile birds have a partial moult in the same period, replacing the head, body and some wing covert feathers. The only species that can potentially be confused with the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. The Siberian accentor is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask. Voice The call of the Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic ti- ti-ti. The male's song, given from the top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, variously described as similar to that of the Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration. Distribution and habitat Subarctic woodlands near Lake Baikal The Siberian accentor breeds in a belt across northern Russia east from just west of the Ural Mountains to the Pacific coast, with a second, more fragmented, band across southern Siberia. It is migratory, wintering in east China and Korea. This species winters in small numbers in Mongolia, but only rarely in Japan. The breeding habitat is subarctic willow and birch forests, and open coniferous woodland, often close to rivers or bogs, although pairs are also found in mountains and spruce taiga. In winter, the Siberian accentor occupies bushes and shrubs, often near streams, but may also be found in dry grassland and woods. Movements Siberian accentors leave the north of their breeding range from mid-September onwards but may stay for a further month or two in the south. In spring, returning birds pass through Mongolia from the end of March and southeasternmost Russia in April and May, reaching their breeding grounds in May, perhaps as late as June in the far north. Vagrant birds have been recorded in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Lebanon and several European countries, as well as in North America. Most North American records have been in western Alaska and British Columbia, but as of February 2018 there had been records of single birds away from the Pacific coast in Alberta, Idaho and Montana. Alaskan records, like those in western Europe, are mainly from late September to November; occurrences in Canada are less predictable, although mostly in autumn and winter, and mostly at bird feeders. October–November 2016 influx A bird from the October 2016 influx at Easington, East Riding of Yorkshire Wind map for 1–10 October 2016 October and early November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of Siberian accentors into western Europe, including first records for Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, in some cases attracting national attention and hundreds of twitchers. Prior to 2015, only 32 individuals had been recorded in western Europe, the majority in Finland and Sweden, but in October and early November 2016 at least 231 were reported. Records were from the Czech Republic (1), Denmark (11), Estonia (9), Finland (72), Germany (12), Hungary (1), Latvia (9), Lithuania (4), Netherlands (1), Norway (11), Poland (11), Russian Karelia (3), Sweden (71), the UK (14) and the Ukraine (2). Four additional birds in Sweden and one in Finland were not positively identified as Siberian, rather than black-throated, accentors. Those birds that were reliably aged all appeared to be in first-winter plumage. One of the UK birds lingered in Scotland, where it was found in February 2017. Fires and smoke in Siberia may have forced migrating birds westwards. NASA image for July 22, 2016. Most of the birds found were on well-watched coasts and islands, and 25% were trapped; in the Baltic states, the proportion of trapped discoveries were much higher, and all finds in Lithuania were of captured birds. It is likely that many more birds were present but were not detected away from the migration watch points and bird observatories, especially in the south and southeast of the Baltic region. The UK Met Office suggested that the influx of accentors was driven by strong and persistent easterly winds from Siberia, partially driven by a high- pressure area centred over Scandinavia. Another weather system produced easterlies in western Asia during the same period. The weather conditions that carried the accentors so far west also brought large numbers of other Siberian migrants, including a record arrival of yellow-browed warblers in northwest Europe and a sprinkling of extreme eastern rarities such as the UK's first pale-legged leaf warbler and the Netherlands' second eastern crowned warbler. In addition to the weather systems, other factors leading to the irruption may have included the widespread forest fires in that summer and autumn. In June, of woodland was burning, and by September the smoke cloud extended over several thousand kilometres and reached an altitude of . Migrating birds may have moved west to avoid flying through the smoke. The preceding hot summer may also have led to undetected breeding west of the known range involving birds seeking the cooler habitat preferred by this species. There have been suggestions that the accentor influx was augmented by high breeding success in Siberia in 2016, but there is no direct data to support that, and no obvious increase in numbers reaching North America. Behaviour Siberian accentors are typically skulking birds, readily disappearing into cover. They have an above average ability to maintain their body temperature in cold conditions, an adaptation to their sometimes cold environment. Breeding The breeding season of the Siberian accentor is from June to August. Little is known about territorial or breeding behaviour, but birds of the nominate subspecies tend to occur in small groups of two to six closely spaced nests. This clumping does not appear to be shown by the southern subspecies, P. m. badia. The nest is an open cup built above the ground in a dense shrub, or where branches fork in a tree. The nest is constructed from coarse vegetation such as twigs and leaves and lined with hair or fine grasses. The eggs are a glossy deep blue- green and measure ; they weigh about . The clutch of four to six eggs is incubated by the female for about ten days to hatching and the downy brown- black chicks are then fed by both parents. They can breed in the following year. Two broods may be produced annually in the south of the range, just one further north. Feeding The Siberian accentor feeds mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation including bushes and trees, and frequently from near snow fields. Young birds are fed mainly on insects, especially the larvae of beetles, several food items being carried to the nest at each visit. Seeds may be consumed in winter, and the accentors may also then feed near human habitation. Food plants include crowberry, bistort, and members of the aramanth and birch families. Status taiga tick is a parasite of the Siberian accentor The total population for the Siberian accentor is uncertain, although estimates for the small European part of the range vary from 100 to 500 breeding pairs. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and stable. For this reason, the Siberian accentor is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although as a northern breeding species it may in the long term be affected by climate change. Breeding densities have been recorded as over 30 pairs/km2 in northwestern Russia, depending on habitat, generally becoming lower, around 5 pairs/km2 in the east of the range. Weather is also a factor, with an atypically high density of 7.4 birds/km2 being recorded in the Taymyr Peninsula in 1983. The Siberian accentor is parasitised by the taiga tick, which can host the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease.

He is known for his freeware Knytt series, as well as earlier releases, including Within a Deep Forest and the #ModArchive Story series. His most recent game is Uurnog, a Humble Original title released via the March 2017 Humble Monthly Bundle. Nifflas currently lives in Umeå, Sweden. Games Early games Geoffrey the Fly is an example of Nygren's earlier work. Nygren's career in game-making began with a number of small games he released as freeware. Many of these games were extremely simple - consisting of little more than a physics engine and a single level on which to test it, however it was in developing these games that several themes would emerge that would later come to characterize Nygren's work. Among other themes, the concept of the ball as a hero originated in these early games and the games became increasingly atmospheric and ambient in nature. Early games include: *The Turtle Philosopher- a simple platformer *Pteranodon - a simple 2D, vertical-scrolling, single player, musical shoot 'em up game *The #ModArchive series - early ball-based platformers **#ModArchive Story **#ModArchive Story 2: Operator Status *Riddle - a simple puzzle game in which the goal is to discover the rules *Geoffrey the Fly - a simple platformer *Roll - a simple ball-based platformer Early betas include: *Dis - The player takes control of a man as he runs through a disintegrating train *Goble - Precursor to The Turtle Philosopher, Goble also features the Nifflas ball. *Pie War in Water - A 2-player racing game *Within a Deep Forest 2 - An abandoned sequel to Within a Deep Forest. Within A Deep Forest Within A Deep Forest is a freeware game, taking place in the year 2500, after a devastating war has left the Earth a desolate wasteland. One of the survivors, the infamous and notorious Dr. Cliché, creates a time machine that enables him to travel many hundreds of years back in time in order to complete his most dastardly deed, the building of an underwater laboratory in which he has placed the most powerful bomb the world has yet known. \\"If ever this bomb should explode, the entire planet will freeze and all life will be lost. In this way, Dr. Cliché aims to eliminate beyond all reckoning the possibility of such a future ever coming to pass.\\" As the game starts, the bomb has been activated, and the world lies in grave danger. The bomb is in fact Dr. Cliché's second attempt as \\"his first attempt failed and instead lead to the creation of a ball, although, no ordinary ball.\\" The player controls this ball throughout the game. The ball can be transformed into different substances with various materials found in the landscape. Many hazards, including spikes, water, lava, and certain creatures can kill the ball. There are warp spots (save points) at certain places in the game areas. When the ball is killed, it reappears in the last warp spot visited. Bigdownload.com highlighted Nygren's minimalist sound and graphics in Within A Deep Forest, and praised its sense of frustration and emotion. Knytt series Knytt Knytt The name Knytt , which roughly translates as \\"tiny creature\\" from Swedish, comes from a character in the book Vem ska trösta Knyttet? by renowned Finnish-Swedish children's author Tove Jansson. A peculiar creature living on a unique planet, the Knytt is abducted by an alien in a spaceship for no apparent reason and taken into outer space. While the alien is traveling through space, the spaceship is hit by a meteoroid and crashes onto another planet. Thankfully, the Knytt and the alien who has abducted it survive, but the spaceship is so heavily damaged that they are trapped on this new world. It is up to the Knytt to venture courageously through the various types of terrain and caves on this planet to retrieve the pieces of spaceship so that it can return to its home. Knytt Stories Knytt Stories is a follow-up to Knytt, and is mostly a level designer rather than a single campaign. It came packaged with several small levels. It features Juni, a character who shows up commonly in Knytt myths and stories. In the game, the player acts out these stories (also called levels or worlds) as Juni. The two stories that come bundled with the game, \\"Tutorial - Learn How to Play Knytt Stories\\" and \\"The Machine - A Save-the-World Adventure,\\" are fairly short, but the game comes with a full level editor and support for many extra levels in game, loaded from .knytt.bin files. This format is meant to allow for easy access to new stories designed by Nygren as well as to encourage community development of expansion packs and third party stories. To date, Nygren has released two official expansion packs, A Strange Dream (featuring the 4 stories: \\"A Strange Dream - That Night, She Had a Strange Dream,\\" \\"An Underwater Adventure - ...In an Underwater Laboratory,\\" \\"Sky Flower - Abstract and Slightly Pretentious,\\" and \\"This Level is Unfinished - The Author Simply Lost His Interest\\"), and Other Levels (featuring the story: \\"Gustav's Daughter\\"). Nygren has also released a story, the purpose of which is to explain some of the advanced features available for level design. This story is entitled \\"Advanced Features Demo - Useful for Level Designers.\\" The Multimedia Fusion and Nintendo DS source code for Knytt Stories and several other games was made available to public under a restrictive license,Can Kyntt be ported? on pyra-handheld.com (9 March 2012)KS online with OINC - Source Code Available resulting in some modsKnytt Stories on sites.google.com \\"Extended Version v1.5.9\\" (2010) but due to the closed source Multimedia Fusion game engine no source ports. In 2010, based on the source code and with support of Nifflas, a C programming language remake was created, allowing porting to other platforms.Knytt Stories DS on rodrigoroman.comknyttds on googlecode.com Nano Pack Nano Pack volume 1 is a batch of 2 games and an art collection. All of these open in relatively small windows. The games are \\"Knytt Nano\\" and \\"Nano Lasers.\\" Knytt Nano concerns the attempts of a new, unnamed Knytt to return home. The second game is titled \\"Nano Lasers\\" and is a small puzzle game, the object of which is to cause a laser beam to strike a block, overcoming various obstacles. The art collection is entitled \\"Nano Portfolio\\" and contains a small amount of art, ranging from \\"Gubba\\" to pixel art. All of these pieces are made by Sara Sandberg who has assisted him with the creation of many of his previous games. Knytt Experiment The ambitious but unfinished third member of the Knytt series circa 2007. Nygren has canceled work on this game. Knytt Underground Knytt Underground combines the features of Knytt and Within a Deep Forest and was released on PC, Mac and Linux platforms in late 2012, with the PlayStation platforms seeing the first launch. In July 2012, Nifflas announced that he was working on Knytt Underground, and that it is his biggest game yet. It was released on the PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3 and PS Vita in late December 2012, and the console versions include extra content. The game was released on Steam on 25 October 2013. A Wii U version of the game was confirmed in August 2013, and is being ported by Nygren's colleague Mathias Kærlev. The game was released on 19 December 2013 in both North America and Europe. Saira Saira is a 2D puzzle platformer. First announced during the final stages of work on NightSky, the game was initially known as Project Q. It was released on 12 December 2009. The eponymous Saira is a photographer who, as a result of a mysterious accident, found herself as the only remaining person in the entire galaxy and has to find out what happened. Saira features six endings and a unique graphical style that combines traditional 2D animation with high resolution photographs taken by Nygren--the press-release stated that the game was \\"developed almost as much in the outdoors as indoors\\". A level editor was included with the game. FiNCK In May 2010 Nygren released FiNCK (\\"Fire Nuclear Crocodile Killer\\"), a 2D puzzle platformer inspired by Super Mario Bros. 2 and the indie game Lyle in Cube Sector. The game, together with a level editor, is available as a free download; however, custom level support has to be purchased. NightSky NightSky, a physics-based puzzle platformer, was released on 6 January 2011. The game had a long development history; first announced in 2007, it was known variously as Skymning and Night Game. On 5 May 2008, Nygren released three minigames that were going to be part of the project, but were abandoned due to incompatibilities with the new engine. In 2009, news appeared that the game would only be released for Wii, only in late 2010 it was announced that the PC version would appear first and was released on the Steam digital download service on 1 March 2011. The Wii version was eventually cancelled but later arrived on the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. In NightSky, the player controls a glowing sphere which can accelerate and decelerate, and sometimes has the ability to invert gravity. The goal is to guide the sphere through 10 different worlds, each divided into 13 three- screen sections, each section containing a challenge or a puzzle. The soundtrack was composed and performed by Chris Schlarb; the game was produced by Nicalis. Affordable Space Adventures Affordable Space Adventures, a 2D puzzle adventure game for the Wii U, was released on 9 April 2015 in collaboration with Danish developer KnapNok Games. The game takes full advantage of the Wii U GamePad by allowing players to control a complex fictional spaceship via the touch-screen, switching between different engines and adjusting the ship's settings and landing gears to advance through the various levels' obstacles. Uurnog Uurnog, a 2D puzzle platformer with algorithmic music, was released on 3 March 2017 through the March 2017 Humble Monthly Bundle as a Humble Original title. An expanded version titled Uurnog Uurnlimited, published by Raw Fury, was released on 17 November 2017 on Steam and on 21 November 2017 for the Nintendo Switch.http://uurnog.com/ Other games *Car Game - a mini game created by Nygren for a game-design one hour competition *Bagatelle - a mini game originally created by Nygren for inclusion in Night Game as an unlockable. *Cannon - a mini game originally created by Nygren for inclusion in Night Game as an unlockable. *ClickDrop - a mini game originally created by Nygren for inclusion in Night Game as an unlockable. *Det Officiella EDGE Dataspelet \\\\- a mini game programmed by Nygren for EDGE festivalen. *Avoid the Evil Space Eel \\\\- a rhythm mini game created by Nygren for the No More Sweden competition. *The Mushroom Engine - an updated version created by Nygren of an earlier game by another author, Jump On Mushrooms: The Game *R-Type 3.141592653589793238469 - a mini game created by Nygren for the No More Sweden 2009 competition. *The Great Work - a platformer made for a documentary film by Bautafilm.

Nygren has also contributed to the enhanced soundtrack of the WiiWare version of the independent game, Cave Story. Music Apart from contributions to the original scores for eight of the games he has made, Nygren has also created seven stand-alone albums of ambient music. He claims influence from jazz records among others. Additionally, he has released an album of bonus tracks intended to accompany four of the seven albums by providing stylistically similar extras. He has also released a collection of sound effects used in his games. Nygren has been engaged in music creation for the past ten years. Nygren's early works (e.g. Knytt Stories) were primarily composed using Fast Tracker 2;Nifflas on modarchive.com however, his later works often use non-computer hardware. All songs including those from his games are freely available for download online.

New features included ground movements (e.g. towing planes to gates), giving correct Standard Instrument Departure, use of radar vectors, and changing channel frequency. The choice of Standard Terminal Arrival Route distance eliminates the speed instruction in previous version. In the game, there are a few conditions that will cause game over. These include head-on, near miss, pilots' pressure bar reaching 100%, or failed to accumulate enough points to pass that particular stage. The points are awarded according to how fast to reply a response. A slow or non-response will raise the pressure bar. Other things that increase pressure bar include instructing the plane to take off in tailwind or tower failing to give the plane permission to land or go- around. Additional points are awarded at the end of the stage, but before deciding whether there's enough points to pass, for minimal % in pressure bar.

Air Traffic Controller 4  Air Traffic Controller 4 is an air traffic control simulation game developed by TechnoBrain as a successor to the Air Traffic Controller 3. The game is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 until ATC4 - Naha which is no longer compatible with Windows 7 and 8. The first installment, ATC4 - Tokyo Haneda was originally planned to be released on July 15, 2015, but the developers delayed the release of the game to August 28, 2015. However, TechnoBrain delayed again to September 17, 2015 for testing the Windows 10 compatibility. Since March 22, 2018, TechnoBrain released ATC4 - Haneda 2, ATC4 - Fukuoka, ATC4 - Centrair, ATC4 - New Chitose and ATC4 - Naha on Android and iOS.https://gcluster.jp/sp/app/technobrain/news.htmlhttps://gcluster.jp/app/technobrain/index.html Airports and airplanes are more realistically scaled. In-game time counter is now progressing as the same speed as real time. Furthermore, more gates are added for every airport to match their real-life counterparts compared to the previous games. There are also stages based on the actual schedule of the airports of which the players can select the time frame and channels they wish to take charge. Players can't choose runway for the plane to takeoff, landing nor even go-around unless the runway section (e.g. 16L, 16R. etc.) are opened due to changes to the wind pattern (only for ATC4 - Tokyo Haneda). Unlike the previous games, if the planes line up with one another, the game will not result in a head-on game over (only in Normal Mode) unless they're heading into each other. Players can select planes at the top of it or at the flight control selection bar (bottom-right during gameplay). TechnoBrain Airlines also appears here like in ATC3, occasionally presenting problems for players to solve or work around (for the main stages of the game) as well as replacing airlines not included in game. Similar to previous games, the game consists of two modes (Normal Mode and Game Mode). Game Mode is more challenging because player needs to pay attention to the planes on the ground to prevent head-on game over. However, these two modes were later omitted for future installments. The game consists of eight total installments as of October 15, 2020.

The 2007 Kent earthquake registered 4.3 on the Richter scale and struck south east Kent, South East England on 28 April 2007 at 07:18:12 UTC (08:18:12 local time), at a shallow depth of 5.3 km. The worst affected area was the town of Folkestone, although the towns of Deal, Dover and Ashford were also affected. The tremors could be felt across much of Kent and south east England, including as far as East Sussex, Essex and Suffolk, as well as on the other side of the English Channel at Calais and Brussels. Location The British Geological Survey stated that the epicentre of the earthquake was less than 1 km north of Folkestone at 51.10°N, 1.17°E. The United States Geological Survey indicated that the location of the earthquake was at 51.085°N, 1.009°E suggesting a position approximately 5 km north west of Hythe. Impact The earthquake's shallow depth and proximity to Folkestone resulted in structural damage in the town, and one woman suffered a minor head and neck injury. Following the earthquake, a total 474 properties were reported as damaged, with 73 properties too badly damaged for people to return to, 94 seriously damaged, and 307 suffering from minor structural damage. Harvey Grammar School situated in Cheriton Road, Folkestone was closed on 30 April due to \\"significant structural damage\\". Several thousand homes were left without power for several hours and there were reports of a \\"smell of gas\\" in Folkestone. The Port of Dover, the channel tunnel and travel links were unaffected, although authorities asked people heading towards Dover to use the A2. EDF Energy had restored electricity supplies that had been cut by the earthquake by the same afternoon. The Salvation Army Church in Folkestone provided refuge on 28 April for approximately 100 people whose homes had been damaged by the earthquake. On the same morning, a 300-metre (948 ft) long crack appeared in a cliff at Barton-on-Sea in Hampshire, creating fears of a landslide, although there were mixed views from authorities on whether it could be related to the earthquake. Magnitude The British Geological Survey gave the earthquake a reading of 4.3 on the Richter scale, while the USGS and the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre estimated that the earthquake had a body wave magnitude of 4.6 and 4.7 respectively. It was the largest British earthquake since the 2002 Dudley earthquake and the strongest in the Dover Straits since a magnitude 4.4 earthquake in 1950. The strongest recorded British earthquake is the 1931 Dogger Bank earthquake, which measured 6.1 on the Richter scale. Ten months later, the earthquake's strength was surpassed by that of the 2008 Lincolnshire earthquake, which was 5.2 in magnitude. Less than two years later, on 3 March 2009 at 14.35 UTC, Folkestone was shaken by a smaller magnitude 3.0 quake, located in the same area.\\"Recent Earthquakes Reported by BGS\\" http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/recent_events/20090303143556.7.html See also *Dover Straits earthquake of 1580 *Geology of the United Kingdom *List of earthquakes in the British Isles References External links *Earthquake shakes parts of Kent - BBC News *BGS report of the earthquake Kent Kent earthquake 2007 Kent Category:Disasters in Kent Kent earthquake Category:Folkestone Category:2000s in Kent Category:April 2007 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"2007 Kent earthquake"},{"id":"10945158","text":"Robert John Moreland (born 21 August 1941) is a British management consultant and Conservative Party politician. After a single term as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), he served on the Economic and Social Committee of the European Union for twelve years and was elected to two local authorities. He is descended from George Cockle. Education Robert Moreland was educated at Bearsden Academy, Glasgow Academy and Dean Close School (in Cheltenham), the latter two independent schools. He then studied at the University of Nottingham for an undergraduate degree in Economics and at the Institute of World Affairs in Connecticut and the University of Warwick where he obtained postgraduate qualifications. Early career In 1966 Moreland started work in the Civil Service in Canada, at first in the government of Nova Scotia but from 1967 in the government of New Brunswick where he became Assistant Budget Director.\\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons, October 1974\\" (Times Books), p. 217-8. In 1972 he returned to Britain to become Senior Economist on the West Central Scotland Planning Study, a job which took two years. In 1974 he began work as a management consultant for Touche Ross, where he remains. Since 2012 he has been a member of the partnership board of the Canal and Rivers Trust for the Severn and South Wales. Political involvement Moreland became interested in politics, and at the October 1974 general election he was selected as Conservative Party candidate for Pontypool, a safe Labour seat in south Wales, where he lost with a reduced share of the vote. He was a member of the Bow Group and the Conservative Europe Group. At the 1977 Conservative Party conference, Moreland spoke in favour of sales of council houses, arguing that up to 70% of tenants would like the opportunity to buy their home.\\"Quick action promised to enable tenants to buy homes at discount\\", The Times, 13 October 1977. European Parliament Having chaired the Bow Group's European Committee in 1977–78, Moreland was interested in playing an active part in European politics. At the 1979 election to the European Parliament, Moreland was elected for the Conservative Party in the constituency of Staffordshire East. He was a moderate MEP, criticising the slow pace of reform in South Africa in an emergency debate in June 1980.\\"S Africa urged to make reforms\\", The Times, 21 June 1980. He also showed a willingness to see the situation from the ground, travelling in 1983 in the cab of long-distance lorries to see the bureaucratic situation which resulted at border crossings.\\"Taking the red tape road to Turin\\", The Times, 12 August 1983. He wrote a pamphlet called \\"Transport for Europe\\" based on what he learnt. Economic and Social Committee Moreland lost his seat in the 1984 election, but remained interested in the European Union. He wrote to The Times in 1985 to urge British membership of the European Monetary System.\\"Decline of sterling\\" (letter), The Times, 15 January 1985. He was appointed by the Thatcher government as a member of the UK delegation to the EU's Economic and Social Committee in 1986, and served as Chairman of the Regional Policy and Town and Country Planning Section of the Committee from 1990 to 1998. Local politics In May 1990, Moreland was elected to Westminster City Council as a Councillor in the Knightsbridge ward, serving in this role until May 1998. He was Deputy Chief Whip for the Conservative group on the council in 1991–93 and Chief Whip in 1993–94. He served as Chairman of the Environment Committee of the Council in 1994–95 and of the Planning and Environment Committee from 1995 to 1997. He was appointed as Deputy Chairman of the London Research Centre and as a Director of the Albert Memorial Trust from 1997 to 2000. Moreland was nominated to the Conservative Party's list for election to the London Assembly in the 2000 election but was too far down to be elected. He was involved in the London Europe Society and became its Deputy Chairman in 1997 and Chairman in 2000, a post which he currently holds. He was also Treasurer of the European Movement from 2003 to 2008. Moreland also served briefly on Gloucester City Council from 2001 to 2002. He was Chairman of Governors of Archbishop Tenison's C of E School, Lambeth from 2003 to 2011.

It had an estimated population of 640 in 2000. Kamay is part of the Wichita Falls, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area. Geography Kamay is located on State Highway 258, twelve miles (19 km) southwest of Wichita Falls in southwestern Wichita County. Its elevation is above sea level. History Development in the area began in 1912 when Joseph A. Kemp, W. Munger, and Reese S. Allen formed a land company that purchased of Wichita River valley land for resale. By the 1920s, investors had turned their attention to oil exploration and the K-M-A Oil Company was established. The name was formed from each of the three principals' last names. The community that developed around the oil fields became known as Kemp City by 1928. Within ten years, more than 100 wells were operating in and around Kemp City. The community's name again changed in the 1930s. Texas already had a post office operating under the name Kemp (in Kaufman County), while using the initials K-M-A was deemed unacceptable. The name Kamay was chosen to solve the problem. Despite Kamay being the official name, Kemp City remained in use as well. At its peak in the 1940s, Kamay had a population of around 700 and twenty-one businesses. There were twenty-seven businesses in Kamay by the mid-1950s. In 2000, the population had declined to approximately 640 with seven businesses operating in the community.

ICAI is the acronym by which the Instituto Católico de Artes e Industrias (Catholic Institute for Arts and Industry in English) is known. It is the name of the school even before it joined the Comillas Pontifical University in 1978. Currently, the ICAI School of Engineering occupies three buildings in Madrid's neighbourhood of Argüelles, in the streets of Alberto Aguilera 25 (headquarters), Santa Cruz de Marcenado, and Francisco de Ricci.  History  ICAI was funded in 1908 by the Jesuits as a technical school for industry workers. Its study programmes were officially recognised by the Spanish Government in 1957. In 1960 ICAI merged with ICADE to become ICAI-ICADE. In 1978, with a view to reinforce a catholic university with a wider range of academic disciplines, ICAI-ICADE joined the Comillas Pontifical University, and new School of Engineering kept ICAI as a brand name. During the 2006-07 academic year,ICAI en cifras it had 1805 undergraduate students, 147 graduate students, and its 264 academics attracted research funds for a total of €3.7 million. 63% of the graduating students had done paid industrial placements. ICAI sent 150 students abroad for international exchanges and hosted 92 international students. It has exchange agreements with 49 European universities and 41 US and Asian universities.  Academic Studies  ICAI offers just two engineering programs to undergraduates: Industrial Engineering (electric, electronic and mechanical), and Telecommunications Engineering. Both programs are structured in a 4-year Bachelor plus a 2-year Master. In addition ICAI offers several specialized Master programs oriented to the industry and a Doctorate program oriented to engineering research.  IIT  The Instituto de Investigación Tecnológica (IIT), Institute for Research in Technology in English, is a part of the School of Engineering. It is a non-profit institute which conducts research and postgraduate training on diverse technological fields. It is financed through participation in specific projects of interest for Industry, and responds to a clear social demand.

An R&B; and soul song, \\"Suga Mama\\" is built on a hip hop and jazzy beat, and samples Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers' song \\"Searching for Soul\\", written by Chuck Middleton. Lyrically, it features the female protagonist willing to pay large sums of money to keep her love interest contented. \\"Suga Mama\\" was generally well received by music critics, who noted it as one of the highlights from B'Day and complimented Harrison's production. However, there was some limited criticism about Knowles' vocal delivery on the song. Though not released as a single, \\"Suga Mama\\" had a music video filmed in black-and-white, and directed by Melina Matsoukas and Knowles, for the B'Day Anthology Video Album. It received a limited release to British music TV channels. \\"Suga Mama\\" was added on the set list of Knowles' world tour, The Beyoncé Experience (2007). Recording Knowles enlisted Harrison as one of the five co-producers of B'Day, and she arranged for him, Sean Garrett and Rodney Jerkins to be given individual rooms at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Knowles said she fostered \\"healthy competition\\" between the producers by going into each of their rooms and commenting on the \\"great beats\\" the others were creating. She and Harrison had previously collaborated on her 2003 single \\"Crazy in Love\\", which uses a prominent soul music sample in a similar manner to \\"Suga Mama\\". Fox News said that \\"Suga Mama\\" and \\"Freakum Dress\\", Harrison's other contribution to B'Day \\"fall short of originality but mimic the Chi Lites percussion section [of \\"Crazy in Love\\"] yet again\\", adding, \\"Harrison is like the Indiana Jones of soul, constantly pulling out forgotten gems of the past for sampling [...] You can't help but think: Thank God someone wrote music in the past that can be repurposed now.\\" Music and theme \\"Suga Mama\\" is a moderate R&B; and soul song that displays influences of the 1960s as well as 1970s funk and rock music. It also song contains limited elements of the 1980s go-go and sounds more closely resembling live music than Knowles' previous recordings. According to the sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation, \\"Suga Mama\\" was composed using common time in the key of G minor, with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute. Knowles' vocals span from the low note of C4 to the high note of G5 as she sings on a hip hop and jazzy beat. The main instrumentation is provided by a bluesy guitar. IGN Music noted that \\"Suga Mama\\" is built of a \\"static grit groove\\", and Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song consists of a mixture of \\"brute power and slick syncopation\\". It samples Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers' song \\"Searching for Soul\\", which was written by Chuck Middleton. \\"Suga Mama\\" features the female protagonist offering up the keys to her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably so that he can listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: \\"It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me what you want me to buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...\\". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and \\"take it off while I watch you perform\\". Staff members of USA Today contrasted \\"Suga Mama\\" with the 1999 song \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that \\"From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [Knowles is] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'.\\" Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: \\"I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store\\" with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007).\\" On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence. Critical reception The song received generally positive reviews. Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times, who reviewed B'Day negatively, wrote that \\"Suga Mama\\" was the \\"best moment\\" on the album, and that it \\"owes much of its charm to lifts from Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers\\". Likewise, Bernard Zuel The Sydney Morning Herald cited \\"Suga Mama\\" as one of the \\"good moments\\" on B'Day, writing: \\"... followed by a dud ... the slinky funk of 'Suga Mama' is trodden on by the mechanical 'Upgrade U' and then trampled by the posturing and eventually annoying 'Ring the Alarm'\\". Chris Richards of The Washington Post commented that Rich Harrison \\"delivers again with 'Suga Mama', twisting a vintage Soul Searchers sample into a gritty, loping groove. Beyonce sounds right at home on this one ... And while it doesn't quite eclipse 'Crazy in Love', it's still B'Day's finest moment.\\" Andy Kellman of Allmusic described \\"Suga Mama\\" as a \\"spectacularly layered\\" track. Eb Haynes of AllHipHop considered \\"Suga Mama\\" to be an embodiment of \\"the woman wearing and buying $500 stiletto pumps.\\" Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic wrote that Knowles is as \\"sweet and faux-innocent\\" as the 1960s soul stars in the song. Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly wrote that songs such as \\"Suga Mama\\" showcase of Knowles' virtuosity and continued, \\"No one – not R. Kelly, not Usher, to say nothing of her rival pop divas – can match Beyoncé's genius for dragging her vocal lines [...]\\". By contrast, IGN Music criticized Knowles' vocals in the song, writing that she \\"comes in over the low-end track with too much earnestness, drowning out the funky grooves with her piercing dramatic mezzo-soprano. If she were a throaty alto, she'd fit the beats that have been served up to her much more appropriately.\\" Music video Knowles riding a mechanical bull in the music video The accompanying music video for \\"Suga Mama\\" was released to British music channels in April 2007. It was shot in black-and-white and was co-directed by Melina Matsoukas alongside Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month; \\"Suga Mama\\" was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the video album. It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair, wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. She gets up and begins to pole dance. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing on top of a sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a circle of light, and riding a mechanical bull. Knowles said she is meant to \\"slowly become a woman\\" during the video, adding \\"Well, a sexier woman – I'm always a woman.\\" Knowles rehearsed the pole dancing using two ballet bars, which was when it was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though she is from Texas, she had never previously been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00 am that they completed work. Live performances The Mamas providing backing vocals on Knowles' I Am... Tour Although Knowles did not perform \\"Suga Mama\\" in any televised appearances, the song was a part of her set list on The Beyoncé Experience (2007). In Los Angeles, Knowles performed segments of the song, dressed in a golden, translucent slip and golden, sparkling panties. It was executed without backup dancers, but with live instrumentation and only backup singers toward the performance's conclusion. \\"Suga Mama\\" was included on her 2007 live album The Beyoncé Experience Live. Bill Friskics-Warren of The Tennessean wrote that the song \\"was even sexier and more gutbucket than on record\\".

Born in the province of Guria (then part of Kutais Governorate, Imperial Russia), he engaged in local peasant movement and was a member of the Georgian Social Democratic (Menshevik) Party. He played a prominent role in the 1903-06 Gurian Republic, the first social-democratic self-governing territory within the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Georgia became an independent democratic republic in 1918 and Khomeriki was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Georgia. He then assumed the position of Minister for Agriculture in the Georgian government. During his tenure, Khomeriki authored a successful land reform (January 1919), which redistributed the land as private property, retaining only forests, rivers and some pastureland as state property.Lang, p. 212. The Red Army invasion forced the Georgian cabinet into exile to France where Khomeriki remained a member of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in exile.Lang, p. 241. In 1922, he secretly returned to Georgia to supervise the Committee for Independence of Georgia, an underground anti- Soviet organization. However, he was arrested by the Cheka in 1923 and shot during the 1924 purge in Georgia.  Works  *N.

Immigration and immigrant workers in Singapore have been closely associated with Singapore's economic development. For a long period after its founding, the majority of Singapore's population were immigrants. It was not until around the 1930s that the number of native births in Singapore would overtake net immigration. After its expulsion from Malaysia in 1965, immigration laws were modified in 1966 to reinforce Singapore's identity as a sovereign state. However, the initial strict controls on immigrant workers were relaxed as demand for labour grew with increased industrialisation. Immigration would again become the largest contributor to population increase in Singapore in the late 20th century and early 21st century. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority publishes a number of criteria for eligibility for permanent residence.ICA - Becoming a permanent resident In colonial times, British merchants, Chinese, Malay and Indian migrants moved to Singapore and helped develop the region. The large flow of migrants into Singapore in more recent times however has raised concerns and curbs on immigration have been introduced.

The founding of colonial Singapore as a free port led to a rapid influx of people, initially mostly Malays, quickly followed by Chinese. It was estimated that when Raffles arrived in Singapore in January 1819, Singapore had about 120 Malays, 30 Chinese and some local tribes such as the Orang Laut. Another estimate put the total population of Singapore at 1,000, mostly of various local tribes. By 1821, the population was estimated to have increased to 4,724 Malays and 1,150 Chinese. Javanese, Bugis and Balinese also began to arrive. In the first census of 1824, out of the 10,683 total, 6,505 were Malays and Bugis constituting over 60% of the population. The total population of Singapore then increased to 16,000 by 1829, 26,000 five years later, and 60,000 by the beginning of 1850. Chinese migrants started to enter Singapore from the Straits area and southern China to trade just months after it became a British settlement. Later migrant workers from China would also increase considerably to work on the pepper and gambier plantations, with 11,000 recorded in one year. Indian migrants also arrived, mostly from Bengal and the Coromandel Coast. Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for a large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, some of whom then settled in Singapore after their contracts ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and it showed that Chinese were the largest ethnic group at 57.6%. In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555, with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians. The Chinese population of Singapore has stayed at over 70% of the total ever since. The early population figures show that Chinese immigrants of the period were overwhelmingly male. The 1826 figures give a total population of 13,750, with 5,747 Chinese males and only 341 Chinese females, compared to 2,501 Malay males and 2,289 Malay females. The sex ratio of Indian migrants was similarly distorted. The imbalance of the sexes of the immigrant communities continued for a long time with the continual flow into Singapore of male migrant workers who were either single or had left their wives and children behind in China or India, for example the 1901 census figures show that there were 130,367 Chinese males and 33,674 Chinese females. Most of the early Chinese immigrants did not intend to settle permanently to raise their families there; they worked to send money back home, and many would return to China after they had earned enough money. For over a hundred years, the great proportion of the Chinese in Singapore were immigrants – by the late 1890s only around 10% of the Chinese population were native-born in Singapore. Later an increasing number would also choose to settle permanently in Singapore, especially in the 1920s when more chose to remain in Singapore rather than leave. Change in social attitude in the modern era also meant that Chinese women were freer to emigrate from China, and the sex ratio began to normalise in the 20th century, which led to a much greater number of people being born in Singapore. Immigration continued to be the main reason for the Chinese population increase in Singapore until the 1931-1947 period when the natural increase in population surpassed the net immigration figure. Immigration from China and India to Singapore stopped during the years of Japanese occupation. After the Second World War, the immigration pattern shifted from the influx of migrants from other countries to movement of people between peninsular Malaya and Singapore, with a significant number of net migrants moving from Malaya to Singapore. However, after the declaration of independence of Malaya in 1957, the migration of people from Malaya began to fall.

This and increasing job opportunities in Malaysia meant that the previous high level of movement of people between the two countries fell significantly. Net migration in Singapore dropped to 24,000 in the decade of 1970-80 due to tighter control of immigration from Malaysia and other countries. However, a lower rate of natural growth in population and the need for low-skill labour resulted in a deliberate shift in policy by the Singapore government to allow more foreigners to live and work in the country, and net migration increased in the 1980-1990 period to nearly 200,000. By the decade of 1990–2000, the net migrant number of over 600,000 had surpassed the natural growth of the population, and accounted for nearly two-thirds of the population increase. The same high level of immigration is also seen in the next decade with 664,083 net migration recorded. Curbs on immigration however began to be implemented in the 2010s to ease increasing social issues arising from the high level of immigration. The high level of foreign migrant workers in late 20th and early 21st centuries meant that Singapore has one of the highest percentages of foreigners in the world. By the middle of the 2010s, nearly 40% of the population were estimated to be of foreign origin; although many have become permanent residents, most of them were non-citizens made up of foreign students and workers including dependants. Between 1970 and 1980, the size of the non-resident population in Singapore doubled. The numbers began to increase greatly from 1980 to 2010. Foreigners constituted 28.1% of Singapore's total labour force in 2000, to 34.7% in 2010, which is the highest proportion of foreign workers in Asia. Singapore's non-resident workforce increased 170% from 248,000 in 1990 to 670,000 in 2006 (Yeoh 2007). By 2010, the non-resident workforce had reached nearly 1.09 million, of these 870,000 were low-skilled foreign workers in Singapore; another 240,000 were skilled foreign worker, better-educated S-pass or employment pass holders. Malaysia is the main source of immigrants in Singapore (386,000 in 2010), followed by China, Hong Kong, and Macau, then South Asia, Indonesia, and other Asian countries. As of June 2014, the total population of Singapore stands at 5.47 million: 3.34 million citizens and 0.53 million permanent residents (total resident number 3.87 million), with 1.60 million non-residents with work passes and foreign students. Policy In Singapore, the term migrant workers is separated into foreign workers and foreign talents. Foreign workers refers to semi-skilled or unskilled workers who mainly work in the manufacturing, construction, and domestic services sectors. The majority of them come from places such as People's Republic of China, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Thailand, as part of bilateral agreements between Singapore and these countries. Foreign talent refers to foreigners with professional qualifications or acceptable degrees working at the higher end of Singapore's economy. They mostly come from India, Australia, the Philippines, People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Europe, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States. On 24 July 1998, the Singaporean government first constructed a system under which different types of employment passes (EP) are issued to migrant workers according to their qualifications and monthly salaries. The \\"P, Q, R\\" employment pass system was put into practice on 1 September 1998; a new \\"S\\" type employment pass was later introduced on 1 July 2004. The government has also set different policies on recruiting foreign talents and foreign workers. In 2014, the Ministry of Manpower did away with their pass type category, however, the criteria remains the same. From 1 January 2017, new EP applicants will have to earn a fixed monthly salary of $3,600 or more, depending on their qualifications and experience. The different policies towards 'Foreign workers' and 'Foreign talent' in Singapore have led some people to feel that their contributions toward Singapore's development are valued differently. However, the Singapore government has always stressed the importance of migrant workers to Singapore's economy and development. Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, then Prime Minister, said in his 1997 National Day rally speech that the government's lack of restrictions on the recruitment of foreigners did not extend only to top-rung prestigious positions, but also to middle-level management, skilled worker and technician positions. Foreign talent Various policies and incentives are used to attract foreign talent to Singapore. CONTACT SINGAPORE was launched in 1997 by the International Talent Division of the Ministry of Manpower, beginning with six offices worldwide, to facilitate the inflow of international talent to Singapore. The Singapore Talent Recruitment (STAR) Committee was formed in November 1998 with the aim of attracting foreign talents to Singapore. Other similar programmes include Manpower 21, launched in 1999, and the International Manpower Program of the Economic Development Board. The government has developed the Scheme for Housing of Foreign Talents with the aim of providing affordable yet comfortable accommodations for foreign talents, to attract them to work and stay in Singapore. Foreign workers On the other hand, stringent policies and regulations have been set on employing foreign workers. In 1981, the government even announced its intention to phase out all unskilled foreign workers by the end of 1991, except domestic maids and those employed in construction and shipyards. The policy stance was met with strong protests from employers facing labour shortages. In April 1987, the Singapore government announced its immigration policy, which intended to control the foreign worker inflow. The two key elements in the policy were a monthly levy payable by the employer for each foreign worker employed, and a \\"dependency ceiling\\" that limits the proportion of foreign workers in the total workforce of any one employer. The government later introduced a two-tier levy system in October 1991 under which employers were required to pay a higher levy on workers whose employment would change the \\"dependent ceiling\\" value of the company. The levy and the \\"dependency ceiling\\" have remained the two instruments with which the government has regulated worker inflow in line with changes in domestic labour-market conditions. In 2020, it was reported that of the 1.4 million foreign workers in Singapore, nearly 1 million were in lower paid, lower skilled work. On top of the low pay is a perception that these jobs are physically taxing issue that Singaporeans appear unwilling to do these jobs. Nevertheless, some observers, such as Selina Ling at OCBC note that migrants workrs are indeed necessary given the ageing labour force and a low fertility rate. Non- residents working in Singapore will require a work visa. There are various types of Singapore work visas starting from work permits for the lower-skilled labourers, to P1 and P2 category Employment Passes to attract niche professionals with good credentials in both education and work experience. From 1 September 2012 only foreign workers with earnings of at least SG$4,000 (US$3,150) per month can sponsor their spouses and children for their stay in Singapore and some of them are also not allowed to bring their parents and in- laws on long-term visit passes. The new regulation also impacts those who switch companies on/after the date, but foreign workers whose families are already in Singapore won't be affected. The increase from SG$2,800 to SG$4,000 was to ease public disquiet over the influx of workers from overseas. In December 2012, there were over 1,268,300 foreign workers employed in Singapore, while in December 2018 this had increased to 1,386,000. As of 2020, foreign workers make up some three quarters of the whole construction industry, half of manufacturing, and 30 per cent of services. During the COVID-19 pandemic it became clear that dormitories used to house foreign workers were reported to be unsanitary and crowded - conditions that made it ripe for the virus to take hold. In some cases, foreign workers in dormitories would be living twenty to a room. Retired diplomat Tommy Koh called the living conditions \\"third world\\" while Amnesty International called the situation a \\"recipe for disaster\\". Dominique Mosbergen at the Huffington Post said that COVID-19 \\"exposes ugly truth about Singapore's treatment of migrant workers\\". As the situation continued to evolved, it became clear by the middle of April that while cases had remained reasonably low in the general population, there was a significant spike in cases of foreign workers who were housed in dormitories, leading to their declaration as Isolation Areas under the Infectious Disease Act. The significant increase in cases towards the end of April was brought about because of the close proximity and intermingling of workers the packed dormitories, but also because of aggressive testing of the part of the Singapore government to try to get a hold on the situation. Minister of Manpower Josephine Teo vowed to improve the living conditions of foreign workers after the quarantine was handled. It was announced that from January 2021, a new insurance scheme would be introduced to cover migrant workers against critical illnesses and non-work related deaths, with the employers needing to pay premiums of $9 a year per worker. 2013 Population White Paper In early 2013, the Singapore parliament debated over the policies recommended by the Population White Paper entitled A Sustainable Population for a Dynamic Singapore. Citing that Singapore's 900,000 Baby Boomers would comprise a quarter of the citizen population by 2030 and that its workforce would shrink \\"from 2020 onward\\", the White Paper projected that by 2030, Singapore's \\"total population could range between 6.5 and 6.9 million\\", with resident population between 4.2 and 4.4 million and citizen population between 3.6 and 3.8 million. The White Paper called for an increase in the number of foreign workers so as to provide balance between the number of skilled and less-skilled workers, as well as provide healthcare and domestic services. It also claimed that foreign workers help businesses thrive when the economy is good.A Sustainable Population for a Dynamic Singapore. The motion was passedAmended motion on white paper adopted; 6.9 million is not a target. The Straits Times. 9 February 2013. albeit after amendments made to leave out \\"population policy\\" and add focus on infrastructure and transport development. The White Paper was criticised by opposition parties. Member of Parliament Low Thia Khiang of the Workers' Party of Singapore had criticised current measures of increasing the fertility rate, claiming that the high cost of living and lack of family and social support discouraged young couples from having babies. As for current immigration policies, he had noted that immigrants were a source of friction for Singaporeans and that an increased population would put more stress on the already strained urban infrastructure.A Sustainable Singapore with a Dynamic Singaporean majority – MP Low Thia Khiang The Workers' Party. PAP MP Inderjit Singh had also spoken out on the issue, citing cohesion and social issues that would have been made worse with the proposed immigrant influx rate. On 16 February 2013, nearly 3,000 people rallied to protest the White Paper and raise concerns that the increased population would lead to the deterioration of public service and the increase of the cost of living in the future. Impact and criticism The large influx of migrants from the 1980s onward has raised concerns about the government's policy on immigration. Whilst the inflow of immigrants and foreign workers have helped to alleviate a labour crunch and help the economy, it has also resulted in strong sentiment by the locals against both foreigners and the government, and was a major issue in both the 2011 general and presidential elections. Singaporeans have attributed to the government's open- door immigration policy the country's overcrowding and falling reliability of its public transportation system, increasing property prices for housing, suppressed wage level, increased competition for jobs and education, increasing income inequality and other social problems. These issues came under close scrutiny by foreign media in the aftermath of the 2013 Little India riot. Local NGOs have also raised issues of migrant welfare, especially those relating to work injury and living conditions. Social pressures have been acknowledged by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong with various measures put in place in the last few years, such as the Fair Employment (Consideration) Framework and Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices and increasing support for migrant workers. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and various government agencies have spoken out against a rising anti-foreigner sentiment after Singaporeans expressed outrage at disparaging statements made by foreigners residing in Singapore. For example, in March 2012, Sun Xu, a scholar from China studying in the National University of Singapore, made a remark in his blog that \\"there are more dogs than humans in Singapore\\". This was weeks after a revelation in parliament that SG$36 million worth of scholarships were awarded to 2,000 foreign students every year, something that is unheard of in other countries. The government was accused of disadvantaging local students in places for education and affordability, and in response it has made a policy change in primary education to give some priority to Singaporeans. Further incidents have also fanned local sentiments against expatriates and foreign workers in Singapore, for example, the publicity over negative comments about the locals by banker Anton Casey and Filipino nurse Ed Mundsel Bello Ello. In the case of Anton Casey, he had posted comments on Facebook which had abused, variously, a taxi driver and Singaporean commuters in general. For Ello Ed Mundsel Bello, he suggested that Singaporeans could not compete with Filipinos. Whilst anti-foreigner sentiments are still prevalent online, fifteen foreigners who were interviewed by CNA did not feel such anti-foreigner sentiments reflected what they encountered in the real world. Local Singaporeans have also written in to the press to encourage fellow Singaporeans to have a mindset of being more accepting towards other cultures, reminding them that Singapore is also from immigrant stock. Media reporting that foreign workers helping out in distress situations have also helped improve locals' perception of them. There are also concerns that immigrants were using Singapore as a springboard for immigration to other developed countries. Every year, 300 naturalised citizens renounce their Singapore citizenship. Many foreigners remain hesitant to take up Permanent Residency (PR) or Singapore citizenship because of the two years of mandatory military service for male citizens and second-generation PRs.

She is best known for her number-one R&B; single \\"I Want To Be Loved (But Only By You).\\" Life and career Born to Creole parents Emmett Roberts and Hazel Hickman in Colfax, Louisiana, her family moved to Brooklyn, New York when she was three. Growing up, Churchill played violin and sang with the choir at St. Peter Claver Catholic School in Brooklyn. She graduated from Brooklyn's Girls' High School. In the 1930 and 1940 United States Census she and her parents are listed as Negro, as Louisiana Creoles were required to do at the time. Churchill never denied her African American ancestry even as she attained fame, and she appeared in black publications such as Jet magazine. In 1939, Churchill quit her job as a waitress to pursue a singing career. She began singing at Small's Paradise in Harlem, earning $18 a week. She performed with the Crystal Caraverns in Washington D.C. and then toured with Edgar Hayes band in 1941. Her first recordings, including the risqué \\"Fat Meat Is Good Meat\\", issued on Beacon Records in 1942. These were followed the next year by recordings on Capitol with the Benny Carter Orchestra, including her first hit \\"Hurry, Hurry\\". In 1945, Churchill signed with Irving Berman's Manor Records, and that year \\"Daddy Daddy\\" peaked at #3 on the R&B; chart. Two years later, reached #1 on the R&B; chart with \\"I Want To Be Loved (But Only By You)\\", which topped the charts for eight weeks. The record was billed as being with vocal group The Sentimentalists, who soon renamed themselves The Four Tunes. Subsequent recordings with The Four Tunes, including \\"Time Out For Tears\\" (#10 R&B;, #24 pop) and \\"I Want To Cry\\", both in 1948, were also successful. Billed as \\"Sex- Sational\\", Churchill performed to much acclaim, and appeared in the movies Miracle in Harlem (1948) and Souls of Sin (1949). From 1949, Churchill recorded with Regal, RCA Victor and Decca Records, recording the original version of \\"Shake A Hand\\", later a big hit for Faye Adams, and also recording with the Ray Charles Singers. By 1952, Churchill became one of the top box- office attraction at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, the Regal Theater in Chicago, the Howard Theater in Washington D.C., and the Palladium in London.She toured widely with backing vocal group The Striders, including a visit to Hawaii in 1954. In 1953, Churchill released gospel tunes on Decca Records. In 1956, she was one of the first artists signed to the Argo label, set up as a subsidiary to Chess Records. Churchill's career ended in 1956 when, as she was singing on stage in a club, a drunken man fell on top of her from a balcony above, causing severe, debilitating injuries from which she would never fully recover. Although she did some recording in 1960, releasing her debut album Time Out For Tears on Jamie Records, her health declined greatly until her death from pneumonia in Brooklyn in 1974.Savannah Churchill Biography at Black Cat Rockabilly.

Biography Simon Holmes was born on 28 March 1963 at Mordialloc Hospital to Neville and Eve Holmes. He grew up with an elder sister, Kerith, and a younger brother, Rowan. The family lived in Bentleigh, before shifting to Turramurra in 1967, before going overseas for three years, in upstate New York, where Holmes started school at Myers Corner. The family then moved to Geneva, Switzerland. He spent part of his childhood in Canberra, attending the AME School: an alternative education institution and then Hawker College. Holmes moved to Sydney in the early 1980s. He started studying anthropology and archaeology at the University of Sydney, but left after two years. In 1981 Holmes, on guitar and vocals, replaced founding member Greg Suptut in Sydney-based punk rockers, the Exserts, until May 1983. His musical influences include punk rock, psychedelia and new wave. During the mid-1980s Holmes was a member of Bug Eyed Monsters, alongside John Boyce on bass guitar and Mark Temple on drums. In 1986 the trio formed the Hummingbirds, as a pop group. Holmes described their name, \\"I don't particularly like but it stuck. We were in a hurry when we recorded our first single and it was innocuous enough for all of us. But it's an appropriate name — it's light and inoffensive and relatively memorable.\\" Soon after they were joined by Alannah Russack on guitar. Early in 1987 Robyn St Clare replaced Boyce on bass guitar and vocals. The Hummingbird's debut single, \\"Alimony\\" (July 1987), was written by Holmes. As of August 1989 Holmes was working in a record store (which was also his group's label), Phantom Records, while St Clare worked in a book shop and a coffee shop. Holmes and St Clare became domestic partners and, in 1991, they had a child. The group's debut album, loveBUZZ (October 1989) via rooArt, peaked at No. 31 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The Canberra Times Kathryn Whitfield observed \\"he likes his music loud enough to rattle his bones and vibrate his internal organs, and judging by the somewhat speedy success of the band's debut album, loveBUZZ, there are a lot of other folk who enjoy the same experience.\\" Most of its 14 tracks were written by Holmes, although its lead single, \\"Blush\\" (August 1989), was co- written with St Clare. It became their highest charting single when it reached No. 19. The group issued a second album, Va Va Voom (April 1991), and disbanded in December 1993. During 1992, while still with the Hummingbirds he issued a single, \\"Strung Out\\", under the name, Revhead. In the 1990s Holmes helped run an alternative culture bookshop, Half A Cow, in Glebe and he also worked as a music retailer. As a record producer he worked on Custard's second album, Wahooti Fandango (July 1994), the Fauves' second album, The Young Need Discipline (November 1994, co-produced with Wayne Connolly) and Things of Stone and Wood's fourth album, Whirligig (September 1996, co-produced with Things of Stone and Wood, James Black). Holmes released an album, Airbrushed Perfection and two mini-albums with his band Fragile, between 1995 and 2000. By October 2004 he was a member of Her Name in Lights, which issued their debut album, Into the Light Again, on Laughing Outlaw Records. Holmes provided bass guitar, lead guitar, and pump organ; and also produced the album. Holmes died in Sydney in July 2017, at the age of 54. Cause of death was not publicly announced.

Biography He began his career at the right-wing newspaper Il Secolo d'Italia, until entering the ranks of the far right party Italian Social Movement (MSI) and later of National Alliance (AN) after repudiation of extremism. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 1994. At the time he was the spokesman of Gianfranco Fini. From 1996 to 2000 he was chairman of the bicameral Commission supervising the RAI. In April 2000 he was elected President of Lazio. Among measures taken by Storace there was the opening of Sant'Andrea hospital and other health centers.Paghiamo ancora i debiti di Badaloni , \\"Il quotidiano della Tuscia\\"]. His health management of Lazio won praise for Giulio Andreotti and some members of the Vatican curia.S'avanza Sua Sanità , 29/04/2005. In 2005 he failed the re-election, defeated by the centre-left candidate Piero Marrazzo. He was subsequently named Minister of Health in the Berlusconi III Cabinet. In March 2006 Storace was involved in the so-called Laziogate scandal, leading to his resignation from the government. He is suspected to have illegally exploited informatics mean to investigate the memberships of the new party founded by Alessandra Mussolini, a former member of AN who was one of his rivals in the 2005 regional election. In October 2012 Storace was acquitted, because \\"the crime does not exist\\".Il commento dell’avv. Romolo Reboa alla sentenza di assoluzione nel processo di appello del cosiddetto Laziogate. On 10 April 2006 he was elected to the Italian Senate in Lazio, where he was at the head of the party list. On 3 July 2007, after having continually criticized the leadership of Gianfranco Fini at least since 2005, he finally left AN on 16 November 2007. One of the motivations of the criticism between Fini and Storace is the fact that Fini repudiated the values of the right. In November 2007 he founded his brand new national-conservative party, named The Right. Storace ran for president in the 2013 regional election in Lazio, but he got 29.3% of the vote and was beaten by Nicola Zingaretti.

Early career Born in Lankaran to a wealthy noble family (from her maternal side, she was the niece of general Samad bey Mehmandarov), Talyshinskaya first studied at Maryam Bayramalibeyova's Uns School for Girls and moved to Baku at the age of nine to attend the Azerbaijani Girls Seminary. While residing at her older sister Bilgeys's house, she learned how to play the piano and the tar with no professional instruction. Her exceptional ear for music and voice was quickly gaining her fame as an amateur mugham singer and in 1934, she became a soloist at the Azerbaijan Philharmonic Society. She travelled to Azerbaijan's remote rural regions to collect samples of folk music, many of which would later be performed publicly for the first time. By 1936 she had given concerts in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kiev, and had released a gramophone record. The Voice of Happiness and Optimism: Jahan Talyshinskaya by Afruz Mammadova. Musigi-dunya.az Exile and later life After the arrest and exile of her ex-husband, brother, sister and two brothers-in-law in 1937 during the Stalin Purges, Talyshinskaya was treated by government institutions with suspicion, sometimes to a point of being refused permission to go on tour. Despite being recognized as an Honoured Artist of Azerbaijan in 1940, Talyshinskaya and her fourteen-year-old son Nazim were eventually exiled to Petropavlovlsk, Kazakhstan as \\"enemies of the people\\" in 1942. She was later permitted to settle in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where she managed to continue her career at the local philharmonic society. She soon met with the member of the USSR Council of Ministers Arts Committee and future Deputy Minister of Culture Vladimir Surin who had happened to know Talyshinskaya from a pop music contest in Moscow, in which she had participated and won back in 1938. Following his approval, she left Tashkent for Tbilisi, Georgia to perform at the Tbilisi Azeri Drama Theatre, and later (at the insistence of director Shamsi Badalbeyli) at the Azerbaijan Musical Comedy Theatre, where she proved to be an outstanding comedy actress. In 1949, her case was revoked and she was exiled to Central Asia for the second time. Talyshinskaya and her son were exonerated shortly after Soviet premier Joseph Stalin's death but continued to live in Tashkent until the devastating earthquake of 1966 destroyed their house. They immediately returned to Baku where Jahan Talyshinskaya died a year later of heart failure, while playing the piano.

Mountainous, chotts, wetlands and grassy desert-like regions all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilisation. The most commonly seen animals include the wild boars, jackals, and gazelles, although it is not uncommon to spot fennecs and jerboas. Leopard and cheetah are seldom seen. A variety of bird species make the country an attraction for bird watchers. Barbary macaques are the sole native monkey. Snakes, monitor lizards, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of rodents throughout the semi arid regions of Algeria. Endangered species and conservation Algeria is also home to a number of dangered species which are currently not protected under Algerian law. A creature that is dangered in Algeria is the Mediterranean monk seal. These seals live in caves and in rocky outcrops along the coast of Algeria and their numbers have been made scarce by over-fishing and pollution. Monk seals do not give birth often and usually have only one pup, which means attempts to increase the seal population are slow and difficult. Besides the serval and seals, Algerian wild dogs and a species of bat are also considered to be endangered. Flowers In the north some of the native flowers includes daffodiles scrub, oaks, cedars and other conifers. The grape vine is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region some oases have palm trees. Acacias with wild olives are the predominant flowers in the remainder of the Sahara. Fauna Mammals There are 104 mammal species in Algeria, of which three are critically endangered, two are endangered, ten are vulnerable, and three are near-threatened.

Isolated locations were sought to hold religious ceremonies, as observing the Catholic Mass was a matter of difficulty and danger at the time as a result of both Cromwell's campaign against the Irish, and the Penal Law of 1695. Bishops were banished and priests had to register to preach under the 1704 Registration Act. Priest hunters were employed to arrest unregistered priests and Presbyterian preachers under an Act of 1709. In many instances a stone would be taken from a church ruin, and relocated to a rural area, with a simple cross carved on its top. Because the activity was illegal, the services were not scheduled and parishioners would be obliged to spread the word of them informally. By the late 17th century worship generally moved to thatched Mass houses. Some of the Mass rock places may have been used for patterns. Similar stones, known as Mass stones, are found in Scotland. Presbyterians held similar Conventicles and these were also outlawed, even though they were not religious ceremonies. For Lutherans during the Counter-Reformation in Austria, a similar stone in Paternion was dubbed the hundskirche.

Local  In the 1970s the A292 Ashford Ring Road was created around the town centre and is well known for being popular with boy racers. The Ring Road was conceived to relieve traffic congestion along the previous main thoroughfare through the town centre, the narrow East Hill. There is work under way to convert the Ring Road to two-way operation to minimise the \\"race track\\" feel and help bring the isolated town centre back into the rest of the area.Kent County Council There are plans for a fast link between the town centre and the suburbs and main amenities, creating an alternative to the car called \\"SMARTLINK\\".  National and international   Roads  Ashford was one of the towns that became a hub when the roads were turnpiked in the second half of the 18th century. Today it is on the M20 motorway which offers easy access to London, Maidstone and Folkestone, with junctions 9 and 10 serving Ashford. The A20 runs almost parallel with the motorway, and the A28 allows access to Canterbury and Tenterden. Also leaving Ashford are the A251 for Faversham and the A2070 for Romney Marsh and Hastings. Operation Stack on the M20 is the bane of Ashford. Usually implemented in response to industrial action in Calais, it brings Ashford to a halt several times each year. The Operation Stack of 29 November 2006 is estimated to have cost the town £2 million. Local and central government have spent 12 years studying the problem without making any progress towards a solution. Railways Ashford International The South Eastern Railway (SER) opened its main line from London to the town on 1 December 1842, and by 7 February 1844 trains were running through to Dover. The importance to the town of the railway, however, was when the company established its locomotive works here. The railway community had its own shops, schools, pubs and bathhouse, and much of the area retains the look of a \\"railway town\\" (like Swindon or Crewe), however the works closed in 1981. Ashford became a junction with a line to Margate that was opened in 1846 and in 1851 the Marshlink Line to Hastings was opened. On 1 July 1884 SER's rival in Kent London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) opened its second main line via Maidstone to its own terminus in Ashford. On 1 January 1899 SER and LCDR merged to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) and soon after the LCDR Maidstone terminus was closed and a connection established from the SER station to the LCDR line. The LCDR's works at Battersea were closed in 1911 with work shifting to Ashford. When the Channel Tunnel was opened on 6 May 1994, the new Ashford International station began operating. It now serves the high-speed rail link that began service in 2003 carrying the Eurostar from England to the continent, with stops in London, Ashford and then on to Brussels, Lille, Paris and connections to the rest of Europe. Ashford has direct trains services to Brussels, frequent services to Lille and Paris via Ebbsfleet International railway station and St Pancras International railway station. Local firms, residents and politicians are amongst those seeking a less drastic change in the Eurostar timetable. With the introduction of domestic train services along High Speed 1 between St Pancras railway station, Stratford International station in east London and Ashford, it is expected to pull the outer limits of the London commuter belt to the town and beyond, as travel time from Ashford to London is reduced from 83 to about 37 minutes. Currently there are off peak services to London that only take 63 minutes and 60 minutes from London to Ashford.  Air  Ashford was formerly served by Lympne Airport, with scheduled services to Le Touquet and Vichy in France. Commercial services from Lympne ceased in 1974. London Ashford Airport is based at Lydd, approximately 17 miles (27 km) from Ashford, with regular flights to Le Touquet, France by Lydd Air. There is a small airfield located at Headcorn (17 miles (27 km) by road, but only 13 minutes on the main Ashford to London railway) west of Ashford) at which there is an aviation museum and a parachuting centre. London Gatwick Airport, the nearest fully international airport is 58 miles (94 km) from Ashford.

Gustav Adolf was almost killed or captured twice. Fighting in Prussia continued after the battle into July and August and ended with stalemate and finally a truce accepted by Sigismund III.  History  Swedish and Polish-Lithuanian king Sigismund III sought to hold on to the crown of Sweden, but was rejected by the Swedish people, and Sigismund's uncle Karl became king of Sweden instead. Sigismund wanted to regain the Swedish crown and he also wanted to gain the crown of Russia. Russia requested help from Karl of Sweden. The Holy Roman Empire under the Habsburgs attempted to regain European countries for Catholicism and to gain control of northern German Baltic Sea trading cities, namely the Hansa, and to reverse the North having become Lutheran and thereby Sweden gaining supremacy over the Baltic Sea. The Trade routes for some time had been controlled by a powerful Denmark, which controlled and collected at the Sound in its territory. Sigismund III of Poland-Lithuania sought to wrest the Baltic Sea with its lucrative trade routes for himself and he repeatedly requested Swedish king Gustav Adolph to renounce his title of Swedish king as a prerequisite for a truce and peace negotiations. The Swedes saw through these delaying tactics by Sigismund III and so the battles and skirmished went on for years.  Eve of the Meeting at Honigfelde  In early 1629 the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa received military support from the emperor Ferdinand II. The reinforcements, 5000 infantry and reiters, led by Hans Georg von Arnim, arrived in Prussia in late spring 1629, and set up camp near Grudziądz (Graudenz). After wintering in Sweden, Gustav Adolf arrived in Prussia in May. Several skirmishes (Scharmuetzel), broke out, one on June 27, 1629 at Honigfelde (Honigfeldt on older maps) south of Sztum, where Gustav Adolph led his army of total of 4,000 cavalry and 5,000 infantry from Marienburg (Malbork) against the Imperial and Polish forces.  Battle  The Swedish objective to confront one opposing force before the enemy could link up failed, and Gustav was forced to withdraw towards Marienburg (Malbork) to avoid their now superior numbers. However, discovering his withdrawal, Polish hetman, Koniecpolski and von Arnim dispatched a force of 1,300 hussars, 1,200 light cavalry and 2,000 reiters to harry the Swedes. This force caught up with the Swedish army at the village of Honigfelde (Polish Trzciana, modern Trzciano) on the Sztum Heath (Stuhmer Heide). On learning of the proximity of the Polish and Imperial forces, Gustav II Adolf had ordered the troops of Rhinecount (Rheingraf) Otto Ludwig to continue the march. Otto Ludwig did not follow orders and instead maintained a position at Honigfelde with 1,950 cavalry, 60 infantry and 10 3x pounder leather cannons. Meanwhile, Koniecpolski ordered his Polish cossack horse to advance through the woods northwest of Sadowe and his hussars to make a flanking manoeuvre behind the hills south-east of Honigfelde. Von Arnim's slower and heavier horse regiments reached the battlefield last and formed into battle order to attack the Swedes frontally. The Swedish leather cannons began to fire on the approaching cossacks as they came out of the woods and the Rheincount ordered his arquebusiers to attack them. Both the cossacks and arquebusiers were mobile cavalry with good firepower but the Germans arquebusiers gained the upper hand and began pushing the outnumbered cossacks back towards the forest. At this moment the Polish hussars arrived from their flanking manoeuvre, a few companies were sent to deal with the Swedish artillery and the 60 musketeers supporting them but the majority advanced to charge the engaged arquebusiers. The arquebusiers quickly collapsed as the hussars charged their flank and rear and fled in great disorder towards the north towards the rest of their army. Gustav Adolf arrived to aid the Rheincount and they regrouped by charging with Zacharias Pauli's squadron and Reinhold Anrep's Finnish squadron of 700 cavalry, but most of these were demoralised by the flight of the rearguard and joined within it. Gustav Adolf was at great risk as he and the remaining cavalry were pursued by Polish cossacks. He was almost captured by a cossack but escaped when one of his officers, (according to legend) Erik Soop, shot the attacker and enabled Gustavus to rejoin the rest of the cavalry. The situation was critical as the Swedes reached the village of Straszewo, but Field Marshal Wrangel momentarily stabilised the situation by charging the pursuing Poles with his entire force of 2,150 cavalry. This gave Gustav Adolf the time to reassemble 1,000 men of his fleeing squadrons and rejoin battle. Von Arnim's cuirassiers and Koniecpolski's hussars once again charged and the Swedes were thrown back once again, but this time in better order. The Swedes then began a withdrawal to Pułkowice (Pulkowitz) 7 km from Trzciana, where the Swedish guard cuirassiers and Streiff's squadron of 750 men took up a defensive position. During their retreat, the Swedes were subjected to a fierce pursuit. As they neared Pułkowice (Pulkowitz), they were relieved by a counterattack by Streiffs squadron. The battle now reached a deadlock until von Arnim once again caught up with his cuirassiers and turned the battle against the Swedes. The Swedes again withdrew, this time to Neudorf (Nowa Wieś) where the infantry of 1,260 with 8 6x–12x pounder guns had taken up position by the river-crossing and without too much trouble were able to hold off the tired Polish-Imperial cavalry until darkness fell. The following day the Swedes were able to withdraw unmolested to Marienburg (Malbork).  After the Battle  The Swedish cavalry had suffered serious losses during the battle, with about 600 dead and 200 captured by the Poles, including many high-ranking officers (Earlier accounts of the battle incorrectly speak of only 200-300 lost on each side), along with 1,300 of the initially 5,500 horses, being unable to serve the cavalry due to losses and wounds. The Swedish infantry, however, remained mostly intact, and overall the balance of forces in the war remained largely unchanged. A further attack by the Polish side under Koniecpolski on July 15 was repelled as was one on August 9 on the Elbinger Werder (Żuławy Elbląskie) by a demoralized Polish group looking for food. Soon after, foreign diplomats arrived at Warsaw and the Truce of Altmark was signed which ended the hostilities of the Polish–Swedish war.Frost, R.I., 2000, The Northern Wars, 1558-1721, Harlow: Pearson Education Limited, The Battle of Trzciana is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"TRZCIANA 25 VI 1629\\".

The industrial facility was built as the first Heineken brewery in 1867, serving as the company's primary brewing facility until 1988 when a more modern, larger facility was constructed on the outskirts of the city.  History  In 1991, the brewery opened to the public as a brewery tour and visitor centre, known as the \\"Heineken Treat and Information Centre\\" (Although the Heineken \\"Experience\\" began in 1991, there were tours of the original brewery while it was still fully operational.) (). The attraction grew to become one of Amsterdam's most popular tourist attractions and by 2001 the visitor centre changed its name to \\"Heineken Experience\\". After a year of extensive remodeling and expansion, the Heineken Experience reopened to visitors on 3 November, 2008. The latest transformation of the visitor experience comprises four levels of historical artifacts, product exploration and sampling, and interactive exhibits which employ the latest high-tech multi-media technologies. Redesign In renovating this visitor experience, the brewery tour was designed to educate the public on the process of pilsner brewing as well as to bringing the Heineken product and brand to life. As described by branding expert Bob Rogers of BRC Imagination Arts, an experience design firm based in Burbank, California, commissioned to design the visitor center renovations: \\"We wanted to bring back the connection with beer-making, and the history of Heineken, to help people see it, touch it, taste it\\". European Route of Industrial Heritage Site While the original brewing facility which houses the Heineken Experience is an historic landmark for the Heineken company, it serves also as an Anchor Point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage. The European Route of Industrial Heritage presents 845 sites in 29 European countries. Of these, 66 Anchor Points comprise the ERIH main route.

It is believed that most of the church as it is today was completed in 1325, some 171 years after its first recorded vicar, Gerinus, in 1154. It is one of six churches in the town of Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire. Layout Sacristy The sacristy was built in the 1830s and contains charity boards that were originally from the galleries, located at the west end of the church. The sacristy contains clothing for the acolytes and minister, as well as other items used within the service. Sanctuary The roof over the sanctuary is all that remains of the 16th century roof that covered the nave. The reredos (a more recent part of this church) is made from English Oak in 14th Century style to blend in with the historic image of the rest of the church, in memory of Charlotte Sewell, mother of vicar Canon Sewell (1882–1902). The East Window dates back to the completion of the church in 1325, depicting angels and saints in adoration of Christ. Brasses This is the area near the sacristy containing the tombs of Lord Thomas IV and Lady Berkeley. Lord Thomas was the Admiral of the King's Fleet and fought in the battle of Agincourt. . The brasses over their tombs date from 1392 and are thus the second oldest in Gloucestershire. Chancel & Choir The choir stalls were built into the church in 1885, the incredible chandelier that swings above was a gift from clothier William Moore, in 1763 - but is only lit at major events. The Catherine Chapel The Catharine Chapel is located at the top of the north aisle. It is named after St Catherine, not to be confused with Lady Berkeley. The chapel was originally built in medieval times, possibly not long after the actual church. It was enlarged in 1780 to form a vestry and then restored as a chapel in 1928. It is now used for Friday morning prayer. Tower The church tower is located at the west of the church. It was built in six stages, the first two in c.1320, at the time of the church construction. The latter four were built slightly later but completed by the end of the 14th Century. It stands 47 metres tall. Clock Built in 1902, the clock is about halfway up the west side of the tower, with a clock face measuring six feet in diameter. The hands and numbers are made from brass. Bells The bells were originally cast in 1756 in Gloucester by Abel Rudhall. In 1902, during a renovation of the tower (including the clock), they were hung on steel frames, and then rehung again in 1960. They sound in the key of E-flat. The Organ The famous organ that resides in the south-east of the church. The church is perhaps best known for its large organ. Positioned in the south-east corner of the church, adjacent to the altar; it is one of the biggest organs in the county and is famed for having been played by Georg Handel when in its previous location of St Martin in the Fields. The organ was presented to St Martin in the Fields by King George I It possesses a large range of stops over three manuals and a pedalboard, including two trumpets, six diapasons, a cornopean, and a flute A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Botswana is around 90% covered in savanna, varying from shrub savanna in the southwest in the dry areas to tree savanna consisting of trees and grass in the wetter areas. Even under the hot conditions of the Kalahari Desert, many different species survive; in fact the country has more than 2500 species of plants and 650 species of trees. Vegetation and its wild fruits are also extremely important to rural populations living in the desert and are the principal source of food, fuel and medicine for many inhabitants. Three national parks and seven game reserves stretch over 17% of Botswana's land area. The three national parks are the Chobe National Park, the Nxai Pan and Makgadikgadi National Park and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. The seven game reserves are the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, Gaborone Game Reserve, Khutse Game Reserve, Mannyelanong Game Reserve, Maun Game Reserve and Moremi Game Reserve. In addition, a number of small privately owned reserves are maintained. Geography The Kalahari Desert, which extends on its western borders into South Africa, Namibia and Angola, is a flat terrain, which covers about 84% of Botswana, known by the epithet \\"thirstland.\\" It is in fact covered by shrubland vegetation of trees, grasslands, scrub and thorny bushes. Apart from scattered hills and valleys, the dunes system of the southern part contains pans that fill with water during the rains, sustaining the wildlife with its nutrients and grasses. Chobe National Park River front in Chobe National Park Chobe National Park, with its four ecosystems, is known for its largest wildlife concentration in Africa, extends over an area of . Initially established as a reserve area in 1960 became the first gazetted national park in 1967. Chobe River valley forms the northeast part of the park and has thick forests and lush green plains. The marshland of Savuti forms the western zone. The hinterland is hemmed between the marshland of Savuti on the west and the Linyanti Swamps on its northwest. San people or the Basarwa were the original inhabitants of this land who were hunter gatherers. The park's elephant population is the largest in Botswana, and the animals' seasonal migratory route covers between the Chobe and Linyanti rivers. The body size of the elephants here is the largest. However, their ivory is brittle and their tusks are generally short. Some of the other faunal species seen here are sable, wildebeest, kudu, buffalo and waterbuck, apart from lion, hyena, jackal, bat- eared fox, cheetah and wild dogs. Also more than 500 bird species have been recorded in Chobe National Park. Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park A female lechwe (Kobus leche) jumping over a patch of clear water in Okavango Delta Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (KTP), a transboundary park between Botswana and South Africa, was the first conservation area to be set in the southern Kalahari Desert in May 2000. Out of a total area of , Botswana has control over while the balance is with South Africa. Two ecological zones of savannahs and grasslands of Africa in semi-arid environment, with least anthropological pressure, are represented here by ungulates and large carnivores mammals. The rich faunal and floral diversity has involved several research projects. Its approach from Goborone involves road travel over a distance of . Makgadikgadi and Nxai National Park The Makgadikgadi and Nxai National Park, which cover a large area of were established in the 1970s. They have complementarity in wild life migrations, which necessitated merging the two parks into a single entity. It has the pans of Ntwetwe, Makgadikgadi, Nxai, Baines' Baobabs and Kudiakam. Khutse Game Reserve Khutse Game Reserve established in 1971, covering an area of in Bakwena tribal land, has undulating topography of the bush savanna vegetation. It is sparsely populated due to poor water sources and wild life in the mineralised pan system within Khutse has been their major source of sustenance. The wild life of herbivore thrived on grass growing in the pans which in turn has attracted predators. Central Kalahari Game Reserve The Central Kalahari Game Reserve, the second largest reserve in Botswana covering an area of , is a habitat of open plains, salt pans and riverbeds. It has wooded mopane forests in the south and east. The indigenous people residing here since ancient times are known as bushmen or the Basarwa or San. Its fame is also due to its Deception Valley where the study of brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea) has been carried out. Deception was the name given to the salt pans of the valley, which gave deceptive sight (mirage) of a water body from a distance. Tree Island used to be the main camping ground here. Cry of the Kalahari, a famous book made this a popular place. Wild animals such as giraffe, brown hyena, warthog, wild dog, cheetah, leopard, lion, blue wildebeest, eland, gemsbok, kudu, red hartebeest and springbok are seen in the pans and valleys, particularly during the period from December to April. Flora Floral diversity of vegetation in Botswana, which receives only an average annual rainfall of about only, is generally defined under three broad heads namely, hardveld, sandveld and Okavango deltaveld which show seasonal difference in its nutrition value, with woody plants recording higher values compared to the grasses; Panicum has recorded more nutritional content during the rainy season. Hardveld vegetation consists of woody plants and grasses. The woody plants are; Acacia karroo, Albizzia anthelmintica, Balanites aegyptiaca, Mopane (Colophospermum mopane), Combretum apiculatum, Grewia bicolor, Grewia flavecens, Grewia monticola, Lonchocarpus capassa and Terminalia. Sandveld of the Kalahari desert’s vegetation expanse consists of grasses, namely Kragrostis pallens, Striagostis uniplumis, Anthephora pubescens, Schmidtia pappophoreides and Megaloprotachne albescens. Woody plants recorded are the Grewia avellana, Grewia retinervis, Lonchocarpus nelsii and Terminalia sericia. Okavango deltaveld has both grasses and woody plants. The woody plants are the Fecus verruculosa and the Hyphaene crinata. The grasses reported are the Phragmites communis, Dichanthium papillusum, Panicum repens, Andropogon encomus, Echinochloa pyramidelis and Imperata cylindrica. Although about 90% of Botswana is covered by some kind of savanna, even the Kalahari Desert contains adequate vegetation to support tens of thousands of wild animals. Small areas of forest exist, but only in the far north along the Chobe River. Gruff shrubland tends to grow in the dryer desert areas, whilst trees tend to grow in the swamps, particularly in the Okavango delta which have access to more water to thrive. Botswana is home to over 2500 species of plants and over 650 species of trees. Trees Common trees are the mopane, baobab, marula, acacia, camel thorn, motopi (shepherd’s tree), wild date palm, papyrus, sycamore fig tree, real fan palm, African mangosteen and the sausage tree. The trees tend to grow in areas with a plentiful supply of water, such as in the Okavango Delta swamps. The baobab tree, known as mowana in the Setswana language are some of the long living trees in Botswana and may grow older than 2000 years. The bark is characteristically pinkish- grey in color, with a shiny tint. Large white flowers, averaging about 12 cm across and appear between October and December, whilst the greyish-brown fruits which average about 24 cm in length appear in April–May. The marula or morula tree, belonging to the mango family Anacardiaceae, grows to an average of 15 meters (and up to 20 meters) in the Okavango Delta in bushveld and woodland, and has a greyish bark and is deciduous. From January to July, the leaves are grey-green but eventually turn pale yellow and fall off in the latter part of the year during the winter. During the summer months the trees exhibit round to oval fruit, rich in Vitamin C, with a thick peel covering white slippery pulp, which like the leaves turns increasingly yellow at the end of the blooming season. It also bears flowers, pinkish with male and red- purple and white with female.; the male tends to be larger and borne on sparse drooping racemes. Wild date palm is one of only two species of palm tree which occur on the Okavango Delta, the other being the real fan palm. The palm, an evergreen, tends to reach a height of around and grows in abundance in the swamps in Botswana, along with the papyrus. It exhibits feather-shaped leaves, as compared to the fan-shaped leaves of the real fan palm. The leaves typically grow to about in length with some soft basal leaflets and others which are dark green and rough in appearance. Male florets of the tree are pale dirty-yellow and caduceus and male florets are smaller, globose and have a greener bluer coloring. Plocepasser mahali (white-browed sparrow-weaver) nests, within an acacia tree in the Okavango Delta The sycamore fig tree is one of the largest trees growing in Botswana, typically found in the Okavango delta growing up to 20 metres. A semi-deciduous tree, it has a deeply fluted stem with bright orange bark and grows figs up to 3 cm in diameter which eventually turn pale red to red when mature from green and peak between July and December. The deciduous water-thriving African mangosteen in Botswana can grow up to in height, identifiable by its bare, evenly sectioned yellowish- grey stem which stands out against its dense, very dark crown. The bark is grey in color and the tree sports dark green, shiny leathery leaves averaging by , with a yellow veining are diagnostic. The fruit which the tree bears is oval and of a pinky-orange color, about in diameter on average and appears from November to February. The mmilo tree, the species Vangueria infausta of the family Rubiaceae grows is a small deciduous shrub occurring in wooded grassland and bushveld, particular in rocky areas. It exhibits a yellowish- brown drupe, subglobose edible fruit, up to in diameter of which the seed is often obtained to create a dish called nchwachwa during the dry winter season. The species Kigelia africana of sausage tree grows in the Okavango Delta, especially in the Xakanaxa, Third Bridge and Mboma Island areas, and can reach heights of up to , making it amongst the tallest trees in Botswana. It is noted for its fruits which resemble oversized sausages and can weigh up to 4–5 kg and up to long and in diameter. The bark is grey and smooth in younger trees and may exhibit leaves up to long and dark red to maroon cup-shaped flowers measuring 15 by 15 cm, which bloom in August to October. Fauna Botswana is a natural game reserve for most animals found in southern Africa, including lions, leopards, cheetahs, elephants, giraffes, zebras, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, African buffalo, hyenas, and 22 species of antelope. The duiker (a small, horned antelope), wildebeest (gnu), and springbok (gazelle) are familiar. Bird species reported are 593 out of which eight species are under the globally threatened category. Eastern cattle egret (Bubulcus coromandus, Syn. Bubulcus ibis coromandus) is the national bird of Botswana. Mammals Mammals found in Botswana include aardwolf, African bush elephant, African civet, African golden cat, African striped weasel, banded mongoose, bat-eared fox, black-footed cat, blue duiker, bongo (antelope), brown hyena, Burchell's zebra, bushbuck, African buffalo, Cape fox, Cape hyrax, Cape wild dog, caracal, South African cheetah, common duiker, common eland, gemsbok, giant sable antelope, Angolan giraffe, greater kudu, ground pangolin, hartebeest, hippopotamus, impala, Kirk's dik-dik, klipspringer, lechwe, African leopard, lion, mountain zebra, oribi, roan antelope, sable antelope, serval, Sharpe's grysbok, sitatunga, southern reedbuck, south-central black rhinoceros, spotted hyena, springbok antelope, steenbok, topi, common warthog, waterbuck, wildebeest, yellow-backed duiker, yellow mongoose, marsh mongoose and meerkat. Khama Rhino Sanctuary Khama Rhino Sanctuary was established in 1992, covering of Kalahari sandveld with Serwe Pan, primarily to protect the rhinos which at that time was listed subject to poaching causing fears of extinction. A community trust was established to protect the black and white rhino species left in the area. There are also 30 other animal species found in this area as well as over 250 bird species. There are many activities that can be taken place while at Khama Rhino Sanctuary these include, game drives, nature walks and rhino tracking. The Sanctuary is a community trust governed by a Board of Trustees who are elected from the local communities of Serowe, Paje and . The President of Botswana, Seretse Khama Ian Khama, Paramount Chief of the Bamangwato, is patron of the trust. Mokolodi Park Mokolodi Park spreads over a area, is a park maintained by the Mokolodi Wildlife Foundation, a private organization, near Gaborone. Its ecosystem has, as result of restocking efforts, witnessed proliferation of many species of wildlife like white rhino, cheetah, mountain reedbuck, giraffe, zebra, red hartebeest, sable, gemsbok, which coexists along with the indigenous fauna such as kudu, impala, hyena, leopard and water buck. The park is developed as nature reserve with extensive network of jeepable (4x4) paths, which permits viewing the wild life at close quarters. The park administration is planning to expand its limits of conservation area up to the Lion Park opposite to Crocodile Pools. Northern Tuli Game Reserve The Northern Tuli Game Reserve is a private reserve covering an area of made up of savannah plains, riverine forests, open marshland and rugged outcrops of sandstone. It is the largest private reserve in Southern Africa. It has the largest elephant population in the world. In addition, more than 350 species of birds have been reported here. Other fauna of Botswana are also commonly found here. Birds Cape vulture or gyps in a Zoo The twelve important ornithological sites selected in Botswana of which seven are wetlands and which are recognized and supported by the BirdLife International known for their bird life cover more than 25% of the land surface of the country. These parks are: The Chobe National Park; the Linyanti Swamp along the Chobe River; the Okavango Delta, the Lake Ngami; the Makgadikgadi Pans; the Central Kalahari; the Manyelanong Hill; the Tswapong Hills; the Boka Dam; the Phakalane Sewage Lagoons; the Southeast Botswana; and the Gemsbok National Park. An initiative started by the IBA is of setting up 'Site Support Groups' (SSGs), an organised group of local people with the objective to \\"sustain biodiversity to sustain livelihoods in rural Botswana\\"; there are 150 SSGs in important bird areas reported to be functioning throughout Africa. Red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus), amur falcon (Falco amurensis) and barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) and Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres) are some of the birds reported by IBA from the grasslands, wetlands, hills, in areas of Kalahari Highveld, deltas and around lakes created by dams. The Botswana Bird Club (BBC) established in 1980, now renamed as BirdLife Botswana promotes ornithological knowledge and interest and also publishes a biannual journal called \\"The Babbler\\" and a quarterly newsletter known as \\"The Familiar Chat\\" dealing with all issues of bird conservation, research and training in Botswana. Manyelanong Game Reserve’s small cliffs protect a breeding colony of Cape vultures, the largest such colony in Botswana and hence called the \\"Otse Vulture Colony\\" as its vultures are an endangered species protected by law. Protection has enabled the species to proliferate; its numbers in recent years are 70 breeding pairs seen in the colony. Tockus leucomelas, the southern yellow-billed hornbill in Moremi Game Reserve ;Nata Bird Sanctuary Nata Bird Sanctuary, established in the early 1990s, is situated to the far northeastern edge of Sowa Pan. It encompasses an area of and maintained as a community project to preserve its 165 bird species. Some of the species reported are the kingfishers, bee-eaters, eagles, bustards and ostriches. Water birds of Africa flock to this place during winter; the bird species reported are teals, ducks, geese, pelicans, spoonbills, greater flamingo and lesser flamingo. The flamingos and pelicans also breed here. ;Gaborone Game Reserve Gaborone Game Reserve, near the city of Gaborone, has a small area of but provides for popular viewing along roads. It has plenty of birds and wild life in its precincts The reserve is habitat of thorn scrub and woodland to riverine forest and marshland which attracts a wide variety of birds such as raptors a snake eagle, crimson boubou (a genus of brightly coloured, carnivorous passerine bird) and gallinule. Faunal species seen here are the rhino, impala, kudu, ostriches, wildebeest, zebra, gemsbok, bushbuck, springbok, duiker the giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus also known as the Lord Derby eland), which is Africa's largest antelope. ;Moremi Game Reserve Moremi Game Reserve, established in 1965 and expanded over the years and now covering an area of , it is the habitat of mopane woodland and acacia forests, floodplains and lagoons. It is said to be one of the most beautiful reserves in Africa maintained by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks. Birdlife in the park is wide and of varied species; water birds to shy forest dwellers are commonly seen. Other wild life fauna such as elephants, hippos (found in large number in the Hippo Pool), a few rhino and the red lechwe. Moremi is also particularly well known for its African wild dog sightings.

Born in Patrickswell, County Limerick, Bennis first played competitive hurling during his schooling at CBS Sexton Street. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Limerick minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1965-66 league. Bennis subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won one All- Ireland medal, two Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on several occasions Bennis won one Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute. At club level he is a ten-time championship medallist with Patrickswell. Bennis's career tally of 9 goals and 106 points ranks him as one of Limerick's top championship scorers of all time. His brothers, Phil and Peter Bennis, and his nephew, Gary Kirby, also played for Limerick. Kirby is now the manager of the Patrickswell Senior Hurling Team. Throughout his career Bennis made 19 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1975 championship. In retirement from playing Bennis became involved in team management and coaching. At club level he has been involved in the management of Camogue Rovers and Patrickswell before taking charge of the Limerick senior team. Playing career School During his secondary schooling in Limerick Bennis was chosen as captain of the Limerick City vocational schools' team. In 1961 he won an All- Ireland medal following a 10-6 to 7-9 defeat of Kilkenny. Club In 1965 Patrickswell, with six Bennis brothers on the team, qualified for the final of county championship for the first time ever. A 2-16 to 0-4 trouncing of St. Kieran's gave Bennis his first championship medal. Patrickswell retained the title in 1966, with Bennis securing a second championship medal following a 5-11 to 3-7 defeat of St. Patrick's. After failing in their bid for a third successive championship, Patrickswell reached the decider once again in 1969 where the team faced Pallasgreen. A 0-17 to 2-2 victory gave Bennis a third championship medal. Patrickswell retained the title in 1970 with Bennis collecting a fourth championship medal following a 2-14 to 0-2 trouncing of Kilmallock. After a period of decline, which involved the losing of three championship decider, Patrickswell returned to the final once again in 1977. Goals were key as a 3-7 to 0-7 defeat of Killeedy gave Bennis a fifth championship medal. After failing to retain the title Patrickswell bounced back in 1979. Once again goals were vital in a 2-16 to 0-16 victory over Tournafulla, which gave Bennis a sixth championship medal. In 1982 Patrickswell faced Bruree for the very first time in a county final. The overall craft and experience of Patrickswell, plus some shrewd tactical switches by their mentors, brought a late flurry of scores which finally sounded the death knell for Bruree, as Bennis collected a seventh championship medal following a 0-17 to 0-15 victory. Patrickswell retained the title in 1983 with Bennis winning an eighth championship medal as Ballybrown were downed by 1-13 to 1-7. In 1984 Patrickswell secured their own piece of history by capturing a third successive championship title. The 4-13 to 3-5 victory over Cappamore gave Bennis a ninth championship medal. Four-in-a-row proved beyond Patrickswell, however, Bennis, who was now in his forties, was still a member of the team when the club contest their next final in 1987. A narrow 1-17 to 3-10 defeat of local rivals Ballybrown gave Bennis a tenth and final championship medal. Inter-county Bennis first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Limerick minor hurling team in 1963. He was an unused substitute that year when Limerick defeated Tipperary by 4–12 to 5–4 to take the Munster crown. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Limerick face a 6-12 to 5-9 defeat by Wexford. His tenure with the Limerick under-21 hurling team yielded little in terms of success. Bennis made his senior debut during the 1965-66 league at a time when Limerick hurling was in the doldrums. Limerick contested five successive league deciders between 1970 and 1974, with success coming in 1971. A narrow 3-12 to 3-11 defeat of old rivals Tipperary, when Bennis scoring a last-second free to win the game, gave him a National Hurling League medal. In 1973 Limerick faced Tipperary in the provincial decider and a close game developed. The game ended in welter of excitement as, with time almost up and the sides level, a controversial ’70 was awarded to Limerick. Bennis, as free-taker, was told by the match referee that it was the last puck of the game and that he must score directly. Some debate followed as to the validity of the score, with Tipperary players and supporters claiming the sliotar had drifted wide, however, the score was give and Bennis collected his first Munster medal following a 6-7 to 2-18 victory. On 2 September 1973 Limerick faced Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland decider, however, the reigning champions had a depleted team due to a combination of injuries and emigration. In spite of this, the game hung in the balance for the first-half, however, eight minutes after the restart Mossie Dowling got a vital goal for Limerick. Shortly after this Bennis spearheaded a rampant Limerick attack which resulted in a 1–21 to 1–14 victory for Limerick. The victory gave Bennis an All-Ireland medal while he was later presented with his an All-Star. Limerick maintained their provincial dominance in 1974, with Bennis winning a second Munster medal following a 6-14 to 3-9 trouncing of Clare. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 1 September 1974 was a repeat of the previous year as Kilkenny provided the opposition once again. Limerick stormed to a five-point lead in the first eleven minutes, however, a converted penalty by Eddie Keher, supplemented by further goals from Mick Brennan and Pat Delaney gave Kilkenny a 3–19 to 1–13 victory. In 1975 Limerick failed in their bid to win a third successive Munster title following a 3-14 to 0-12 defeat by Cork. This defeat brought the curtain down on Bennis's inter-county career. Inter-provincial Bennis was also chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team. He was first picked for duty in 1970, however, he remained as a non- playing substitute during Munster's 2-15 to 0-9 defeat of Leinster. Managerial career Early experience Shortly after retiring from club hurling Bennis remained active as a coach at all levels with Patrickswell. He later took charge of junior club Camogue Rovers but enjoyed little success. Managing Limerick In June 2006 Bennis was included as part of a four-man interim management team that was appointed in Limerick following Joe McKenna's resignation after a seventeen-point defeat to Clare. He took charge as manager of the team midway through a disastrous championship campaign. Limerick went on to win their subsequent qualifier games before narrowly losing to Cork by 0-19 to 0-19 in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At the end of the season Bennis was appointed Limerick manager on a full-time basis. In his first full season in charge, Bennis's Limerick enjoyed a remarkable championship campaign and qualified for the All-Ireland decider against Kilkenny on 2 September 2007. The Cats got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin scoring two goals within the first ten minutes to set the tone. Limerick launched a second-half comeback, however, Kilkenny were too powerful and cruised to a 2–19 to 1–15 victory. Limerick's 2008 championship campaign ended without a single victory, as defeats by Clare and Offaly resulted in Bennis's side being dumped out of the championship. In a subsequent interview with the Limerick Leader, Bennis criticized the social habits of a group of players whom he says \\"broke their hearts in training and then went drinking\\". He revealed how commitment to training was good but \\"some players let me down\\". Less than a month after this Bennis failed to have his contract renewed as Limerick manager.

He is the son of Dušan Uhrin senior who is also a football manager. Playing career Dušan Uhrin Jr. played in his youth at Meteor Prague and Bohemians Prague. He started his senior career at Meteor in 1984, before moving to Montáže Prag and subsequently FC Jílové. While at the latter, Uhrin suffered a severe injury and decided to concentrate on a coaching career. Between 1990 and 1991 he stepped up into the role of player/manager at RH Strašnice, but afterwards only kept on playing on occasion for FC Jílové until 1998, when he retired altogether from his playing career. Managing career Although Uhrin first managed RH Strašnice in 1990, his first real major team in 2000, when he co- coached Sparta Prague. He got a longer managing stint at Bohemians Prague between 2002 and 2004, but Uhrin came into the limelight while at FK Mladá Boleslav, whom he took over in 2004. After saving the team from relegation in his first season, he managed the amazing feat of becoming vice-champions of the Czech first league in the 2005–06 season. Mladá Boleslav impressed in Europe the following season, not least because of defeating Olympique de Marseille in the first round of the UEFA Cup, and one of the people who took notice of Uhrin's achievements was Timișoara boss Marian Iancu. Despite finishing third with Mladá Boleslav that year, Dušan Uhrin Jr. accepted to take over Politehnica Timișoara, stating that it was important for him to find a new challenge.  Politehnica Timișoara and return  In the first year at Timișoara, Uhrin achieved qualification to the UEFA Cup, thereby marking the first European presence of a Timișoara team since 1992. Although his achievements in the first half of the 2008/2009 season were even more impressive, with the club being placed third despite a six-point penalty imposed by FIFA, the FC Timișoara owner, Marian Iancu, decided to sack Dušan Uhrin Jr. in early December, for undisclosed reasons. (Marian Iancu is known though to often do such uninspired moves, also sacking before the end of the season – the best in the team's history – the follower of Dušan Uhrin Jr. as team coach and having done something similarly a few years before with Romanian coach Cosmin Olăroiu). On 13 December 2010, Dušan was announced the new Politehnica Timişoara's Head Coach signed for one year with option to renewal for two years. After his come back he spoke for official site : \\"\\"I hope the stadium will be full again! But, above all, I promise to our fans that we play good attacking football.

I'm glad that we have again the colors that he had a team since I started coaching in 2007. These are Poli's true colors!\\". Uhrin made an impressive re-debut by winning all of the first four matches. But after that series of victories Poli unluckily gained only one victory in the following six games. Although Poli finished second at the end of the 2010–11 Liga I season and was supposed to play in the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League, it was relegated to the Liga II because of accumulated debt and Dušan Uhrin left Poli on 27 July 2011.

Location of Burkina Faso Burkina Faso is largely wild bush country with a mixture of grass and small trees in varying proportions. The savanna region is mainly grassland in the rainy season and semi desert during the harmattan period (defined as the period when stormy and dusty Sahara winds blow dry and hot). Fauna, one of the most diverse in West Africa, includes the elephant, hippopotamus, buffalo, monkey, lions, crocodile, giraffe, various types of antelope, and a vast variety of bird and insect life. The country has 147 mammal species, 330 aquatic species including 121 species of fish and 2067 different plant species.Adjima Thiombiano, Marco Schmidt, Stefan Dressler, Amadé Ouédraogo, Karen Hahn, Georg Zizka. 2012. Catalogue des plantes vasculaires du Burkina Faso. Boissiera 65, Conservatoire et Jardin Botaniques de la ville de Genève. 391 S. Of the plant species, the dominant endemic species are shea tree (Butyrospermum parkii) and the baobab, the former plant species has immense economic value to the country. To ensure conservation and preservation of the wildlife of Burkina Faso, four national parks have been established. These are the Po National Park in the south-centre of the country, Arli National Park established in 1954 in the southeast, W of the Niger National Park, a trans frontier park existing since 1957 in the east bordering Benin and Niger and the Deux Balés National Park. The forests, fauna and fish have been declared part of the national estate of Burkina Faso. In addition, the List of national parks of Burkina Faso consist of one UNESCO Biosphere reserve, three Complete Reserves, six Partial Reserves and ten protected forests. However, according to conservation classification conducted between 1936 and 1957, the country has 78 protected areas that cover , which accounts to about 14% of the area of the country. Geography Wildlife area in the landlocked Burkina Faso in western Africa is spread over a plateau area of . The dominant habitat types are the grassy savanna in the north with transition to the varying thin forests in the south. Based on ecological characteristics and climatic conditions, the country is divided under three bio-climatic zones namely, the Sahelian Zone, the Sudanian Zone and the Sudano-Guinean Zone. The Sahelian Zone covers 25% of the area of the northern part of the country, which is further subdivided under the Sahelian and sub- Sahelian sectors. In the Sahelian sector, where the rainfall is only of the order of , the vegetation is mostly of shrubs and wooded grassland or steppe. The sub-Sahelian sector represents the transition zone, receives an average annual rainfall of and represents the transition between the Sahelian and Sudanian bioclimatic zones. The vegetation in this sector has moist Sudan savanna vegetation in the river valleys, while the western half is largely inhabited by humans; most of the large trees in the northern half of the sector are reported to have vanished due to climate change. The Sudan Zone receives higher rainfall in the range of and is further subdivided into three sectors namely, the central plateau sector, the Mouhoun sector and the Pendjari–Mékrou sector and has widely varying vegetation depending on human occupation for agriculture and mostly savanna vegetation, predominantly wooded savanna. the Pendjari–Mékrou sector with its floodplains and many ephemeral rivers, is less populated by humans but has the largest population of mammals in the country; vultures and raptors are also reported. The Sudano-Guinean Zone in the southwest corner of the country is a humid zone with an annual rainfall in the range of . It is heavily wooded with wooded savannas and gallery forests; it has the ambience of a park with its widespread vegetation of Khaya senegalensis, Daniellia oliveri and Isoberlin forests, tall grasses and savanna vegetation is also a dominant feature. Its human population distribution is low but the wildlife population is the second largest in the country. The area is drained by many rivers, the most important of them being the Black Volta (Mouhoun), the Red Volta (Nazinon), and the White Volta (Nakambé), which flow into Ghana on the south and form the Volta River. Climate Rainy season (June to September) is one of the four seasons in Burkina Faso; the other three being, an intermediate season from September to mid November, the summer of harmattan season of the Sahara hot and stormy winds (mid February to mid June) and the dry and winter cool season from mid November to mid February. During the rainy season is when the shrubs and stunted trees flourish in the savanna in the northern region where rainfall incidence is about 10 inches and the rivers flow full with dense vegetation growing in the southern region of the country when the rainfall incidence is as high as . National Parks There are four important National Parks in Burkina Faso namely, the Arli National Park existing since 1954, the Deux Balés National Park, Kaboré Tambi National Park and the W of the Niger National Park which is a trans-boundary park existing since 1957. Arli National Park Arli National Park The Arli National Park, covering an area of , lies to the southwest of Arli–W–Singou complex. It borders with Benin (the Pendjari River forms the boundary) and Singou Game Ranch on its northwest direction and has large network of drainage system which has vast flood plains. Within the park boundary, the Falaise de Gobnangou is a prominent hill feature with cliffs that extends over from the southwest to the northeast. The park also has many inselbergs. Shrub and tree-savanna (extensive growth of Isoberlinia doka) in the non-flooded areas, Mitragyna inermis with gallery forests in seasonally flooded areas, baobab Adansonia digitata trees near old village sites are some of the vegetation types found in the park. Deux Balés National Park The Deux Balés National Park, is located in central eastern Burkina Faso, within Mouhoun Province. It is situated to the west of the Black Volta River. It has an elevation range of . The park was first established in 1937 as the forêts classées des Deux Balés ('the Deux Balés Classified Forests') with an area of . In 2001, the largest number of elephants in West Africa were found in Deux Balés (together with Baporo Forest), estimated at four hundred of them. Kaboré Tambi National Park View of the Red Volta in Kaboré Tambi National Park The Kaboré Tambi National Park is situated between Ouagadougou and the border with Ghana. It follows the course of the Nazinon River. It was founded in 1976 as Pô National Park or known as Parc National Kaboré Tambi (PNKT). The park has an area of in the alluvial floodplain on both banks of the ephemeral Volta Rouge River; the river results to small water holes during the summer season. A number of small marshes and lakes also dominate the scene. It maintains contiguity with the Nazinga Game Ranch of area, the Sissili Hunting Concession of ha and the village hunting zones around Nazinga and Sissili villages. The park has varied topography with geological formations of granite outcrops, lateritic plateaus and several isolated high mountains. The vegetation types found here are northern Sudan savanna, shrub savanna, tree-savanna and gallery forests. The park is home to lion, elephant, buffalo and a number of antelope species. Poaching and deforestation activities are an issue in the park. The main road from Ouagadougou to Bolgatanga in northern Ghana runs across the park. W of the Niger National Park The Mékrou River in W National Park The W of the Niger National Park was created in August 1954. It is a major national park of the three countries of Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso, and is governed by the three governments. It is around a meander in the River Niger shaped like a \\"W\\". Until 2008, the implementation of a regional management was supported by the EU-funded Project ECOPAS (French: Ecosystèmes Protégés en Afrique Soudano- Sahélienne). The three national parks operate under the name W Transborder Park. In the three nations, the park covers about , largely uninhabited by humans, having been until the 1970s a Malarial zone of wetlands formed by the delta of the Mékrou River with the Niger, broken by rocky hills. It was declared a Ramsar site in 1990. A cattle route from Mail and Niger to Tago passes through the park creating conservation problems which are proposed to be tackled through many conservation and biodiversity support programmes. Fauna As of 2006, Burkina Faso is considered to be one of the West African countries with the largest faunal population. Mammals Mammals found in Burkina Faso include aardvark, African bush elephant, African civet, African clawless otter, African golden cat, African ground squirrel, West African wild dog, western dwarf buffalo, bushbuck, Cape hare, Cape hyrax, caracal, Northwest African cheetah, common chimpanzee, common genet, Dorcas gazelle, fennec fox, four-toed hedgehog, giant pangolin, West African giraffe, Egyptian wolf, Haussa genet, hippopotamus, African leopard, West African lion, olive baboon, oribi, pale fox, patas monkey, ratel, red-fronted gazelle, reedbuck, roan antelope, rusty-spotted genet, Senegal bushbaby, serval, side-striped jackal, slender mongoose, speckle-throated otter, spotted hyena, striped hyena, striped polecat, sun squirrel, tree pangolin, warthog, water chevrotain, western hartebeest, white-tailed mongoose and African wildcat. While chimpanzee are considered extirpated from Burkina Faso, they may be migrating back into the country during the rainy season. Hyena are widespread but at low densities. Reptiles Sacred crocodiles of Bazoulé, Burkina Faso. Three crocodile species are found in the wild, slender-snouted crocodile, Nile crocodile, and dwarf crocodile. According to Bird Life International, there are 119 migrant birds which visit the country out of which 81 belong to Palaearctic species including two species namely Falco naumanni (vulnerable) and Gallinago media (near threatened) of global conservation concern. There are also 10 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) identified which cover 20260 km2 accounting for 7.4% area of the country. Birds Urocolius macrourus, blue-naped mousebird In Burkina Faso, as of 2005, 497 bird species of various families, including 35 rare or accidental species, 12 near threatened species, three vulnerable species (lesser kestrel Falco naumanni, white-headed vulture Trigonoceps occipitalis and Beaudouin's snake- eagle Circaetus beaudouini) and one endangered species (Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus) have been reported. These cover species under several families such as: thirteen of Anatidae, one of Numididae (helmeted guineafowl Numida meleagris), six of Phasianidae, one of Podicipedidae, two of Ciconiidae, one of Anhingidae (African darter Anhinga rufa), one of Pelecanidae (great white pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus), one of Scopidae (hamerkop Scopus umbretta), seventeen of Ardeidae, five of Threskiornithidae, one of family Pandionidae (osprey Pandion haliaetus), thirty-nine of Accipitridae (mostly eagles, vultures and hawks), one of Sagittariidae (secretary-bird Sagittarius serpentarius), eleven of Falconidae, nine of Rallidae, one of Rallidae (African finfoot Podica senegalensis), six of Otididae, one of Gruidae (black crowned-crane Balearica pavonina), three of Burhinidae, eleven of Charadriidae, two of Recurvirostridae, two of Jacanidae, eighteen of Scolopacidae, two of Turnicidae, five of Glareolidae, one of Rostratulidae (Greater painted-snipe Rostratula benghalensis), eight of Laridae, two of Pteroclidae, thirteen of Columbidae, two of Psittacidae, two of Musophagidae, twelve of Cuculidae (cuckoos), one of Tytonidae (barn owl Tyto alba), eight of Strigidae, eight of Apodidae, one of Coliidae (blue-naped mousebird Urocolius macrourus), one of Trogonidae (Narina trogon Apaloderma narina), nine of Alcedinidae, eight of Meropidae, five of Coraciidae, one of Upupidae (Eurasian hoopoe Upupa epops, two of Phoeniculidae, four of Bucerotidae, four of Lybiidae, two of Indicatoridae, two of Indicatoridae, nine of Picidae, three of Platysteiridae, two of Prionopidae, nine of Malaconotidae, two of Campephagidae, nine of Laniidae, two of Oriolidae, three of Dicruridae, two of Monarchidae, three of Corvidae, one of Nicatoridae (western nicator Nicator chloris, nine of Alaudidae, seventeen of Hirundinidae, one of Stenostiridae (African blue-flycatcher Elminia longicauda), one of Paridae (white-shouldered black-tit Parus guineensis), two of Remizidae, one of Certhiidae (spotted creeper Salpornis salvadori), two of Pycnonotidae, four of Phylloscopidae, six of Acrocephalidae, twenty of Cisticolidae, one of Hyliotidae (yellow-bellied hyliota Hyliota flavigaster), twenty-seven species of Muscicapidae, three of Turdidae, three of Timaliidae, one of Zosteropidae (African yellow white-eye Zosterops senegalensis), nine of Sturnidae, one of Buphagidae (yellow-billed oxpecker Buphagus africanus), eight of Motacillidae, four of Emberizidae, three of Fringillidae, three of Passeridae, nineteen of Ploceidae, nineteen of Estrildidae and six of Viduidae. Ten Important Bird Areas (IBAs) which cover about (7.4% of the area of the country). These have Sudan–Guinea Savanna biome (A04) (with 30 of the 32 species of this biome), Sahel biome (A03) (with six of eight biome species) and with breeding colony of Gyps rueppellii in the Arli–W–Singou Park complex (accounting for more than 1% of the global population of the species). The number of resident bird species is reported by Birdlife International as 318, out of which 119 are migratory birds. Of the migratory birds, 81 belong to Palaearctic family and two species are of global conservation concern, namely Falco naumanni (Vulnerable) and Gallinago media (Near Threatened). Insects ;Lepidoptera Flora Niangoloko Forest The flora of Burkina Faso is composed of 2067 plant species. The most important families in terms of species richness and abundance are the grasses (Poaceae) and legumes (Fabaceae).Marco Schmidt: Pflanzenvielfalt in Burkina Faso. Analyse, Modellierung und Dokumentation. 2006 Many species are distributed widely in the savannas regions of Africa. There are however two endemic plants, Pandanus brevifrugalis and Isoetes jaegeri. Approximately 15% of the country has forest cover while wooded land constitutes approximately 34% of the area. Very little closed forest can be found and this is mainly of the gallery forest type along waterways. The open forests include savanna of four types, namely Sahelian, Sahelian-Sudanian, Sudanian, and Sudanian-Guinean. Though much of the country is dry and sparse, vegetation can vary considerably. Northern Burkina Faso consists mainly of savanna, acacia woodland, and during the wet season, prickly shrubs and stunted trees flourish. Herbaceous plants include broadleaf deciduous, shrub, desert shrub, semi-desert savanna and thorny scrub. Crops include Banana, Cassava, Bougainvillea, Cotton, Guava, Maize, Spinach, Malabar Spinach, Millet, Onions, Papaya, Sorghum, Tomatoes, and Yams. Most of the country consists of sparse savanna grasslands, with the occasional shrub or acacia. Although the country only has about 15% forest cover overall, there are many forests in the south, growing denser along the banks of the perennial rivers. These include Diéfoula Forest, Logoniégué Forest, Laba Forest, Dida Forest, Koulbi National Forest, Bontioli Reserve Forest, Nabere Partial Reserve Forest, Koflandé Forest, Maro Forest, Tui Forest, Deux Balés Forest, Kalio Forest, Tisse Forest, Dibon Forest, Pâ Forest, Mou Forest, Boulon Forest, Tigo Forest, Nakambe Forest and Niangoloko Forest, of which about 16% have official protection. Poverty means that deforestation is a problem in the country and each year the country loses approximately 32,000 hectares of forests, to make way for agriculture and for fuelwood, which around 90% of the national population are dependent upon. Numerous NGOs are active in the country, educating farmers and encouraging them to minimize land clearing and plant trees as well as cultivate the land. Trees of note include the shea tree (known as \\"Karité\\" in the local Dioula language and the baobab. Although the shea tree is indigenous to the semi-arid Sahel region of West Africa, Burkina Faso contains the largest number of them. The shea tree is extremely important to the Burkinabe people and is termed as \\"women's gold\\" by the villagers, because the nuts of shea tree can be collected and then processed by crushing and grinding to yield shea butter, important in cuisine and in exports, for use in the manufacture of chocolate and cosmetics such as soap. Shea nuts are the country's third most important export, after cotton and livestock; in 1997, an average tonne of unprocessed shea nuts sold domestically for CFA70,000 (US$980) and overseas for CFA1,00,000 (US$1400). The most important centres of shea butter production are in Sissili Province and Ziro Province. The bark of the tree is also used as an ingredient in traditional medicines and the shell of nut is said to be able to repel mosquitoes and is also said to protect existing trees. The Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea) is also grown in abundance; Burkina Faso produced some 20,000 tonnes in 1989, after peanuts (160,000 tonnes) and cowpeas (74,000 tonnes). Between 1982 and 1985, an attempt was made to improve the Bambara groundnut, an initiative which involved the participation of plant breeders in the Grain Legumes Programme. The country contains populations of Vitellaria paradoxa trees, which often have problems with parasites of the family Loranthaceae. Four species of Tapinanthus (Tapinanthus dodoneifolius, Tapinanthus globiferus, Tapinanthus ophiodes and Tapinanthus pentagonia) are widespread all across Burkina Faso and Mali and are also subject to being affected by pests. Other trees include Acacia, flamboyant tree, Delonix regia, and neem tree. Conservation Fauna conservation areas were first established in 1926, which included five 'parcs de refuge' that covered 536,700 ha. Global Environment Facility (GEF) in its report to the World Bank to promote conservation of natural habitat in Burkina Faso reported that the biodiversity species profile of Burkina Faso contains \\"655 wildlife species (mammals and birds); 330 aquatic species (includes 121 fish species), and 1054 plant species (751 grass, 304 tree and brush species)\\", based on meagre data. It was also noted that the natural habitats were found now only in parks, reserves and gazetted forests as agricultural operations dominated the scene in 70% area of the country. The oryx, cheetah, and giraffe are reported to be totally extinct, probably includes Burkina redneck ostrich. The nearing extinction species were reported to be black and white colobus, dama gazelle, leopard and topi. This alarming situation of loss of biodiversity resulted in creation of national operational strategies not only for rural development in 2001 but also for reforms in the wildlife and protected area sector in 1995 (a Forestry Code was introduced defining the National Forestry Policy and establishing 12 Wildlife Conservation Units covering the entire country in followed in 1996) and Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan in 2000 with the objective stated as to \\"ensure responsible management of biological diversity by the populations by 2025\\". In conservation and sustainable resources management efforts, the IBA Local Conservation Group with help from BirdLife Partners around the world have set up \\"Site Support Groups\\" in Burkina Faso, which was initially begun in 1959 to count birds. This resulted in the training of local volunteers as ornithologists. In 2009, Vogelwacht Utrecht, a Dutch regional volunteer birding group, supported efforts conserve migratory birds. Cambridgeshire Bird Club in the UK has also pitched in with support. However, all these efforts are concentrated at Lake Oursi (included in the List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance) and are yet to permeate to a national scale.

Written by Kawatake Mokuami, it first premiered at the Ichimura-za in Edo in March 1862. The play is frequently known by a number of other names. The name ' actually refers to the main character of the play, a gizoku (honorable thief), one of a band of five such men. Another common name for this play is ', \\"shiranami\\" (white waves) being a term used to refer to thieves. Like most traditional Japanese dramas, the play originally had five acts, following particular conventions as to the dramatic pattern and themes of each act. However, today, it is very common to perform only one or two acts, each combination of acts represented by a different play title. For example, the title Benten Musume Meo no Shiranami refers to the performance of Acts III and/or IV without the other three. The play centers on a band of five thieves, based on real thieves and criminals of Edo period Osaka: Karigane Bunshichi, An no Heibei, Gokuin Sen'emon, Kaminari Shōkurō and Hotei Ichiemon. The name of Nippon Daemon, the leader of the band, is taken from that of Nippon Saemon, who was captured and executed in 1747. The character of Benten Kozō, meanwhile, is said to have been based upon a servant at the Iwamoto-in temple on Enoshima, an island dedicated to the goddess Benten.Plaque at the site of the former Iwamoto-in, Enoshima, Fujisawa City, Kanagawa Prefecture. The play is perhaps most famous for the speeches made by Kozō and his compatriots when they dramatically remove their disguises and reveal their true identities. Characters *Benten Kozō Kikunosuke – a young thief *Nippon Daemon – leader of the band of thieves *Nangō Rikimaru – a young thief *Tadanobu Rihei – a young thief *Akaboshi Jūzaburō – a young thief *Princess Senju – a daughter of a powerful samurai or courtier *Hamamatsuya Kōbei – owner of a kimono/cloth shop *Hamamtasuya Sōnosuke – Kōbei's son-in- law Plot Act I The play opens upon a strikingly colorful scene of Hase-dera at the height of cherry blossom season. Princess Senju is praying at the temple for her late father and for Kotarō, her fiancé by an arranged marriage, who has gone missing. Kotarō (actually Benten Kozō in disguise) then appears with an attendant (his fellow thief, Nangō Rikimaru in disguise), and the couple go into a nearby teahouse on the grounds; Senju has never before met Kotarō, and so has no reason to know what he should look like. Meanwhile, Akaboshi Jūzaburō, another thief, is discovered attempting to swindle money intended for the memorial service from members of Senju's party. A scuffle erupts and the group rushes into the teahouse where Benten Kozō is attempting to obtain from Senju a valuable gold incense burner which was a gift to her from Kotarō's family. Tadanobu Rihei, yet another thief who is disguised as an anonymous rōnin, drives them away and diffuses the situation. Believing that it is somehow her possession of the incense burner which has brought such violence and trouble to her and her party, Senju gives it to \\"Kotarō\\" for safekeeping. The pair then leave the temple for Mt. Mikoshi-ga-take as Rihei and Rikimaru fight for the 100 ryō stolen from the memorial service. Act II Senju and \\"Kotarō\\" hike up the mountain for some time, Kozō treating her quite nicely and playing the role of her fiancé. However, when she insists upon heading more directly and quickly for his home, he loses the disguise and announces his identity to her, explaining that he was named Benten Kozō after his home, the island of Benten-jima. His possession of Kotarō's flute, Chidori, being what originally convinced her that he was her betrothed, he concocts an explanation of how he came to obtain it. He explains that Kotarō came to him as a poor and ill traveler who asked him to safeguard the flute and to exchange it for the incense burner, just before he died. In truth, Benten Kozō took care of Kotarō before killing him for his money and taking the flute. Betrayed and overwrought, Senju throws herself into a ravine, as a voice is heard from off-stage, announcing a desire for the golden object. Nippon Daemon, a great thief respected by all others, appears and demands that Kozō join him, and gather a band of other thieves for him. In exchange, he explains, he will allow Benten to keep the incense burner. In the following scene, Senju is seen to have survived, and comes across Akaboshi Jūzaburō, who is preparing to commit seppuku (suicide) for his failure to rob her earlier. The two console one another, though in the end Senju throws herself once again into the ravine, killing herself. Jūzaburō returns to his preparations, but is stopped by Tadanobu Rihei, who gives him the 100 ryō stolen from Senju's followers, and convinces him to join him; thus all five thieves are united. Act III The climatic act of the play takes place inside the Hamamatsu- ya, a cloth and clothing shop run by Hamamatsuya Kōbei and his son-in-law Sōnosuke. Benten Kozō enters the shop, disguised as a high-ranking young lady seeking to buy wedding clothes, along with Rikimaru who acts as the lady's retainer. One of the most celebrated elements of this play lies in the acting skills required to act the role of the low-class manly thief who is in turn acting as a classy, refined young woman. As most kabuki actors specialize only in male or female roles for their entire careers, a skillful performance of this scene serves as a dramatic demonstration of an actor's abilities. The \\"lady\\" is shown a number of silks and brocades possibly suitable for her wedding dress, into which she inserts a small piece of cloth and then removes it, sticking it into her kimono. Noticed by Kōbei, she is accused of stealing, and a scuffle erupts. Rikimaru (as the lady's retainer) manages finally to mediate, with the help of the shop's neighbor and a few others. He shows a receipt from another shop for the scrap of fabric, proving it was not stolen from the Hamamatsu-ya. In the course of the fighting however, the \\"lady\\" suffered a blow to her head, for which Rikimaru then demands 100 ryō as recompense. As the pair prepare to leave with their illicit gains, however, a man by the name of Tamashima Ittō (Nippon Daemon in disguise) emerges from the backroom and points Kozō out, noting that the cherry blossom tattoo peeking out under his sleeves reveals him as a man. Discovered, Kozō removes his outermost kimono, reveals his tattooed arm, and begins to explain his true identity, in one of the most popular monologues in the kabuki repertoire. Rikimaru also removes his samurai disguise, and Tamashima, acting outraged, offers to cut off the thieves' heads. Kōbei instead takes pity on them, and lets them go, even offering some plaster or salve for Kozō's injury. The pair leave, and walk along the streets taking turns carrying the disguises and discussing how to split the money. This serves to introduce some levity and ease the narrative out of the emotional climax of the scene, helping to prepare the audience for the twists and emotion of the following scene, the true climax of the play. Tamashima Ittō is invited into the back room of the shop for a drink, perhaps in part in thanks for pointing out the thieves. The next scene takes place in this back room. Drunk, Tamashima draws his sword and reveals himself as Nippon Daemon in a rousing speech, before demanding Kōbei hand over all the money in the shop. Though Rikimaru and Kozō have made off with 100 ryō, the entire ordeal was a ruse to help Daemon earn Kōbei's trust, and to get himself into the back room. Sōnosuke throws himself between the two, offering his own life instead of that of his father-in-law; Daemon stops, noting that he once had a son who would be roughly Sōnosuke's age. The two older men begin to talk about their pasts and come to the realization that not only is Daemon Sōnosuke's true father, but Kōbei is in fact Kozō's true father. Both men, for differing reasons, lost their sons at a crowded ritual ceremony at the Hase-dera over a decade prior, and agree to forget about Daemon's criminal scheme as they thank one another for taking care of one another's sons, though Kōbei does ask that Daemon attempt to turn all five of the thieves away from their lives of crime. Kozō learns through this exchange that Kōbei was once a retainer of the Koyama family to which Princess Senju belongs. If Kōbei can return the stolen incense burner, he'll be reinstated as a samurai. As the police descend upon the shop, Kōbei offers Daemon a set of formal clothes ordered several days prior by the thieves. Act IV thumbcenter700pxInasegawa Seizoroi no Ba (“Act IV: Inase River Monologues) by Toyokuni Utagawa III, 1862 \\\\---- From left: Sanjūrō Seki III as Nippon-daemon, Kumesaburō Iwai I (the future Hanshirō Iwai VIII) as Jūzaburō Akaboshi, Shikan Nakamura IV as Rikimaru Nangō, Gonjūrō Kawarazaki I (the future Danjūrō Ichikawa IX) as Rihei Tadanobu, and Uzaemon Ichimura XIII (the future Kikugorō Onoe V) as Benten- kozō Kikunosuke. The single scene of the fourth act takes place on the banks of the Inase River where, surrounded by the police and clad in formal kimono, all five reveal their identities and life stories in celebrated monologues. They then overcome the police and flee. Act V The final act takes place at the Gokuraku-ji, where Kozō battles the police while searching for the lost incense burner. One of his band, who informed on him to the police, steals away the incense burner, and after a long battle, Kozō commits suicide on the roof of the temple gate, seeking to atone for all his crimes. The transition to the next scene is likely one of the largest, and most famous, keren stage tricks in kabuki. The entire roof tilts backwards and out of the way, revealing Nippon Daemon standing on a veranda within the temple gate. He stands and watches the police search for him. Two of the thieves appear, convey the news of Kozō's death, and then attack him, explaining that they were policemen in disguise the entire time. Daemon throws off the attack, and spots Aoto Fujitsuna, the top official after whom the play was originally named, on a small bridge down below. Aoto explains that his men found the incense burner in the river, and intend to return it to its rightful owners. Relieved, Daemon resolves to ask to be arrested, but Aoto generously offers to instead let him be at least until the end of the memorial service of the late shōgun; Daemon promises to turn himself in later in the day, and leaves.

It is a 3D remake of the video game Snake. Snakeball was developed in collaboration between the British Gamoola Soft (the sister studio of Gamoola) and the Norwegian Ravn Studio. It was published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Gameplay The game uses most of the mechanics of the late 70s game Snake. The goal consists of taking the balls and throwing them into the hole at the center of the stage. While the game has many variations of gameplay, the main goal stays the same. Snakeball has a flashy disco graphic style, with stages that are taking places on disco floors. The player can also choose between 16 characters with 8 colors each. The PlayStation Eye camera can even be used to snap a picture of the player's face and map it onto one of the riders. Modes Snakeball has 3 main game modes: Snakeball, Challenge and Ball Frenzy. Snakeball is the multiplayer mode, where up to 8 players can play online. There are 10 variations of game for this mode: *Raindrops: The player has to collect the balls as they appear and shoot them in the goal. *Patience: Similar to Raindrops, but here, the balls don't appear immediately. *Goal Fever: Similar to Raindrops, but every ball must be put into the goal of matching color. *The Ball Ring: Similar to Raindrops, but only with bomb balls that explodes after 10 seconds. *Open Season: At the beginning, the balls are launched and don't stop moving. Also, there are now enemies that the player must avoid. *Bumper Jam: In this game variation, balls can only be shot at goal. *Square Routes: Similar to Raindrops, but taking places in a maze of squares bumpers. *Goal Tangle: The player can score his balls in goals for shots and normal goals in a stage filled with enemies. *Trigger Snappy: Similar to Open Season, but the enemies here are far more. Fortunately, the player can now eliminate them with guns. *No balls: The player has no balls to score. In fact, the goal of the game is to destroy the ships of other players with guns. The second game mode is Challenge, where the player must navigate through levels to open the teleporter and go to the next level. 14 levels are available. The last one is Ball Frenzy, which is a remake of the classic game Snake, with 10 levels. The goal of this mode is to get all the 1000 balls that are in the level without crashing and destroying the ship. Additional Team Mode add-on was released at the PlayStation Store in May 2008. It includes team-based online and offline multiplayer matches up to 8 players. Reception and demo Metacritic awarded the game a 65 out of 100. A demo of the game and the full game is available at the PlayStation Store.

It is affiliated with Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), the only organisation legally able to transmit radio and TV broadcasts in Iran. The 24-hour channel, with headquarters in Tehran, was launched on 2 July 2007 and was intended to compete with western English language services. Press TV has been described as an Iranian government propaganda. It has been criticized and accused of broadcasting \\"the most disreputable of fringe causes\\" in The Jewish Chronicle including antisemitism and Holocaust denial, promoting Iranian foreign policy, and has broadcast the coerced confessions of multiple prisoners. The channel has since been subjected to sanctions and restrictions by multiple countries. Purpose and launch PressTV shooting at University of Johannesburg, South Africa Press TV was created for the purpose of presenting news, images and arguments, especially on Middle Eastern affairs, to counter the news coverage that appears on BBC World News, CNN International and Al Jazeera English. Press TV is state-funded and is a division of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), the only organisation legally able to transmit radio and television broadcasts inside Iran. Based in Tehran, It broadcasts to North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and areas of Africa and Latin America. IRIB's head is appointed directly by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; according to The Guardian, it is close to the country's conservative political faction, especially the elite Revolutionary Guards. Press TV CEO Mohammad Sarafraz said in a June 2007 press conference that, \\"Since September 11, Western bias has divided the media into two camps: those that favour their policies make up one group and the rest of the media are attached to radical Islamic groups like Al-Qaeda. We want to show that there is a different view. Iran, and the Shi'as in particular, have become a focal point of world propaganda. From the media point of view, we are trying to give a second eye to Western audiences.\\" By launching an English-language television network to promote an Iranian perspective of the world, together with an Arab-language station, the Al-Alam News Network, the Iranian government said it hoped \\"to address a global audience exposed to misinformation and mudslinging as regards the Islamic Republic of Iran.\\" The two networks focus on \\"difficult issues in the Middle East such as the United States’ occupation of neighbouring Iraq and the Shiite question.\\" According to mediachannel.org, \\"the government aims to use Press TV to counter what it sees as a steady stream of Western propaganda against Iran as well as offer an alternative view of world news\\". Press TV began its activities in London during 2007. The network's website launched in late January 2007, and the channel itself on 2 July 2007. Roshan Muhammed Salih was Press TV's first London news editor and chief correspondent. The BBC journalist Linda Pressly described Press TV as pro-Palestinian and opposed to sanctions against Iran in December 2011. At the time Press TV Ltd in London sold programmes to Iran, principally talk shows, while Tehran's Press TV International produced the majority of the news and documentaries. As of 2009, the annual budget of Press TV is 250 Billion rials (more than US$8.3 million). Controversies Alleged pro-Government bias Press TV's news bulletins often feature Iranian ministers, diplomats or government officials, or guest commentators that are able to express views consistent with the Iranian government's \\"message of the day.\\" In 2012, commentator Douglas Murray wrote that the station was the \\"Iranian government’s propaganda channel\\". In a post- election \\"information offensive,\\" reports the Associated Press, Press TV and Al-Alam have \\"churned out a blitz of policy statements, negotiating points and news breaks as the main soapboxes for Iran's public diplomacy.\\" In 2007, the Canadian weekly Maclean's, while observing that \\"most of Press TV's news reports are factually accurate,\\" alleged that Press TV also publishes \\"intentional errors,\\" citing a story on the Press TV website that contained the claim, based on \\"no evidence,\\" that the Lebanese government is trying to convert the Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp into an American military base.\\" In August 2009, Ofcom, the British broadcasting regulator, judged that two phone-in shows hosted by George Galloway on Press TV had broken its broadcasting code on impartiality in their coverage of the Gaza War by not including enough calls from pro-Israelis. Press TV said contributions to the show reflected the balance of opinion.BBC (3 August 2009). \\"Galloway TV shows 'broke rules'\\". The Sunday Times journalist Eleanor Mills walked out before a Press TV interview in 2010 after discovering she was not being interviewed by Sky News, as she had falsely believed. While she was reassured on editorial independence from Tehran, Mills doubted she would be able to talk about torture in Iran or Neda Agha-Soltan, who was shot dead in the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests.  Allegations of antisemitism  Press TV was accused in December 2011 by British journalist Nick Cohen of functioning as \\"a platform for the full fascist conspiracy theory of supernatural Jewish power\\". He wrote that \\"If whites ran Press TV, one would have no difficulty in saying it was a neo-Nazi network\\". Oliver Kamm in The Jewish Chronicle in 2009, of having an \\"ability to insinuate into public debate the worst and most pernicious ideas around\\", including Holocaust denial. Cohen mentioned that the station featured \\"fascist ideologues such as Peter Rushton, the leader of the White Nationalist party – an organisation that disproves the notion that the only thing further to the right of the BNP is the wall.\\" In a September 15, 2009 article entitled \\"Incendiary Press Reporting,\\" Moroccan journalist Hassan Masiky criticized Press TV for trafficking in \\"fiction and fantasy\\" by circulating a suspect story about \\"an alleged Jewish gang trading in “body parts” and abduction of Algerian children towards Morocco.\\" In a May 2011 article reprinted on the website of Press TV, correspondent Mark Dankof, who is also a contributor to the conspiracy-oriented\\"Anti-Semitism - US: 9/11 Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theories Still Abound\\", Anti-Defamation League, 7 September 2006Intelligence Files: Willis Carto. Southern Poverty Law Center. Retrieved November 1, 2011 American Free Press, wrote an article about how the prediction of antisemitic Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion is \\"only partially true\\", and lauded Press TV as \\"one of the 'few exceptions'\\" to the Lobby's control of the media. In 2012, a report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) alleged that Press TV has broadcast what the ADL described as examples of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and opinions. The report says Press TV for interviewing individuals such as the American conspiracy theorist David Duke who said on the station that Israel was involved in 9/11 and of the Iraq War, he said: \\"The Zionists orchestrated and created this war in the media, the government, and international finance\\". The ADL reported in 2013 that in another appearance, Duke made \\"anti-Semitic allegations that are consistent with his record and typical of the views often espoused on Press TV\\". Mark Dankof has also backed claims on Press TV that 9/11 was an \\"Israeli Mossad inside operation from start to finish\\". In early 2015, Press TV claimed Jews or Israel were responsible for the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. In a January 20, 2015 article by Kevin Barrett on the station's website he claimed that \\"The Zionists created ISIL and sent it to fight Muslims and Christians in Syria and Iraq\\" while \\"New World Order Zionism is also targeting the USA for destruction\\". In a February 17, 2015 article for the website, Barrett claimed 9/11 was a \\"Zionist ‘coup d'etat’ to seize power in the country and launch a permanent war on Islam on behalf of Israel\\" falsely claimed the 2011 attacks in Norway In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Press TV broadcast unsubstantiated assertions. On March 5, it broadcast an item claiming \\"Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran\\". Accusations of Holocaust denial On the subject of International Holocaust Remembrance Day (January 27), an editorial on the Press TV website in 2008 noted, \\"On this anniversary, we all need to mull over the faking of history and the Greatest Lie Ever Told\\". In 2008, The Jerusalem Post and the British Searchlight magazine The apologist for terror and the BBC by David Williams, July 2008. criticized Press TV for reprinting on its website an article entitled \\"The Walls of Auschwitz: A Review of the Chemical Studies\\" by the British Holocaust denier Nicholas Kollerstrom which was first published by the denial group, the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH). The document claims that the Auschwitz gas chambers were used for \\"benign\\" purposes only and said \\"the alleged massacre of Jewish people by gassing during World War II was scientifically impossible\\". Press TV described Kollerstrom, by then removed as an honorary fellow of University College London (UCL) because of the article, as a \\"distinguished academic\\". A 2014 article on the website, the Canadian writer Brandon Martinez described Auschwitz as having been an appealing place where Jews were able to participate in \\"cultural and leisure activities\\". He rejected the existence of gas chambers during the Holocaust and the use of Zyklon B for the mass killings of European Jews. To make his assertions he drew on claims made by Holocaust deniers Mark Webber and David Irving. In November 2013, the Press TV website reprinted an opinion piece in its 'Viewpoints' section, first written by M.I. Bhat for Veterans Today, although Bhat was a regular columnist for Press TV as well. The article blamed Jews for their fate in the Holocaust and accepted \\"the Nazi regime’s anti-Jewish conspiracy theories as historical fact\\". Bhat queried whether American Jews were \\"incubating another Hitler\\". Maziar Bahari case On 10 June 2010, the United Kingdom's Channel 4 News interviewed Iranian-Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari, a documentary maker and Newsweek contributor, who was arrested while filming the protests following the contested Iranian presidential election in 2009. Held in Evin Prison, Bahari was accused of spying for the CIA, MI6 and Mossad, and was detained for 118 days. Bahari alleged that a 10-second Press TV interview and 'confession' that the western media was guilty of fomenting the protests had been preceded by torture, and was given under the threat of execution. The nature of the interview, that it was a forced confession, was not disclosed to viewers of the footage. Having to talk complete rubbish before a camera to save his life \\"was like a rape”, he told The Sunday Times in 2012. \\"It went against the very essence of me\\". Bahari is not the only Iranian prisoner who has been coerced with a following broadcast of the supposed confession. Allegations about Canada Following the severing of diplomatic relations between Canada and Iran in September 2012, Press TV began to devote more attention to Canada. In December 2012, Press TV aired a report entitled \\"Alberta takes aboriginal kids from parents at high rate\\" in which Joshua Blakeney, Press TV's Calgary correspondent, claimed that Alberta's child protective services were engaged in the human trafficking of First Nations children. Blakeney stated that \\"Some upset parents allege that there is a profit motive behind what they refer to as Canada's so-called child protective services\\" and asserted that an anti- terrorism squad, called INSET, was responsible for the abductions.Iranian media report claims Alberta police abduct, traffic Aboriginal children for profit by Tristin Hopper, National Post, December 11, 2012.Alberta takes aboriginal kids from parents at high rate, Press TV, December 10, 2012.Parents dispute removal of Canadian aboriginal children, Press TV, December 10, 2012.Lack of fact doesn't stop journalist claiming Alberta government sells Native children by Michael Platt, Calgary Sun, December 13, 2012.[Conspiracy theorist and Iranian-sponsored journalist takes aim at Alberta] by Ian Campbell, 660News Radio (Calgary) December 13, 2012. One of the veiled women interviewed in the report (who was not identified) claimed that her \\"aboriginal children\\" were taken by a squad of 32 police officers.\\" Another woman interviewed stated that \\"It definitely is a money-making scheme, because a lot of native children have been sold into adoption, but it is also used as an assimilation program [and] a genocidal program.\\" The report also showed written messages of \\"Help me! Now!!\\", which were allegedly written by abducted children. The allegations in the report were immediately denied by Government officials and Native leaders. Cindy Blackstock, an associate professor at the University of Alberta and executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada denied the report was true, stating that \\"The factors driving aboriginal children into care have been well-known for 15 years; it's poverty, poor housing and substance abuse. ... The federal government provides significantly less funding on reserves than for all other Canadians ... but I have never in my life heard of any military undertones to this.\\" Blakeney has also claimed in reports published or broadcast by Press TV, that the appearance of Canada's new $20 bill was evidence that Canada “remained an imperialist nation” and that \\"90% of Canadian youth felt stressed about careers.\\" Blakeney subsequently claimed that his reports for Press TV are “defiantly illuminating the skeletons in Canada’s closet.” Another report made several charges against the Canadian government, including: * Secret plans to \\"steal indigenous children\\"; * \\"Ignorance of the First Nation land rights\\"; * Jailing refugees without cause; and * using excessive force to suppress student protests. Another program interviewed Alfred Lambremont Webre, who was described as an \\"international lawyer\\" based in Vancouver. Webre stated Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is an \\"out and out Zionist\\" who is engaging in the \\"same repressive policies within Canada that Israel follows within its own territories against the Palestinian people.\\" Webre then described a conspiracy between Vancouver police and serial killer Robert Pickton \\"to commit ritual Satanic murders with high-ranking politicians.\\" Finally, Webre claimed that the Queen of England abducted 10 Aboriginal children in 1964. Concluding his comments, Webre described Canada as \\"the ultimate Zionist state under the British Crown and under Israel.\\"Canada and its 'out and out Zionist' prime minister have become the latest target of Iran's Press TV by Tristin Hopper, National Post, January 18, 2013.Canadian politicians involved in Aboriginal women killings: Alfred Lambremont Webre, Press TV, December 20, 2012. In response, Paul Heinbecker, a former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations and a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation at the University of Waterloo, has stated that Press TV is highlighting Canada's First Nations in order to \\"negate\\" Canadian reports of human rights allegations against Iran. Heinbecker stated that \\"The human rights situations in the two countries are scarcely comparable ... but our own very real shortcomings on Aboriginal issues ... are fodder for the Iranian efforts.\\" Iranian native Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at McGill University, stated that \\"Canada's diplomatic posture has elevated its ranking in the regime's demonology charts.\\" Ed Corrigan, an immigration lawyer and former councillor for London, Ontario, is a regular guest on Press TV. Corrigan, who has said that \\"There's very few people in Canada who have more expertise on Middle East politics than I do,\\" argues that Press TV is demonstrating the \\"international opinion\\" of Canada's treatment of its native peoples, explaining that \\"We tend to forget about our conquest of North America ... but most countries in the world see it as a colonial exercise.\\"  Staff resignations  Nick Ferrari  Nick Ferrari, a British radio presenter on LBC, resigned from his show on Press TV on 30 June 2009, following the response of the country's authorities to protests over the disputed Iranian presidential election. Ferrari told The Times that Press TV's news coverage had been \\"reasonably fair\\" until the election—but was not any longer. Ferrari admitted joining Press TV \\"was one of the dimmest career decisions of my life\\", although he also said he had not been pressurized to adhere to any particular line.  Hassan Abdulrahman  In September 2009, The Times reported that Hassan Abdulrahman, born David Theodore Belfield, one of the chief editors of the Press TV website from the beginning of Press TV's news department, had stated that he left Press TV as chief online editor in July 2009 after the election in protest at its skewed coverage of that event.Jon Lee Anderson (30 September 2009). \\"Jon Lee Anderson: A Fugitive in Iran\\". The New Yorker. The Times quoted Abdulrahman as saying, \\"No, I don't think Press TV is about [real journalism]. By its nature, state journalism is not journalism. They have some programmes on there that might be, but generally it's not.\\" In the article the Times also reported that Abdulrahman, who has also used the alias Dawud Salahuddin, is wanted by the FBI for shooting dead Ali Akbar Tabatabai, a former press attache at the pre- revolutionary Iranian embassy in Washington, in 1980. The Iranian government provided money and airfare to Tehran to Belfield after he allegedly committed the killing.  Sheena Shirani  Sheena Shirani worked for Press TV from 2007 to January 2016 as an editor, producer and news presenter. She said news director Hamid Reza Emadi and studio manager Payam Afshar sexually harassing her for years, and published a recorded phone conversation with her boss Emadi. Press TV suspended both managers following the incident. Sanctions and restrictions In 2010, the Jammu and Kashmir government banned Press TV for airing video on the 2010 Qur'an-burning controversy saying \\"We have decided to impose a ban on the airing of Press TV broadcasts by local cable operators. We appeal to the people not to heed unverified reports about the alleged desecration of the Holy Koran which have only been aired by Press TV and no other television news channel in the world.\\"\\"Indian Kashmir bans Iran's Press TV over Koran ripping\\". Sify. On April 3, 2012, Munich-based media regulator Bayerische Landeszentrale für neue Medien (BLM), announced it was removing Press TV from the SES Astra satellite, as they did not have a licence to broadcast in Europe. However, the channel's legal team submitted documents to the court that proved Press TV could broadcast under German law. An administrative court in Germany accepted Press TV's argument and the legal procedures began. Munich's Administrative Court announced on Friday 15 June that the ban was illegal. In September 2012 the High Administrative Court of Bavaria confirmed the regulatory authority's decision. In July 2013 Press TV and other Iranian channels were removed from several European and American satellites (amongst others those of Eutelsat and Intelsat), allegedly because of the Iran sanctions, even though an EU spokesperson told the channel that these sanctions do not apply to media. In November 2012, the Hong Kong-based AsiaSat took Iranian channels off air in East Asia, and in October 2012 Eutelsat and Intelsat stopped broadcasting several Iranian satellite channels, though the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting managed to resume broadcasts after striking deals with smaller companies that are based in other countries. Google blocked Press TV access to their Gmail and YouTube in April 2019; although the latter remained active no new content could be added. YouTube removed Press TV UK from its platform in January 2020. Press TV accused Google, which owns YouTube, of censorship. The Press TV UK channel appeared after the original was removed. In April 2019, Press TV reported that Google blocked their access (along with HispanTV) “without prior notice, citing “violation of policies,” and that they received a message saying “your Google Account was disabled and can’t be restored because it was used in a way that violates Google’s policies.” Although their YouTube channels remain open, no new content can be published. Press TV claimed that Google “has refused to offer an explanation for shutting down the accounts,” and that they have not violated any of Google's listed policies. Potential terrorist designation On June 26, 2008, the United States House of Representatives proposed to declare Press TV, Al-Alam News Network and several IRIB-affiliated channels as a \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity\\" sponsored by Florida congressman Gus Bilirakis.http://www.payvand.com/news/08/jul/1236.htmlhttps://infolution.wordpress.com/tag/specially- designated-global-terrorist/https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/173906/Iran-U-S- seeks-to-keep-public-in-dark UK licence revocation Maziar Bahari, by then a British resident, complained to Ofcom, the regulatory authority for the telecommunication industries in the United Kingdom. In May 2011, Ofcom ruled that Press TV was responsible for a serious breach of UK broadcasting rules by airing a 10-second interview with Maziar Bahari, accepting that it had been obtained under duress while he was imprisoned. A fine of £100,000 ($155,000 in January 2012) was eventually imposed in November 2011, reversing an initial decision to revoke Press TV's licence. The extent of the fine was partly due to Press TV continuing to run the interview after warnings from Ofcom that the station had broken the Broadcasting Code. Responding to the decision, Press TV said Ofcom was \\"influenced by powerful pro-Israeli politicians and US sympathisers\\" and \\"members of the royal family and the government\\". It maintained Bahari was an \\"MI6 contact person\\". Defenders of Press TV, such as Geoffrey Alderman and the broadcaster's legal representative, Farooq Bajwa, referred to a formerly secret American diplomatic cable dated 4 February 2010 which was released by WikiLeaks. The cable said the British government was then \\"exploring ways to limit the operations of the IRIB's Press TV service\\" in response to the jamming by the Iranian government of broadcasts by the BBC Persian Service and the Voice of America. On 20 January 2012, Press TV's licence to broadcast in the UK was revoked by Ofcom with immediate effect. The investigation into the Bahari case had revealed the applying company's direct connection to Tehran, and that editorial control came from there. An invitation to change this in the licence had not been taken up by Press TV. Geoffrey Alderman, who had appeared on Press TV to put the Zionist case, criticised the Ofcom decision, describing it as \\"thoroughly deplorable as well as palpably cynical\\" and \\"an affront to freedom of expression\\". He said the location of Press TV's editorial control had not changed since the licence was granted. Afshin Rattansi said the concern over editorial control being based in Britain \\"will come as a surprise to my former employers at the London offices of CNN International, Bloomberg and Al Jazeera, all of which ultimately answer, editorially, to bosses in Atlanta, New York and Doha\\".

Each version of the work typically establishes its own continuity, and sometimes introduces parallel universes, to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified. This article details various versions of Wolverine depicted in works including Marvel Comics Ultimate line, What If?, television, and film. Age of Apocalypse In the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" story arc, the Wolverine/Logan character is again a member of the X-Men, this time using the code-name Weapon X rather than Wolverine.X-Men Chronicles 01 (1995) In this reality the events which saw the character's Adamantium ripped out have never occurred, and it is Magneto that helps him to control his feral rages. Most significantly, Weapon X is missing a hand, cut off by Cyclops (who in turn is missing an eye thanks to Weapon X). The claws on this hand still exist, however, which appear by piercing through the metal stump covering the break. Consistent with the main characterisation, this version is also shown to be a loner, his back story presenting him as an unwilling recruit to the X-Men. He and Jean Grey are lovers in this reality. Also during the arc, there is a separate character named Wolverine, a mutant altered by Dark Beast, who worked as a tracker for Apocalypse. Weapon Omega Later he offered himself to the Celestials to prevent the planet's judgment and was further augmented by the Celestial technology, yet while he had ascended in form and power, his mind had become so twisted to the point of assembling a deadly group of genetically modified warriors known as the Black Legion and sent them to kill Charles Lehnsherr, the infant son of Magneto and Rogue. He also captured his teammate Storm and renamed her as Orordius after using the Celestial technology on her, enslaving and transforming her into a blind seer made of living stone. He also intended to do the same to Jean Grey, by turning her into the Horseman of Death, but his efforts were prevented by the Uncanny X-Force from the Main Reality, who had traveled to the Age of Apocalypse seeking a celestial life seed. Age of X In the Age of X reality, Wolverine's powers have been virtually lost after he was forced to ingest a mutant 'cure' in order to dispose of it; although his healing factor can stop the cure totally affecting him, it is now so focused on fighting the cure and the adamantium poisoning of his metal skeleton that he cannot fight any more, as any additional strain placed on his system could kill him. Amalgam Comics In the Amalgam Comics community, Wolverine was combined with Batman to create Dark Claw.Legends of the Dark Claw #1 (1996)Dark Claw Adventures #1 (1997) Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows In the Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows timeline, Wolverine is married to Jean Grey and they are the co-directors of education at Xavier's school for Gifted Youngsters. They also have a daughter named Kate, who is nicknamed \\"Shine.\\"Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows (vol. 2) #6 In this timeline, the superhero Civil War was averted when Charles Xavier proposed self-policing among the super-powered community. The fallout of this decision tore apart Jean and Cyclops, leading to her marriage to Logan. Civil War In the alternate version of Civil War seen in the Secret Wars event, Wolverine is on Captain America's side, as is also a grey version of the Hulk.Civil War Vol 2 #5 Counter-Earth In the Onslaught Reborn mini-series, the Wolverine of Counter-Earth is revealed to have been masquerading as that Earth's version of Hawkeye. Days of Future Past In this alternate reality the X-Men fail to prevent the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly, which results in Sentinels ruling the United States of America by 2013 AD. Mutants fall one by one at the hands of the Sentinels, until only Wolverine, Storm, Colossus and Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat) are left. They are confronted by a group of Sentinels and Wolverine lunges at one, ready to slice off the Sentinel's head, but his flesh is burned off by the Sentinel's hand laser. Wolverine seemingly dies and his charred Adamantium skeleton falls onto the ground. Later on in the Earth X: Heralds storyline, Wolverine is revived by X-51's machine. Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth In the seventh issue of this series, Deadpool visits a universe where the wild west still exists. There Wolverine is a bounty hunter looking to make some money by capturing the Deadpool Kid. Earth X According to the information in the Earth X miniseries Paradise X: Heralds, the second child of the Howletts died in childbirth and the Howletts found and adopted an infant member of the Moon Clan, a bestial race which has co-existed with humanity for hundreds of thousands of years. This Clan, which is also dubbed wolf clan, were mortal enemies of the Bear Clan, to which Sabretooth belongs. Supposedly, it is this Moon Tribe child who was named James Howlett and would grow up to become Wolverine explaining the enmity between Wolverine and Sabretooth in this alternative reality. It is also revealed that this seemingly divergent sub- species is in fact what the \\"true\\" human species would have become if not for the Celestials' intervention and genetic tampering. In the Earth X series, Wolverine has married Jean Grey; however, they are now overweight and fit the image of a bickering couple. When the Skull attacks New York, Wolverine refuses to aid Captain America and the other heroes in fighting him. Jean, disgusted, leaves Logan, but not before claiming that she is in fact Madelyne Pryor. The two later reconcile, but have not gotten back together. Exiles and Weapon X Another version of Wolverine, originating from Earth-172, was revealed by Sabretooth to have joined an alternative, more sinister version of Weapon X in the Exiles series. At some point in Weapon X's travels, this version of Wolverine was killed. Like other fallen members of the Exiles and Weapon X, his body was stored in a stasis wall inside the Timebreakers' crystal palace before he was sent home to his own timeline to be cremated by his loved ones. Issue #85 and #86 followed the adventures of several Wolverines from different timelines gathered in an attempt to stop a mutant known as Brother Mutant, a being with the combined powers of Wolverine, Magneto, Quicksilver, Scarlet Warlock (a male version of the Scarlet Witch) and Mesmero. Different teams of Wolverines were gathered and each fell to the hypnotic powers of Brother Mutant. The last team of Wolverines was composed of Patch, an alternative version of the zombie Wolverine featured in the miniseries Marvel Zombies, Albert & Elsie-Dee, Weapon X, a young James Howlett and the Days of Future Past Logan. When most of this team fell before Brother Mutant's followers, Logan and James Howlett were able to contact the Timebreakers and convinced them to gather the original Exiles to help defeat Brother Mutant. Numerous other alternative reality versions of Wolverine appear in those issues as well, some of them being hybrids between Wolverine and main Marvel continuity characters (Thing/Wolverine, Hulk/Wolverine, Deadpool/Wolverine, etc.). Issue #91-94 shows Wolverine as an agent of HYDRA which he leads together with the Invisible Woman, with whom Logan has a relationship. They also appear in the following New Exiles series, where he is ultimately killed by an alternative version of Shadowcat. Future Imperfect In the future of Future Imperfect, where Earth was decimated by nuclear war and the Hulk had become the insane dictator known as the Maestro, the now- elderly Rick Jones kept Wolverine's skeleton as one of the many mementoes of the age of heroes, his words implying that Wolverine was killed in the nuclear fallout of the two world wars between the present and his time. Rick was later killed when his attempt to defend himself from the Maestro with Captain America's shield caused him to be thrown out of his wheelchair and impaled on the skeleton's claws, the Maestro grimly commenting on the amusing irony of Rick being killed by one relic while defending himself with another. General James Howlett From the \\"Exalted\\" storyline of Astonishing X-Men and X-Treme X-Men vol. 2, General Howlett was a general in the army of the British Empire, and viceroy of his world's Canada. Howlett was part of an expedition to the lost city of Shangri-La. There, his skeleton was bonded with the adamantine. However, he was taken from his world by some means when the Saviour came calling. He was held for a time, but escaped with the help of Scott Summers. Now he is a member of a dimension-hopping X-Men team and assisted with hunting down ten evil Xaviers from various alternative timelines in order to save the multiverse. He is in a relationship with his world's Hercules; however, their relationship is considered illicit because the gods of Olympus are not permitted to consort with mortals. Guardians of the Galaxy In the alternative future of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Wolverine's adamantium skeleton is reanimated and controlled by the brain of Doctor Doom. Additionally, one of the villains appearing in the series, in which Wolverine is still remembered with awe as \\"the Brood Slayer\\", is his great-great- granddaughter Rancor, who is obsessed with her ancestor and owns one of his broken off claws. Rancor comes to rule a human colony, which had been founded by Wolverine and other mutants, hundreds of years ago. She came from a long lineage, all claiming rulership by relation to Wolverine. Most were murderous tyrants. It is, however, hinted at that Wolverine is still alive. Alluded to by several \\"shots\\" of an unrevealed, shadowy individual, which included captions and character comments heightening the suggestion. The character is never revealed, leaving the question of who they were unanswered. While it is a strongly held belief that he will live hundreds of years, this suggests Logan has the potential to live for thousands of years, but how it may fit into Marvel canon is unknown. Here Comes Tomorrow In the \\"Here Comes Tomorrow\\"story arc, set 150 years in an alternative future, Wolverine is still alive and part of group fighting against a version of Beast possessed by Sublime. This version of Wolverine is killed when Beast artificially gives himself the powers of the Phoenix Force and turns off Wolverine's healing factor, before beating him to death. This future is averted by Jean Grey.New X-Men #151-154 (March-May 2004) The Hooded Man This version of Wolverine comes from hundreds of years into the future. He is part of a group called \\"The Last Defenders\\", who, led by a future version of Sue Storm, have come back in time to save the last of humanity.Fantastic Four #559 This future Logan later briefly encounters his younger self at the future Sue's funeral, telling him, \\"Don't even ask.\\"Fantastic Four #562 During the Fantastic Force mini-series Logan briefly leads the team when they find themselves under attack from various enemies summoned by Gaea the living spirit of the Fantastic Force's now barren earth. Due to the abandonment of all life she has been driven insane and attempts to force them back in to their timeline. After several confrontations and fights, Logan elects to stay behind in the future and to aid Gaea in restoring herself by sharing his healing factor. The two are last seen tending to a garden with Gaea pregnant.Fantastic Force #1-4 House of M Although another reality, the Wolverine of House of M is the 616 Wolverine, retaining his memories from the old reality, including his untampered past. After the House falls, he retains these memories. The House of M Wolverine was a head operative of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Red Guard, and had an affair with Mystique. Marvel Mangaverse In the Marvel Mangaverse reality Wolverine, not Charles Xavier, formed the X-Men (Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Mirage and Jean Grey forming the core of the group, with Rogue living with them). Wolverine has one set of long metal claws—most likely adamantium and shaped like katanas on his left hand, and another set, on his right hand, composed of red energy (like Cyclops's optic beams) and shaped like lightsabers. Wolverine has incredible strength. He has white hair (it is later changed to black in the new mangaverse) and a strange tattoo on his face, possibly meant to be the Greek symbol Omega. His uniform is highly reminiscent of that worn by Dragon Ball character Vegeta, possibly as homage. In this reality, he and Cyclops are brothers. Wolverine cost Cyclops one of his eyes, while it is hinted that Cyclops cost Wolverine one of his hands. (This seems to be why one of Wolverine's sets of claws is energy while the other is metal. Throughout this story with the exception of a pair of panels, Wolverine was depicted with two flesh and blood hands, but his right hand had claws of energy, not adamantium. The flesh and blood appearance of both hands continued in the final issue of the first arc of Mangaverse). He is also hinted to have had a relationship with Jean Grey, who had begun to favor Cyclops. In the New Mangaverse, Wolverine is one of the few mutants to survive the Hand/S.H.I.E.L.D. bio-engineered virus targeting mutants thanks to his healing factor. Jean Grey's rejection of him has clearly left him with some issues since he said he had a thing for redheads and flirts with Spider-woman (Mary Jane Watson) in New Mangaverse #2. It is clear that his advances are unwanted and that Mary Jane is scared of him. When Logan grabs her, Spider-Man becomes angry and tries to fight him but proves to be no match for Wolverine and it is ultimately the Black Cat that stops him. He flirts with the Black Cat throughout the New Mangaverse miniseries, saying \\"I've always been a sucker for a girl with a nice set of ... CLAWS.\\" It is also hinted that at some point in the past he was Lady Deathstrike's lover. In the New Mangaverse, Wolverine teams up with the Black Cat, Captain America (Carol Danvers), Iron Man, Spider-Man, Spider-Woman (Mary Jane Watson), and The Torch (Jonatha Storm, Sioux Storm's half sister, this reality's Human Torch) to fight the Hand (some of the organization's more prominent members being Lady Deathstrike, Elektra, Silver Samurai, Sunfire, and a (brainwashed) Sharon Carter). Marvel Noir In X-Men Noir, set in the Marvel Noir reality, \\"Captain\\" Logan is a heavily scarred bootlegger operating in the New York Chinatown and adept at defending himself with a metallic claw. Wolverine Noir, which presents a different characterization, presents Jim Logan, private investigator along with Dog Logan, whom he claims is his brother. Marvel Zombies In the alternative Marvel Zombies universe, Wolverine is one of many heroes who become infected by the zombie virus. He is actually infected when both zombies Captain America, and Hawkeye bite him. The virus overwhelms his healing factor, so he can no longer heal from any injury. He, along with other zombies, attempted to slay the Silver Surfer. Wolverine attacks the Surfer but his body is decayed so much that his right arm is torn apart, as his adamantium bones are stronger than his rotting flesh. Eventually Wolverine and the other zombies are successful in killing and eating the Surfer. As a result, he and the others gain the Silver Surfer's cosmic power and wound and devour Galactus, becoming the creatures collectively known as The Galacti. The Marvel Zombies attack a Skrull planet, only to encounter the Fantastic Four of the 616 reality - currently consisting of Black Panther, Storm, the Thing and the Human Torch, leaving the Zombies eager to capture the FF and transport back to their reality.Black Panther #28-30 (July - September 2007) In Marvel Zombies 2, Wolverine's lost right arm has been replaced with a cybernetic arm with claws He is loyal to Henry Pym (Giant-Man) and willingly attacks the defecting Spider-Man. When the others realize that the hunger is fading, he initially refuses to let go of a survivor in his grasp until Henry Pym tells him to stop, saying he seemingly loses his hunger. He is one of the last surviving zombies from the zombie Hulk's attack that killed many zombies, and even the last zombies to especially kill the Hulk with his cosmic powers. After that, he has been teleported to a new world known as Earth 91126 along with the other surviving zombies. During the teleportation, he lost his cosmic powers, and became a regular zombie once more. Zombie Wolverine also appears in Marvel Zombies Return. In this Zombie Wolverine kills the human Elektra, Iron Fist (comics) and Shang-Chi, White Tiger, Black Tiger, and many of the Hand, thus recently he was one of the few remaining zombies left. He also appears in Japan, and infects another version of himself, though he resists the hunger and angrily kills him, zombie Spider-Man watches the whole thing happen. This reality's Wolverine joined Spider-Man's New Avengers consisting of Spider-Man, Iron Man (James Rhodes), Hulk and himself. He, along with the rest of the zombies are destroyed by the nanite-carried Sandman. MC2 In the alternative future known as MC2, Wolverine and Elektra are married and have a daughter named Rina Logan, who inherits her father's healing factor and senses and possesses \\"psychic claws\\" which resemble Psylocke's telepathic \\"psychic knife\\". She becomes a superheroine called Wild Thing. Wolverine also has a son, Sabreclaw (Hudson Logan), with another woman. During the events of Last Hero Standing, Wolverine is among the heroes kidnapped by Loki as part of his plan to bring about the end of the Age of Heroes. Mutant X This version of Wolverine is a member of the Pack a group consisting of Sabertooth, Wildchild and Logan. All three savage and driven insane by the Weapon X experiments. The three roam the Canadian wilderness very much like a wolf pack. Old Man Logan Old Man Logan is a character depicted in an eight-issue story arc in the Wolverine ongoing series by writer Mark Millar and artist Steve McNiven. He debuted in Wolverine #66 in June 2008. Set over fifty years in the future, the entire United States has been overtaken and divided amongst supervillains. Logan lives with his wife Maureen and young children Scotty and Jade on a barren plot of land in Sacramento, California, now part of the territory known as \\"Hulkland.\\" Logan needs money to pay rent to the landlords of this territory: the hillbilly grandchildren of the Hulk, who are products of years of incestuous procreation originating with Banner and his first cousin She- Hulk. In order to pay the rent, Logan accepts a job from a now-blind Hawkeye: help him navigate east across the country, to the capitol of New Babylon, and deliver a secret and illegal package. Throughout the story it is said that Logan as \\"Wolverine\\" died the day the villains attacked and has refused to pop his claws since, even in a fight. Via flashbacks it is revealed that on the night the world's heroes came under attack by masses of villains, a group consisting of Mr. Sinister, Sabretooth, Dr. Octopus, Omega Red, Bullseye and many others attacked the X-Mansion. Unable to locate his teammates, Wolverine was forced to slaughter the attackers to ensure the safety of the mutant children. As the last attacker was killed, Logan realized that the entire assault was an illusion created by Mysterio, and his perceived enemies were actually his fellow X-Men. This destroyed him emotionally and mentally, and he wandered from the Mansion never to be heard from again, his last action laying his head across train tracks to be run over. Logan notes that while this would never have killed him, it in effect killed \\"Wolverine\\" for good. The story was concluded in Giant Size Old Man Logan (September 2009) with Logan riding off into the sunset, heavily implying that this alternative version of Wolverine is the same character as \\"The Hooded Man\\" version, described above. After the events of The Death of Wolverine story arc, Old Man Logan was brought to serve as a member of the Earth-616 X-Men. Prelude to Deadpool Corps In the second issue, a universe is shown where Wolverine is an orphaned kid at Professor X's orphanage for troubled kids. At a dance for the orphanage, along with Emma Frost's, Wolverine, aided by kid versions of Angel and Colossus, gets into a fight with Kidpool (a kid version of Deadpool for whom Wolverine expresses hatred). In the third issue, Deadpool visits an earth where he is a dog and Wolverine is a dog created by Mascara X to hunt and kill Dog Deadpool, the first dog they experimented on. This universe's Wolverine has claws. After the battle he is shot into a pool of acid, his fate is unknown. Ruins Spending his time in a bar, this version of Wolverine threatened his fellow patrons in order to get more to drink, but more often than not was given free drinks by the bartender for showing off his \\"bone disease\\", bones that stuck out of the back of his hand. The bartender referred to him as \\"Canuck.\\" Spider-Gwen In the Spider-Gwen reality, Logan was a Japanese samurai that was cursed by a witch to continue walking the Earth for as many lives as he's killed. Like his 616 counterpart, his memory is erased after joining the Weapon X program and gaining adamantium claws. He then decides to work for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Black Ops department, where his fellow operatives have nicknamed him \\"Mr. Murderhands.\\" Spider-Gwen nicknames him Wolverine after body swapping with the Earth 616 X-23 (who had the Wolverine identity at the time). He works closely with Shadowcat, as Kitty feels guilty for using her powers to aid the Weapon X Program.Spider-Gwen Vol 2. #20-22 (2017) Spider- Man Unlimited Spider-Man Unlimited (a comic based on the Spider-Man Unlimited animated series) introduces a bestial version of Wolverine in #6. In this continuity, Wolverine is Naoko Yamada-Jones's ex-husband and Shayne's father. Peter first finds a photo of them together, which shows that Wolverine was a decorated soldier. He later runs into Wolverine as Spider-Man and the 2 of them fight, but then stop to talk as they notice a robber kidnapping Naoko. They both follow the robber and manage to easily find him, due to Wolverine's sense of smell. The 2 of them team up to fight the robber, who transforms into a lizard and is revealed to be Chameleon of Counter-Earth. After they defeat him, Wolverine then says that this neighborhood isn't his home anymore and gives Spider-Man his medal, which resembles the medal that Naoko's husband wears in the photo, confirming that Wolverine is Shayne's father and Naoko's ex-husband, despite the Spider-Man Unlimited animated series confirming that the Green Goblin of Counter-Earth is Naoko's ex-husband and Shayne's father, leaving the identity of Naoko's ex-husband and Shayne's father unknown. Ultimate Marvel Ultimate Wolverine is the Wolverine in the Ultimate Marvel universe. Initially, this Wolverine was a member of Magneto's Brotherhood but later changes his mind and joins the Ultimate X-Men. What If? In the second What If? series (1989–1998): *Issue #7, Wolverine was an agent of SHIELD? - Wolverine does not join the X-Men but instead ends up working for Nick Fury. There he becomes Nick's third-in-command after Dugan and helps them against Hydra, A.I.M., and other SHIELD enemies.. When Nick is killed by a Strucker clone, Wolverine takes over as head of SHIELD as Dugan retires. *Issue #16, Wolverine had battled Conan the Barbarian? - During the events of the Dark Phoenix fight on the moon, Wolverine is accidentally transported to Hyboria. There he defeats and falls in love with Red Sonja, while also fighting Conan (cutting his sword hand off) and helping both Hyborians against the sorcerer Zukala. In the end, Conan ends up back in the Marvel universe where he prevents Colossus from knocking Phoenix out (thus ending that particular universe), and Wolverine stays in Hyboria with his new girlfriend Sonja. The classic Conan end crawl changes to \\"Know Ye O prince that in the years following the passage of Conan the cimmerian, There emerged Logan, the wolverine, wild haired, bestial-eyed, magically clawed ...\\" *Issue #24, Wolverine becomes lord of the Vampires? - An alternative story to Uncanny X-Men #159: Instead of defeating Dracula, the X-Men are all turned into vampires. The problem is, Dracula's mind-control abilities don't work on Wolverine, so he promptly kills and feasts on Dracula himself. After drinking Dracula's blood, Wolverine becomes the new Lord of Vampires, leading his vampire X-Men on a killing and feeding spree throughout New York. When the Punisher, aided by Doctor Strange's spirit, inadvertently kills Kitty Pryde, Wolverine kills him, but also recovers his human side and, with the aid of Strange, puts an end to all vampires in New York, including himself, by reciting the Montesi Formula. *Issue #37, Wolverine had been Lord of the Vampires during Inferno? - A sequel of sorts to issue 24, the story diverges once more, with Logan killing the Punisher before he can stop the vampires. Wolverine and his brood must then deal with the events of Inferno. *Issue #43, Wolverine had married Mariko? - Instead of falling apart, the wedding of Logan and Mariko goes off without a hitch and the new couple make it their mission to free Mariko's family from the dreaded Yakuza, which has been taken over by the Kingpin. They are assisted in this by her half-brother, the Silver Samurai, and her cousin Sunfire. Unfortunately, the Silver Samurai turns traitor on them and assassinates Mariko, leaving a desolate Wolverine to return to the X-Men. *Issue #50, Wolverine is killed by the Hulk? - In a post- X-Men battle between Logan and the Hulk, Hulk manages to get so angry that he breaks Wolverine's adamantium spine, killing him instantly. Later, since Wolverine isn't there at a key moment in the Adversary vs. Roma war, the war turns out differently. And as the Hulk goes on a rampage after, there is no one to stop him. Finally Roma magically turns Hulk back into Banner, but by that time most of the heroes are already dead. *Issue #62, Wolverine fights Weapon X? - In this timeline, a drunken and dejected Wolverine was never kidnapped and enhanced in the Weapon X program. Instead, a Canadian Marine was selected but the program left him an insane, uncontrollable killing machine who escapes and kills numerous police and federal agents as well as civilians - pretty much anyone in his path. One of the mounties killed is a friend of Logan's, however, so he offers his services to stop Weapon X. Using an arsenal of weaponry and instinct, Logan disarms and finally kills the rampaging Weapon X before escaping into the woods and later blowing the whole cover on Department H and the Weapon program. *Issue #93, What if Wolverine became savage? - After the failed attempt by Genesis to put the adadmantium back into Wolverine, our hero goes completely berserk and slaughters Genesis and all of his lackeys. It also reduced him to an animalistic savagery and intelligence, however, that he slowly had to nurse himself back out of. This issue shows what might have happened if he never regained his humanity, however - remaining a feral and savage creature who posed a danger to any around him. *Issue #111, What if Wolverine was a Horseman of War? - After the successful attempt by Genesis to put the adamantium back into Wolverine, our hero becomes Apocalypse's Horseman of War with the mission to cull weakness from the earth. Unfortunately, Wolverine is the best at what he does, so he promptly kills Apocalypse and every other super-villain in the Marvel universe before working his way down to any criminal he can find. When the world's superheroes and law enforcement agencies try to stop the murderous War, he turns his attention to them as well - eventually eradicating all of the heroes too. Hundreds of years later, the planetary infrastructure that was set up to protect people from the Horseman of War has made the planet an idyllic paradise. Wolverine, now free again from Apocalypse's programming, lives as a monk named Brother Xavier and teaches the young the dangers of violence and War.What If? (vol. 2) #111 In a recent What If? issue, Logan was present when Daken was born and was able to save him from the people who would have raised him in the original course of events, taking him to live in seclusion in the mountains in the hope that he could raise Daken away from the kind of life he has lived himself. However, despite his attempts to ensure privacy by turning Professor X away when he came to recruit Logan to join the X-Men, Logan's attempts to suppress Daken's darker instincts failed when Sabretooth found them, revealing the truth about his father's past to Daken. Leaving his father, Daken became a brutal killer, roaming various cities and killing his opponents, proclaiming that Logan made him what he is by denying him his heritage. Concluding that he will never bring anything good into the world, Logan stabs Daken in the heart with the Muramasa Blade, subsequently impaling himself to end his own dark stain on the world. Wolverine MAX Wolverine is a lone survivor of a fatal plane crash. The law seems to think he's responsible for it. A mysterious woman who was a survivor of the plane crash, was eaten by a shark only to be seen by Logan later on television. In the flashbacks, he was a man on his way to the West to find peace within himself. He is also approached by Victor who claims he's the same as Logan and they don 't have to be alone anymore.Wolverine: Max #1 Logan finds a lead leading him to a restaurant in the Roppongi district of Tokyo. He finds out he goes by another alias named Collinsworth. The mysterious woman's name turns out to be Yami. It also seems that he has numerous apartments and buildings in Tokyo as well. In his apartment, he observes some things and opens a safe with claws. It turns out he has a ton of fake identities. As he takes the subway, there is a flashback when a woman approaches him and makes conversation. Turns out Logan is a monk and is Canadian. She asks him to walk her home. Her name is Mariko Yashida. After she leaves, Victor approaches him jokes about how Logan is coming out of his shell and is acting like the Logan he heard about back in Canada. Victor then explains to him that outside of the monastery the country is in chaos. He also explains that guys like him and Logan are in demand because there are no others like them.

Wolverine vs the Marvel Universe In this reality, the Punisher had unknowingly released an unstoppable plague which turns anyone infected into homicidal cannibals after stopping a potential weapons deal involving the Russian Mob. A few weeks later, Wolverine and Colossus are horrified after witnessing Spider- Man kill and eat the Rhino. Later during a mission against Hydra with Psylocke, Wolverine holds off the enemy forces while Psylocke attempts to get away, but she is taken by an unknown assailant who leaves her severed arm behind. Wolverine decides to stay investigate Psylocke's disappearance and the cause of the growing pandemic, witnessing the horrid acts of violence and cannibalism over the city. He is eventually contacted by the X-Men to help investigate Angel's disappearance after the later was supposed to bring lab equipment for Hank McCoy, who along with Reed Richards, Hank Pym, and T'Challa, are trying to develop a cure for the plague. After killing an infected Doctor Octopus, Wolverine finds the Black Bird and an infected Angel, who he is forced to kill. Deducing that the plague may have reached Utopia, Wolverine takes the Black Bird back to Utopia and discovers that all the X-Men have been infected. Unable to save them, Wolverine kills all the X-Men on Utopia. X-Men film series An alternate version of Wolverine is introduced in X-Men: Days of Future Past portrayed by Hugh Jackman. The original timeline Wolverine's consciousness is sent back in time to possess his 1973 self to prevent the apocalyptic future he inhabits. With the help of a younger Charles Xavier and Hank McCoy, they are able to prevent Mystique from assassinating Bolivar Trask, the event that would've led to the Sentinel-ruled future. At the end of the film, the original timeline is erased and Wolverine returns to a changed future while his younger self regains consciousness and has no memory of anything that happened. By 2023, around the time Logan would've been sent back in time in the original timeline, Logan is shown to have joined the X-Men and had become a history teacher at the Xavier Institute. He encounters Charles Xavier who recognizes that the Logan whom traveled back in time to save the future had returned to himself once again. By 2029, Logan, his healing factor failing, works as a limo driver caring for Xavier after he had developed dementia and suffered a seizure, releasing a powerful wave of his telepathic powers that resulted in the deaths of six hundred people, including several of the X-Men. X-Men Forever In an alternative reality continuing writer Chris Claremont's run from \\"Uncanny X-Men\\" Wolverine and Jean Grey have begun a secret psychic affair, though Jean remains with Scott for the time being, the professional aspects of the relationship has enough physical subtleties to be recognised by Kitty Pryde. After Nick Fury decrees that The X-Men must work closer with the government, an incensed Logan goes AWOL, but keeps in touch with Jean. Logan is later killed by Storm, who appears to have become evil and turned against the X-Men. His death sends Jean into a temporary coma. When she awakens, an enraged Jean is no longer able nor willing to hide her true feelings for Wolverine. Following the revelation of Storm's involvement in Wolverine's death, Storm is attacked by Shadowcat (who, due to an earlier phasing mishap, has acquired one of Wolverine's adamantium claws in her arm). Storm escapes and is revealed to be working for a shadowy, previously unknown group called \\"The Consortium\\". While the X-Men search New York for Storm, another younger version of Storm with short hair appears, and finds Gambit; she implies that she had been kidnapped, with Wolverine having freed her before his death. Around the same time, the older version of Storm is seemingly killed by a team of commandos from the Consortium. In this universe Sabretooth implies, after Wolverine's death, that Logan was his son, and that he wanted revenge on Storm for having killed him. X-Men: The End In the alternative future of X-Men: The End, Wolverine is caring for a crippled Storm and has given up his life as an X-Man. However, after being attacked by a Warskrull, Wolverine and Storm return to the X-Men only to find a crater where the mansion stood. Wolverine along with Rachel Summers, X-23 and a few others were sent to find out what happened to Cable and his team. Wolverine and Jean Grey/Phoenix meet up again. Jean helps Logan break free of the Lady Mastermind and later helps him heal.

Biography Born in Transylvania in Romania, Hendel made aliyah in 1959 and in his military service he served as a Gadna instructor. In his reserve duty he served as part of a reconnaissance unit in the Israeli Artillery Corps and took part in the Yom Kippur War. In 1977, he moved with his family to the Israeli settlement of Ganei Tal, part of the Gush Katif bloc in the Gaza Strip. Political career In the early 1990s, Hendel was elected to the head of the Hof Aza Regional Council, and was first elected to the 14th Knesset in 1996 as a National Religious Party representative. Towards the end of his term, he left the party along with Hanan Porat and formed the \\"Emunim\\" faction, which soon after changed its name to Tkuma. As part the Tkuma party, he joined the National Union list, and was elected to the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth Knessets. In the 15th Knesset, he served as chairman of the Aliyah, Absorption, and Diaspora committee. During Ariel Sharon's second term as Prime Minister of Israel, Hendel served as Deputy Minister of Education, Culture, and Sports until the National Union party was dismissed from the coalition on 6 June 2004 prior to a vote on the disengagement plan. A significant part of his parliamentary career was devoted to efforts for the residents of Gush Katif (where he himself resided), and strengthening the right wing in the Knesset. In this context, he also coined the phrase \\"כעומק החקירה, כך עומק העקירה\\" (\\"As deep the investigation is, so is the uprooting\\"), commenting on the legal investigations ongoing against Sharon at the same time Sharon changed his political views and decided on the Disengagement Plan. Hendel also served as head of the Agricultural caucus in the Knesset. In 2005, Hendel was evicted from his home along with fellow residents of Ganei Tal as part of the Disengagement Plan. Him and his family's dealing with the eviction was the subject of the documentaries \\"Katif\\", and \\"Last Katif\\". In 2006, Hendel submitted a bill proposal that would tie an oath of loyalty to \\"a Jewish and democratic Israel\\" and to the laws of Israel, to the right to vote. The Bill was turned down by a vote of 45-17.Knesset rejects proposal requiring voter loyalty to state Haaretz, 18 October 2006 He lost his seat in the 2009 elections.

The Jun dimerization protein is a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors. JDP 2 was found by a Sos-recruitment system, to dimerize with c-Jun to repress AP-1-mediated activation. It was later identified by the yeast-two hybrid system to bind to activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) to repress ATF-mediated transcriptional activation. JDP2 regulates 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response element (TRE)- and cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-dependent transcription. The JDP2 gene is located on human chromosome 14q24.3 (46.4 kb, 75,427,715 bp to 75,474,111 bp) and mouse chromosome 12 (39 kb, 85,599,105 bp to 85,639,878 bp), which is located at about 250 kbp in the Fos-JDP2-BATF locus. Alternative splicing of JDP2 generates at least two isoforms. The protein JDP2 has 163 amino acids, belongs to the family of basic leucine zipper (bZIP), and shows high homology with the ATF3 bZIP domain. The bZIP domain includes the amino acids from position 72 to 135, the basic motif from position 74 to 96, and the leucine zipper from 100 to 128. The molecular weight of the canonical JDP2 is 18,704 Da. The histone-binding region is located from position 35 to 72 and the inhibition of the histone acetyltransferase (INHAT) region is from position 35 to 135, which is located before the DNA-binding domain. JDP2 is expressed ubiquitously but is detected mainly in the cerebellum, brain, lung, and testis. A JDP2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected in Japanese, Korean, and Dutch cohorts, and is associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms.  Posttranscriptional and post translational modifications  Phosphorylation of the threonine (Thr) residue at position 148 is mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (MAPK8; JNK1) and p38 MAPK. Phosphorylated ATF2 inhibits the formation with JDP2 in vitro while phosphorylated JDP2 undergoes proteosomal degradation. It contains putative SUMO modification of lysine (Lys) residue at position 65, and recruits interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 1 (IRF2BP1), which acts as an E3 ligase. Phosphorylation of Thr at position 148 is detected in response to various stress conditions such as UV irradiation, oxidative stress, and anisomycin treatment or JDP2 is also regulated by other kinases such as p38 MAPK and doublecortin like protein kinase. Polyubiquitination of JDP2 protein is induced by IRF2BP1. JDP2 displays histone-binding and histone-chaperone activity. and inhibition of p300/CBP induced histone acetylation (INHAT). JDP2 recruits histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, HDAC6 and HDAC3. JDP2 has INHAT activity and inhibits histone methylation in vitro.  Function   Phenotypes of gene knockout and transgenic mice  Gene knockout mice have a shorter tail, are smaller, have low neutrophil count. and cell proliferation, and commit to cell cycle arrest because of AP-1 repression. TransgenicJDP2 mice display atrial dilation and myocardial hypertrophy.  Dimer formation and interacting molecules  JDP2 functions as a transcription activator or repressor depending on the leucine zipper protein member it is associated with. JDP2 forms a homodimer or heterodimer with c-Jun, JUNB, JUND, Fra2, ATF2. and acts as a general repressor. On the other hand, JDP2 form a stable heterodimer with CHOP10 to enhance TRE- but not CRE-dependent transcription. In addition, JDP2 has been shown to directly associate with the progesterone receptor (PR) and functionally acts as a coactivator of progesterone-dependent PR-mediated gene transcription. Other proteins such as interferon regulatory factor-2-binding protein-1 (IRF2BP1). CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein gamma (C/EBPγ), HDAC3 and HDAC6 have also been demonstrated to associate with JDP2.  Cell differentiation  JDP2 plays a role in cell differentiation in several systems. Ectopic expression of JDP2 inhibits the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 cells and adipocyte differentiation. By contrast, JDP2 induces terminal muscle cell differentiation in C2 myoblasts and reduces the tumorigenicity of rhabdomyosarcoma cells and restored their ability to differentiate into myotubes. It is also reported that JDP2 plays an important role in the RANK-mediated osteoclast differentiation. Further, JDP2 is involved in neutrophil differentiation and transcription factor Tbx3-mediated osteoclastogenesis for host defense and bone homeostasis. Methylome mapping suggests that JDP2 plays a role in cell progenitor differentiation of megakaryocytes.  Regulation of cell cycle and p53 signaling  JDP2 induces cell cycle arrest through cyclin D, p53, and cyclin A transcription, by increasing JUNB, JUND, and Fra2, and by decreasing c-JUN through the loss of p27kip1. JDP2 downregulates p53 transcription, which promotes leukemogenesis. Mouse p53 protein negatively regulates the JDP2 promoter in F9 cells as part of the JDP2˗p53 autoregulatory circuit. By contrast, JDP2-knockout mice exhibit in downregulation of p53 and p21 proteins.  Apoptosis and senescence  JDP2 appears to be involved in the inhibition of apoptosis. Depletion of JDP2 induces cell death similar to apoptosis. A study also demonstrated that UV irradiation induces JDP2 expression, which in turn down-regulates expression of p53 and thereby protects cells from UV-mediated programmed cell death. Heart-specific JDP2 overexpression protects cardiomyocytes against hypertrophic growth and TGFβ–induced apoptosis. In other settings, JDP2 has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of cellular senescence. JDP2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to replicative senescence by recruiting polycomb-repressive complexes (PRC1 and PRC2) to the promoters at the p16Ink4a locus.  Oxidative stress and antioxidative response  The increased accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 8-oxo-dGuo, one of the major products of DNA oxidation, and the reduced expression of several transcripts involved in ROS metabolism in Jdp2-deficient MEFs argue that JDP2 is required to hold ROS levels in check. Furthermore, JDP2 binds directly to the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) core sequence, associates with Nrf2 and MafK (Nrf2–MafK) via basic leucine zipper domains, and increases DNA-binding activity of the Nrf2–MafK complex to the ARE and the transcription of ARE- dependent genes such as HO1 and NQO1. Therefore, JDP2 functions as an integral component of the Nrf2–MafK complex to modulate antioxidant and detoxification programs.  Nuclear reprogramming  JDP2, which has been shown to regulate Wnt signaling pathway and prevent ROS production, may play roles in cell reprogramming. Indeed, a study demonstrated that DAOY medulloblastoma cells can be reprogrammed successfully by JDP2 and the defined factor OCT4 to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-like cells. This iPSC-like cells expressed stem cell-like characteristics including alkaline phosphatase activity and some stem cell markers, including SSEA3, SSEA4 and Tra-1-60. Later, another study also showed that JDP2 can substitute Oct4 to generate iPSCs with Klf4, Sox2 and Myc (KSM) or KS from somatic cells. Moreover, they showed that JDP2 anchors five non-Yamanaka factors (ID1, JHDM1B, LRH1, SALL4, and GLIS1) to reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts into iPSCs.  Oncogene or tumor suppressor gene  JDP2 may act as a double-edge sword in tumorigenesis. It is reported that JDP2 inhibits Ras-dependent cell transformation in NIH3T3 cells and tumor development in xenografts transplanted into SCID mice. Constitutive expression of JDP2 in rhabdomyosarcoma cells reduced their tumorigenic characteristics. On the other hand, JDP2 induces partial oncogenic transformation of chicken embryonic fibroblasts. Studies using high throughput viral insertional mutagenesis analysis also revealed that JDP2 functions as an oncogene. JDP2-transgenic mice display potentiation of liver cancer, higher mortality and increase number and size of tumors, especially when JDP2 expression is at the promotion stage.  Cancer and disease markers  JDP2 shows the gene amplification of head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma. In pancreatic carcinoma, downregulation of JDP2 is correlated with lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis and strongly associated with the post- surgery survival time, indicating that JDP2 may serve as a biomarker to predict the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. In addition, JDP2 overexpression reverses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by co-treatment with TGF-β1 and EGF in human pancreatic BxPC-3 cells, suggesting that JDP2 may be a molecular target for pancreatic carcinoma intervention. Furthermore, it has been shown that the expression level of JDP2 gene upon acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is highly specific and a sensitive biomarker for predicting heart failure.  JDP2 targets and JDP2-regulated genes  JDP2 is involved in the modulation of gene expression. For example, JDP2 regulates MyoD gene expression with c-Jun and gene for galectin-7. JDP2 functionally associated with HDAC3 and acts as a repressor to inhibit the amino acid regulation of CHOP transcription. JDP2 and ATF3 are involved in recruiting HDACs to the ATF3 promoter region resulting in transcriptional repression of ATF3. JDP2 inhibits the promoter of the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) immediate early gene BZLF1 for the regulation of the latent-lytic switch in EBV infection.  Interactions  JDP2 (gene) has been shown to interact with Activating transcription factor 2.

Once found all around the New Zealand coast, it is now restricted to a few offshore islands. It is one of the world's rarest shorebirds: the population is roughly 200.  Taxonomy  Initially classified in the common plover genus Charadrius, the shore plover is currently placed in Thinornis along with one other species, the hooded plover (T. cucullatus). Thinornis rossii, supposedly from the Auckland Islands, is now generally considered to be a juvenile shore plover with an incorrectly recorded location. Some authorities consider the shore plover a species of Charadrius, and further genetic evidence will be needed to resolve the issue.  Description  alt=Image of Shore plover juvenile Thinornis novaeseelandiae is brown above and white below, with a black (male) or brown (female) mask. There is a distinctive white strip circling its head below its brown skullcap. Its legs and dark-tipped bill are orange, brighter in males.  Distribution  Although this species was historically found only on the New Zealand coast, subfossil shore plover bones have been recovered from roosts of the extinct laughing owl near rivers many kilometres inland. Cook's second expedition collected them from opposite ends of the South Island, in Fiordland and the Marlborough Sounds. There are 19th century reports of shore plovers from the South Island and several parts of the North Island, but by the 1870s they had vanished from the mainland, surviving only on the Chatham Islands. Introduced predators such as feral cats and Norway rats were the main culprits.  Breeding  Thinornis novaeseelandia egg, Auckland Museum collection Shore plovers (unusually for shorebirds) nest under cover (such as driftwood and vegetation) or in burrows under boulders. This is likely to be for protection against avian predators – in their current range, skuas, and past predators would have included the laughing owl and the New Zealand falcon. This is one of the reasons for their decline, as such nests are more vulnerable to mammalian predators. In the early 1990s, the Department of Conservation (DOC) started a captive breeding programme at Pukaha Mt Bruce Wildlife Centre, and later at Isaac Conservation and Wildlife Trust. From a captive population of around 6–10 pairs, over 400 captive-bred juveniles have been released into the wild.  Conservation  Shore plovers are endangered, with a world population of around 200 birds. The species survived on only one island, Rangatira, in the Chatham Islands, from where it has since been introduced to other offshore islands, such as Mangere Island in the Chathams, Mana Island near Wellington and Motutapu near Auckland. The world population was roughly 70 breeding pairs in 1937 and their habitat was declared a reserve in 1954. The population fluctuated in the 1980s, with only 40 breeding pairs in 1982, rising to 80 pairs in 1987 and a high of 94 pairs in 2010. A second wild population of about 20 birds was discovered in 1999 living on Western Reef off Chatham Island, but it gradually declined, and the last bird was taken into captivity in 2003. As of 2016, the wild population comprised 66 breeding pairs, 56 of them in the Chatham Islands. DOC has a stated goal of increasing the population to 250 in five different habitats. DOC moved a number of captive-reared juveniles to Mana Island, off Wellington's western coast, between March and May 2007. They bred within months of their arrival, and in February 2008 twenty more were translocated. From a high of 87 individuals, the population was reduced to just 10 from the effects of a single Norway rat. Birds had also been translocated since 2000 to Waikawa (Portland Island), a privately owned island off the Mahia Peninsula in Hawke's Bay. In 2012, the population on Waikawa was discovered to have crashed by 75% to just 20 birds, apparently due to predation by a Norway rat. Twelve eggs were rescued for translocation to Mana Island. A total of 42 captive-bred shore plovers were released onto Motutapu Island in 2012 in the hope they would become established there and on other pest-free islands in the Hauraki Gulf. The birds repeatedly flew away, and only five were still present in 2015 when nineteen more were released. Motutapu had its mammalian pests removed in 2010, and the breeding population there increased from one pair in 2015 to three pairs in 2016. These birds are currently the most accessible to the public. Six juveniles were released into the wild in 2018. Four additional juveniles were released in February 2019 with a further 21 due to be released on 25 March, having been bred at the Pūkaha National Wildlife Centre. Five more juvenile birds were transported from a captive breeding program in Christchurch to Mana Island in April 2020 during the COVID19 lockdown.

Bordering Nigeria, it is considered one of the wettest parts of Africa and records Africa's second highest concentration of biodiversity. To preserve its wildlife, Cameroon has more than 20 protected reserves comprising national parks, zoos, forest reserves and sanctuaries. The protected areas were first created in the northern region under the colonial administration in 1932; the first two reserves established were Mozogo Gokoro Reserve and the Bénoué Reserve, which was followed by the Waza Reserve on 24 March 1934. The coverage of reserves was initially about 4 percent of the country's area, rising to 12 percent; the administration proposes to cover 30 percent of the land area. The rich wildlife consists of 8,260 recorded plant species including 156 endemic species, 409 species of mammals of which 14 are endemic, 690 species of birds which includes 8 endemic species, 250 species of reptiles, and 200 species of amphibians. The habitats of these species include the southern region comprising tropical lowland, coastline on the Gulf of Guinea. Mangroves forests, in size, are along the coast line. Montane forests and savannahs are in the northern region of the country. Important protected areas for these species are the Mbam Djerem National Park, Benoue National Park, Korup National Park, Takamanda National Park, and the Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary. Cameroon is an important breeding area for marine and freshwater species such as crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and birds. Geography East Province of Cameroon The topography of the country extends from the coastline to hill regions with elevations of up to . The habitat consists of three regions. These are: The dense rainforests in the southern region in the hot and humid climatic conditions; the central region of semi-deciduous forests; and the northern region consisting of semi-deciduous forests of wooded savanna with scattered trees. The climatic conditions are of low to highland with equatorial to tropical climate. Initial coverage of protected areas was in savanna region but it now covers all the ten provinces of the country with all the diversity of its topographic, climatic, hydrological biological features. alt=highlands The highest mountain the country is the Mount Cameroon with an elevation of . It is located in southwestern Cameroon in the coastal zone close to the Nigerian border. The total forest area coverage is reported to be of which of closed forest and is fragmented forest or degraded forests accounting for 27 percent of the total forest area. The forests are also categorized as part of the \\"Congolian Coastal Forests, Western Congo Basin Forests, Sudanian Savannas, Sahelian Flooded Savannas, Gulf of Guinea Rivers and Crater Lakes, Guinean-Congolian Coast Mangroves, and Gulf of Guinea Marine Ecosystems.\\" One of the important regions is the Cameroonian Highlands forests which extends across the Cameroon Highlands, covering an area of in western Cameroon and eastern Nigeria. The ecoregion lies above elevation, and is surrounded at lower elevations by the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests at the southern end of the range, and by forest-savanna mosaic along the central and northern ends of the range; the Cameroon Highlands form the boundary between the Guinean and Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic ecoregions, consisting of sub-montane to montane forests and finally sub alpine grasslands. The region is categorized as critical/endangered, but the area under full protection is not great. The area is subject to intense population pressure and conversion of forest lands into agricultural areas. The Dja River which drains the Dja Faunal Reserve joins the Sangha River. As part of the Congo Basin, the Sangha River, drained by the tributaries rising in the northern humid region, and flowing into the southern region of the country, is the main water catchment. At the swampy estuary it forms several branches, and is also joined by the Likouala aux Herbes, Likouala, and Ubangi (Oubangui) rivers. Another major river, which joins the Sangha River, is the Dja River, which rises in west-central Africa and flows forming the border between Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo, and through the Dja Faunal Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The major river drainage is the Chari subbasin of the Congo Basin, which covers Cameroon and the Central African Republic. It drains into the Atlantic Ocean. Protected areas Many protected areas are still in \\"pristine\\" condition, mostly because there is less tourism in Cameroon than other regions of Africa. According to reported statistics, there were ten protected areas from 1932 to 1960. 6 protected areas were added between 1960 and 1980, 5 more were added between 1980 and 2004, and 8 protected areas are under consideration within a final approval process. Korup became a National Park in 1982. The protected areas cover of which (81 percent) is part of the border protected area. The distribution of this protected area within Cameroon covers: The Lowland forest zones of Dja () with corridors connecting to the Nki and Minkébé protected areas, the Nki National Park covering with ecological corridors to Dja and Boumba–Bek, the Boumba Bek National Park covering , and the Lobéké National Park covering (integrated with the Trinational Park of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Republic of Congo and linked with an Eco-corridor to Boumba–Bek Reserve; the Campo Ma'an National Park of , which borders with the Rio de Campo of Equatorial Guinea; and the Savanna Zone comprising the Waza National Park of near Chad border, Faro National Park of area with common boundary with Nigeria, and the Kalamaloué National Park of on the Chad border. Falling Waters in KORUP National park Cameroon's first protected area in the northern part of the country was established in 1932 under the French colonial administration of the black francophone Africa. The first forest reserve created was the Mozogo Gokoro Reserve 12 June 1932 and the second in the same year was the Benue Reserve on 19 November 1932. The third reserve, the Waza Reserve was established on 24 March 1934, initially covering an area of which was extended in 1935 to cover ; this is one of the most popular reserves in the country. Until 1975, there were 9 protected areas with greater focus on the north than the south. Following the Earth Summit of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil in 1992, the number of protected areas increased substantially and were well distributed covering all the ten provinces of the country in widely differing topographic, climatic, hydrological and biological conditions. There are 20 protected reserves which include national parks, zoos, forest reserves and sanctuaries. Flora Gymnosiphon bekensis The vegetation varies with elevation. Submontane forests extend from 900 to 1800 meters (3000 to 6000 ft) elevation. Above 1800 meters (6000 ft) elevation are distinct montane forests and patches of montane grassland, bamboo forest, and subalpine grasslands and shrub lands. The ecoregion is characterized by the presence of afromontane species, which have an archipelago-like distribution across the highlands of Africa. Typical afromontane species are Nuxia congesta, Podocarpus latifolius, Prunus africana, Rapanea melanophloeos, and Syzygium guineense bamendae. The evergreen trees found in the rainforests are mahogany, ebony, obeche, dibetu, and sapelli; the trees grow to heights of 200 feet. The trees are also covered with mosses, lichens, and other epiphytes. In the drier woodlands above the rain forests are the tall grasslands and also some areas covered with mountain bamboo. In elevations between 2,400 m and 3,000 m, short grasses are the dominant species, particularly in the region of Mount Cameroon. Fauna Leatherback turtle The most endangered species is the Cross River gorilla, a great ape, whose last reported count was 300, spread over 11 scattered sites both in Cameroon and Nigeria. For preservation of this species of ape, the Kagwene Gorilla Sanctuary and the Takamanda National Park have been specifically established in Cameroon. Elephants migrate between the Lake Chad region in Chad and Cameroon; 300 to 400 elephants are reported to live here. In the dense forest areas of the rainforest ecoregion the fauna commonly reported are; red and green monkeys, chimpanzees, mandrills, rodents, bats, and large number of birds like the small sunbirds, giant hawks and eagles. Elephants are also reported in small numbers. The grassy woodlands have baboons and many species of antelope. ;Reptiles Python sebae Prominent reptiles reported include the African rock python (Python sebae), the green bush viper (Atheris squamigera) and the African slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops cataphractus). Marine turtles reported near the coasts of Cameroon in the Atlantic Ocean are the loggerhead (Caretta caretta), Atlantic green (Chelonias mydas), leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), and the olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea). Cameroon has enacted legislation to protect all these species of turtles. Olive ridley, leatherback, and green turtles are reported to nest on the sandy shoreline between Equatorial Guinea and the Wouri Estuary in Cameroon during November to January. ;Mammals Cross River gorilla Primates reported are: De Brazza's monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus), the black colobus (Colobus satanas); the patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas); the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla); the Angolan colobus (Colobus angolensis); the moustached monkey (Cercopithecus cephus); the Gabon bushbaby (Galago gabonensis); the mona monkey (Cercopithecus mona); and the western needle-clawed galago (Euoticus elegantulus). The Cross River gorilla is the most endangered African ape subspecies. Eleven small mammal species are endemic to the ecoregion: Eisentraut's striped mouse (Hybomys eisentrauti), the African wood mouse (Hylomyscus grandis), the Mount Oku rat (Lamottemys okuensis), Mittendorf's striped grass mouse (Lemniscomys mittendorfi), two brush-furred mouse species (Lophuromys dieterleni) and (Lophuromys eisentrauti), the Oku mouse shrew (Myosorex okuensis), the Rumpi mouse shrew (M. rumpii), the western vlei rat (Otomys occidentalis), Hartwig's soft-furred mouse (Praomys hartwigi), and Isabella's shrew (Sylvisorex isabellae). Other small mammals present include Stuhlmann's golden mole (Chrysochloris stuhlmanni); the long-tailed pangolin (Manis tetradactyla) and the African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis). Rodents include the lesser cane rat (Thryonomys gregorianus); Dendromurinae (African climbing mice, fat mice, tree mice, and relatives), and Otomyinae (vlei rats and whistling rats). Bats include the lesser woolly bat (Kerivoula lanosa) and Franquet's epauletted bat (Epomops franqueti). In Cameroon, a range of cetacean species such as humpback whale, right whale, sperm whale, fin whale, sei whale, killer whale, and dolphins are reported on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. The African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) is also present. The Central African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii) and West African wild dog (Lycaon pictus manguensis) were declared extinct from Cameroon in 2010. ;Avifauna Laniarius atroflavus Cameroon has more than 900 bird species which belong to 76 families. Of these 7 are endemic species and 20 are specialty species. With this rich reporting of birds, they are categorized as resident birds (found throughout the year), breeding birds (which breed during the season), and migrants birds found only during specific the seasons and wintering birds which resided here during winter away from the colder regions of the north. Though the ecoregion is rich in bird species, birdwatching is a very limited activity here. The nearby Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests ecoregion is also known for the endemic species. The seven endemic species are: the Bamenda apalis (Apalis bamendae), Bangwa forest warbler (Bradypterus bangwaensis), white-throated mountain-babbler (Kupeornis gilberti), banded wattle-eye (Platysteira laticincta), Bannerman's weaver (Ploceus bannermani), Bannerman's turaco (Tauraco bannermani), and Mt. Kupe bushshrike (Telophorus kupeensis). Fourteen species are endemic to the Cameroon Highlands forests and Mt. Cameroon: Andropadus montanus, Phyllastrephus poliocephalus, Laniarius atroflavus, Malaconotus gladiator, Cossypha isabellae and the subspecies Cisticola chubbi discolor (sometimes considered a separate species C. discolor. Nine more montane endemic species are shared with Mt. Cameroon and Bioko: Psalidoprocne fuliginosa, Andropadus tephrolaemus, Phyllastrephus poensis, Phylloscopus herberti, Urolais epichlora, Poliolais lopezi, Nectarinia oritis, Nectarinia ursulae and Nesocharis shelleyi. ;Molluscs Radix natalensis shell Some of the non-marine molluscs species found in the wild in Cameroon are: Bulinus camerunensis, an endangered species found in western Cameroon from Barombi Koto and Debundsha, both crater lakes; Lymnaea natalensis, a species of least concern; and Sinistrexcisa, a new genus of land snail with four new species. Endangered species The ecoregion is home to several critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable species of animals. These are the following. *The critically endangered species are: black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), Eisentraut's shrew (Crocidura eisentrauti) also endemic, pitch shrew (Crocidura picea) also endemic, and Rumpi mouse shrew (Myosorex rumpii) also endemic.

Threats The wildlife is under threat due to many factors. These are: conversion of forest land for agricultural use on account of their rich soil derived from volcanic rocks; pressure to meet firewood requirements; forest fires, particularly in grass land areas; the development of industrial complexes hydro-electric power plants and bauxite mining and forest land slotted for the purpose; as well as hunting. Forest loss in the Bamenda-Banso Highlands and also to certain degree in the Obudu Plateau is reported as more than 50% since the 1960s because of conversion to agricultural lands and good rainfall conditions. Hunting is recorded in the cross border regions of Cameroon. Trading in bush meat is common in the Sangha River Region; bush meat trade is reported to be concurrent with the logging operations. Hunting for ivory, skins and other animal parts is also reported in many national park areas in Cameroon, from within the country and also from cross border poachers. Conservation Many NGOs are working in Cameroon for the conservation and preservation of wild life. The Sangha Tri National Landscape. The park is labelled. Conservation efforts in the Sangha River Tri-national Protected Area are in place in a trans-boundary program sponsored by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) with participation by the Central African Republic, the Congo and the Cameroon. This covers a total area of 2,800,000 ha (6,918,951 acres) encompassing the Dzanga Sangha Special Reserve (the second largest area in the world) in the Central African Republic, which incorporates within its ambit the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park in the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) and the Lobéké National Park in Cameroon. Appropriate actions are under implementation in respect of anti-poaching, research and the promotion of tourism to the rain forests (the mammal species of particular interest are elephants, apes, ranging from western lowland gorilla to chimpanzees and bongo). The three park-administrations and the prefects of the three countries meet often to ensure proper monitoring of the conservation activities. Patrolling of the parks is a regular joint effort to prevent poaching, smuggling of ivory and unauthorized fishing and carriage of fire arms in the reserve park The German Cooperation of Technical Collaboration (GTC) in Central African Republic and Cameroon, and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS - New York) in the Congo are providing large funds for conservation of the parks. A particular success story of the enabled protection, particularly in the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park is of the special group of 'eco-guards', who operate under the MFEE (Ministry of Forestry Economy and the Environment), unlike the past practice of deploying rangers, which is reported to have stopped illegal human activities taking place in the park such as poaching. Ape Action Africa is one such non-profit NGO which was established in 1996 with the primary objective of conservation of endangered gorillas and chimpanzees, which are threatened by the bushmeat trade in Central and West Africa. The NGO not only helps in the rescue and rehabilitation of great apes but also helps in management of a large sanctuary in the Mefou forest.

Some of these productions go on to successful subsequent runs in Hong Kong and overseas. In 2008, the HKAF commissioned and produced the production, Titus Andronicus by William Shakespeare for the 36th HKAF as part of its New Works series, and was later featured in a second run in the 40th HKAF in 2012 before participating in Globe to Globe, a World Shakespeare Festival at the Globe Theatre in London in which 37 of Shakespeare’s plays were performed in different languages. This was the first Cantonese production to be performed at the Globe. The HKAF in 2014 featured FILTH by Jingan Young, the first English language play ever commissioned by the festival. In 2013, the 41st HKAF commissioned the New Stage Series, Heart of Coral, a chamber opera about the life of Xiao Hong, one of the most celebrated female Chinese writers. The opera production was later featured in Taiwan at \\"Hong Kong Week 2014 @ Taipei\\" as part of a cultural exchange organized by the Hong Kong-Taiwan Cultural Co-operation Committee. The Crowd, another HKAF commissioned production which is written by Shanghai-based writer Yu Rongjun and directed by Hong Kong theater director, Tang Wai-kit for the HKAF in 2015 was also performed in Shanghai in April 2015. Co-commissioned by the HKAF and the Shakespeare’s Globe, renowned Hong Kong theatre director Tang Shu-wing premiered his Cantonese production of Macbeth at the Globe Theatre in London in August 2015, 4 years after the debut of his production of Titus Andronicus as part of the Globe to Globe initiative. Macbeth was then staged at the 44th HKAF.

The wetter climate of the interior and the eastern coast contrasts with the dryer one in the south/southwest coast The wildlife of Cape Verde is spread over its archipelago of ten islands and three islets, which all have parks under their jurisdiction by decree promulgated by the Cape Verde government. Located off the west coast of Africa, the total land area of the island nation is . The wildlife consists of many tropical dry forest and shrub land, endemic flora and fauna, and rare breeding seabirds and plants, which are unique to this group of islands. Some of the wildlife species of Cape Verde are considered as endemic, evolving over millions of years of isolation; the grey-headed kingfisher (Halcyon leucocephala) survived here on insects in the absence of water in the lands of the islands. In the process of development, many lands in the islands were converted to agricultural fields and several hundred varieties of herbaceous plant and tree species were introduced, resulting in depletion of the original vegetation. However, efforts are now underway at reforestation to improve the wildlife of Cape Verde, with reported planting of three million new trees every year (about 7000 per day), with pine, oak, sweet chestnut and acacia as the prominent varieties being planted. Cape Verde is also one of the world's top ten coral reef Biodiversity hotspots. Geography Map of Cape Verde The Cape Verde archipelago, a cluster of 10 islands and three islets located in the eastern Atlantic Ocean at a distance of off the coast of Senegal in West Africa, are volcanic in origin. Cape Verde is divided into two areas: the southern leeward islands known as the Sotavento Islands and the windward islands known as the Barlavento Islands in the north; Santo Antão, São Vicente, Santa Luzia, São Nicolau, Sal, and Boa Vista, and the Sotavento Islands of Maio, Santiago (the largest with an area of 991 km2), Fogo (with the only active volcano), and Brava. Nine of these islands which are inhabited have mountainous areas whereas the other islands have flat topography with sandy beaches. There are trees typical of both temperate and tropical climates, depending on elevation, which have created different types of flora and fauna. Given its geographical isolation, it exhibits a unique ecoregion with endemic plant and vertebrate species, particularly birds and reptiles. It is also inferred that arid climate with no sources of surface fresh water and geographic remoteness are the reasons for the islands limited wildlife diversity. As of 2003, there were 48 protected areas covering 0.3% of the islands land mass. The Cape Verde islands are a very degraded area. Due to proximity to the Sahara, most of the Cape Verde islands are dry, but on islands with high mountains and farther away from the coast, the humidity is much higher, giving a rainforest habitat that is very degraded by the strong human presence. Northeastern slopes of high mountains often receive a lot of rain while Southwest slopes are much drier. This umbria areas are identified with cool and moisture. Some islands, as Santiago with steep mountains, are covered with vegetation where the dense moisture condenses and soaks the plants, rocks, soil, logs, moss etc. The laurel forest is a type of cloud forest that has developed on mountains, where the dense moisture from the sea or ocean, is precipitated by the action of the relief. The terrain forces up wet and warm air masses, which cool and decreases the dew point, causing moisture to condense and fall as rain or fog. This creates a habitat that is cool, saturating air and soil with moisture. The sand desert Viana on the island of Boa Vista, surrounded by rock desert Boa Vista landscape Protected areas The protected areas declared under the Official Gazette of Cape Verde, in February 2003 are: In Santo Antão Island the protected areas are Moroços – Natural Park, Cova/Ribeira Paúl/Torre – Natural Park, Cruzinha – Natural Reserve, Pombas – Protected Landscape and Tope de Coroa – Natural Park. São Vicente Island has the Monte Verde – Natural Park. Branco and Raso Islets – Integrated Reserve is the natural reserve in Santa Luzia Island. São Nicolau Island has Monte Gordo Natural Park and Monte do Alto das Cabaças Natural Reserve. Sal Island has 11 protected areas namely, the Salinas de Pedra Lume and Cagarral – Protected Landscape, the Monte Grande – Protected Landscape, the Rabo de Junco – Natural Reserve, the Baía da Murdeira – Natural (Marine) Reserve, the Costa da Fragata – Natural Reserve, the Serra Negra – Natural Reserve, the Buracona-Ragona – Protected Landscape, the Salinas de Santa Maria – Protected Landscape, the Morrinho do Filho –Natural Monument, the Ponta do Sino – Natural Reserve, the Morrinho do Açucar – Natural Monument. In Maio Island protected are the Terras Salgadas – Natural Reserve, Casas Velhas – Natural Reserve, Barareiro e Figueira – Natural Park, Lagoa Cimidor – Natural Reserve, Praia do Morro – Natural Reserve, Salinas de Porto Inglês – Protected Landscape, Monte Penoso e Monte Branco – Protected Landscape and Monte Santo António – Protected Landscape. Boa Vista Island has the largest number of parks and natural monuments. These are: The Boa Esperança – Natural Reserve; the Ilhéu de Baluarte – Integrated Natural Reserve, the Ilhéu dos Pássaros – Integrated Natural Reserve, the Ilhéu de Curral Velho – Integrated Natural Reserve, the Ponta do Sol – Natural Reserve, the Tartaruga – Natural Reserve, the Natural Park do Norte – Natural Park, the Monte Caçador e Pico Forçado – Protected Landscape; the Morro de Areia – Natural Reserve; the Curral Velho – Protected Landscape; the Monte Santo António –Natural Monument; the Ilhéu de Sal-Rei – Natural Monument; the Monte Estância – Natural Monument; and the Rocha Estância – Natural Monument. The Santiago Island has two preserved areas in the Serra da Malagueta – Natural Park and the Serra Pico de Antónia – Natural Park. The Fogo Island has Bordeira, Chã das Caldeiras e Pico Novo Natural Park. The Rombo Islets have an Integrated Reserve. With a view to preserve the marine ecosystems and develop fisheries pragmatically, the action initiated included creation of Marine reserves: Santa Luzia Island, and the Islets Raso and Branco, Boavista, Sal and Maio Islands; and Conservation of Cape Verde Endangered Marine Species Project. Flora Losma (Artemisia gorgonum), an endemic plant of Fogo Island Acacia tree Grey long-eared bat Historically, Cape Verde was probably not rich with greenery, although the evidence of the situation in earlier times is severely lacking. When Cape Verde was first discovered and colonized by the Portuguese in the 15th century, the wildlife consisted mainly of dry forests and scrub habitat, which underwent a sea change under the influence of the inhabitants of this then isolated and uninhabited group of islands. The endemic flora and fauna of the islands were disturbed and have now remained confined mostly in the mountain peaks, steep slopes and other inaccessible areas. Vegetation in the islands is basically of the savannah or steppe type. There are trees typical of both temperate and tropical climates, depending on elevation. The flatter parts of the islands sustain semi-desert plants while the higher lands have arid shrubland. The leeward slopes tend to contain desert, with a very sparse shrub cover, mostly thorny or toxic. A number of xerophilous plants grow in the brackish subsoil of Maio, Sal, and Boa Vista. There are 664 listed plant species, which include two threatened species. Over 80 vascular plant taxa are reported to be endemic to Cape Verde; these include Tornabenea, Aeonium gorgoneum, Campanula bravensis (bellflower), Nauplius smithii, Artemisia gorgonum (sagebrush), Sideroxylon marginata, Lotus jacobaeus, Lavandula rotundifolia, Sarcostemma daltonii, Euphorbia tuckeyana, Polycarpaea gayi and Erysimum caboverdeanum (wallflower). Several trees are indigenous such as the blue-green flat-topped dragon tree Dracaena draco, Tamarix senegalensis, Phoenix atlantica (tamareira), in the lagoons and deserts of Boavista, the ironwood tree and a species of fig tree and Faidherbia albida (formerly known as Acacia albida and locally called simply \\"acácia\\"). As a result of extensive tree planting since 1975, there are pine trees, oaks and sweet chestnuts on the cool peaks of Santo Antao, eucalyptus on the heights of Fogo, and forests of acacia on Maio. Fauna The island has five mammals out of which three are threatened, 75 species of birds including 2 threatened species, 19 reptiles, 132 varieties of fish species including one threatened species. However, the islands do not have snakes and large mammals. Mammals The only indigenous mammal found in the island is the grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus). Bat species on the islands account for about 20% of all mammals. Of particular note are those of the family Vespertilionidae: Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii) and Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) in addition to the grey long-eared bat. Feral goats are found on Fogo, the descendants of domestic goats introduced by the Portuguese. Rodent populations were introduced by the Portuguese from early ships which visited the islands. Monkeys are also present in Cape Verde, hailing from the African continent. The slender mongoose (Galerella sanguinea) has also been introduced. Birds Male colour-ringed Raso lark (Alauda razae) Male Iago sparrow at Sal Island Cape Verde has many species of endemic birds, which are observed by keen ornithologists and bird watchers on the islands. 130 migrant birds are reported to visit the islands, out of which over 40 nest there. The seabirds which breed on the island are: Fea's petrel (Pterodroma feae), frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) and red-billed tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus). Four species of birds, (Alexander's swift, the Raso lark, the Cape Verde swamp-warbler and the Iago sparrow) are also endemic here, while the Cape Verde shearwater is a breeding endemic. The endemic and endangered Bourne's heron is sometimes considered a full species. Also common are the greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) and the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus). Lizards Lizards reported on the islands are 15 species including 12 endemic species, such as the now extinct Cape Verde giant skink (Macroscincus coctei) on Ilhéu Raso, giant gecko (Tarentola gigas) on Raso and Branco islands, Mabuya skinks (6 species), Hemidactylus (3 species) and Tarentola geckos (11 species). Invertebrates Cape Verde has a reported 58 endemic species of spider, including Wesolowskana lymphatica (jumping spider), and Hottentotta caboverdensis, a parthenogenetic scorpion. It has a reported 15 endemic genera and 369 endemic species of insects. Of note are Ceylalictus capverdensis (bee), Thyreus denolii (cuckoo bee), Thyreus batelkai (cuckoo bee), Thyreus schwarzi (cuckoo bee), Thyreus aistleitneri (cuckoo bee), Chiasmognathus batelkai (cuckoo bee), Monomorium boltoni (ant), Scopula paneliusi (geometrid moth) and Serranegra petrophila, a true bug in the family Lygaeidae There also are endemic marine species, including molluscs such as Favartia burnayi, Nassarius caboverdensis, Prunum sauliae, the cone shell Conus josephinae and the Cape Verde spiny lobster, Palinurus charlestoni Marine life Green sea turtle The tropical marine environment of the Cape Verde islands of Boavista, Sal and Maio is reported to have a high diversity of sea life. Boavista is part of the Macaronesia Wetlands. Coral reefs are also found extensively in Cape Verde, considered as one of the \\"world’s ten most important coral reefs\\". There is a large number of endemic marine gastropods (sea snails and sea slugs) on the coasts of Cape Verde. Marine species reported are bridled dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin, long-beaked common dolphin, blue whale, humpback whale, Blainville's beaked whale, common porpoise, barracuda's, moray eels and marine turtles (5 species). Turtles migrate across the Atlantic to breed from May to October. The most prominent species is the endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). Other species of turtle are the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricate) which is critically endangered; the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), endangered; leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) and olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea). Hunting of sea turtles remains prevalent per an UNEP report, however turtle conservation measures began in 2008. Eighteen species of whales and dolphins have been recorded in the waters of the Cape Verde archipelago. The area is cited as one of two known breeding grounds for the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) of the Northern Hemisphere. Humpback whales migrate annually from the North Sea to winter around Cape Verde from January to mid-May. The humpback whale population became limited due to severe overfishing during the 19th century and, although the total North Atlantic population of humpbacks had rebounded to more than 10,000 individuals by 1993, the Cape Verde population remained uncertain as of 2009. Threats and legal redress The status of biological resources of Cape Verde, in the process of degradation, was recognized in 1996 which prompted action in 2005 with several legal instruments that were introduced by the government of Cape Verde. In spite of all the legislation, the level of degradation reported in the Red List of Threatened Species was \\"26% for angiosperms, over 40% of bryophytes, over 65% of pteridophytes and over 29% of lichens are threatened; furthermore, over 47% of birds, 25% of terrestrial reptiles, 64% of coleopterous, over 57% of arachnids and over 59% of terrestrial mollusks.\\" The number count of Alauda razae (Calhandra-do-Ilhéu-Raso) and Himantopus himantopus (Perna-longa) has still shown a declining trend. Further, with a view to preserve the marine ecosystems and develop fisheries pragmatically the action initiated included creation of Marine reserves: Santa Luzia Island, and the Islets Raso and Branco, Boavista, Sal and Maio Islands; and Conservation of Cape Verde Endangered Marine Species Project. ;Organizations Institutions and organizations involved with the preservation and conservation of the biodiversity of Cape Verde are: The Directorate General of Agriculture, Forest and Livestock Production, the Institute for the Development of Fisheries (INDP), the University of Cape Verde's National Institute of Agricultural Research and Development (INIDA) and Project Biodiversity. Noting that the exclusive biological species of Cape Verde are not represented in any germplasm banks across the world and that its fauna and flora of Cape Verde are extremely vulnerable to climate adversities with the natural regenerative conditions considered as poor, INIDA has established \\"a collection of biological resources for ex situ conservation as a means of backing in situ conservation of species threatened in some way, as they may be introduced in the wild as needs be, in sites where they are best adapted, through a finely tuned reintroduction program.\\"  See also  * Overfishing in West Africa References External links *www.caboverde.com Category:Biota of Cape Verde Cape Verde ","title":"Wildlife of Cape Verde"},{"id":"10946169","text":"Louise Thérèse Blouin (born 1958/59) is a Canadian magazine publisher.

George Pearce Ret'de-Veritas, July 24, 2016, Headdress of the Royal Military College of Canada: A brief history by 8057 Ross McKenzie, former Curator RMC Museum, http://everitas.rmcclub.ca/?p=154491 is a uniform hat worn by the Canadian military and RCMP. The outside of the cap is entirely covered in real (e.g. seal skin or Persian lamb) or synthetic fur and is shaped like a wedge. When not being worn the cap folds flat. The cap is about high but is normally worn with the apex of the wedge shape depressed back into the interior of the cap to form a longitudinal trough at the crown, reducing the overall height. Often the cap is patterned such that the front of the crown will be slightly higher than the back. On one side of the military style fur wedge cap hangs a flat flap made of cloth or wool that extends from the crown to the bottom of the cap, known as the \\"bag\\". The colour of the \\"bag\\" was determined by the regimental colours (e.g. the RCMP bag was yellow). The bag is very similar to that worn with the busby. Because of the cap's passing resemblance to the hussar busby author and researcher James J. BoultonBoulton, James, J., Head- dress of the Canadian Mounted Police, 1873–2000, Calgary: Bunker to Bunker Pub., c2000., , pages 89–96 dubbed it the envelope busby. Still, whatever influence the busby may have had on its design, the fur wedge cap pattern was \\"distinctly Canadian.\\" The fur wedge cap was used by both the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP), later Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), with the first examples coming into service in 1876 until 1901 and then again from 1928 until 1935. Today the RCMP wear the Yukon pattern of fur cap that is similar to the Russian ushanka style.Ross, David, and Robin May, The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 1873–1987, London: Osprey, 1988., The other police unit that still regularly wears the fur wedge cap is the Toronto Police Mounted Unit as part of their full dress uniform. The Canadian military also wore the cap from about the end of the 19th century, and was formally adopted in the 1970s as the issued fur cap for all commands of the Canadian Forces during unification.Summers, Jack, L., Military uniforms in Canada, 1665–1970, Ottawa: National Museum of Man, National Museums of Canada, c1981., The bag was coloured rifle green. In Canadian Forces nomenclature it is known as Cap, Man's Winter, Fur, C.F. Exactly when the fur cap stopped being in general issue is unclear; however, it is still being worn today by the officer cadets of the Royal Military College of Canada.Gregory, Michael, Compendium of Canadian Regiments: A Civilian's Perspective, Michaeljohn Gregory, pages 59 to 60Canadian Forces, A-DH-265-000/AG-001 Canadian Forces Dress Instructions, Department of National Defence, pages 2-2-10 and 2-2-19, http://cs.uwindsor.ca/~fitzpatr/A-DH-265-000.pdf As an example William Avery Bishop, Canadian flying ace, can be seen wearing the cap during his days in Royal Military College of Canada.  In popular culture  The fur wedge cap is prominently featured in the Cecil B. DeMille film North West Mounted Police (1940), with the mounted police characters all wearing the cap despite the fact that the movie is set in the summer time. (In real usage, the cap was not intended to be worn in summer.) A civilian version of the cap without the bag was fashionable in Canada during the 1970s.

It prohibits discrimination against faculty, staff, and students, including racial segregation of students, and requires school districts to take action to overcome barriers to students' equal participation. It is one of a number of laws affecting educational institutions including the Rehabilitation Act (1973), Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Background Origins The civil rights movement brought about controversies on busing, language rights, desegregation, and the idea of “equal education\\". The groundwork for the creation of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act first came about with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination and racial segregation against African Americans and women. In 1968 the U.S. Department of Education, formerly the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, issued a statement saying that school officials are responsible for providing equal educational opportunities for all, regardless of one’s nationality, race, or color. A 1970 memorandum was then passed, clarifying the responsibilities of school officials. In addition to requiring separate classes to be created for students less than proficient in the English language, communication between students’ parents and the school was to be required to be conducted in a language understood by the parents. President Nixon's proposals On March 6, 1972, President Richard Nixon clarified the definition of “equal educational opportunity” and also called for the judiciary to create a more uniform set of standards off which to judge future cases related with educational opportunity, prioritize equal education, and create alternatives to busing. He set forth two specific proposals on this day: one to effectively eliminate busing entitled \\"The Student Transportation Moratorium Act\\" and another entitled the Equal Educational Opportunities Act. Although the Equal Educational Opportunities Act was not passed at that time, Nixon declared that “[t]his act would require that every State or locality grant equal educational opportunity to every person, regardless of race, color, or national origin”. In the 1974 Lau v. Nichols, students unable to speak English fluently were denied additional education, resulting in renewed interest in Nixon’s 1972 proposals. This led to the official passage of the act on August 21, 1974. Legislative history Congress passed the EEOA as a house bill amending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The only legislative history available for reference is from a similar bill passed in 1972. The House Committee on Education and Labor noted that the bill was significant in that it contained the first \\"illustrative definition of a denial of equal educational opportunity\\", and that this lent clarity to schools, governmental authorities, and students as to what, precisely, their rights were. Contents of the act Provisions The act states that no U.S. state can deny equal educational opportunity to any person on the basis of gender, race, color, or nationality through intentional segregation by an educational institution; neglecting to resolve intentional segregation; by forced assignment of a student to a school, other than the one closest to his or her place of residence, that promotes further segregation; by discrimination in determining faculty and staff; by purposely transferring a student to another school to increase segregation; or by failing to remove language barriers preventing students from being able to equally participating in English classes. The act also states that lawsuits may also be filed should individuals believe themselves to be denied equal education from their peers. The U.S. attorney general is also allowed to initiate civil action on behalf of students should he deem it necessary. Defining \\"Appropriate Action\\" The act remains vague in its statutory language. The EEOA states that no state can deny students the right to equal education by \\"failure by an educational agency to take 'appropriate action' to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs\\". For example, although the act bears no mention of bilingual education, but instead uses the term \\"appropriate action\\" to describe measures Congress may take to enforce the EEOA, Congress has interpreted bilingual education as an action a school district must take to help teach non-English-speaking students how to speak English. Notable court cases Lau v. Nichols (1974) This case was a landmark case during which the U.S Supreme Court made one of its first interpretations of the term \\"appropriate action\\". In 1974 the court ruled that a school district based in San Francisco had violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by denying students of Chinese descent opportunities to participate in classes. The court decided that just providing the students with the same textbooks, desks, and teachers was not sufficient, and measures, such as instruction in both Chinese and English, needed to be taken to make sure that English was taught to non- English speaking students. Castañeda v. Pickard (1981) In 1981 the U.S Fifth Circuit of Appeals created a three-prong test to be used to determine whether or not school officials denied students not proficient in English the right to enjoy equal educational opportunities. Under this test, an acceptable program for English-language learners is as follows: * A curriculum is recognized by experts in the field; * The programs or methods used are effective in carrying out the curriculum; * The program proves successful in helping to overcome language barriers. The court ruled that students learning English as their second language should be able to receive the rest of the school’s educational opportunities regardless of any language barriers. Plyler v. Doe (1982) In 1982 the court ruled that public school districts could not deny immigrant students from receiving a free public education. The court also ruled that not only do undocumented children have the right to receive the same public education, but that they are also required, like U.S. citizens and permanent residents, to attend school until they are of age as laid down by the state law. Public schools and school personnel are also not allowed to adopt measures that would prevent students from receiving access to public education based on their citizenship status. For example, the court ruled that school officials cannot legally ask students to present proof of citizenship such as green cards. Instead, they can only ask the student to provide proof that they reside within the boundaries of the school district. Keyes v. School District 1 (1983) In 1983 the three- part test created in the Castañeda v. Pickard was used to decide that a school district in Denver, Colorado, had participated in intentionally separating white students from Mexican-American students. The court ordered for desegregation. United States v. State of Texas (1982) In 1982 the Court ruled that the state of Texas had failed to provide opportunities for English learners, mainly of Latino descent, to overcome language barriers under the EEOA. State education agencies adopted bilingual services to be provided for those learning how to speak English. Idaho Migrant Council v. Board of Education (1981) In 1981 the U.S. Ninth Circuit ruled that state education departments needed to enforce federal mandates in local school districts. Flores v. Arizona (2000) This case was first filed in 1992 from parents accusing schools for failing to provide adequate enough educational services for English language learners and in 2000, the court ruled that educational programs were not properly funded nor were enough teachers provided. As a result, the court ruled for sufficient educational resources to be implemented as of January 31, 2002, and in 2009, the Court ruled that the EEOA was officially violated.

The prominent wild fauna includes African buffalo, African bush elephant, black rhinoceros, southern giraffe, African leopard, lion, plains zebra, and several antelope species. The introduction of the Wildlife Conservation Act of 1960 resulted in checking the loss of wildlife in Zimbabwe, since the 1960s. In the 1990s, it became one of the leading countries in Africa in wildlife conservation and management with a reported income generation US$300 million per year from the protected areas of the state, rural community run wildlife management areas and private game ranches and reserves. The Parks and Wildlife Board consisting of 12 members is responsible for this activity and deciding on policy issues under the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Management. The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority under the Board has the onerous task of overseeing the activities related to 10 national parks, nine recreational parks, four botanical gardens, four safari areas, and three sanctuaries. These areas are collectively called the Wildlife Estate which covers an area about , which is equivalent to 12.5% of the total land area of the country. However, reports of National Geographic News indicate a disturbing trend of decimation of wildlife in Zimbabwe as result of “national economic meltdown” leading to overexploitation of the wildlife resources to meet the finances of the nation. Legal codes The Wildlife Conservation Authority initially protected and preserved wildlife in Zimbabwe as \\"king's game\\", which was changed to total state control subsequently. However, this created difficulties to the local population who were entirely dependent on the forests for their survival, as they were excluded from using indigenous wildlife resources and also gradually excluded from almost one-half of the country's land base. This seriously affected the sustainable exploitation of the wildlife resources as local people resorted to illegal poaching. However, in the 1960 the economic awareness created a policy shift in managing the wild life in the country when the Wildlife Conservation Act was introduced. This was followed by the Parks and Wildlife Act of 1975, which enabled the land owners \\"the right to manage wildlife for their own benefit, thus providing an economic rationale to reinforce the scientific, aesthetic and moral justifications for wildlife conservation.\\" The Parks and Wildlife Act of 1975 has been amended and consolidated in 1982 in which certain animals to be protected have been listed. Taking off animals has been prohibited except under special permit issued by the minister for scientific or educational purposes or for captive breeding of falcons, live export, and re-stocking, wildlife management or defence of property. Provision also includes taking of indigenous plants, hunting of animals and regulation of fishing. Detailed regulations have been issued to the Act. Wildlife estate The Wildlife Estate includes eleven national parks: the Chimanimani National Park (including the Eland Sanctuary), Chizarira National Park, the Gonarezhou National Park, the Hwange National Park, the Kazuma Pan National Park, the Mana Pools National Park, the Matusadona National Park, the Matobo National Park, the Nyanga National Park, and Victoria Falls National Park and Zambezi National Parks. Chimanimani National Park View of the national park area from behind Chimanimani village stores Chimanimani National Park borders Mozambique in the southernmost area of the Eastern Highlands. It is a mountainous terrain with peak heights of and is the source of many streams and springs enriching the environment of the park with natural falls such as in the Bridal Veil Falls in the Eland Sanctuary. There are also views of the Pork Pie mountain range and the Bridal Veil Falls, which plunges down into a base about 10 m wide. The virgin forest cover is dense of the moist evergreen type. It is approachable only by trekking along hill tracks. It is from the Mutare town. It has many wild life fauna such as eland, sable, bushbuck, blue duiker, klipspringer and also spotted leopard, apart from butterflies, birds, snakes and shy cats. Chizarira National Park Chizarira National Park located in northwestern Zimbabwe covers a virgin forest land of area of ; ‘Chizarira’ means \\"great barrier\\". Though it is one of the largest parks, its location is in the remote Zambezi Escarpment and has extensive vistas including of its valleys, gorges, plateaus and flood plains. Its large game includes elephant, lion, leopard and buffalo. Its bird species are the big five birds namely, the African broadbill, Livingstone's flycatcher, western nicator, emerald cuckoo, apart from Angolan pitta and the Taita falcon. Gonarezhou National Park Wildlife camp in the Gonarezhou National Park Gonarezhou National Park, encompassing an area of about , in southeastern Zimbabwe is in a remote region along the Mozambique border and is the second largest such park in the country; the first largest park is the Hwange National Park. ‘Gonarezhou’ in Shona means \\"elephant's tusk\\" (which the herbalists used to store their medicines) and it also means \\"place of many elephants.\\" The park's habitat consists of baobabs, scrub lands and sandstone cliffs in the lowveld region. The park is very large, in rugged terrain, and hence remains unaffected by human interference. The park is within the ambit of the transboundary part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a peace park that links Gonarezhou with the Kruger National Park in South Africa and the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique. Animals move freely between the three sanctuaries. The park's rich wild life consists of 500 species of birds, 147 species of mammals, more than 116 species of reptiles, 34 species of frogs and 49 species of fish. The park's rivers and pools have some unique species of aqua fauna such as the Zambezi shark, freshwater goby, black bream and the turquoise killifish. Hwange National Park Elephants at Longone Pan, Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe The Hwange National Park (formerly Wankie National Park) established in 1929 with an area of is the largest park and game reserve in Zimbabwe in the south-west corner of the country. The park lies on the main road between Bulawayo and the widely noted Victoria Falls. In the 19th century it was the hunting ground of the Ndebele warrior-king Mzilikazi and it is named after the local Nhanzwa chief. The park is close to the edge of the Kalahari desert, a region with little water and very sparse, xerophile vegetation. While the park abounds in elephant population (one of the largest in the world), it also hosts 100 mammal species, including 19 large herbivores and eight large carnivores and 400 bird species; Zimbabwe's specially protected animals are all found here. Gemsbok, brown hyena and African wild dogs occur in fairly large numbers (the population of African wild dogs is stated to be of one of the largest surviving groups in Africa now). The very large elephant population has been a matter of concern since, during drought years, they are a burden on the ecological balance of the region. Elephant culling has been done to restrict the population of elephants to 13,000 (less than 1 per km2); against the recommended population of 35,000 – 40,000 animals (0.6 per km2) for the country as a whole. Apart from culling the other suggested option to keep the elephant population under check is sterilization. Conservationists covering this area have also expressed concern at the large \\"deforestation, poaching and unsustainable resource exploitation\\" that is occurring in this national park attributed to political and economic instability in the country. Kazuma Pan National Park Kazuma Pan National Park covers an area of and is located in the northwest corner of Zimbabwe, between Kazungula and Hwange National Parks, and south-west of Victoria Falls. Basically, it was developed as a safe haven for the animals during the hunting season, as it formed an extension of the Matetsi Safari Area. It has a series of depressions, which enriches the ground water which is then pumped during the dry season. It has the largest concentration of about 2,000 buffaloes and also elephants and rhinos. Other species of wildlife seen here are: lion, leopard, giraffe, zebra, gemsbok, roan antelope, sable, tsessebe, eland and reedbuck. The oribi, a small antelope, an endemic species, is rarely sighted in the depressions where a large variety of water birds such as storks, crowned cranes, stilts, cormorants, ducks and kingfishers are also seen making it an attractive bird- watching site. Mana Pools National Park Zambezi River in the Mana Pools National Park. The Mana Pools National Park, a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, extending over an area of (as part of the Parks and Wildlife Estate that stretches the Kariba Dam in the west to the Mozambique border in the east) is in the region of the lower Zambezi River in Zimbabwe where the flood plain turns into a broad expanse of lakes after each rainy season. As the lakes gradually dry up and recede, the region attracts many large animals in search of water, making it one of Africa's most renowned game-viewing regions. In Shona language, ‘Mana’ means “four” referring to the four large permanent pools formed by the meandering ox-bow lakes of the middle Zambezi River. Dande Safari Area () established in 1968, and the Urungwe Safari Area () established in 1976 are contiguous to this park. The park's habitat consists of islands, sandbanks and pools, flanked by forests of mahogany, wild figs, ebonies and baobabs. Alluvial deposits along the Zambezi have winterthorn with more diverse woodlands with species of Kigelia africana and Trichelia emetica on the top alluvial layers. The park has the country's biggest concentration of hippopotamuses and crocodiles as well as large dry season mammal populations of elephant and Cape buffalo. Spotted hyena, honey badger, warthog, bushpig, plains zebra and many species of antelope are found here. Bird life consists of 380 species which includes Nyasa lovebird, western nicator, rock pratincole, banded snake-eagle and Livingstone's flycatcher. Matusadona National Park Matusadona National Park, a game reserve in 1963, was declared a national park in 1975 covering an area of . It is bounded on the south by the Omay communal, on the north by Lake Kariba, on the east by the Sanyati River and its gorge, and on the west by the Ume River. It has three ecological zones namely, the lake and shoreline grassland forming the first zone, the Zambezi Valley floor made up of a mass of thick jesse and mopane woodland (with sparse grass cover) as the second zone and; the Escarpment area of Julbernadia and Brachystegia woodlands constituting the third zone. Black rhino, elephants and buffalo inhabit the park. Other species include night ape, honey badger, civet, small spotted genet, slender mongoose, banded mongoose, spotted hyena, serval, lion, leopard, yellow-spotted rock hyrax, black rhinoceros, zebra, warthog, common duiker, grysbok, klipspringer, waterbuck, bushbuck, scrub hare, porcupine, vervet monkey, chacma baboon, side-striped jackal, hippopotamus, roan antelope, kudu and bush squirrel, African clawless otter, white-tailed mongoose, reedbuck, sable antelope, eland, civet, rusty spotted genet, caracal and bush pig; sighted on rarely are Cape wild dog, cheetah, roan and pangolin. Matobo National Park The Matobo National Park is part of the UNESCO Matubo Hills, became a national park covering an area of which was established in 1953. It has an exclusive \\"Intensive Protection Zone\\" to protect the large population of black and white rhinoceros. The name Matobo means \\"bald heads\\" and was selected by the Matabeleland king Mzilikazi whose grave lies in the Matobo Hills close to the park. Matobo Hills includes a range of domes, spires and balancing rock formations created erosion and weathering within a granite plateau. It has diverse species of vegetation, including examples of mopane, Acacia, Brachystegia, Ficus, Azanza, Ziziphus, Strychnos and Terminalia. Along with rhinoceros, the park supports also a large number of animal species, including zebra, wildebeest, giraffe, kudu, eland, sable antelope, klipspringer, leopard, hyena, cheetah, hippo, warthog, rock dassies, waterbuck, African wildcat, springhare, common duiker, crocodiles, baboons and monkeys. The park is also rich in bird life, including black eagle, African fish eagle, martial eagle, secretarybird, pied crow, Egyptian goose, francolin, and weavers. Fish species in the park include bass, bottle fish, bream, catfish and Melanochromis robustus. The park has a number of dams such as the Maleme Dam, the Mthselele Dam, the Toghwana Dam, the Mesilume Dam, which are all communal camp sites. Nyanga National Park Male waterbuck in the Udu area of the park The Nyanga National Park in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe located at about from Harare (connected by a black topped road) is made up of rolling green hills terrain with perennial rivers which spread through the park. The park lies between and elevation and has salubrious mountain climate. It is rich in flora and fauna. The faunal species seen in the park are the waterbuck, wildebeest, kudu, zebra, impala, sables and eland. The rivers in the park have fresh water fish such as the Nyanga trout. The visitor attractions in the park are: The Mount Nyangani (2593 m), the Nyangombe Falls, Mutarazi Falls, Pungwe Gorge & Falls, Nyamuziwa Falls, Nyangwe & Chawomera Forts and the Trout Hatchery near Purdon Dam. Victoria Falls and Zambezi National Park The Victoria Falls and Zambezi National Parks, a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, are located on the western edge of Zimbabwe; the two together cover an area of bounded by the Zambezi River, which borders with Zambia. The Falls and the Pa National Park are on the southern bank of the Zambezi River. The Victoria Falls, one of seven natural wonders of the world, is wide, cascades into the gorge and is formed by five different \\"falls\\", out of which four are in Zimbabwe. The catchment area of the falls is made up of rainforests with rich and unique species of flora and fauna. The flora consists of species of fig, mahogany and date palm. An attraction is the large baobab tree near the Falls which is 16 m in diameter and tall. The notable wildlife in the parks consists of elephants, lions, buffalos, leopards and white rhinoceros apart from herds of sable antelope, eland, zebra, giraffe, kudu, waterbuck and impala. The Zambezi River is rich in fish fauna such as bream and fighting tigerfish. Vegetation The vegetation or flora type is generally uniform in Zimbabwe. Bushveld or thorny acacia savanna and miombo or dry open woodland dominate the central and western plateau. In the south and southeast, which are dry lowlands, thorny scrub and baobabs are extensive. Cactus-like euphorbias (similar to pipe organs), 30 species of aloes, wildflowers, profusion of jacarandas, and succulent tropical flowers and palms are some of the plant species commonly seen in the country. The dominant woody species noted in the Northwest Matebeleland, the Sebungwe region, in the Zambezi River Valley and in Gonarezhou National Park are: C. mopane, B. plurijuga, Guibourtia coleosperma, Pterocarpus angolensis and Acacia species, Julbernadia globiflora, Brachystegia boehmii, Erythrophleum africanum, P. angolensis, B. africana, Kirkia acuminata, Adansonia digitata, Screrocarya birrea, B. massaiensis, D. condylocarpon, T. sericea and Combretum species.

The wildlife of Chad is composed of its flora and fauna. Animal and plant life correspond to the three climatic zones. In the Saharan region, the only flora is the date-palm groves of the oasis. Palms and acacia trees grow in the Sahelian region. The southern, or Sudanic, zone consists of broad grasslands or prairies suitable for grazing. As of 2002, there were at least 134 species of mammals, 532 species of birds (354 species of residents and 155 migrants), and over 1,600 species of plants throughout the country. Bush elephants, West African lions, buffalo, hippopotamuses, Kordofan giraffes, antelopes, African leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, and many species of snakes are found here, although most large carnivore populations have been drastically reduced since the early 20th century. Elephant poaching, particularly in the south of the country in areas such as Zakouma National Park, is a severe problem. Vegetation Map of Chad As of 2011, there are in the country, 55 of which are endemic. Precipitation varies widely from south to north of the country. The country is also subject to hot, dry, dusty conditions. Harmattan Winds are a feature in the northern part of the country. Droughts and locust plagues are also common. The vegetation in the country is broadly categorized under the three regions of the northern Sahara zone, the central Sahel zone, and the southern Sudan zone; all three zones are of equal proportion. The northern part of the country which has the Sahara desert and which borders Libya and the volcanic massif of Tibesti () forms part of the northern zone. Vegetation is dominantly tropical in the tropical zone of the country with deserts having least vegetative growth. However, a large area of desert dunes lie between Lake Chad and the Ouaddai massif, where fringes of xerophytic scrubland is noted. The montane vegetation on the massif is rich, unlike the vegetation that is in the lowlands. Woody vegetation occurs in some deep gorges of the Ennedi massif, which rises to . A flat terrain supports Sahelian grasslands. The transition zone that lies between the southern Sahel and northern Sudan–Guinea is also a seasonal wetland. The Sudan Savanna zone mostly consists of Sudanian woodland with intermittent vegetation of edaphic grassland and acacia. Lake Chad, lying on the country's western edge and extending across the border into Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon, is one of the richest areas of flora in the country, although it has rapidly reduced in size during the last century. The well-drained soils of the area once supported areas of dense woodlands with ebony and kapok trees, but this has declined due to soil erosion and degradation. Vegetation found in the area includes acacias, baobab, desert date, palms, African myrrh, and Indian jujube. Found within the lake itself are aquatic plants such as reeds, Papyrus, ambatch, and water lilies. Fauna As of 2002, there were at least 134 species of mammals and 532 species of birds (354 species of residents and 155 migrants) in Chad. Before the 20th century, Chad reportedly had a rich fauna of large carnivores in the Lake Chad region, but due to deforestation, hunting and competition from livestock most of the population of lions, leopards, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus have disappeared from the region. The Zakouma National Park is an important habitat with the highest number of large mammals. Scimitar horned oryx are seen in the reserves of Chad in significant numbers, mostly in the Ouadi Rime Ouadi Achin Faunal Reserve. Also reported to survive in this reserve are the large population of addax (nasomaculatus) and dama gazelle Gazelle dama. Other species reported are; red-fronted gazelle, dorcas gazelle (Gazella rufifrons, Gazella dama, Gazella dorcas), patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), caracal (Felis caracal), and Chadian wild dog (Lycaon pictus sharicus), African elephant (Loxodonta africana), otter (Lutra maculicollis), Aonyx capensis, sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekei) and kob (Kobus kob). Rodent species reported are Mastomys verheyeni and gerbil (Taterillus lacustris). African rock pythons and spitting cobras are the reptile species also reported. Aquafauna Lake Chad has 179 species of fish which feed on vegetation, phytoplankton and zooplankton. Some of the species reported are catfish (Clarias gariepensis), tilapia, cichlids, characin (Alestes baremoze) and Nile perch (Lates niloticus). Lungfish and sailfin are the two other unique species in the lake. Crocodile and hippopotamus also inhabit the lake as do birds, and it is an important destination for many migratory species of birds. Avifauna While the Birdlife International Organization has reported 532 species of birds of which 354 residents and 155 are migrants, the Avibase - Bird Checklists of the World reports 587 species including 6 globally threatened species. Of these the species under endangered, near- threatened, and vulnerable categories are: ;Critically endangered *Slender- billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris) ;Endangered *Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) *Hooded vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus) *White-backed vulture (Gyps africanus) *Rueppell's griffon (Gyps rueppellii) *Saker falcon (Falco cherrug) ;Vulnerable *Marbled teal (Marmaronetta angustirostris) *Secretary- bird (Sagittarius serpentarius) *White-headed vulture (Trigonoceps occipitalis) *Beaudouin's snake-eagle (Circaetus beaudouini) *Greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga) *Black crowned-crane (Balearica pavonina) ; Near- threatened *Ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca) *Bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus) *Lesser flamingo Phoenicopterus minor *Martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus) *Pallid harrier (Circus macrourus} *Arabian bustard (Ardeotis arabs) *Stanley bustard {Neotis denhami) *Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba) *Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata) *Black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) *Great snipe (Gallinago media) *Black-winged pratincole (Glareola nordmanni) *African skimmer (Rynchops flavirostris) *European roller (Coracias garrulus) *Red- footed falcon (Falco vespertinus) *Sooty falcon (Falco concolor) Musophaga violacea (violet turaco} is a species of least concern, which is found in large numbers in a range of less than covering many African countries including Chad Protection The unprotected parks, reserves, protection forests, reforestation areas, and Ramsar drylands of International Importance in the country include the IUCN Level II categorized Aouk (7400 km2), Goz Beïda, Manda (1140 km2), and Zakouma (3000 km2) national parks. The country has a number of faunal reserves which are loosely protected including Abou Telfane (1100 km2), Bahr Salamat (20600 km2), Beinamar (763 km2), Binder-Léré (1350 km2), Fada Archei (2110 km2), Larmanaye (3040 km2), Mandelia (1380 km2), Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim (80,000 km2), and Siniala-Minia (4260 km2) faunal reserves. Aside from the numerous protected forests, Tibesti Massif is also a protected area. The Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar) are the Lac Fitri Ramsar Site (1950 km2), Réserve de faune de Binder-Léré Ramsar Site (1350 km2) and the Partie tchadienne du lac Tchad Ramsar Site (16481.68 km2). Apart from parks and reserves, eight Important Bird Areas have been identified and supported by Bird Life International covering an area of (11.2% of the area of the country) some of them overlapping with parks and reserves. Of these, the Ouadi Rimé–Ouadi Achim IBA is the largest covering an area of more than 6% of the area of the country. Conservation Extensive deforestation has resulted in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; one of the main reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Animals like lions, leopards and rhino have been almost decimated. Efforts have been made by the Food and Agriculture Organization to improve relations between farmers, agro-pastoralists and pastoralists in the Zakouma National Park (ZNP), Siniaka-Minia, and Aouk reserve in southeastern Chad to promote sustainable development. As part of the national conservation effort, more than 1.2 million trees have been replanted to check the advancement of the desert, which incidentally also helps the local economy by way of financial return from acacia trees, which produce gum arabic, and also from fruit trees. Poaching Poaching is a serious problem in the country, particularly of elephants for the profitable ivory industry and a threat to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized poaching. The problem is worsened by the fact that the parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.

The species was first described by Charles Oberthür in 1897. Range This moth can be found in parts of China. Life cycle It takes 70–85 days to progress from an egg to the adult, depending on the temperature and humidity. It uses its colorful wings to attract its mate Egg The female lays up to 120 eggs, and may place their eggs anywhere. The egg is oval-shaped, 1.5 × 1 mm; whitish gray, and firmly stuck to branches or sides of the cage that the female had been kept in. Caterpillars, 4–5 mm long, hatch after 10–14 days, the warmer and the higher the humidity, the quicker it happens. Larva Larva The newly hatched larva is black with hairs. It sheds its skin four times in its larval stage. In the first instar, it is initially black but becomes a deep red brown as it grows. In the second instar, it continues to lighten to an orange brown. In the third instar it changes into beautiful green with white stripes and silver/gold metallic reflective markings on the sides of the tubercles. Above the thoracic segments there is a stripe of white, black and red which can be opened and closed to show or hide the aposematic colouration. It is hairy in all its stages, and it feeds on pine trees. The fully grown caterpillar is 60–75 mm long. It spins its brownish silk cocoon on the ground among moss or among pine needles. They are easy to rear, as long as they eat in their first instar. The species comes from high mountainous regions, so it is quite cold hardy. It is best reared indoors, sleeved on a small pine tree. Pupa The chrysalis is about 35 mm long, and the imago emerges from the cocoon after about four weeks, depending on the temperature and humidity. Adult An adult moth's life is short, no longer than 10 to 12 days (females live longer due to their fat reserves). Pairing is easy in a medium-sized cage. A beautiful hybrid with Graellsia isabellae was obtained by a team of French entomologists (D. Adés, R. Cocault, R. Lemaitre, R. Zaun and R. Vuattoux). Host plants Pine tree - Pinus species. In the wild they eat Pinus massoniana. Caterpillars rather like Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), but they will also eat Pinus nigra (black pine).

According to official sources, when the PRT militias were demobilized in 1991 the party had around 200 fighters.Saludo del Presidente Uribe a los Desmovilizados. - Armada Nacional de Colombia Apart from its armed struggle PRT maintained an open mass front, the trade union organization Corriente de Integración Sindical. Coordination work In 1984 PRT entered into the 'Trilateral', a cooperation between the National Liberation Army (ELN), the Revolutionary Integration Movement - Free Fatherland (MIR-PL) and PRT. Amongst other things, the Trilateral resulted in coordination of mass movement activities, leading up the formation of ¡A Luchar! as a joint mass movement. On June 20, 1985, PRT took part in, along with ¡A Luchar!, organizing a national general strike against the policies of the Belisario Betancur government. At the time the National Guerrilla Coordination was born, a coalition consisting of ELN, Popular Liberation Army (EPL), M-19, MIR-PL, Armed Movement Quintín Lame (MAQL), Commando Ricardo Franco (RF) and PRT. With the entry of FARC-EP into the unity work of Colombian guerrilla movements, the National Guerrilla Coordination evolved into the Coordinadora Guerrillera Simón Bolívar in September 1987. Founding members of CGSB were EPL, UC-ELN, FARC-EP, MAQL, M-19 and PRT., ELN - Colombia Peace Treaty In December 1990, president Virgilio Barco expressed willingness to hold peace talks with PRT.Centro de Investigación para la Paz. Proyecto Europa Colombia Talks were initiated between the Colombian government and PRT. On December 28 an accord was signed between the government and PRT. On January 25, 1991, a final peace treaty was signed in Don Gabriel, Ovejas municipality, Sucre, between the government and PRT. It stipulated, amongst other things, that: *PRT would become a legal political party *PRT would gain representation in the Constituent Assembly. The party was given one seat in the assembly, but without vote.http://kellogg.nd.edu/events/pdfs/Pena.pdf *A TV programme of the party would be broadcast *PRT would get a full page ad in 2 national newspapers and 4 regional newspapers, as well half-page ads in 1 national newspaper and 3 regional newspapers. *Government would pay for an office for PRT in Bogotá *An armoured car for the PRT spokesperson in the Constituent Assembly, four bodyguards and 14 bulletproof vests for the PRT leadership. *Government would finance the building of five Casas por la Vida, in Bogotá, Barranquilla, Medellín, Sincelejo and one additional location. *A fund of 300 million pesos would be allocated for projects in the conflict areas of PRT. A joint government-PRT commission would oversee the distribution of the funds. *Subsidy for upkeep, health and education would be given to demobilized PRT fighters, through a fund. *An Indigenous Police force would be formed within the Colombian National Police. On behalf of the PRT the peace treaty was signed by Valentín González, Sergio Sierra, Pablo Roncallo, Rafael González and Ernesto Falla.Cedema.org - Viendo: Acuerdo final entre el PRT y el Gobierno de Colombia The weaponry of PRT was destroyed at a ceremony on January 26. Aftermath Even though the peace treaty specified that PRT would reorganize themselves as a legal political party, such a move never occurred. Instead some members of PRT joined M-19. Rather than organizing party work, PRT cadres became active in social organizations, primarily focus on human rights and peace promotion, in Bolívar and Sucre.

Range It is found only on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Life cycle Egg Eggs are brown/grey, with a fine mottled pattern, ovate, approximately 2-3 millimetres long. The larvae emerge about 10–14 days after being deposited by the female (at typical indoor room temperature). Actias isis eggs.jpgEggs Larva Larvae have five instars (molts/stages). The first instar is orange/brown, with a black band around the middle segments. The width of the dark band is variable. The larva has a dark brown head capsule. The larva changes to green at the start of the second instar, developing red/orange tubercles toward the end of the second instar. By the fourth instar, the tubercles become black and spiny. Later instars also develop white dot patterning. The larva can reach a maximum length of approximately 9-10 centimetres, and mass of 15 grams.

Female pupae reach 7-10 grams, while male pupae reach 4-7 grams. Pupae are wrapped in a cocoon constructed as a thin single layer of yellow silk. The cocoon is easily permeable by the elements, and has a vent opening at the head end. Pupal development can be slowed at temperatures of about 15 °C - but this is not true diapause; The pupae will continue to develop at a decreased rate. If kept at 20 °C the moths emerge in around four weeks. Some pupae have black colouration, while others are brown. In those that have black colouration, it is not possible to see the wing patterns developing prior to emergence.

The adults do not eat. Adult Actias isis exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males have variable patterning of dark brown and yellow, with a black and brown crescent moon marking on the forewing and a brown eyespot on the hindwing. The hindwing has long dark-coloured tails extending as much as 20 cm, tipped in yellow. Females are considerably heavier than the males, have a yellow base colour to the wings, and stronger thicker tails. Forewings are more rounded compared to the male's more falcate wings. The female will lay 150-250 eggs. Eggs will be deposited without the food plant being present.

The country has a long Atlantic coastline on the Gulf of Guinea and a range of habitat types. Once covered in tropical rainforest, much of this habitat has been cleared, the remaining terrain being gallery forests and savanna with scattered groups of trees, resulting in a decrease in biodiversity. As of 2016, 252 species of mammal had been recorded in Ivory Coast, 666 species of bird, 153 species of reptile, 80 species of amphibian, 671 species of fish and 3660 species of vascular plant. Geography Topography of Ivory Coast, before the creation of Lake Buyo Ivory Coast is a country in western sub-Saharan Africa just north of the equator, bordered by Liberia and Guinea to the west, Mali and Burkina Faso to the north and Ghana to the east. To the south lies the Gulf of Guinea with a coastline where there is a network of lagoons. The land rises from south to north, the terrain being mostly flat to undulating plain, with mountains in the west and northwest. The highest point is Mount Richard-Molard on the border with Guinea, reaching . The main rivers flow from north to south. A dam on the Bandama River, the longest waterway in the country, has created the artificial Lake Kossou, while another on the Sassandra River has created the rather smaller Lake Buyo. The forests on mountains in the west of the country near the border with Guinea and Liberia, are classified as Guinean montane forests. The Guinean forest-savanna mosaic belt extends across the middle of the country from east to west, and is the transition zone between the coastal forests and the interior savannas. The forest-savanna mosaic interlaces forest, savanna and grassland habitats. Northern Ivory Coast is part of the Sudanian Savanna ecoregion of the Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome. It is a zone of lateritic or sandy soils, with vegetation decreasing from south to north. Temperatures average between . The main rainy season is between May and September, with the remaining part of the year being dry in the north of the country, as the Harmattan wind blows. In the south the rainfall is higher ( annually and twice as much as the north) and some rain falls in most months. Flora Rainforest with emergent trees in Taï National Park As of 2016, 3660 species of vascular plant had been recorded in Ivory Coast. The Ébrié Lagoon is dominated by mangroves and herbaceous vegetation including both rooted and floating aquatic plants. Further inland are extensive swamps with larger herbaceous plants and small trees. In the southwest of the country, the Taï National Park protects the largest area of forest remaining in the Upper Guinean rainforest belt of West Africa. The vegetation is predominantly dense evergreen ombrophilous forest with emergent trees up to tall, with massive trunks and large buttresses or stilt roots. This mature tropical forest includes some 1,300 species of higher plants and has been designated as a World Heritage Site and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Another area that has been protected is the Comoé National Park, near the border with Burkina Faso. This has a variety of habitats, including gallery forests, woodland, open savannas and wetland. Fauna As of 2016, some 252 species of mammal had been recorded in Ivory Coast, 666 species of bird, 153 species of reptile, 80 species of amphibian and 671 species of fish. In the shallow parts of the Ébrié Lagoon there are a range of invertebrates including polychaete worms, nemertean worms, oligochaetes, isopods, amphipods and prawns. Over a hundred species of fish have been recorded here, and the lagoon and surrounding swamps are home to the pygmy hippopotamus, the Nile crocodile, the West African slender-snouted crocodile, the dwarf crocodile and the African manatee. Population growth and civil wars, together with deforestation, the increase area of plantations, hunting for bushmeat and other factors have led to a reduction in diversity among the animals in Ivory Coast, such that many are now restricted to protected areas. Among the 135 species of mammal recorded in Comoé National Park are 11 species of primates including the olive baboon, green monkey, lesser spot-nosed monkey, Mona monkey, black and white colobus, olive colobus, white collared mangabey and western chimpanzee. A total of 17 carnivore species have been observed here, but cheetahs, African wild dogs and lions no longer seem to be present. There are also 21 species of artiodactyl present including hippopotamus, bushpig, bongo, warthog, buffalo, kob, red-flanked duiker, bushbuck, waterbuck, roan antelope and oribi. Mammals recorded in the Taï National Park include the pygmy hippopotamus and 11 species of monkey, as well as African forest elephants, buffaloes, pangolins, bushbuck, leopards, chimpanzees and zebras. Reptiles include crocodiles, lizards and chameleons, as well as snakes such as horned vipers, mambas, and pythons. Among the 670 species of bird that have been recorded in the country are 10 species of seabird and 119 species of water bird, with the remaining birds being terrestrial. There are no species endemic to the country, but it is visited by 197 species of migratory bird. Some notable birds include 6 species of vulture, raptors, owls, 8 species of stork, African jacana, Ibises, herons, plovers, parrots, 11 species of hornbill, pigeons, and many smaller passerines.

Clarke, first published in the magazine If in 1953.Arthur C. Clarke: Reach for Tomorrow. Ballantine Books, New York 1956, p. IV It appeared again in Clarke's collection of short stories Reach for Tomorrow, in 1956, and deals with the detection and exploration of an old spaceship from outside the Solar System. Plot summary Professor Forster is a distinguished scientist on an expedition with the spacecraft Arnold Toynbee. He determines that the innermost satellite of Jupiter, Jupiter V, is a parked spacecraft from \\"Culture X\\", an ancient race of reptiles from outside the Solar System. Culture X coexisted with insectoid Martians, and settled the smaller rocky planets and moons throughout the Solar System apart from the Moon of the Earth. Jupiter V is discovered to be a spherical metal vehicle with a diameter of 30 kilometers. It contains an art gallery with millions of exhibits. One of the art objects is a depiction of a member of Culture X, which Forster dubs \\"The Ambassador\\". It becomes clear that \\"The Ambassador\\" was intended explicitly for Mankind. Culture X predicted that intelligent life would develop on Earth and eventually achieve space flight; the statue is a message of greeting and goodwill spanning the gulf of time between its creators' ancient extinction and the arrival of the space travelers from Earth. A science writer, Randolph Mays, arrives with his pilot and his secretary. Forster takes advantage of a loophole in space law and claims salvage rights to Jupiter V in the name of the World Science Organization. Mays tries to steal \\"The Ambassador\\" and other art objects, but Forster turns Mays' companions against him, forcing him to return the stolen items.Arthur C. Clarke: Reach for Tomorrow.

Samuelson.David N. Samuelson: Arthur C. Clarke (1917–). In: Richard Bleiler (ed.): Science Fiction Writers. Critical Studies of the Major Authors from the Early Nineteenth Century to the Present Day. Charles Scribner’s Sons, New York 1982, p. 315 Thus, it represents one of few cases in which Clarke overcame his \\"reluctance to tell traditional action- adventure story in the pulp tradition\\" due to \\"his literary allegiances and a desire to downplay the thoughtless romanticism evident in such tales of derring-do\\" (Samuelson). Critic David Samuelson, describes the work as not having significant literary importance. Influence The idea of an artifact left behind by a spacefaring alien race for humans to discover after they achieved space flight also showed up in \\"The Sentinel\\", a 1948 (published 1951) Clarke short story about the discovery of an ancient artifact on the Moon and the major basis for 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1968 novel and film Clarke developed in partnership with director Stanley Kubrick. However, the artifacts in \\"Sentinel\\" and \\"Odyssey\\" are speculated on in-story (in \\"Sentinel\\") or explicitly stated (in the novel version of \\"Odyssey\\") as being set as a warning to the alien race that humans were in space. Early drafts of the 2001 novel did include the moon Jupiter V as the location where the Star Gate was located, instead of on Iapetus as in the final version of the novel, with revelation that Jupiter V had been artificially sculpted and placed into its precise orbit by the builders of the Star Gate.Arthur C.

As a footballer, Noble was a Great Britain representative , but is best known for his coaching career, during which he coached the Bradford Bulls, the Wigan Warriors, the Crusaders RL and the Salford Red Devils in the Super League, and the Great Britain national team. He was the first coach to win three Super League Grand Finals, and is one of only two coaches to have achieved that feat along with Brian McDermott. He was formerly the Director of Rugby for the Toronto Wolfpack, and also works as a pundit for BBC Sport.  Background  Noble was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England.  Playing career  Brian Noble's early rugby league career was as a member of the Police Boys' Clubs before he signed for Bradford Northern. His début came in the 1978-79 season and was the beginning of almost 15 years and over 400 games with the club, concluding in the centenary season of 1995-96 following a spell at Wakefield Trinity (Heritage № 1062). Noble combined his professional career with his job as a policeman, and captained Great Britain on the Lions' tour of Australasia in 1984. He played in all seven tests on the tour, including the test in Papua New Guinea. Brian Noble played in Bradford Northern's 5-10 defeat by Castleford in the 1981 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1981–82 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 3 October 1981, played in the 7-18 defeat by Hull F.C. in the 1982 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1981–82 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 2 October 1982, played in the 12-12 draw with Castleford in the 1987 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1987–88 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 17 October 1987, played in the 11-2 victory Castleford in the 1987 Yorkshire County Cup Final replay during the 1987–88 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 31 October 1987. Brian Noble played in Bradford Northern's 2-12 defeat by Warrington in the 1990–91 Regal Trophy Final during the 1990–91 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 12 January 1991, and played (replaced by interchange/substitute Trevor Clark) in the 15-8 defeat by Wigan in the 1992–93 Regal Trophy Final during the 1992–93 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 23 January 1993.  Coaching career   Bradford  After 6 years serving in the backroom staff at the club following his retirement, he was appointed Bradford head coach in November 2000. After initial confusion regarding chairman Chris Caisley's appointment - the tabloids reported that the new coach was Radio 4 comedian Ross Noble! - he was a hugely popular choice to succeed departing coach Matthew Elliott. Noble took Bradford Bulls to the 2001 Super League Grand Final in which they defeated Wigan. As Super League VI champions, Bradford played against 2001 NRL Premiers, the Newcastle Knights in the 2002 World Club Challenge. Noble oversaw Bradford's victory. In July 2002, Noble received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bradford for his achievements as a rugby league footballer, and coach. He took Bradford to the 2002 Super League Grand Final which was lost to St. Helens. He was named Super League coach of the year in 2003 and succeeded David Waite as Great Britain coach following the 2003 Ashes series. Noble took Bradford to the Grand Final again in 2004 but lost out to local rivals Leeds Rhinos 16-8 at Old Trafford. Noble led Bradford to victory in the 2005 Super League Grand Final his third Championship in five years with the club. Noble left Bradford midway through the 2006 season to join Wigan, handing control to his assistant Steve McNamara. While head coach of the Bradford Bulls, Noble guided the them to two Minor Premiership titles, victory in three Grand Finals in 2001, 2003 and 2005, victory in the Challenge Cup in 2003 and to three World Club Championships in 2002, 2004 and 2006. In 2004 he received the Rugby League International Federation's coach of the year award. Harlequins RL  Wigan  On 20 April 2006 Noble took up the position of head coach at Wigan, nine days after the sacking of Ian Millward. Brian took over at the club during a relegation battle which at one point looked as though Wigan would lose, however he has been credited for keeping Wigan in Super League following a number of impressive performance. However, despite having just £60,000 available to spend under the salary cap, Noble bought Stuart Fielden and Michael Dobson from the Bradford Bulls for a world record £450,000. At the end of the season when the club's books were audited by the league's accountants, it was found there was an unauthorised overspend of £222,314, which led to allegations that the club cheated their way out of relegation by deliberately spending money they didn't have due to salary cap restrictions. However the club was eventually only found guilty of \\"breaching the spirit of the cap\\", by trying to restructure existing contracts. On 17 January 2007 it was announced that his contract as head coach of the British national team would not be renewed. In October 2009, after the defeat by St Helens in the semi-final play-off game, Noble announced he would be leaving to club.  Crusaders RL  On 14 October 2009 Noble was confirmed as the new head coach of the Welsh side Crusaders. Jon Sharp was first-team coach, and Iestyn Harris was an assistant. In the 2010 season Noble managed to gain 13 wins, which was a vast improvement on the season before, and took them into the play offs for the first time. In November 2010, Noble confirmed his departure from Crusaders Rugby League after only one season in charge. His last match as Head Coach was an 18-12 loss away to Huddersfield in an Elimination Play-off tie.  Salford  On 13 April 2013 Noble was appointed head coach of Salford on an 18-month contract, but on 4 April 2014, Marwan Koukash announced that Noble would become the director of football at Salford, while Noble's former assistant Iestyn Harris would become the new head coach.http://www.superleague.co.uk/article/29909/harris-appointed-head-coach- at He departed the club soon after. Following his departure from Salford, Noble worked in a part-time consultancy basis with London Broncos and Gloucestershire All Golds, while regularly appearing as a pundit and occasionally as a co-commentator on BBC Sport's rugby league coverage.  Honours  Noble was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to rugby league and charity.

The former is known for many species of avifauna and the latter park is rich in mammals and predators. In addition, many other forest reserves are noted in the country but are not easily accessible, well protected or adequately surveyed for its wildlife resources. The protected area system of Benin defined as National Protected Area System is situated in the northern Benin, mostly with a woody savanna ecosystem. It covers 10.3% of the national territory and is part of the three nation transboundary W-Arly-Pendjari (WAP) complex (with area distribution of 43% in Benin, 36% in Burkina Faso and 21% in Niger). Forests of particular note are the Riparian forests which form a dominant ecosystem, accounting for ⅓ of the estimated flora of 3,000 species in Benin. These forests are found along river banks consisting of semi-deciduous, dry, and open forest and woodland savanna. However, these systems have been subject to severe misuse by way of deforestation, which necessitated the enforcement of a Law, which imposes restrictions on cutting of these forests. In south Benin, where malaria is a common disease as in the rest of Africa, medicinal plants are used for treatment as an alternative to allopathic medicine. National parks W National Park W National Park, IUCN Management Category II, a transboundary park among Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso, as a part of the Niger River, encompasses an area of in Benin; the prefix \\"W\\" is after the W-shaped bends in the Niger River that border's the park and which is fed the Tapoa River in the north, and the Mékrou River in the south. It is set in attitudinal range of 170 to 338 m. In addition, the buffer zones are the hunting zones of Mékrou , Djona and Kompa , apart from transition areas in a zone. This area in the West African savanna belt covers terrestrial, semi- aquatic and aquatic ecosystems. Primarily of semi-arid to semi-humid Sudanese wooded savanna, 500 plant species have been identified. Sudanese savanna fauna consists of 70 diurnal mammals and more than 112 species of fish including monkfish Squatina aculeata. The park has about 200,000 people living within it and on its periphery, which creates conflicts between park managers, herders and farmers. Pendjari National Park The Pendjari National Park is an area of , located entirely in Benin, in the far north-west of Benin. In addition it has buffer zones namely, the Pendjari (348,000 ha) that incorporates the hunting zones of Pendjari-Porga (76,000 ha), Batia (75,500 ha) and Konkombri (25,900 ha). Initially known as forest reserve, it was declared a National Park on May 6, 1961 after the independence of Benin. In June 1986, it was classified as a MAB Biosphere Reserve (including the adjoining hunting zones of Pendjari and Atacora) and in February 2007, the Pendjari River Valley was recognized as a Ramsar Site of wetland importance. The park is part of the W-Arli-Pendjari complex (WAP), which is a vast protected area in Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. The hills and cliffs of the Atakora range make the north-west one of the most scenic areas of Benin. They provide a wonderful backdrop to the Pendjari National Park, which, in its isolation, remains one of the most interesting in West Africa. Riparian forests Riparian forest along a river bank/lake shore Riparian forests in Benin are important conservation sites that need more care than is currently available. These forests, which are flood-dependent and the flora that is dependent on this source of water, are seen in many parts of Benin. However, forest and savanna species are also part of this ecosystem as they have a combination of plants from various forest and savanna types. Hence, the riparian forests have been found to be more diverse than those of the single one-ecosystem-based vegetation. They also provide the needed categories of food for many animal and other forest species to survive. The riparian forests ecosystem is in a limited area and spread in a linear shape. The forests account for at least one-third of the estimated 3,000 species of flora of Benin, with several valuable, rare or even endemic species. These forests are woodlands of semi-deciduous, dry, and open forest, and woodland savanna that occur along riverbanks or along streams. The physiognomy of this type of forest is highly variable with trees of average height of and some places as high with dense understorey. Adjacent more open ecosystems also affect the vegetation in these forests. However, this ecosystem of hygrophile and edaphic freshwater forests is of general structural complexity and extent. It was in a state of extinction due to \\"shifting cultivation, grazing, selective cutting of valuable or rare tree species, road and dam construction, and over- exploitation of non-timber forest products\\" to meet the basic needs of rural community. This misuse also resulted in degradation of the ecosystem of rare plants and animals. It reached a chronic stage when indigenous multilayered plant communities became extinct in several areas with resultant creation of open fields, shrubs or grass savanna of least value. Thus, degradation of the ecologically rich system necessitated intervention at the Government level through enabling legislation to stop further damage to the ecosystem. The government of the Republic of Benin enacted a new forest law (no. 93-009) in July 1993, under which the uniqueness of riparian forests as refuge ecosystem for plant and wildlife of many kinds, was duly recognized. The rules enacted clearly defined that \\"clearance of wood and shrubs is not allowed within at both sides of any waterway (article 28). Moreover, in the management plans of most forest reserves in Benin, gallery forests are to be left uncut, and rare species (e.g. Khaya spp. (Meliaceae), Milicia exelsa (Moraceae)) outside the gallery forests will not be cut either.\\" In spite of such a legislation the enforcement is not effective as it is reported that uncontrolled and unplanned, mostly illegal utilisation of the forests resources continues, particularly in non-protected areas. Fauna The major faunal groups in Benin are mammals, birds, reptiles and many more. Mammals Predators include: the lion (panthera leo), the largest predator of Africa (found in both parks); the leopard (panthera pardus) a secretive large African cat (found even outside the two parks); the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is in the national parks but is a rare sight; several (Felis silvestris), a smaller cat; the caracal (Caracal caracal), the African wild cat (Felis sylvestris); the African hunting dog (Lycaon pictus) said to be in W. Park (may be extinct); side-striped jackal (Canis adustus); the black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas); the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) found in both parks. Nocturnal predators include: the African civet (civettictis civetta) – a bulky long haired animal; small-spotted genet (Genetta genetta) and the large-spotted genet (Genetta tigrina) found in both parks; the spotted-necked otter (Lutra maculicollis), ratel or honey badger (Mellivora capensis); many mongoose species such as the marsh mongoose (Atilax paludinosus), the Egyptian large grey mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon), cusimanse (Crossarchus obscurus), the white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda); slender or pygmy mongoose (Galerella sanguinea), solitary inhabitant of the savanna; and Gambian mongoose (mungos gambianus). Mammals found here include: African bush elephant (loxodonta Africana) found widely in savannas, deserts, rainforest, and in the national parks; hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) found in rivers of both parks; the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) an ox like animal in large herds in savannas and in smaller groups in parks; warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) in both parks; the aardvark (Orycteropus afer) insectivore found in savannas; pangolins; hedgehogs; porcupine species; rock hyrax (Procavia capensis); Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris). ;Antelopes The parks and other areas have a major population of antelope. 17 species are identified, out of which the endangered species are sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus) and korrigum (Damaliscus korrigum korrigum). Other species of various status are: grey duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia); bushbuck; Maxwell's duiker (Philantomba maxwellii); red-flanked duiker (Cephalophus rufilatus); black duiker (Cephalophus niger); yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus silvicultor) (vulnerable); grey duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia); bohor reedbuck (Redunca redunca); waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) found near water sources; Buffon's kob (Kobus kob); roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) found more in both parks but more in Pendjari; western hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus major) ungainly in appearance; red-fronted gazelle (Eudorcas rufifrons); and oribi (Ourebia ourebi), more abundant in Pendjari Park than in W National Park.Butler (2006), pp. 3–5 ;Primates Primates reported include: olive baboon (Papio anubis) of large size with inverted “U” shaped tail; the green monkey (cercopithecus sabaeus), the most common monkey species; the red monkey or patas (Erythrocebus patas) with an orange tinged coat) found in Northern Benin.  Reptiles  Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) the largest living reptile seen in river banks and ponds in the two protected parks, the dwarf caiman, smaller and docile species of chameleons in 100 colour variations.Butler 2006, p.12-13 Tortoises are: leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis), several species of terrapin and turtles – out of eight species of marine turtles four are found in Benin coast, namely, the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) and leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). The indigenous hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is the source of traditional tortoiseshell).Butler 2006, p.14 Lizards found are harmless and of two types, the water and savanna monitors – Varanus niloticus and Varanus exanthematicus – both are predatory species; house gecko (Hemidactylus mabouia), a translucent white lizard; agama species in large size of varied mixed colours and the skinks.Butler 2006, p.15-16 Birds Birds are a special feature in all types of habitats ranging from rainforest to deserts in Benin, which have two main climatic zones, namely the thick tropical vegetation in the south and the dry savannas and light woodlands in the north. The birding sites for coastal waders are the coastal lagoons of Les Bouches du Roi and the backwaters of Ouidha beach. Water birds and forest birds are found in Lake Nokoué and Lake Ahémé. Feathered birds are found in granite rock hills near Dassa-Zoume. The national parks are full of savanna specific birds.Butler 2006, p.10-12 The weaver species reported are: 12 species of weavers of family Ploceidae are found in Benin, out of the overall 111 of the genus Ploceus (true weavers) identified; they are larger than a sparrow, males are more colourful than female species. Other reported species are golden weaver, masked weaver (Ploceus velatus), common Vieillot's black weaver (Ploceus nigerrimus), black weavers (Ploceus melanogaster), grosbeak weaver (Amblyospiza albifrons), sparrow and buffalo weavers dideric cuckoo (Chrysococcyx caprius), a handsome white cuckoo (Coracina pectoralis) which lays its eggs in weavers nests. More species of birds are: guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), black-and-white-chicken-like cuckoo found in North Benin, Abyssinian ground hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus), a large distinctive bird; the marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus); the crowned crane (Balearica pavonina), a tall grey-black bird; the saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), a large white bird with black wings.Butler 2006, p.11-12 Birds also include puff adder and mamba. Raptors are vultures (Gyps) species found in both parks, which are carion-eating birds. A common sight is the African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer) species, which is black and white in colour.  Molluscs   Insect  Insect species found in Benin include the tsetse fly and many vectors of epidemic diseases.  Flora  Dense forests are not recorded in Benin. Along the coastal areas coconut, palmyra palms, oil palms are seen up to Abomey, where after vegetation is savanna merged with that of Guinea and Sudan. Other tree species noted are ebony, shea nut, kapok, fromager, and Senegal mahogany trees. The W National Park constitutes the southern limit of tiger bush plateau distribution. Riverine and gallery forests are noted on the banks of the Mekrou River (with seasonal flows), and other tributaries of the Niger River. The plains have extensive coverage of grasses. In the savanna woodlands, grassland and stunted savanna woodlands, the plant species recorded are the Terminalia avicennioides, Anogeissus leiocarpus, hackberry Clematis integrifolia clematis, Boscia senegalensis, Balanites aegyptiaca, kapok tree (Bombax costatum), African locust (Parkia biglobosa), camel's foot tree, Senna reticulata, baobab (Adansonia digitata), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), Prosopis africana, (Piliostigma reticulatum). In the evergreen gallery forests, sausage tree, (Kigelia africana) and African mahogany (Khaya senegalensis) are found. Orchid species recorded are the Eulophia cucculata and Eulophia guineensis. The Pendjari park consists of; grasslands which have no trees or shrubs; shrub lands which are fully covered by grass; Arborous savanna vegetation; wooded savanna formations with contiherbaceous layer but with no undergrowth; forests along the river, thin forests with plenty of trees of size of 8–16 m; and gallery forests which are dense with shrubs. The rocky cliffs of the Pendjari National Park are sparsely wooded. The Volta depression has savanna ecosystem with woodlands and rare species such as Burkea africana, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Pterocarpus erinaceus, Detarium microcarpum, Lannea acida, Sterculia setigera, Combretum ghasalense and Acacia spp. On the deep soils of some of the summits and the Atakora escarpment one finds a greater variety of plant species with Isoberlinia doka and Afzelia africana. The Pendjari River has an impressive gallery forest and river forest. The park includes both Sudan and North Guinea savannas, with areas of grassland dominated by Acacia sieberiana and Terminalia macroptera. The most common species found in the \\"riparian forests\\" are: Pterocarpus santalinoides (Papilionaceae), Cola laurifolia (Sterculiaceae) and Syzygium guineense (Myrtaceae), out of which a few species are endemic and valuable. ;Herbal cure Malaria, which is a virulent disease in Benin as in the rest of Africa, is treated by alternative medicines. The alternative treatment locally practiced in southern Benin is based on several plant species that are extracted and administered orally. Such extracts are also used for bathing. Plant species listed for treatment are 85, which are used to make 35 mixtures for treatment. ;Botanical garden The phytodiversity of Western Africa is being preserved at the Papatia Botanical Garden in northern Benin. This garden, which is spread over an area of 12 ha, is a species-rich savanna area where an inventory of hundred woody plants and several hundred of herbaceous species has been maintained. A tree-nursery is part of this garden created to increase rare species. Organizations According to the Strategic Plan for the Conservation and Management of Protected Areas approved in 1994, organization such as the National Centre for Wildlife Management (or Centre National de Gestion des Réserves de la Faune – CENAGREF) was created in 1996 for the sole purpose of the conservation and management of national parks including the buffer zones and the transition areas. The Direction of Pendjari National Park set up in 1996 and the Direction of W National Park set up in 1999 are administrative organizations under the CENAGREF that are responsible for the management of the parks. The Association of Civil Communities in the Protected Areas of the W National Park and the Séri Zone (Association des Communes Riveraines aux Aires Protégées du Parc W et de la Zone de Séri – ACRAP/WS) and Village Associations for the Management of Wildlife Reserves (or Associations Villageoise de Gestion des Reserves de Faune -AVIGREF) were also set up with the responsibility community training and promoting multi-level communication between farmers and other stakeholders and capacity building and the development of effective governance following decentralized resource management. IUCN has associated with these organizations to address all aspects of management of the natural resources of the W National Park.

Biography In September 1646, Anthony Hungerford, then Major Hungerford, pressed for a commission as governor of the parliamentarian garrison at Stoke and for an appointment as Major of the standing companies in Shropshire. In March 1647 the parliament seems to have accepted his services, and as a Colonel, sent him to Ireland, where he landed on 30 April 1647. He was colonel of a regiment at Drogheda in 1648.

In July 1652 the council of state granted him £100 to enable him to return to Ireland. Cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1651-2, p. 610. He was in 1653 a prisoner for debt in the \\"upper bench\\" in London, and petitioned parliament for payment of his commission as a debtor. According to a certificate from Sir John Danvers, he was \\"of most honest and religious conversation, very free from the common vices of swearing, drunkenness, &c.;, and most valiant and faithful\\" in the service of the parliament. He obtained leave to return to Ireland, but on 28 March 1654 his regiment was disbanded, and he himself was left in urgent need. A weekly pension of 20s. was granted him by the Council of State on 17 April 1655. Cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1651-2. He died on 9 June 1657. Cites: Thurloe, State Papers, vi. 594. Family Sir Bernard Burke writing in 1884, based on information supplied by William Roberts (the Ulster Herald between 1643 and 1655), said that Anthony Hungerford was descended from Sir John Hungerford of Down Ampney in Gloucestershire, (Anthony's great-grandfather) through his second son Henry Hungerford of Marston in Wiltshire, whose son, also Henry Hungerford of Marston was Anthony's father. William John Hardy writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, in a volume published in 1891, suggested that he may possibly have been the \\"brother or half-brother of the royalist Anthony, for the Hungerfords often gave the same Christian name to more than one of their children\\", but Stephen Wright updating Hardy's article for the Oxford Dictionary of Biography suggests that \\"he may have been the son of Thomas Hungerford, gentleman of Garsdon, Wiltshire. As a young child he was acquainted with Sir John Danvers (d. 1655) of Dauntsey, an estate close to properties owned by a junior branch of the Hungerford family at Garsdon. For this reason he could be the Anthony Hungerford who on 9 November 1632 matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, at the age of seventeen, the son of Thomas of Garsdon\\". In 1658 his widow, Chrisagon, petitioned Oliver Cromwell for relief. The petition was passed to the committee at Ely House, but no record exists as to whether she was granted relief.

His real name was Tanaka Jun.  Biography  He was born in what is now Tochigi City, Tochigi Prefecture, as the son of a local sculptor. Interested in art at an early age, he won his first award for a watercolor painting at the age of 7. In 1926, he enrolled in the Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko (the predecessor to the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music), where he specialized in Nihonga painting, but left after a few months without graduating due to his father's illness and lack of funds. From 1938, he lived at various locations in Chiba Prefecture, and although his future initially seemed promising, his isolation from the mainstream art circles meant that he had difficulty in establishing a name. He was forced to work at numerous odd jobs to stay alive, while attempting to paint on the side. In the years of World War II, he endured illness and poverty. It was only in 1947, in an exhibition sponsored by Kawabata Ryūshi, that his name became known to the art world. In 1958, at the age of 50, he decided to relocate to Amami Ōshima, where he found employment at a silk factory, earning just enough for a frugal life. He continued to paint, using the nature of Amami Ōshima for inspiration, and his output through the 1960s and early 1970s was prolific. Tanaka Isson died in 1977 of a heart attack at the age of 69. After his death, his life and the style of his works were compared with that of Paul Gauguin on the Japanese national television (NHK)'s Sunday Art Museum program, and in 2001, a memorial art museum was established in his honor near the airport on Amami Ōshima. In 2018 his work was exhibited outside Japan for the first time. Philately One of Isson's paintings (Amami Forest, palm trees and bougainvillea) was selected by Japan Post for a commemorative postage stamp in 2003, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the reversion of the Amami islands to Japanese administration.

Namibia's endangered species include wild dog, black rhino, oribi and puku. Endangered Species The puku antelope is limited to about 100 individuals along the Chobe River in Botswana and the Linyati marshes in Namibia. The black and white rhino have suffered the most from poaching and are on the verge of extinction. If there had been no effort to save them in the last 20 years they most likely would have disappeared altogether. While both species occur naturally in Namibia, in many of the reserves they have been reintroduced. The country also has the largest population in southern Africa of cheetah not contained within national parks. There are over twenty species of antelope ranging from the largest, the eland, to the smallest, the Damara dik-dik. The gemsbok, a striking antelope with long symmetrical horns and distinctive black and white markings is featured on the Namibian coat of arms. Namibia also harbours a wealth of small mammals including mongoose, jackal as well as the less common antbear and honey badger, both solitary and nocturnal. National parks and nature reserves Namibia's parks and reserves range from the open bush of the centre and the north where wildlife is relatively plentiful, to the barren and inhospitable coastal strip with its huge sand dunes.

In 1992, he won a seat on the Westminster City Council, becoming the first Vietnamese-born person to be elected into a political office in the United States. Prior to being elected, Lam had been living in America for 17 years, and owned the Vien Dong restaurant in Garden Grove. He was also a respected community leader, secretary of the Vietnamese Lions Club in Westminster, and the first vice president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Orange County. Although Westminster had one of the largest concentrations of Vietnamese immigrants in the United States, Lam was not primarily voted in by his fellow Vietnamese. His winning total was about 6,500 votes, but only 2,000 Vietnamese-Americans in the city were eligible to vote. His campaign had the backing of the police, the Mayor and local mobile-home owners. He defeated another Vietnamese candidate, Jimmy Tong Nguyen, for the Westminster City Council seat. In 1999, Lam bore the fury of many Vietnamese immigrants when he refused to join in demonstrations protesting against a video-game store that displayed a poster of Ho Chi Minh and a communist Vietnamese flag. City attorneys had advised him to \\"stay neutral\\". For this, his restaurant was picketed, and people burnt effigies of him, calling him a \\"communist sympathizer\\". At the height of the controversy, the protesters raised the possibility of Lam's recall from office. Even his wife called on him to resign, but he refused. Lam served for a decade on the City Council over three terms, until he decided not to seek re-election in 2002.

With its headquarters in Kabul, NDS has field offices and training facilities in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. It also has special agents stationed in Afghan embassies around the world. Development The National Directorate of Security was founded as the primary domestic and foreign intelligence agency of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in 2002, and is considered the successor to KHAD, which was the previous intelligence organization before the Afghan Civil War (1992–2001). Organisation The NDS is part of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF),(MOI is taken i.e. understood to refer to the Ministry of Interior according to page 62, not Ministry of Information) and reports directly to the Office of the President. Operations NDS members in 2013 As the primary intelligence organ of Afghanistan, the NDS shares information with ministries of Afghanistan and with provincial authorities. The NDS also cooperates with the American CIA, the Indian RAW, the Pakistani ISI, and other NATO intelligence agencies. After the ouster of the Taliban in 2002, the NDS warned ISI about exiled militant commanders and al-Qaeda operatives hiding in Pakistan. In early 2006, intelligence gathered from NDS detainees suggested Osama bin Laden resided in the western Pakistan town of Mansehra. A classified NDS paper completed in May, titled \\"Strategy of the Taliban,\\" claimed ISI and Saudi Arabia restarted active support for the Taliban in 2005. Pakistan's military leadership sought to weaken and delegitimize Hamid Karzai's government, in order to prevent an alliance between Afghanistan and India. In 2007, Amrullah Saleh's NDS used arrests and interrogations to discover the majority of suicide bombings in Afghanistan originated among Paushtuns from Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. During the April 2014 Afghan Presidential Election, the NDS, under Rahmatullah Nabil, collected thousands of signals intelligence indicating Ashraf Ghani's allies organized massive electoral fraud. The NDS has had a degree of success, including capturing Maulvi Faizullah,reportage a notable Taliban leader, and foiling an assassination attempt against Abdul Rashid Dostum in 2014.

He has played one game for Queensland in State of Origin. He played at and previously played for the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, with whom he won the 2008 and 2011 Premierships. Early years Matt Ballin at the celebration of the winning of the 2008 NRL Grand Final Ballin playing for Manly Although he was born in Nanango, Queensland, Australia, Ballin grew up in Kingaroy and attended Kingaroy State High School where his father was the school principal. Ballin played his junior football with the Kingaroy Red Ants, and although he played in the lower grades with the Brisbane Broncos, he did not play first grade for the club. Playing career 2005-2014 Ballin signed with Sydney based club Manly-Warringah and made his NRL debut in Round 2 of the 2007 NRL season when the Sea Eagles defeated the Wests Tigers 19–8 at Leichhardt Oval, scoring a try in his first grade debut. He played in Manly's record breaking 40–0 victory over the Melbourne Storm in the 2008 NRL Grand Final where he was the game's first try scorer. Ballin played in the 2011 NRL Grand Final giving Ballin his second NRL premiership as a player. Coming off contract at the end of season 2012, rumours were rampant that Ballin would be a casualty of Manly's post-premiership(s) salary cap pressures, with the Canberra Raiders the front runners to secure his signature. However, after the departure of test back rower Tony Williams to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Manly were able to re-sign Ballin, and Brett Stewart, to new long- term contracts keeping them at the club until the end of the 2015 and 2016 seasons respectively, effectively ensuring both remain one-club players. Ballin played every game for Manly in 2012 and finished the season as the league's leading tackler. 2015 In mid-2015, Ballin signed a two-year extension of his contract that would see him remain at Manly until the end of 2017. However, just a couple of months later he was one of 14 players who were reportedly told that he would not be required at the club beyond 2015. Additionally, Manly had signed South Sydney's 2014 premiership hooker Api Koroisau from Penrith as well as Brisbane Broncos hooker Matt Parcell. Ballin vowed to stay where he was and fight for his spot, even going so far as to say that he was prepared to play in Manly's New South Wales Cup team if it meant staying with the club. However, in Manly's shock 20–16 home loss to Parramatta in Round 24 of the 2015 season, Ballin suffered his second season-ending injury in consecutive years when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee.Matt Ballin’s Manly future is uncertain after suspected ACL tear On 3 November, despite earlier stating he would fight for his spot at the Sea Eagles, Ballin signed a 2-year contract with the Wests Tigers starting in 2016. 2016 Returning from injury, Ballin did not make his debut for Wests Tigers until round 11. Soon after he suffered another season-ending ACL knee injury. \\"I played two NRL games and once in reserve grade – and I felt I contributed in those games – but obviously it wasn't enough footy. I want to be a bigger part of the team this year and play a lot more games. It's been an empty feeling sitting on the sidelines and not being able to help my teammates. When these things happen I suppose you learn to help them in different ways,\\" he said.  2017  Ballin made only one appearance for the Wests Tigers during the 2017 season. On 26 June 2017, Ballin announced his immediate retirement from the NRL due to chronic injuries. Representative career In April 2009, he was named in the preliminary 25-man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009. However he did not make an appearance. In 2010, with injury to Melbourne's Cameron Smith, Ballin was named in the Queensland side and played in Game 1 of the series at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney, won 28-24 by the Maroons. With Smith returning from injury, Ballin wasn't considered for the rest of the series, though he was on standby for the team should Smith's injury re-occur. Personal life Ballin was voted the 2008 Adidas \\"Sexiest Man in League\\". He also works as a personal fitness trainer specialising in fitness and weight loss. Ballin is an Australian Apprenticeships Ambassador for the Australian Government.

Built in 1901, it was acquired by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1910. The station was used for passenger train service throughout the 20th century and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. It is currently used as a visitor center and office for the adjacent Cardinal Greenway.  History  The station was built in 1901 by the Cincinnati, Richmond and Muncie Railroad (CR&M;), which was acquired by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) in 1910. The C&O; ended passenger service to Muncie in 1949, but the station was used for freight service until 1950 when the Muncie Gear Works became its new tenant. In 1973, Chessie System (which eventually became CSX Transportation) restored the station for passenger service so it could be used by Amtrak on the James Whitcomb Riley and George Washington routes (which eventually became the Cardinal). The station was again removed from passenger service when the Cardinal was rerouted in 1986. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 14, 1997. Restoration of the station began in 2003. The restoration was completed and the building reopened to the public on June 5, 2005. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. The building is now used as a visitor center and office for the Cardinal Greenway recreation trail, which uses the former C&O; right-of-way. On display inside are photos and artifacts from the region's railroad history as well as photographs of the surrounding communities. Although the former C&O; track has since been removed, a second parallel track, now owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway, remains in operation; it is separated from the Cardinal Greenway trail by a safety fence.

The game was released digitally, for Microsoft Windows on 22 March 2007, and for OS X on 8 June 2011. A port to iOS, entitled Bus Driver - Pocket Edition, was released to the App Store by Meridian4 on 27 February 2014.  Gameplay  The player selects a route from tiers (described below), and then after a short loading time, the player sees the selected bus either at a bus depot or terminal. After halting at the first stop, the bus must be driven along the correct route (indicated at intersections by orange arrows) whilst obeying all traffic rules and stopping at all bus stops. If the player fails to do so, points will be taken from their score. When the game begins, one tier of routes, which includes six buses, is available. In total, there are six tiers, thirty-six routes and thirteen buses (seventeen in Temsa Edition). In order to unlock the next tier, the player must drive at least four of the routes successfully. As the game progresses, routes become more tedious. The player will lose points if they disobey traffic laws (going out of lane without using blinkers, driving on the wrong side of the road, hitting other vehicles, hitting obstacles like streetlamp), upset passengers (by braking too hard or causing accidents) or they depart from the bus stop too early, honking at the passengers to make them board faster at the bus stop or even if they leave passengers waiting at a bus stop. Conversely, the player will gain points for obeying traffic laws, safe driving and being punctual. Despite being a game set in the United States, many of the bus stop names and cities are named after areas of London, including Debden, Collier Row, Feltham, Potters Bar and the terminus Westminster. If the player scores points more than 0, then the drive would be a successful drive. If the players score less points than 0, then it will be an unsuccessful drive. There are two camera angles (bumper and chase view). Occasionally, there are visuals of rain. If there is rain happening, then the wipers will function automatically. You can also switch on the blinkers. There is an accelerator and an brake. There is steering as well. Each drive will take place during the day, or at nighttime, depending to the route described. After you choose the route, you can view the description of the route and bus no. before you start the game. There is a time table. There is also a tab showing what is the distance to the next bus stop.  Buses  The game contains a variety of buses which are based on real life buses. As a game set in the United States, most of the buses are based on American designs, however, there are some which are based on European designs since the game was made in the Czech Republic. The buses included are 3 MCI 102D3 (known as GNR-13 LE, including a jail variant which is known as GNR-13 Eco), a Ford B-Series school bus (known as Toucan), a MCI D4500 coach (known as Gryphon Birdie), 2 NovaBus RTS-06 (known as Niva WS-27 Cityroamer), 2 Setra S415HDH (known as Sista XT), 2 Renault Agora S (known as Remark EU) and a Volvo B7TL Wright Eclipse Gemini double decker (known as Velven 18). The Temsa Edition included the Temsa Avenue, Temsa Tourmalin IC, Temsa Opalin, Temsa Safari HD and the Temsa Diamond.  Tiers  The initial game contains five tiers. An additional tier was added in Bus Driver Temsa Edition and in Bus Driver Gold Edition. Each tier contains six different routes. In order to unlock the next tier, the player must drive at least four of the routes successfully. As the game progresses, routes become longer and more complicated. As mentioned above, you have to score more than 0 points to complete each level. Therefore, you have to maintain an formal speed which gives you advantages: 1. You will reach the destination in time. 2. You can brake slowly so that passengers are not disappointed at sharp braking. 3. You will get points for reaching in time and obeying traffic signals.  Reception  Bus Driver was not designed as a bus simulator, but is often considered to be one. Reviewers have suggested that an inside view would improve the gameplay; however, the developers have stated that this was omitted because the game was not designed to be an exact simulator.

Life He was born in Evesham, Worcestershire England, the son of Thomas Watson and Agnes née Weeks. Thomas Watson was born in Evesham around 1491 and in 1544 purchased part of the former Evesham Abbey lands and the lordship of Bengeworth, across the River Avon from Evesham town.

It features an international cast including the U.S. actors Martin Balsam, Alex Nicol and the Franco-Italian Serge Reggiani. Nino Manfredi was rejected for the starring role because Alberto Sordi wanted it. The film is set during the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943. It is one of the most famous films of the Commedia all'italiana genre. It also belongs to a large genre of Italian films about Italy during the chaos after the invasion and double occupation of September 1943 - others include Rome, Open City, Paisan, General Della Rovere, Violent Summer, Long Night in 1943, Escape by Night, Two Women, The Fascist, The Abandoned, The Four Days of Naples, and Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Plot Along the Venetian seaside, on the morning of September 8, 1943, Alberto Innocenzi, junior NCO of the Royal Italian Army is shocked when (in response to the separate surrender signed by the Badoglio government in Cassibile) the former allies of the Wehrmacht surround and take by storm the base where he's stationed. Innocenzi, along with some disbanded soldiers, manages to distance the German troops and is thoroughly shocked when, contrary to his plan of finding a higher echelon to which to report, most of the men accept the fact that the war is over for them and \\"everybody should just go home\\". This reaction at first angers him, but in the end he joins army engineer Ceccarelli and sergeant Fornaciari in discarding their uniforms for civilian clothes and heading southwards for a veritable odyssey along the Italian \\"boot\\", cut in two by German and Allied occupation and wracked by partisan warfare, bloody reprisals, German press-ganging and other perils. The trio meets a band of anti-fascist guerrillas but decline to join them (while an Italian army captain they met along the road does). Later Innocenzi, caught in the \\"everybody for himself\\" mentality which seems to dominate the landscape, succumbs to the temptation of abandoning his mates to help a sultry black marketeer smuggle a load of flour to Rome, as she needs a driver and does not have room for any other passengers. The deal goes awry due to a mechanical failure in a rubble-strewn town where the famished populace plunders the lorry, and after some recriminations and a brief scuffle, Innocenzi rejoins his companions. They witness the killing of a rookie, a naive Italian soldier who tried to protect a Jewish girl during a German roundup; finally they manage to reach Fornaciari's rural home. The former sergeant is delighted of having returned to his young wife, children and old father and offers Innocenzi and Ceccarelli hospitality for the night; his wife reveals that the family has been hiding a former U.S. POW who escaped from the Folpiano prison camp to protect him from the fascist militia patrols and Fornaciari, albeit grudgingly, accepts to keep protecting him. After a darkly humorous polenta dinner (served farm-style with salsa over a wooden table, where Innocenzi and the U.S. officer end up arguing over the right of reaching for the sausage length placed at the table's centre) they all go to sleep but a nighttime fascist patrol breaks in and manages to find the Allied serviceman. Amidst the children's cries and his wife's weeping, Fornaciari is hauled away toward a grim fate, and Ceccarelli and Innocenzi flee the premises without being able to help. The couple manages to reach Littoria (now Latina), where Innocenzi's widowed father lives alone and offers Ceccarelli (who is Neapolitan) to stay a few days before resuming his travel south. Innocenzi is shocked when his father introduces him to a fascist party leader who is recruiting men for the army of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, the fascist puppet state instituted by the Germans after the liberation of Benito Mussolini from his Gran Sasso exile. His father angrily responds to his objections, citing the misery he's living in and all the sacrifices he incurred to allow make him to study and become an army officer; a deep rift is created between father and son, and Innocenzi asks Ceccarelli to take him south to Naples as well, to which the engineer happily consents. However, Naples is in grimmer conditions than Rome, directly on the line of fire after the Allied landing at Salerno, barely kept under control by brutal German detachments who round up able-bodied men to send them to Germany as slave workers. To reach the city the duo passes through a roadblock manned by fanatical, hungry fascists; Ceccarelli, generously chooses to sacrifice a suitcase of delicacies he was meant to deliver to the wife of his commanding officer (who had signed his dismissal on health grounds due to his persistent stomach ulcer). The situation (with the offering readily accepted by the roadblock patrol) causes Innocenzi much panic, having had raided the case during a night-time train trip and substituting the goods with stones and newspaper sheets; he urges his companion to run away before the fascists open it, but they are unsuccessful. Innocenzi and Ceccarelli are pressed in an Organisation Todt rubble-clearing chain gang and manage to escape when the city rises against the occupiers in the Four days of Naples. Desperately trying to reach his home, which is just a few blocks away, Ceccarelli is cut down in a hail of German fire, at which time Innocenzi decides that the real war to be waged is that against the Nazi occupiers and joins an insurgent band offering to man the Breda M 37 machine gun they have captured but cannot operate. With a renewed stern look on his face, Innocenzi opens fire against the Germans, bringing the movie to a close.

History The album has a wide diversity of time-signatures. The arrangements are done by Rodrigo Romani of Milladoiro, Brais Maceiras and Seivane. This is her most traditional album till now, with no rock elements, and many traditional songs. Seivane sang two songs (tracks 5 and 12) the first solo, the second with Sonia Lebedynski, sung in Gallego. The liner notes contain a photograph of her playing bagpipes in a procession in folk costume at the age of three. From a technical point of view \\"Xota dos 28 puntos\\" has the most complex playing technique. The liner notes are in Spanish and English. Reception Music critic Peggy Latkovich wrote in her Allmusic review \\"... her playing is confident with a fine rhythmic sweep. The simple arrangements, though a bit dry at times, keep the spotlight on her performance. Since the nasal moan of Galician pipes is an acquired taste for many, this can be seen as a plus or a minus...

History With her second album Alma de Buxo produced by herself, under the artistic supervision of Rodrigo Romaní, Seivane consolidated her position as a Galician musician in the field of folk music. In this album, important artists such as Uxía Senlle, Kepa Junkera and Rodrigo Romaní have made their contributions. A contribution from her grandfather Xosé Seivane is notable. As an innovation, in this piece of work she introduced drums and bass guitar and included some of her own compositions. During 2001 she was one of the finalists in the 2001 Indie Awards, which are awarded by the AFIM each year, in the category of best artist in Contemporary Music worldwide. In 2003 she has collaborated with the well-known Breton bagpipe band, the Bagad Kemper, in recording their last album Sud-Ar Su. She toured with the band and appeared in concerts, in Paris (Nuit Celtique, March 2004), in Nantes (Nuits Celtes, June 2004), in Quimper (Festival de Cornouaille, July 2004) and she also appeared with them at the Festival Interceltique, in Lorient (August 2004). The title means \\"Soul of the boxwood tree\\". It is a play on words, meaning the wooden bagpipe chanters that she plays, and also Seivane herself running through the forest on the cover art. This has a more powerful sound than her first album, with folk-rock arrangements and an orchestra playing a rumba on one track. Track 11 has Seivane's father, Xose Manuel Seivane playing bagpipes in a house session, with background cheering and laughing, followed without a break by a folk-rock band version of the same tune. There are two songs, sung in Gallego. The song \\"Muineira de Alen\\" includes a female chorus. Reception Music critic Chris Nickson wrote in an Allmusic review \\"... Seivane takes a great leap on this record... The first real indication that something different is happening here comes with \\"Roseiras de Abril,\\" featuring a surprisingly strong Seivane vocal on her own song...

History  A Moudge-class ship was first reported to be under construction in 2001. Warship International wrote in 2008 that four ships of this class were under construction: Mowj (376) launched on 22 February 2007, Jamaran (377) launched on 28 November 2007, as well as Azarakhsh (378) and Tondar (379). The first ship, Jamaran is said to be completed and is stationed in the port of Bandar Abbas. Damavand is the second ship in this class. According to OSGEOINT, Damavand was constructed at the Shahid Tamjidi Marine Industries (STMI) fabrication shop on the Caspian Sea at Bandar-e Anzali. The frigate was launched in March 2013. Damavand, based out of Bandar-Anzali on the Caspian Sea, ran aground on a concrete breakwater in the vicinity of its home port on 10 January 2018. It is believed probable that the incident was the result of navigational error, affected by a strong storm in the area which creating high wave heights and low visibility in the area. During the incident six members of the ship's crew fell overboard. Four of those crew members were later rescued, two were considered missing by media sources. The Iranian Navy declined to confirm the reporting. There has been little information released in reference to the cause of the grounding, with exception to statements of wave height and visibility caused by the storm at the time of the grounding. Damavand is currently listed as actively commissioned. Photos from 2018 show that the ship's hull has broken apart from near the waterline approximately at the near the start of the ships aircraft deck. Future units of the Modge class are set to be equipped with the Sayyad-2 anti-aircraft missiles. Classification Sources differ in specifying the type of the class, either as light frigate or corvette. Jane's Fighting Ships classifies the class as FFG of frigate while the Military Balance of the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), designates the ships in the class as FSGM or corvette.

He was the son of Pietro Greco who was killed during a bloody internal feud between the factions of the Greco Mafia clan in Ciaculli and Croceverde Giardini in 1946. His cousin Salvatore Greco \\"Ciaschiteddu\\" was the first ‘secretary’ of the Sicilian Mafia Commission. Position in the Mafia Salvatore Greco \\"the engineer\\" is one of the most enigmatic mafiosi of the Sicilian Cosa Nostra. He was described as the \\"gray eminence of the entire organization, the one who held and pulled the strings, whether the task was to guide the extermination of enemies or to decide on strategies for moving drugs.\\"According to the \\"Giornale di Sicilia\\", July 14, 1982, quoted in Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, p. 138Giovanni Falcone, Paolo Borsellino and the Procura of Palermo, by Peter Schneider & Jane Schneider, ECPR Standing Group Organised Crime Newsletter, May 2002 He joined the masonic lodge Garibaldi in Palermo in 1946.Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, p. 76. Judge Cesare Terranova, who investigated the Grecos and indicted them in the 1960s (when they were already at large), described \\"the engineer\\" as a pivotal figure in the international cigarette and heroin smuggling networks. He travelled constantly to Marseilles, Tangier, Gibraltar, Malta, Milan and Genoa, all crucial nodes in the international trafficking circuit of the Mediterranean. In 1952, \\"the engineer\\"’s name was connected with heroin when a load of six kilograms sent to him by Frank Coppola was intercepted at Alcamo. Greco owned clandestine boats that changed names constantly. First Mafia war The Greco cousins were protagonists in a bloody Mafia war between rival clans in Palermo in the early 1960s – known as the First Mafia War, a second started in the early 1980s –, for the control of the profitable opportunities brought about by rapid urban growth and the illicit heroin trade to North America. The conflict was sparked by a quarrel over an underweight shipment of heroin and the murder of Calcedonio Di Pisa – an ally of the Greco's – in December 1962. The Greco’s suspected the brothers Salvatore and Angelo La Barbera of the attack.Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, p. 65-66Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 103-04 On June 30, 1963 a car bomb exploded near \\"Ciaschiteddu\\" Greco’s house in Ciaculli, killing seven police and military officers sent to defuse it after an anonymous phone call. The outrage over the Ciaculli Massacre changed the Mafia war into a war against the Mafia. It prompted the first concerted anti-mafia efforts by the state in post-war Italy. The Sicilian Mafia Commission was dissolved and of those mafiosi who had escaped arrest many went abroad. Fugitive The repression caused by the Ciaculli Massacre disarranged the Sicilian heroin trade to the United States. Mafiosi were banned, arrested and incarcerated. Control over the trade fell into the hands of a few fugitives: the Greco cousins, Pietro Davì, Tommaso Buscetta and Gaetano Badalamenti.The Rothschilds of the Mafia on Aruba, by Tom Blickman, Transnational Organized Crime, Vol. 3, No. 2, Summer 1997 Salvatore \\"The Engineer\\" was condemned to 10 years at the Trial of the 114 in 1968, but as he had been on the run since 1963, he did not serve a day. Interpol believed he was in Lebanon, where he controlled a slice of the international trafficking channels. Other sources say he moved to Venezuela. Of the two cousins, \\"the engineer\\" was the more accomplished and powerful, according to Interpol and the US Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN). In 1973 they were both given the maximum period of five years of internal banishment at the remote island of Asinara (now a national park), but they were nowhere to be found.Servadio, Mafioso, p. 181. The sister of \\"the engineer\\", Girolama Greco, is married to Antonio Salamone of the San Giuseppe Jato Mafia.

He lived with his half-sister Lauren and his mother, Gwen Choke, who ran the largest shoplifting empire in North London from an armchair in their living room. James didn't know who his father was, though it is revealed in a deleted chapter from Divine Madness (as well as at the end of the book Shadow Wave) that he was a mathematics professor. When James was two years old, his mother gave birth to his half-sister Lauren Zoe Onions (later known as Lauren Adams, taking on the same crypto-surname as her brother). His mother married Lauren's father, Ronald 'Ron' Onions, who was verbally and physically abusive towards James. He is described in The Recruit as being like \\"a loud, smelly rug\\". However, Ron does not live with them and only visits when he wants money from Gwen. Early in the first book, their mother passes away because of a mix of alcohol and pain medication. This results in Lauren living with her father and James staying in a children's home called Nebraska House, because Ron didn't want him. CHERUB life and missions In The Recruit, James begins his CHERUB career. After returning from basic training, he discovers his sister Lauren has also been recruited following the arrest of her father Ron Onions on various charges (including possession of drugs and stolen artefacts, and abusing a minor). James arrives at CHERUB the night after his twelfth birthday and, after learning how to swim under the guidance of Amy Collins, immediately enters Basic Training. He is paired with eleven-year-old Kerry Chang, who has lived at CHERUB since age seven and whose parents died when she was three (when she was placed in a succession of children's homes). Kerry assists James with her well-honed skills and sheer determination, whilst in return, she asks him to help protect her injured knee. Throughout basic training he develops a strong bond with Kerry as well as the six other recruits, Shakeel Dajani, Mo, Gabrielle O'Brien, Callum Reilly, Connor Reilly and Nicole Eddison. First mission James' first mission was with Amy Collins at Fort Harmony, a Welsh 'hippy' camp, founded by a woman named Gladys Dunn. CHERUB was called in to infiltrate and become close to brothers Fire and World Dunn as well as Brian 'Bungle' Evans, all of whom were suspected of being connected to an eco- terrorist organisation named 'Help Earth'. With an event named 'Petrocon' (the largest meeting of oil executives) occurring at nearby Green Brooke Conference Center, these three men were suspected of organising an attack against the meeting's attendees. James befriended Clark and Sebastian Dunn, two brothers frequently described as 'psycho', and developed a relationship with his first girlfriend, Joanna Ribble, despite the disapproval of her father. It was thought that Fire and World were transporting pieces of a bomb into the centre on mini remote controlled cars, but it is revealed that they were actually creating a bio-weapon made from anthrax. Upon the realisation that James had come into contact with safety clothing used to handle anthrax while investigating Fire and World's workshop, James was rushed to the hospital. It was revealed that the anthrax was a very weak strain (used to immunise Green Brooke staff), and James was completely healthy. Fire, World and Scargill were arrested, and Fort Harmony was eventually evacuated by police. James' mission controller was Ewart Asker, and James was awarded a navy shirt for his contribution to this mission. (Being awarded a navy shirt after only one mission is a rare accomplishment in CHERUB.) Second mission James goes on his second mission with Kerry Chang, Nicole Eddison and his best friend Kyle Blueman to Luton, North London. He befriends Junior Moore, the son of large-scale drug dealer Keith Moore. Kerry uncovers the factory where the company packages the drugs, with the help of James and Lauren, and James flies to Miami with Junior and Keith. There he is attacked by members of the drug cartel Lambayeke and escapes in a Land Rover after shooting and killing a man. In this mission, his mission controllers are husband and wife Ewart and Zara Asker. Third mission This mission takes place in \\"Arizona Max\\", the colloquial name for Arizona State's Maximum Security Prison. Accompanying James is experienced CHERUB agent David \\"Dave\\" Moss, known around campus as a \\"stud\\" because it is rumoured that he impregnated a girl on a mission. James has to complete the mission alone when Dave is extracted because of injuries attained in a fight, and successfully escapes with target Curtis Oxford. He joins up with sister and fellow CHERUB agent Lauren Adams. Curtis takes them to his father, Etienne, who leads them to Curtis' mother, Jane Oxford, a notorious criminal known to run a large-scale illegal gun business. James' mission controller is John Jones, an ex-MI5 agent who worked with the agents in Class A. After experiencing the amazing work the CHERUB agents did, John decides to change jobs and work for CHERUB full-time. Also working with James was American FBI agents Warren Reise (known as Scott Warren for the purposes of the mission), Theodore Monroe and Marvin Teller. For his role in the capture of Jane Oxford, James received the Intelligence Star. Fourth mission James' fourth mission is once again with David \\"Dave\\" Moss. This mission takes place after a small-time crook Leon Tarasov begins splashing around large amounts of money, and the local police would love to know where it has come from. Ex-CHERUB agent Millie Kenter, who is now a member of the Metropolitan Police, calls in CHERUB to help them investigate. It turns out that the death of a local teenager 18 months earlier leads them to the discovery that Leon and police officer Michael Patel, along with a few other accomplices, robbed a casino, and Michael Patel had killed the teenager by pushing him off a rooftop. The CHERUB team (including Lauren and Kerry on attachment from campus) set up a trap so that the suspects admitted their crimes in an argument with each other. Leon was sent to prison for twelve years while Michael was convicted for life. The mission controller was John Jones, with Chloe Blake as assistant mission controller. Fifth mission The fifth mission takes place in Brisbane, Australia with James' younger sister, Lauren, and an older agent, Dana Smith. They are accompanied by Abigail Sanders, a member of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, posing as their mother. Their main objective is to infiltrate a religious cult named 'The Survivors', thought to have links with the Eco-Terrorist group Help Earth. After researching the cult and reading about brainwashing techniques, the agents are ashamed when they find themselves already hypnotised by the group after only their first meeting. This leads the agents to work better and stronger and after not long, James and Lauren are sent to \\"The Ark\\" a monstrosity built in the Outback, by the cult leader, Joel Regan. Here, they meet Rathbone \\"Rat\\" Regan, Joel Regan's youngest son. It is discovered that Susie Regan, Joel's latest wife, is indeed involved with the organization 'Help Earth' and is having an affair with Brian 'Bungle' Evans, a terrorist who escaped custody in James' first mission. Susie kills Joel and takes off with Brian, with Joel's money. The Australian force is sent in to raid and destroy the Ark, but after the death of Joel Regan, the Ark is under lock down and heavily armed, and shoots down a whole chopper full of soldiers. James, Rat, and Lauren, along with young children from the Ark, manage to escape through a sewage system, just in time, as the Ark explodes, killing fifty people instantly, of which half are thought to be children. Susie and Bungle are stopped and Dana also stops a tanker being exploded in Indonesia. The mission controller is once again, John Jones, and Chloe Blake is his assistant, although it is revealed at the end of the mission that she is being promoted to a mission controller. For her bravery and rescuing of the children who would otherwise have been killed, Lauren is awarded the black shirt, outranking her brother for the first time. Sixth mission James' sixth mission is to bring down the Animal Freedom Militia, a terrorist group campaigning for animal rights. Lauren and Kyle join him, and Zara Asker is mission controller, one of her last times in the role before becoming chairwoman. James and Kyle are recruited by the Animal Freedom Army, a new animal rights group that plans on coming into recognition with a bang. They kidnap celebrity chef Nick Cobb and feed him his own cleaning product, which had previously been fed to rabbits as part of a lawsuit. This was broadcast live, over the internet. Kyle saves Nick and rushes him to hospital, and he survives. Seventh mission James' seventh mission based in Aero City, Russia. He joined two MI5 agents when the Intelligence minister declares that their mission is progressing too slowly, and that a CHERUB agent might speed up progress. The operation, however, goes disastrously wrong when two agents working with James murder their prime suspect, Denis Obidin, and James is trapped within Aero City. James is unable to contact campus and when he attempts to steal a phone he is beaten by a group of skateboarders. The skateboarders, having heard of a reward offered for James' capture, call the hotline and within a few minutes one of Obidin's men arrives, pays the skateboarders and arrests James. However, the henchman reveals himself to be an undercover CIA agent. After treating James to the best of his ability, he challenges him as to why he was there and why Obidin was killed. When James protests that their intentions were peaceful, he is shown CCTV footage of the murder. The agent lets James call CHERUB campus before he leaves, telling him not to go to sleep at any cost. Mission controller Ewart Asker arrives and takes James to an airfield where two British service people are to help with their escape. The Russian authorities appear, though, and they are forced to take the couple with them. On the flight, James passes out when air trapped in his broken nose expands due to air pressure changes and the pilot ends up making an emergency landing in Helsinki, Finland. When James finally makes it back to CHERUB, he is awarded his black shirt by Zara for his bravery in saving Ewart, even though the mission was a failure. Eighth mission Following the collapse of KMG (Keith Moore's Gang) at the end of James' Second mission, rival drug gangs the Mad Dogs and the Slasher Boys engage in a violent turf war for control of the Luton underworld. CHERUB agents Gabrielle O'Brien and Michael Hendry are sent to infiltrate the Slasher Boys. While carrying out a delivery for Major Dee, the leader of the Slasher Boys, Gabrielle's contact is killed by members of rival gang the Runts and Gabrielle is grievously wounded after being stabbed by a Runt. Gabrielle barely survives her injury and the CHERUB Ethics Committee think of calling off the mission but are persuaded to send James and Bruce to infiltrate the Mad Dogs. Zara Asker takes over the overall running of the mission, while Chloe Blake continues running the everyday aspects. James uses his past relationship with Keith Moore's son and Mad Dog associate Junior Moore to make infiltrating the gang easier. He is soon accepted into the gang. An older gang member, David \\"Wheels\\" Kemp, invites James on a hotel robbery. However, James being given a high role annoys Junior, who Mad Dogs leader Sasha Thompson is trying to protect. Junior tries to persuade James to join him in the robbery of a travel agent, but James declines. Junior successfully robs the travel agent but is arrested moments after. Sasha plans a great drug robbery on Major Dee. They get into an apartment. Some gang members are by pretending the people need to fill in a form. They then Taser the woman who opens the door, before capturing nearly all the people inside with the use of handcuffs and rubber gags. James decides to help a young boy found inside who is not treated well, and one of the cocaine dealers is freed so he can continue dealing and avoid suspicion. However the gang have to leave not long after. James, though reluctant, loses his virginity to Sasha's daughter Lois, who suddenly meets him when he is having a bath. James tells his girlfriend Dana although hurt, forgives him. Afterwards, James, Bruce and Michael successfully complete their mission and Bruce earns a black shirt. Ninth mission Tenth mission  Post CHERUB career  After leaving CHERUB, James graduates from Stanford University and works as a mission controller at CHERUB. Physical appearance James Adams is described as being well built, with blue eyes and blond hair, and tall when fully grown. He has been known to acquire weight easily, due to his tendency to not care about what he is eating. James easily gets girlfriends on missions and on campus due to his good looks and tendency to get off with every girl he sees. Academic James has an IQ of 152, and his prowess at maths is commonly noted, with him taking his A-levels in maths and further maths a year earlier than normal and teaching maths to younger members of CHERUB (in a deleted chapter from The Recruit). He is fluent in Russian (but hasn't mastered the accent) and Spanish. He is also good at physics and got a guaranteed pass at GCSE for history in The Fall (when he helped Kevin Sumner combat his fear of heights). However, James is known for messing around in lessons when he should be paying attention.

George Dethick was the son of Sir William Dethick.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Civil War In the Parliament State Papers, there is a reference to John Watson — \\"Information that he was in arms against Parliament, and four years since, was of the King's party at Evesham.co. Worcestershire, and was commissary and treasurer to Major Legge and Colonel Washington. \\" The exact nature of the party is unclear though, with the reference possibly being of Robert Legge, Governor of Evesham with Colonel Washington most likely referencing Henry Washington, a loyal Cavalier in the Civil War. Washington was a descendant of Sir William Washington of Northampton which is the same family as George Washington, the first US President. A memorial in Wickhamford Church, Worcester states - \\"Sacred to the memory of Penelope, daughter of that most distinguished and renowned soldier, Col. Henry Washington.\\" > When Evesham was stormed by Colonel Massey, he secured himself amongst his > friends until he found opportunity to escape. Before Evesham was taken, Mr. > Pitway, refusing to drink health to the confusion of Parliament, Watson ran > at Pitway with sword drawn, and being stopped by a person in the room, he > fell down and broke his leg. The Pitway referred to, was probably Edward Pitway, the Innkeeper of the Red Lion in Evesham [Now the site of the Northwick Arms], and known supporter of the Parliament side in the Civil war. This would explain the dispute with John Watson, a royalist. Pitway was a Capital Burgess of Evesham and later (1648) the Mayor. Many of the Pitway family were tenants of the Dean and Chapter of Worcester Cathedral. College of Arms The English Civil War brought Watson to the position of Bluemantle Pursuivant at the College of Arms. Although he was a Royalist,History of the College of Arms p. 254 he was chosen by the Parliamentary Government (The Long Parliament of 1646) for this position. He is listed in the documentation of the College of Arms, after the restoration of the Monarchy in which he lost his position, as an 'Intruder' Bluemantle. He officially assisted at the Funeral of Parliament's Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, and marched in the procession carrying the Earl's Helm and Crest. There is a Broadsheet illustration of the Funeral Procession in the British Museum,Thomason Tracts 699.f.10/89 1646 - in the British Museum which shows John carrying the Helm. Parliament ordered new Tabards for the College of Arms (from Edmund Harrison, embroiderer) H. Stanford London, 'The Heralds' Tabards under the Commonwealth', Notes and Queries, Vol.198, 1953, p. 276-8 which replace the Royal Arms with the new Arms of the Commonwealth (The State) Amongst others, John Watson wore the new Tabard at the Funeral of Henry Ireton (1651). Miscellaneous Grants VIII bought by the College of Heralds from the Tixall Library, 1899, contain copies of grants collected and mostly certified by John Watson. This previously belonged to Peter Le Neve, and Thomas Martin. Family Watson's Coat of Arms were Azure, with a fesse ermine between three Suns in splender Proper. Watson was born to William Watson and Alice Egioke. He married Anne Dethick, with whom he had three children.

He earned four caps with the U.S. national team and was a member of the 1952 U.S. Olympic, 1956 U.S. Olympic and 1960 U.S. Olympic teams. Youth Although he was born in St. Louis, Missouri, Mendoza's family moved to the Mexican state of Durango when he was eight. Mendoza began playing street soccer, as most young boys did at the time, while living in Durango. However, he eventually joined an organized team, the Atlante' Juniors team, going on to win the championship title in 1946. When he was 16, Mendoza returned to the U.S. where he settled in his home town of Granite City, IL. Upon his return to the St Louis area he played for many local teams until he landed a spot with Zenthoefer Furs in 1951. St. Louis leagues Mendoza accepts the Champions trophy as captain of the Atlante' Juniors team, Durango, Mexico, c. 1946 Mendoza (#10) watching his bicycle shot go into the net Mendoza played ten seasons in the St. Louis Major League, St. Louis Municipal League and St. Louis Soccer League with Zenthoefer Furs, St. Louis Raiders and St. Louis Kutis between 1951 and 1960. A prolific goal scorer, he spent most of his years either on the left wing or as a forward where he had a reputation for skillful and accurate headers. Wearing the number 10 jersey, he was known throughout the league for his ability to perform and score using the \\"bicycle kick\\". Unfortunately, St. Louis teams and leagues rarely kept accurate statistics for these years so we no longer know Mendoza's goals totals. Mendoza won the league title in 1951 with Zenthoefer before moving to Raiders for the 1952 season. That year the Raiders won both the league title and National Amateur Cup. After Raiders won the Amateur Cup, Tom Kutis, owner of the Kutis Funeral Home, began sponsoring the team. The team, now known as St. Louis Kutis, went on to win the 1953, 1954, 1957 and 1960 league titles. St. Louis Kutis went on to win the National Amateur Cup every year from 1956 to 1960.USA History: The National Amateur Cup In 1954, SL Kutis was runner-up in the National Challenge Cup before taking the title in 1957. In the 1950s, the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) frequently had difficulty fielding the U.S. national team and in 1957, USSF selected SL Kutis to represent the U.S. in the qualifying rounds for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Despite its domestic success, the SL Kutis team was unable to take the U.S. to the cup finals. His teammates with SL Kutis included such U.S. greats as Bill Looby, Harry Keough and Frank Borghi.History of Soccer in St. Louis Yearly record Mendoza (#10) heading ball playing for the St. Louis Kutis in the 1950s {  - !

For example, in 1951 Eintracht Frankfurt toured the U.S. They racked up a record of 6–2 with the only losses coming from Zenthoefers and fellow European club Celtic. In 1955, Nürnberg toured the U.S., running to a 5-1-1 record. This time Kutis, led by Mendoza, was the only U.S. team to defeat the German club, the tie coming from English club Sunderland. Finally, in 1956 Schwaben Augsburg toured the U.S., finishing 5–1. The only loss coming again from Kutis. National team  Mendoza earned four caps with the U.S. national team between 1954 and 1959, scoring two goals. While this number does not seem impressive by today's standards, it must be recalled that these caps were earned during an era when the U.S. National Team did not play very frequently. He earned his first cap in an April 4, 1954 World Cup qualifier victory over Haiti in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Mendoza scored the second U.S. goal in the thirty-first minute. Mendoza did not play again for the U.S. for two more years. His second game with the national team did not go as well as the first, as the U.S. was crushed 7–2 by Mexico in an April 28, 1957 World Cup qualifying match. Six weeks later, the U.S. hosted Canada in a World Cup qualifying game. While the score was closer than the Mexico game, the U.S. still lost, 3-2 despite a goal from Mendoza. Two weeks later, the U.S. was officially out of the 1958 FIFA World Cup when Canada again defeated the U.S. 5–1. This was the last game played by Mendoza. Olympic teams In addition to his games with the U.S. national team, Mendoza was in the starting lineup for the U.S. at both the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland and the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia and was a member of the 1960 U.S. Olympic squad. The U.S. played only one game in 1952, an 8–0 loss to Italy. It had also lost to Scotland in a pre-game exhibition match. In 1956, the U.S. Olympic team went on an Asian tour prior to the games. During this tour, the U.S. performed well, raising hopes which were crushed by a 9–1 loss to Yugoslavia in the only U.S. match of the tournament. The 1960 Olympic team did not qualify for and did not attend the 1960 games.

He began a soccer program across the river from St. Louis in Granite City, Illinois becoming a pioneer in an area which later produced national team defender Steve Trittschuh, a former player under Mendoza. By the mid-1970s, Mendoza could claim with some accuracy that nearly every soccer player from Granite City had been either coached by him personally or by a coach trained by Mendoza. His club teams won the Illinois State Cup each year throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. One U-13 team advanced to and won the Midwest Regional competition (Detroit, MI) against 7 neighboring states. Mendoza had the satisfaction of seeing the local high school, consisting of players who had almost entirely been coached as youth players by himself, win the Illinois high school state championship in 1972 and each year from 1976 to 1980, then again in 1982, 1987, 1989 and 1990. On October 4, 1984, he was inducted into the St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame. Death Ruben Mendoza died on April 11, 2010 at Barnes–Jewish Hospital. His family said he had been battling Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and congestive heart failure.

The name is applied both to a ruined 17th-century castle (contemporarily referred to as Finhaven Castle), as well as the 19th-century mansion house 130m to the west. History The estate was the property of the Lindsay Earls of Crawford from 1375, who built the now-ruined castle. David Lindsay, 10th Earl of Crawford, married Margaret, the daughter of Cardinal David Beaton, at Finavon in 1546. Extravagance ruined the Crawford fortunes, and in 1625 the barony of Finavon was disposed of by a forced sale to Alexander Lindsay, 2nd Lord Spynie. It passed through the Carnegie family, the Gordon Earls of Aboyne and the Gardynes. In 1843 the Castle was bought by Thomas Gardyne of Middleton. Through an 18th-century marriage he came of the old Lindsay stock. His descendant, Lieutenant-Colonel Alan David Greenhill Gardyne died in 1953, leaving the estate to a daughter, Mrs Susan Mazur. The castle Ruins of the earlier Finavon Castle The castle was an L-plan tower-house of five storeys, with a garret and a courtyard. The tower visible today dates from about 1600. Excavations have revealed that the tower is an adjunct tacked onto the north-east corner of a much older, more extensive structure. The house The house is a Scottish baronial style mansion built in 1865 for the then laird, David Greenhill Gardyne, by Messrs Carver and Symon of Arbroath. Life at the Castle J. B. Burke recorded what life was like at Finavon Castle, saying: > The inner life of the family was of an [sic] uniform but enjoyable > character; martial exercise, the chase, and the baronial banquet, enlivened > by the songs of the minstrel and the quips of the jester, occupied the day > and the evening was wiled away in ‘the playing of the chess, at the tables, > in reading of romans, in ringing and piping, in harping, and in other honest > solaces of great pleasure and disport,’ the ladies mingling in the scene > throughout, whether in the sports and festivities of the morning, or the > pastimes of the evening—though a portion of the day was always spent in > their ‘bowers’ with their attendant maidens spinning or weaving tapestry. > Occasionally, indeed, a higher responsibility devolved upon them,—during the > absence of the Earl, whether in attendance on the Parliament or in warfare, > public or private, his wife became the chatelaine or keeper of his castle > with full authority to rule his vassals, guide his affairs, and defend his > stronghold if attacked at disadvantage during his absence. Other nearby features The nearby Finavon Doocot is Scotland's largest doocot, with 2400 nesting boxes. It is believed to have been built for the Earl of Crawford in the 16th Century and is now maintained by the National Trust for Scotland. On Finavon Hill, above the Castle there is a vitrified Iron Age hillfort dating from the mid-1st millennium BCE. The Finavon Castle beat on the River South Esk provides salmon and seatrout fly fishing.

It was initially developed in 1969 as the Poney de Croisement (Cross-bred Pony), and in 1972 a stud book was created. In 1991 the stud book was closed and the breed renamed to Poney Français de Selle. The breed combines a mix of French and British pony breeds, as well as Thoroughbred and Arabian blood, to create the horse seen today. Due to the large number of breeds used to create the French Saddle Pony, there is not yet a defined set of physical characteristics for the breed, although all tend to be suited for competition in English riding disciplines, including dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing. They fill a similar role as the British Riding Pony and the German riding pony. Breed characteristics A French Saddle Pony being used in dressage The French Saddle Pony stands high and can be any color. A set standard type does not yet exist, due to differences in bloodlines between various ponies, but the desired type is that of a small saddle horse. Despite the differences, the majority of ponies have some physical characteristics in common. The head is small with a straight or convex profile. The neck is long, the withers prominent, the chest wide and deep and the shoulders sloping and long. The croup is sloping and the legs are strong with large, clean joints and clearly defined tendons. History The breeding program for the French Saddle Pony was initiated in 1969 by the Association Française du Poney de Croisement (French Association of Cross-bred Ponies), who wanted to create and promote a French Sport Pony, initially under the name Poney de Croisement (Cross-bred Pony). A stud book was created for the breed in 1972, and in 1991 the registry was closed to outside blood and the breed was renamed to Poney Français de Selle. The first ponies were created from a mixture of Arabian, New Forest, Welsh, Connemara and Thoroughbred blood. Later, Landais, Pottok, Merens and Basque blood was added. Today, the biggest breeding areas are in Mayenne, Normandy and Brittany, although the breed can be found throughout France. Due to its success in competition, it is becoming increasingly popular outside France. Between 1977 and 2000, registrations increased from 95 to almost 1,300, although the population has declined slightly between 1997 and 2012—a trend common to all French pony breeds. Uses French Saddle Ponies are mainly used as riding horses in competition events such as show jumping, dressage and three-day eventing, but are also used as harness ponies and for recreational riding. Many riding schools use French Saddle Ponies for novice riders, although they are also seen in competition as high as the international level. The breed fills a role similar to that of the British Riding Pony and the German riding pony.

With many professional clubs in his résumé, Kazemi has established himself as one of the top coaches in a country which has many enthusiastic football lovers – Iran. Farhad Kazemi was very successful in coaching Sepahan F.C. during the 2002–03 season to make the Isfahan based club, the first non-Tehran team to win an Iranian league. He was presented with the Best Manager of the Iran Pro League award The Persian Gulf Cup after the 2002-03 season and is the all-time best Manager of the Azadegan League managing to successfully gain the most promotions and championships. Early life Farhad Kazemi was born on 2 July 1959 in Tehran. He is a former player, who now works as a coach in Iranian football. He started his athletic career by participating in the sport of wrestling at the age of 13, and bowed out after 3 years. Later, he had an approach towards football, he also tried participating in various sports at high school; sports such as volleyball, wrestling and most importantly football. Playing career He started playing for the youth team of Ekbatan, then played for Bootan and Akam, under the supervisions of Madad Noei, Parviz Abootaleb and Hossein Farzami respectively.

He managed to have a very successful spell at Sepahan from 2002 to 2005, this success gained him a lot of recognition. Temporary Suspension from coaching in The IPL A set of regulations were published by The Iran Pro League (IPL) Organisation stating some laws that players and coaches needed to perform by, otherwise they would consequently be suspended from activities in the league. The so-called “Manshoor Akhalghi” was very much criticised by the people, criticising the charter itself as well as the people who took the biased decisions. It had been a very controversial matter in Iranian media, and many arguments erupted in Iranian football. The Iran Pro League Organisation accused Farhad Kazemi of being a “Manshoori” and was put on the suspension list, stopping him from having any activities in the Pro League. He joined Aboomoslem Mashhad F.C. in November 2009 but the organisation did not give him the permit to sit on the bench as they mentioned the fact that he is on the suspension list, providing no evidence to prove their accusations. Subsequently Farhad Kazemi joined and coached Gostaresh Foolad F.C. who played in a lower division, the Azadegan League, he managed to take them to the final of the Hazfi Cup (FA Cup) after beating many teams like Zob Ahan F.C., only to lose to Tehran giants Persepolis F.C. in the final. After many debates, it was agreed that Farhad Kazemi’s name would be taken off the suspension list; otherwise the complaints from Farhad Kazemi would be taken further, and into courts.

It was first described in the medical literature in 1987 by Ritscher and Schinzel, for whom the disorder is sometimes named. Signs and symptoms The classical triad of symptoms that defines 3C syndrome includes certain heart defects, hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of the cerebellum, and cranial dysmorphisms, which can take various forms. The heart defects and cranial dysmorphisms are heterogeneous in individuals who are all classed as having Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome. Heart defects commonly seen with Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome are associated with the endocardial cushion and are the most important factor in determining a diagnosis. The mitral valve and tricuspid valve of the heart can be malformed, the atrioventricular canal can be complete instead of developing into the interatrial septum and interventricular septum, and conotruncal heart defects, which include tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great vessels, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis have also been associated with 3C syndrome. The cranial dysmorphisms associated with 3C syndrome are heterogeneous and include a degree of macrocephaly, a large anterior fontanel, a particularly prominent occiput and forehead, ocular hypertelorism (wide-set eyes), slanted palpebral fissures, cleft palate, a depressed nasal bridge, cleft palate with associated bifid uvula, low-set ears, micrognathia (an abnormally small jaw), brachycephaly (flattened head), and ocular coloboma. Low-set ears are the most common cranial dysmorphism seen in 3C syndrome, and ocular coloboma is the least common of the non-concurrent symptoms (cleft lip co-occurring with cleft palate is the least common). Cranial dysplasias associated with 3C syndrome are also reflected in the brain. Besides the cerebellar hypoplasia, cysts are commonly found in the posterior cranial fossa, the ventricles and the cisterna magna are dilated/enlarged, and Dandy- Walker malformation is present. These are reflected in the developmental delays typical of the disease. 75% of children with 3C syndrome have Dandy- Walker malformation and hydrocephalus. Signs and symptoms in other body systems are also associated with 3C syndrome. In the skeletal system, ribs may be absent, and hemivertebrae, syndactyly (fusion of fingers together), and clinodactyly (curvature of the fifth finger) may be present. In the GI and genitourinary systems, anal atresia, hypospadia (misplaced urethra), and hydronephrosis may exist. Adrenal hypoplasia and growth hormone deficiency are associated endocrine consequences of Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome. Some immunodeficiency has also been reported in connection with 3C syndrome. Many children with the disorder die as infants due to severe congenital heart disease. The proband of Ritscher and Schinzel's original study was still alive at the age of 21. A fetus with 3C syndrome may have an umbilical cord with one umbilical artery instead of two. Genetics autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. This means that two parents with one copy of the gene each will not have the disease themselves, but can pass on the gene to their children. Statistically, one in four of these children will inherit both copies of the recessive gene and develop the disease. 3C syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease, caused by a mutation on the long arm of chromosome 8 at 8q24.13, the locus for KIAA0196, the gene for the protein strumpellin. Strumpellin is highly expressed in skeletal muscle cells and mutations in it are also associated with spastic paraplegia. Strumpellin is involved in endosomal transport and cell death processes. The mutation occurs at a splice site and causes a substantial decrease in the amount of strumpellin produced by the cell. The phenotype is similar to 6pter-p24 deletion syndrome and 6p25 deletion syndrome but has a different etiology. :The only way to test for this condition before birth is through ultrasound. ::*First-trimester ultrasounds can detected nuchal abnormalities ::*Second-trimester ultrasounds can pick up characteristic major structural abnormalities.Rusnak, A. J., Hadfield, M. I., Chudley, A. E., Marles, S. L., Reid, G. J., & Chodirker, B. N. (2008). Increased Nuchal Translucency Thickness: A Potential Indicator for Ritscher- Schinzel Syndrome. Fetal Diagnosis & Therapy, 24(4), 395-399. Because 3C syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, parents with one child with the disorder have a 25% chance of having another child with the disorder. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis There is an overlap in symptoms between 3C syndrome and Joubert syndrome. Joubert syndrome often manifests with similar cerebellar hypoplasia and its sequelae, including hyperpnea, ataxia, changes in eye movement, and cleft lip and palate. Occasionally, Joubert syndrome will include heart malformations. Brachmann-de Lange syndrome must also be differentiated from 3C syndrome. It presents with similar craniofacial and heart abnormalities and can include Dandy-Walker phenotype, making it difficult to distinguish. Dandy-Walker malformation is also occasionally seen in Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, which is characterized by heart defects and malformed alveolar ridge. Many disorders include the Dandy- Walker phenotype and thus it is not pathognomonic for 3C syndrome. CHARGE syndrome can also be misdiagnosed. This is because both CHARGE syndrome and 3C syndrome share symptoms of ocular colobomas, cardiac defects, growth retardation, and minor facial abnormalities. Coffin-Siris syndrome presents with fifth-finger deformities and congenital heart defects. It is distinguished from 3C syndrome by differences in facial dysmorphisms. Management  The outcome of this disease is dependent on the severity of the cardiac defects. Approximately 1 in 3 children with this diagnosis require shunting for the hydrocephaly that is often a consequence. Some children require extra assistance or therapy for delayed psychomotor and speech development, including hypotonia. Prognosis Prognoses for 3C syndrome vary widely based on the specific constellation of symptoms seen in an individual. Typically, the gravity of the prognosis correlates with the severity of the cardiac abnormalities. For children with less severe cardiac abnormalities, the developmental prognosis depends on the cerebellar abnormalities that are present. Severe cerebellar hypoplasia is associated with growth and speech delays, as well as hypotonia and general growth deficiencies. Epidemiology 3C syndrome is very rare, occurring in less than 1 birth per million. Because of consanguinity due to a founder effect, it is much more common in a remote First Nations village in Manitoba, where 1 in 9 people carries the recessive gene. History The syndrome was first reported in 1987 in two sisters who had similar craniofacial abnormalities, Dandy-Walker phenotype, and congenital heart abnormalities. Neither of the parents was affected, indicating that the disorder was transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. The syndrome's symptoms were further refined in 1989 when the third case of the syndrome was reported, with similar craniofacial abnormalities to the first two cases, ventricular septal defect, and enlargement of the cisterna magna and fourth ventricle of the brain. Other animals Animal models of 3C syndrome have not been created; however, strumpellin is a highly conserved protein, with 12 known homologs and 83 known orthologs.

A home warranty is a contract that agrees to provide a homeowner with discounted repair and replacement services. However, the words \\"home warranty\\" are not always used explicitly to mean a legal warranty is being conveyed. In many cases, at least in the United States, a home warranty is not a warranty at all, but rather a home service contract that covers the repair and/or replacement costs of home appliances, major systems such as heating and cooling, and possibly other components of a home, structural or otherwise. The home service contract generally covers home systems such as the home’s plumbing or electrical, and appliances like dishwashers that fail from old age/normal wear and tear. Coverage varies significantly across home warranty companies. Coverage Basic home warranty coverage includes the main systems of the home and certain appliances. Most companies cover plumbing, electrical, heating systems, as well as refrigerators, dishwashers, and Microwave ovens. Some charge additional coverage for appliances such as clothes washers and clothes dryers. A home warranty company will pay for the cost to repair or replace the system or appliance, as long as it has broken down from normal wear and tear. If the system or appliance failed because it was not maintained (the water heater was not flushed or the fridge’s evaporative coils were not cleaned), most home warranty contracts will not cover the cost to repair or replace it. Home warranties exist to repair or replace old worn out systems that have been properly cared for by the homeowner. Buyers should read the home warranty contract carefully to understand coverages, limitations, and exclusions.  Limitations  Many home warranty companies have limitations within their contracts. These limits stipulate how much money the company will pay to repair or replace a system. Other non-monetary limits may specify how many units are covered or the size of the unit. Some home warranty companies have an overall limit set, where anything in the contract is covered up to a certain amount of money. Once the company has paid that amount of money they will no longer pay for the repairs and replacements of home. Other home warranty companies have limits on certain items in the home. In these contracts, if there is not a limit stated on an item, the item has no limit and the home warranty will pay as much as needed to repair or replace the system or appliance. Homeowners should read through a home warranty contract to know what limits are set on their coverage.  Exclusions  What parts of a home are excluded from coverage vary from company to company. Generally, home warranties exclude coverage on systems and appliances that have been misused, intentionally damaged, or not maintained. Some home warranty companies do not cover non-mechanical parts of system or appliance, like the handles or knobs on an oven, for example. Another common thing for home warranties to exclude coverage on are known conditions.  Known conditions  Most home warranty contracts will state that repairs and replacements will not be covered if the problem was known prior to the date of coverage. This is sometimes referred to as a known condition. Most often, homeowners run into this problem when purchasing a home. After getting a home inspection, some real estate agents will mistakenly tell the buyer that any problems found in the home inspection will be covered with a home warranty. Instead, if the home inspection notates that something needs to be repaired or replaced before the date of closing, most home warranties will not repair or replace it.  State rules and regulations  In some states, such as New Jersey for example, builders of new homes are required to provide a home warranty to those purchasing homes. Though the terminology is identical, these home warranty plans differ from the ones offered to existing home owners or through real estate transactions involving the purchase of existing homes. The coverage may be very different from other similarly named agreements. Home warranty is one of several terms for a contract between home owners and companies that cover some of the costs associated with specific repairs and replacements of household objects. Related industries often use such terms as residential service contract and appliance warranty plan. Just as is the case with home warranty in states such as Florida,Specialty Product Administration. Retrieved October 19, 2014. residential service contracts are regulated in some states such as Texas.The Residential Service Company Program. Retrieved October 19, 2014. It is of value for consumers to understand their state's regulations for companies that offer to provide maintenance or repair services and/or coverage for related costs since some companies may be operating without proper licensing. Consumers may sometimes avoid falling prey to unlicensed companies by consulting their state's policies and other information regarding home warranty and similar services. In some cases current lists of licensed companies are available for consumers to check on the applicable state government agencies' websites. In NSW(Australia), Home Owners Warranty must be taken out by your builder and a certificate of insurance must be provided to you if the value of work is over $20,000. Controversy Some common complaints that home warranty clients have: * Warranty companies deny the claim citing homeowner's maintenance negligence * Warranty companies deny the claim because of a \\"pre-existing problem\\" * Warranty companies always repair the appliance even when it is in such bad shape as to be replaced Home warranty companies deny systematic denial and claim that customers need to pay close attention to the contract. Warranty contracts specify that pre-existing conditions and problems arising due to lack of proper care and maintenance are not covered. It is not too uncommon to find companies that open the business for a short period of time and then vanish. Around 20 companies went out of business between 2013 and 2014. Buyers are encouraged to check the provider reviews and ratings of the companies selling the product.

For example, the central business districts of cities (CBD) are also known as “Central Activities Districts” (CAD) (also known as Downtown in North America or \\"Central Activities Zone\\" in the United Kingdom in recognition of the fact that commercial functions are not the only things that occur there. The term activity centre can also be used to designate an area for mixed-use development, whatever its current land use happens to be. Description Activity centres are a key component of contemporary strategic planning for large dispersed cities like those in Australia, Canada, the US and New Zealand. Examples of such planning include the Melbourne 2030 strategy for Melbourne and the City of Cities metropolitan strategy for Sydney. Activity centres can vary greatly in size from the central districts of large cities to regional commercial areas to neighbourhood shopping centres and strips. They can also refer to specialised agglomerations of activities such as urban university campuses or research institutes. They are an important concept in urban planning for Transit-oriented development or TOD, which seeks to intensify landuses around public transport nodes to facilitate greater sustainability in the way people and goods move around cities. Melbourne 2030 “Activity Centres are defined as any place that attracts people for shopping, working, studying, recreation or socializing”.(Department of Sustainability and Environment, 2002) This is a very broad and descriptive definition that is used in Melbourne 2030. The definition was later made more specific in Melbourne @ 5 million, by saying a mixed use centre is where people work, shop, relax, meet friends and family and also live. These centres are usually a reasonable size and are served by public transport of different sizes and intensities (buses, trains, tram and cars cater for most activity centres in Melbourne). This specific definition is meant to be one of the key aspects to Melbourne 2030 Activity Centre Policy being successful in its efforts in the reduction of car dependence.(K. Sulervian, 2010) The ideas of Activity Centres in Melbourne 2030 is no new concept for Melbourne, as it is a reinterpretation of a policy. The issue surrounding this idea is the ability of our State and Local Governments working together and learning from the past mistakes to create a policy where Governments will adopt a “strong regulative approach”.(R. Goodman, S. Moloney, 2004) District Centre Policy of Melbourne was introduced in 1980s and was then later abandoned. This policy was abandoned because of powerful vested interested opposing the restrictions to lower car usage, that planners were applying. The pressure applied by stand- alone shopping centre owners to expand in the end was too great, and the Government gave into their demands. This was only the beginning with State Government landing the largest blow in 1984, when they approved a “major breach of policy” (R. Goodman, S. Moloney, 2004) allowing Coles-Myers to build their headquarters as a stand-alone centre instead of in a district centre. This not only weakened the policy but also gave to other powerful organizations dismissing the District Centre Policy. Goodman and Moloney have pointed out that the current Government has not learned from previous mistakes. The issues pointed out “lack of including Local Government in the process of selecting centres for designation and future growth, the value of enforceable guidelines and regulation to support the policy and the critical necessity of appropriate funding to enable implementation\\".(R. Goodman, S. Moloney, 2004) Goodman and Moloney believed that State Government could step back and allow “Design to take place at a Local Government level as part of their Planning Scheme Amendment process”.(R. Goodman, S. Moloney, 2004) Looking back at past mistakes, the State Government should step back and let Local Government help with the implementation of the policy at the local level, and would also give strong direction for developers to work with. Housing and Community Facilities Melbourne’s Housing and community facilities Melbourne's housing needs have been a focus of activity centre policies and planning policies ever since the city's future growth potential was realised. The intentions of planners regarding housing have been influenced by the contemporaneous (then current) (then existing) social and economic context. It was not until the plan titled ‘Melbourne 2030’, developed in 2002 that a direct connection was made between housing and activity centres, and as such structure plans for activity centres were introduced. That plan however did address roads, transport forms, compactness, economic activity, investment and liveability, and appeared to take the view that community facilities would follow without the need for particular attention in their own right. A number of historical policies, whilst not directly linking housing and activity centres, shaped the suburbs Melbourne has today, and hence are relevant in Melbourne's 2030 Activity centre policy. Melbourne’s Planning History: Housing The 1971 Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) plan, ‘Planning Policies for the Melbourne Metropolitan Region’ determined Melbourne's Green wedges, and was considered the first policy to address Melbourne's outward growth constrains [3] (Department of Planning and Community Development, 2012). The 1980 and 1981 MMBW's ‘Metropolitan strategy and implementation’ paved the way for future planning policies by encouraging development in existing areas, with a focus on the concentration of housing and community facilities in areas of high accessibility [1].(Activity Centre policy review, 2001) Melbourne 2030, built on the strategic aims of 1971 and 1981, with the addition of an Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) and a quantified approach to urban consolidation [3].(Department of Planning and Community Development, 2012) This brief history of Melbourne's planning in relation to housing and community facilities involved planning scheme changes particularly evident in the 1954 and 1971 plans (‘Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme 1954 Report, Surveys and Analysis’ and ‘Planning policies for the Melbourne metropolitan region’ respectively), and new state policies in 2002 [4].(Melbourne 2030, 2002) Melbourne’s Housing: Flats, units and the inner suburbs The 1954 plan introduced a residential zoning regime for Melbourne which classified inner urban houses through to fringe development and their density. At this time, the plan did not intend on increasing densities. The 1971 plan predicted limited growth in population. The 1971 plan also introduced building design guidelines to improve the 1960s era trend of what was deemed ‘ugly’ flat development in Melbourne (40% of dwellings constructed in the 1960s in Melbourne were either Flats or Villa Units [3] (Department of Planning and Community Development, 2012)). The 1970s also saw renewed interest in the housing possibilities of inner Melbourne suburbs. The 1981 plan emphasised this trend proposing redevelopment of old inner industrial sites. The city of Melbourne introduced ‘postcode 3000’ in 1992 as an incentive to live in Melbourne's city centre, and by the mid-1990s higher density and diversity housing was occurring in inner suburbs and would eventually spread to middle suburbs. Housing and Activity Centres Higher density housing in and around activity centres is a core focus of Melbourne's planning community, since the 2002 Melbourne 2030 plan. However the success of Melbourne's activity centres in accommodating higher density housing is not universally agreed. The affordability of higher density housing is of great importance to success in housing planning in Melbourne 2030. However an analysis by [2] Birrell et al. (2005) suggests that; “The housing side of the activity centre strategy has been developed with little real regard to the reality of land availability and cost of construction and development in suburban centres”. Transport Many cities like Melbourne have had to deal with population growth, which has brought about an increase in travel movements. This growth has also increased concerns for the environment, congestion and sustainability. It is the goal of activity centre policy to reduce individual car usage and encourage people to use public transport. This idea also means that there is a reduction in fuel consumption, saving money and time and is more efficient in the long term. In order to make public transport an attractive option to get to activity centres without the correct transport infrastructure in place, people turn back to their private forms of transport. This can be seen in a study into Activity Centres under taken by P. McNabb and the University of Melbourne research team in 2001 showed that “75% of trips to Melbourne activity centres were by car”. The use of public transport to access activity centres is one of the key principles outlined in Melbourne 2030 and in many other international activity centre policies. If such policies are to succeed, authorities will need to take responsibility and show a united front to developers and the community by reinforcing this policy, or risk losing another policy to the private sector. International examples A large number of European towns and cities have made their city centres car-free since the 1960s. These are often accompanied by car parks on the edge of the pedestrianized zone, and in the larger cases, park and ride schemes. Central Copenhagen in Denmark is one of the largest and oldest examples: the car free zone is centered on Strøget, a pedestrian shopping street, which creates a very large auto free zone. This example of reduction in the use of cars means that there is a large beneficial effect on the amount of emissions released to the atmosphere. These policies however do allow delivery and service vehicles as well as residents cars into exclusion areas. “This lock out of unnecessary car traffic must be an isolated measure, but part of a pull and push approach” (H, Topp and T, Pharaoh, 1994). thumb From the 1990s the city of Utrecht has been implementing the Dutch town planning policy, which is oriented towards the “compact city” concept. The ABC location policy looks at urban development areas and classifies them according to the conditions of transport. “The ABC planning in the major urban areas can be regarded as an example of good practice for the following reasons; it looks at linking urban development with no car traffic planning, orientation towards the compact city concept, it coordinates urban location policies with national and regional government and non-government organization; it uses combinations of pull and push measures in transport policy and offering transport management to companies and businesses via mobility consultancy”(E.Eno,1996). In order it deliver good public transport connections governments need to show a strong regulatory approach to individual car usage in and around to activity centres. Some city's around the world have carried this out and achieved car usage reductions. Without improving public transport connections you can only expect increasing private car usage and increased condition and time delays. Retail Retail is one of the four main components of activity centres, towards the broader social and environmental sustainability plus economic objectives of the increasingly preferred polycentric approach to planning and managing cities. Incorporating retail into the activity centre mix of uses provides benefits for the immediate centre and surrounding community including a: o more equitable access to shops and services, o source of employment, o Strengthening and opportunities for marketing local economies and independent small businesses – in turn more able to compete and respond to demand, o greater work / life balance through more efficient use of time by being able to shop near where people work and/ or live o Physical connections with public transport, reducing car use and promoting short pedestrian commutes as associated with Transit Oriented Development (or see transport section) o Emotional connections through providing ‘fine grain’ opportunities for human interaction and activity such as hairdressers and cafes. Planning for retail within an activity centre framework generally promotes a hierarchy of traditional and existing high street strip shopping and cautions, if not curtails, further development out of centre/s. Exception to the general activity centre rule are single use, stand alone zones such as existing shopping centre malls, distribution centres and “bulky goods” or big box retail where the physical scale of goods sold requires larger floor plates plus heavy vehicle, loading dock access and car parking, which may better be provided stand alone. A range of factors including determines the retail mix within a centre: o Policy directions of governing bodies, the relationships between (such as local and state) and view of the market. For example, in Australia, both NSW and Victoria state government's have defined their policy role in terms of retail as to regulate ‘location and scale’, leaving the market to ‘determine the need for retail and commercial development’ . o Mechanisms such as determining land use zones, processing development applications and developing overarching floor space ratios of retail to other uses mix; o The lobbying and influence of private sector such as property developers and major retailers and business groups such as Chambers of Commerce; o A centre's position within the overarching activity centre policy hierarchy – as metropolitan planning documents use to represent the range of physically large and regionally important down to smaller neighborhood oriented centres. Bigger centres are associated with a diverse retail environment where the offering in smaller centres is more limited o Competition, health and other laws and regulations such as restricting larger chain and discount department stores in centres already served by independent and local retailers, certain types of retail such as more bottle shops in a community concerned about alcohol-related violence, and other government department regulations such as Health seeking to manage the number of fast to fresh food outlets. Commercial development Commercial development can relate to a number of things such as business parks, major office developments, mixed business areas, business centres and warehouse uses. In activity centers and urban locations, commercial buildings often combine multiple functions, such as offices on the upper levels with retailing on ground levels. The purpose of activity centres, or neo-traditional development such as urban villages or compact cities are to provide a mixed use core, within walking distance for most residents. Employment centres are incorporated into these types of areas, so that residents have the opportunity to both live and work within the centre. Activity centre policies in most countries provide guidance for local and state agencies as well as the development industry as to the preferred locations for these commercial land uses. Planning policies support the role of employment in activity centre's and usually aim to concentrate a large area of land use to commercial activity in these centers. These connections provide for the necessary social and economic connections between the region and community, whilst aiming to increase access to employment. Policies assist in ensuring that these land uses are located within associated transport modes and other urban infrastructure. They also aim to provide guidelines with regards to preferred scale and heights. Transport considerations have always been an important factor when deciding on locations for commercial land uses, with many businesses giving high priority to locations that provide good access to main roads, arterial roads and rail. Locating commercial development in activity centres helps to minimise the length and number of trips, especially by motor vehicles and encourage new development in locations that can be served by more energy efficient modes of transport. The locational demands of businesses are therefore a key input to the preparation of structure plans and activity centre policies. Local authorities usually maintain strict regulations on the zoning of commercial or business areas and recently there has been a focus on constraining the spread of large commercial developments in the outer suburbs and ensuring that there is a mix of this type of development specifically located within designated activity centres. Generally in order to implement these aims relating to commercial development, it is necessary to regulate the extent to which commercial development should be permitted outside of these centres. Most planning systems enable a wide range of commercial development opportunities in order to support local competition and meet the demands for commercial floor space. Locating commercial development in activity centres also helps in stimulating local investment and employment issues. The planning system should enable a wide range of retail and commercial development opportunities in order to support competition meet demand for commercial floor space and stimulate local investment and employment. With regards to employment measures, containing commercial development within these places encourages a more even distribution of employment, and guarantees developments are supported by the necessary public transport facilities.

He served as the 13th Lieutenant Governor of Michigan and as the U.S. Minister to the Netherlands. Early life James Michael Birney was born in Danville, Kentucky, the eldest son of Agatha (McDowell) and James Gillespie Birney, who was a presidential candidate for the Liberty Party in the 1840 and 1844 elections. Birney spent his early years in Alabama and Kentucky. Birney was educated at Centre College in Danville and in 1836 graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. For the next two years, Birney was employed by the university as a professor of the Greek and Latin languages. After this, he studied law at Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut. Completing his studies, Birney moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and began the practice of law until 1856, when he succeeded to his father's business interests in the Saginaw Valley of Michigan, where his father had made large investments in what has become Bay City. Birney moved there in the summer of 1857. One of Birney's most notable early acts of public service was procuring the passage in 1857 of an act in the state legislature changing the name of \\"Lower Saginaw\\" to Bay City. In 1856, Birney had the distinction of editing the city's first newspaper, the Bay City Press, which lasted for only a few weeks. Political career In 1858, Birney was nominated as a Republican candidate for the Michigan Senate. At the time the senate district was regarded as a stronghold of the Democratic Party, thus it was seen as a significant achievement that Birney garnered all of the votes in the district within Bay County except for five. He served a single term in the Senate representing the Saginaw district. While in the Senate, Birney was chairman of the committee on public instruction and a member of the judiciary committee. In 1860, Birney was nominated by the state Republican convention as the candidate for Lieutenant Governor with Austin Blair as candidate for Governor. Birney was elected to office by a majority of over 20,000 votes. While serving as Lieutenant Governor, a vacancy occurred in Michigan's 10th circuit court, and the governor offered the position to Birney. He resigned as Lieutenant Governor April 3, 1861 to accept the judicial appointment and served in that position for four years. Birney lost in the next judicial election and was succeeded by Jabez G. Sutherland. After leaving the bench, Birney established the Bay City Chronicle in 1871 as a weekly Republican paper and in June 1873 began publishing the Morning Chronicle. Birney was also a delegate to Republican National Convention from Michigan in 1872. In 1872, Governor Henry P. Baldwin nominated Birney to U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant as Centennial Commissioner for Michigan to celebrate the Hundredth Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1876. Birney was unable to serve in this capacity, however, as he was appointed on December 17, 1875 as U.S. Minister to the Netherlands. Birney departed for The Hague in 1876 and served until 1882. Birney died on May 8, 1888 in Bay City, Michigan. He is interred in Pine Ridge Cemetery in Bay City. Personal life While in New Haven studying at Yale College, Birney married Amanda Moulton on June 1, 1841. His wife was the stepdaughter of Nathaniel Bacon, Esquire of New Haven. Birney and his wife had five children: James G. Birney, Arthur Moulton Birney, Sophia Hull Birney, Alice Birney and one child that died in infancy. The eldest, James G. Birney, distinguished himself as Captain in the 7th Regiment of Michigan Volunteers and died while an officer of the U.S. regular army.

Mechelen was known at the time as a center for oil and water-colours and especially landscape painting.Lucas van Valckenborch in: Karel van Mander, Schilder-boeck, 1604 The artistic milieu of Mechelen was decisive on the development of the artist. Lucas van Valckenborch learned in Mechelen the art of watercolour painting. Here he also got to know the prominent painters Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1528-1569) and Hans Bol (1534-1593), who both played an important role in the development of landscape painting in the Low Countries. The 17th-century biographer Karel van Mander reported that Lucas van Valckenborch learned to paint landscapes in Mechelen. At the start of the iconoclastic fury of the Beeldenstorm in 1566 Lucas van Valckenborch left Antwerp with his brother Marten van Valckenborch, probably for religious reasons as they may have been protestant. A series of topographical views, including a 1567 painted view of Liège, prove that van Valckenborch travelled up the Meuse valley. This trip played an important role in his development as a landscape artist working directly from nature.Lucas van Valckenborch, Rocky Landscape with Travelers on a Path, with a View of a Town, Believed to be Huy, in the Valley Beyond at Sotheby's In 1570 the artist was in Aachen, where he met up again with his brother Marten. Here, the two brothers were also joined for two years by Hans Vredeman de Vries, friend and fellow artist. By 1575 Lucas had returned to Antwerp, where he must have made a name for himself. Before 1579 the young Archduke Matthias of Austria, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, hired him as his court painter. The Archduke was particularly impressed by his skills as a portrait painter. As court painter, Valckenborch created in the Netherlands some works for the Archduke, including the designs for the Archduke's Guard and some portraits. After the Archduke lost his position as governor in 1582, the Archduke left the Netherlands and went to live in Linz without position. It is not clear when Lucas van Valckenborch joined the Archduke in Linz. Van Mander describes the pair traveling together down the Danube. There is no documentary evidence for this but it is assumed that he arrived in Linz in 1582 or earlier, and stayed there until June 1582 at least. Two bills from Kremsmünster prove that he actually spent time in Upper Austria. Landscape with a Rural Festival At the beginning of 1593 Lucas van Valckenborch joined his brother Marten in Frankfurt am Main. Here he became the teacher and collaborator of Georg Flegel. He remained active in Frankfurt until his death in 1597. Work General Lucas van Valckenborch is mainly known for his landscapes, which depict existing and imaginary scenes. He also painted portraits for his patron Emperor Matthias. He was further a figure painter as is shown in a series of nine allegories of the seasons painted in Frankfurt from 1592. Valckenborch's earliest dated works are from 1567. His monogram was L / VV or LVV. Early in his career he placed the 'L' below the two 'V's, while after 1570 he signed with the letters inverted. His style was close to that of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, but he modified this influence in a personal manner and was not a slavish copyist. His work was rooted in the same Flemish tradition, without following the newer Mannerist movement. Landscapes Rocky Landscape with Travelers on a Path Van Valckenborch worked largely in the tradition of the so-called 'world landscape' of panoramic vistas shown from a bird's-eye viewpoint. This style of landscape painting was developed in Antwerp in the first half of the 16th century by artists like Joachim Patinir, Herri met de Bles and Pieter Bruegel the Elder. It was also practised by Lucas van Valckenborch's contemporaries such as Gillis Mostaert and Gillis van Coninxloo. Van Valckenborch also painted topographically accurate landscapes. Joris Hoefnagel is believed to have used his topographical drawings, for instance the drawn View of Linz, for his designs for the six-volume atlas, the Civitates orbis terrarum, published by Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg between 1572 and 1617. Lucas van Valckenborch based many of his imaginary landscapes on drawings he had made directly from nature during his travels. The drawings provided a repertory of motifs, which he employed on multiple occasions. His landscape compositions thus often combine real places with imaginary elements. It is therefore not possible to locate many of the views he created. For instance, none of the many landscapes with furnaces and forges has ever been identified. A large portion of his landscape output was dedicated to the depiction of rocky landscapes in which he situated ironworks or small religious or peasant scenes. Another recurring theme was that of rural entertainments such as in the Landscape with a Rural Festival (1577; Hermitage) or the two versions of the Landscape with a Peasant Wedding and Dance (both 1574, National Gallery of Denmark). He also created some close-up representations of forest landscapes. Autumn landscape (September) In their mixture of fantasy and accurate topographical details, van Valckenborch's landscape paintings offer a view of the world and man's relationship to it. This is particularly clear in his rocky landscapes in which the diminutive people on the winding path are reduced by the monumental cliffs. An example is the Rocky Landscape with Travelers on a Path (c. 1570, Sotheby's 6 July 2016, London lot 3) where the distant goatherd and the silhouettes of his charges seem ant-like in comparison to the vast distance, and the vertiginous perspective of the scene. This dramatic visual depiction is clearly intended as a commentary on man's place within the universe. He also painted between 1584 and 1587 a series of large pictures depicting the labours of the months, probably on commission for Archduke Matthias. These compositions, of which seven survive (five of which are in the Kunsthistorische Museum), present the various months of the year by showing the changing landscape and the traditional activities of humans during each month. It is not clear whether the five missing paintings were never painted or are lost. Due to their realistic setting these compositions carry a documentary interest. The work of Pieter Bruegel the elder, who had painted a series of 6 on the times of the year was influential on van Valckenborch. Lucas van Valckenborch moved away from the tradition of painting the landscape in three cascading distances that were rendered in three different colours: brown, green and blue for each receding plane. Rather he often left out the green tone for the middle distance. He also innovated the thematic scenes by developing them into genre scenes with a stronger narrative depth. Peasant tavern Lucas van Valckenborch regularly returned to the subject of the Tower of Babel, which was also depicted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and later by a whole range of Flemish artists. The subject of the Tower of Babel is usually interpreted as a critique of human hubris, and in particular o the Roman Catholic Church which at the time was undertaking at great expense large-scale construction projects such as the St. Peter's Basilica. However, it has also been viewed as a celebration of technical progress, which would herald a better and more organized world.Jonathan Sawday, 'Engines of the Imagination: Renaissance Culture and the Rise of the Machine', Routledge, 2007, p. 21 Portraits Archduke Matthias is said to have engaged Lucas van Valckenborch as his court painter for his skills as a portrait painter. Many of the works he produced for the Archduke were in fact portraits, including portraits of the Archduke and his wife Sibylle von Jülich-Cleve-Berg. These portraits were full-length portraits or bust format. He also painted several miniature portraits of the Archduke and his wife. It is clear that these portraits' role was to show the power of Archduke and to flatter his ego as he is depicted invariably in a regal and imposing position and dressed in the latest fashions. Lucas van Valckenborch also included miniature portraits of himself and his friends in a number of his landscape paintings. This is the case, for instance in The Emperor's walk in the forest where he has depicted himself on the left of the composition with his drawing tools. In the Landscape with a Rural Festival (1577; Hermitage) he included portraits of his friends Abraham Ortelius, Joris Hoefnagel and himself among the throng of revellers. Market scenes Feast Lucas van Valckenborch painted a number of market scenes, which are also distinctively tied to the four seasons. The Meat and Fish Market (Winter) (c. 1595, Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) is an example of a market scene, which is also an allegory of winter. The work was likely part of a series of four dedicated to the seasons. The imagery of the market scenes can be traced back to the previous generation of painters from the Antwerp school.Lucas van Valckenborch (1535 or later–1597), Meat and Fish Market (Winter) at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts In the series van Valckenborch particularly developed the tradition of art market scenes pioneered by Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer. He strived for a synthesis of still-life with landscape and genre painting. The still lifes in many of the market scenes were the work of his assistant Georg Flegel who may also have trained with him. A snow-covered fish market scene (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp) is another example of a market scene set in the winter. People are shown skating on the ice in the background. Two muffled-up well-to-do women are making their purchases dressed in the typical Brabant style of around 1580–1600. The fishmonger is shown slicing off pieces of salmon, while his wife is taking smoked fish from a hook. The fish and utensils in the foreground are the work of Flegel who was able to render the fine metal shine of the brass bucket and the grain of the wooden water bucket.Lucas van Valckenborch, \\"\\"Fish Market at The Golden Cabinet Georg Flegel also painted the food and luxurious tableware in two paintings of van Valckenborch depicting banquets (Silesian Museum and St Gilgen-Salzburg, H. Wiesenthal private collection).

He was court painter to King Augustus II of Poland, and director of the Royal Academy of Arts in Dresden. Life and work Sylvestre was born in Sceaux, south of Paris, the third son of Israel Silvestre, the notable engraver and drawing- master to the Grand Dauphin himself. Louis was taught initially by his father, then trained under Charles Le Brun and Bon Boullogne; he completed his studies in Rome, where he met Carlo Maratta, whose work had a great influence on him.Louis-Étienne Dussieux, Les Artistes français à l’étranger (Paris; Lyon, Jacques Lecoffre, 1876) pp. 86-88. After his return to Paris, Sylvester entered the Académie de peinture et de sculpture in 1702 and was appointed professor in 1706. The main works he painted at this time were The Healing of the paralytic at the door of the Temple (1703) and the portrait of Louis XV (1715). Hercules topples discord, envy and hatred Friedrich August II, the prince-elector of Saxony, met Silvestre when he was in France and offered him the chance to work at the court of his father Augustus II, King of Poland. The artist accepted the offer, obtained permission from Louis XV, and set off on April 23, 1716; by 1718 he was living in Dresden. Both Augustus II and his son were great admirers of Silvestre's work, and bestowed upon him, in the space of thirty years, every honour imaginable: he was appointed first court painter, then, in 1727, director of the Royal Academy of Arts; he was ennobled in 1741, as was his brother Charles-François. During this period, Silvestre completed, with the help of his wife, Marie-Catherine Hérault, many oil paintings and frescos, either in Dresden or in Warsaw. He painted many portraits of the King and Queen, as well as those of other leading aristocrats. He was responsible for the most important works in the Palace of Dresden, notably, subjects drawn from Ovid's Metamorphoses for several ceremonial bedrooms and several ceilings. On the death of (1654–1725), Silvestre was made Director of the Art Academy in Dresden. During the time he remained at the court of Dresden, Silvestre was known as much for his personality and his distinguished friends, as by his artistic talents. The great number of works that came from his brush and the generosity of his patrons allowed him to amass a considerable fortune, and, having achieved financial security, he retired and returned to France. Louis XV awarded him a pension of 1000 crowns and apartments in the Palais du Louvre itself. In 1752 he was appointed director of the Academy of Paris. Louis de Silvestre died in Paris at the Palais du Louvre on 11 April 1760. > \\"As for art\\", says Mariette, \\"he was not a painter without merit, but his > style had nothing that was new or too exciting; one saw only in him a good > follower of Bon Boulogne.\\" Amongst Silvestre's students was the painter Jean-Eleazar Schenau, who later became director of the Dresden Academy and of the Meissen porcelain factory. His daughter Marie-Maximilienne also became a painter.Profile of Marie- Maximilienne de Silvestre at the Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800.

He played college football for Texas A&M; University, and was recognized as an All- American kick returner. A second-round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, he played professionally for the Arizona Cardinals. Early years McElroy was born in Beaumont, Texas.Pro-Football-Reference.com, Players, Leeland McElroy. Retrieved February 8, 2012. He attended Central High School in Beaumont,databseFootball.com, Players, Leeland McElroy . Retrieved February 8, 2012. and played high school football for the Beaumont Central Jaguars. College career McElroy accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Texas A&M; University, and played for the Texas A&M; Aggies football team from 1992 to 1995. In 1995, McElroy became the undisputed starter — his only year to start at running back at A&M.; A&M; was coming off a 10-0-1 season and top-10 ranking, with most of their starters returning for their upperclassmen years. Corey Pullig was a senior quarterback, McElroy was a Heisman Trophy candidate as a junior, and an experienced defense paved the way for Playboy and The Sporting News to rank A&M; No. 1 in the preseason. The Aggies began the season with impressive wins over LSU (in which McElroy ran for 229 yards, 5th in Aggie history for a single game) and Tulsa, and took a #3 ranking to Boulder to face the #5 Colorado with A&M; mounting a \\"'Lectric Leeland\\" Heisman marketing campaign. McElroy played poorly and the Aggies lost a disappointing game. A&M; tipped passes for interceptions, receiver Chris Sanders dropped a sure touchdown on a screen pass across a wide-open middle of the field, and future NFL fullback Detron Smith dropped a sure huge gain on a swing pass in the flat. Star linebacker Reggie Brown even blew a coverage at the end zone, giving up a circus-catch touchdown. Another poor performance followed, along with another Aggie loss against Texas Tech in Lubbock the following week. McElroy rushed for 1,122 yards (112.2 per game) and 1709 all-purpose yards (2nd for a single season in Aggie history by just 30 yards) that season, but completely missed two games and sat out parts of others as a result of injuries. The Aggies finished 9-3 with a win against Michigan in the Alamo Bowl, but with those two losses as well as a home loss to rival Texas, the season that began with National Championship hopes was considered a disappointment by Aggie fans. For McElroy, the injuries, along with several less than spectacular performances against Colorado, Texas Tech, Baylor and Houston, turned a season that began with Heisman hopes into a fall filled with frustration. After his junior season, McElroy declared early for the NFL draft. In spite of his spectacular junior year, injury concerns caused McElroy to drop in the draft. Although projected to be a first round pick, he instead holds the dubious distinction of being the lowest picked player to attend the NFL draft. McElroy was selected in second round in 1996 by the Arizona Cardinals at number thirty-two. He has become somewhat of a cautionary tale against football players leaving school early. Aggie head Coach R. C. Slocum and others speculated that if McElroy had returned in 1996, he would have benefited from playing with a more prolific passer in Branndon Stewart and probably would have faced less eight-man defensive fronts. These factors along with the additional experience might have resulted in McElroy's Heisman hopes coming to fruition and his entering the draft a more seasoned, more complete back. In later interviews, McElroy would caution college players in his own mold against declaring for the draft when he said, \\"I’d tell them to evaluate the situation and consider every single option. The money is enticing, but nothing’s for sure at this level. I’m a prime example of that.\\" McElroy did make his mark at A&M; and will always be fondly remembered by Aggie fans for his electrifying runs and returns. McElroy was a threat to take the football the length of the field every time he touched it. He was a first-team selection on the Football Writers Association of America All-America team in 1994 and was a first-team Associated Press All-American all-purpose back in 1995. One of the fastest runners in college football history, McElroy set several NCAA records for kickoff returns in his career including most returns for a touchdown in one game and most returns for touchdowns in a single season. His final career average (36.3) set the NCAA record. He was a first- team selection on the Football Writers Association of America All-America team in 1994. He holds the Texas A&M; record for average all-purpose yards per game with 135. He is also tied for the longest kickoff return in A&M; history (100 yards, which he did twice). Professional career The Arizona Cardinals selected McElroy in the second round (Arizona's 2nd pick overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft,Pro Football Hall of Fame, Draft History, 1996 National Football League Draft. Retrieved February 8, 2012. and he played for the Cardinals from ( to ).National Football League, Historical Players, Leeland McElroy. Retrieved February 8, 2012. In his rookie NFL season, 1996, McElroy started for the Cardinals in the season opener against the Indianapolis Colts, rushing for 63 yards on 17 carries, but struggled in the second week against Miami, when he carried six times for negative five yards. The next week against New England, he had just 11 yards on eight carries, and against New Orleans in the fourth week of the season, McElroy was replaced in the lineup after gaining just five yards on four carries. LeShon Johnson took over the starting duties in week 5, and McElroy was relegated to backup and special teams. Overall, McElroy had just 86 yards on 38 carries in the Cardinals’ first seven games and finished with 305 yards on 89 carries. 1997 was not much better. McElroy opened the season as the Cardinals' starting tailback and averaged 18 carries in the first five games. He scored both his touchdowns that year in the first two games and after rushing for 281 yards in the first five games, he managed just 143 the rest of the year. Although he led the Cardinals in rushing, he finished with just 424 yards on 135 carries - a paltry 3.14 yards per carry. After averaging 21.3 yards on 51 kickoff returns in 1996, McElroy did not field a single kickoff in 1997, surrendering those duties to Kevin Williams, who averaged 24.7 in his place. The Cardinals released McElroy and he was claimed off waivers in July 1998 by Tampa Bay, and made an instant impact with a spectacular touchdown run in the Hall of Fame Game against the Steelers. He played well, rushing 27 times for 121 yards and a touchdown in the preseason, but the Bucs were deep at running back and McElroy's specialty was kickoff returns, where Tampa already featured Reidel Anthony and Warrick Dunn. Tony Dungy said that \\"[at that] point it would be best to give him a chance to maybe hook on with someone else, and he had such an impressive preseason, [they hoped] for him for that to be the case.\\" Unfortunately it would not be so. Although he spent the 1999 preseason with the Denver Broncos and was picked up later that season by the Indianapolis Colts, a combination of injuries and misfortune ensured that McElroy never played again in the NFL.

Design and construction The s were built to a slightly modified design for Australian service. They were in length overall, with a beam of , and a mean draught of .Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 110 Displacement was 1,350 tons when surfaced, and 1,870 tons when submerged. The boats had diesel motors for surface running and electricity generation, but when underwater ran off electric motors. They had two propeller shafts. Maximum speed was on the surface, and when dived. Oxley had a ship's company of 54. Armament consisted of eight torpedo tubes (six facing forward, two facing aft), one deck gun, and two machine guns. Oxley was laid down by Vickers-Armstrong Limited at Barrow-in-Furness, England in March 1925, under the designation OA1.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 112 She was launched on 29 June 1926, completed on 22 July 1927, and commissioned into the RAN on 1 April 1927. The submarine was named after explorer John Oxley. Operational history After commissioning, Oxley and Otway were temporarily assigned to the Royal Navy's 5th Submarine Flotilla. On 8 February 1928, the two submarines set out for Australia in the longest unescorted voyage undertaken by a British submarine. The submarines were diverted to Malta after cracks were found on Otways engine columns. On arrival in Malta, similar fractures were found in Oxleys engine columns, and the two boats were detained while improved columns were fabricated and installed. They resumed their voyage in November, and reached Sydney on 14 February 1929. Because of the deteriorating financial conditions leading into the Great Depression, the two submarines were placed into reserve a year later; Oxley was paid off into Reserve on 10 May 1930. Oxley underwent diving exercises every second week until 9 April 1931, when the submarine was paid off in full prior to transfer to the RN. The ongoing cost of maintaining the boats, coupled with the tonnage limits imposed by the London Naval Treaty prompted the Australian government to offer Oxley and Otway to the Royal Navy. The submarines were transferred and commissioned on 10 April 1931. On 29 April, Oxley and Otway (which had also been recommissioned into the RN) left Sydney for Malta. During 1939, the submarine was based at Portsmouth as part of the 5th Submarine Flotilla. At the onset of war the submarine was a member of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. From 26–29 August 1939, the 2nd Submarine Flotilla deployed to its war bases at Dundee and Blyth.Rohwer, p.1 Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Oxley was assigned to patrol duties off the coast of Norway. She was assigned the pennant number 55. Loss On 10 September 1939, Oxley was sunk by HMS Triton. Oxley was the first British submarine lost during the Second World War. When the Admiralty was notified that His Majesty's Government would declare war on Germany, five submarines of the Second Flotilla, including HMS Triton and HMS Oxley, were ordered to patrol on the Obrestad line off Norway on 24 August 1939. Thus, on 3 September all British submarines were in their combat patrol sectors. At 1955 on 10 September 1939, Triton had surfaced, fixed a position off the Obrestad Light, set a slow zigzag patrol, and began charging batteries. Lieutenant Commander Steel, having verified that the area was clear and having posted lookouts, gave the bridge to the officer of the watch and went below, leaving orders that he was to be called if anything unusual appeared. At 2045, he was called to the bridge when an object in the water could be seen very fine on the port bow. Steel ordered propulsion shifted to the main motors, the signalman to the bridge, and torpedo tubes 7 and 8 readied for firing. The object was recognised as a submarine low in the water. Once on the bridge, the signalman sent three challenges over several minutes with the box lamp, none of which were answered. Steel wondered if the boat could be HMS Oxley, which should have been patrolling next in line, but some distance away. Steel and his bridge crew studied the silhouette, but could not distinguish what type of submarine it was. A fourth challenge was sent: three green rifle-grenade flares. After firing, Steel counted slowly to 15 and then decided that they were seeing a German U-boat. He ordered tubes 7 and 8 fired with a three-second interval. Less than a minute later, an explosion was heard. Triton moved into the area to investigate and heard cries for help. The light from the Aldis lamp revealed three men floundering amid oil and debris. Lieutenant Guy C. I. St.B. Watkins and Lieutenant Harry A. Stacey entered the water and rescued Lieutenant Commander H.G. Bowerman, Oxley's commanding officer, as well as Able Seaman Herbert Gluckes, a lookout. The third person in the water, Lieutenant F.K. Manley, was seen to be swimming strongly when he suddenly sank from view. Neither Manley's body nor any other survivors from Oxley were found. A Board of Enquiry found that Steel had done all he reasonably could in the circumstances. Oxley was out of position, Triton had acted correctly, and the first Allied submarine casualty of World War II was due to \\"friendly fire.\\" During the war, the loss of Oxley was attributed to an accidental explosion. After the war, it was explained to have been a collision with Triton. The truth was not made public until the 1950s.

Tiger hunting is the capture and killing of tigers. Humans are the tigers' most significant predator, and illegal poaching is a major threat to the tigers. The Bengal tiger is the most common subspecies of tiger, constituting approximately 80% of the entire tiger population, and is found in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, and India. It has been hunted in these countries for centuries. The tiger has historically been a popular big game animal and has been hunted for prestige as well as for taking trophies. Extensive poaching has continued even after such hunting became illegal and legal protection was provided to the tiger. Now a conservation-reliant endangered species, the majority of the world's tigers live in captivity. Tigers were once considered to be harder to hunt than lions, due to their habit of living alone in dense cover and not noisily asserting their presence with roars as often. History Historical tiger hunting in India, c. 1821. Historically, tigers have been hunted on foot, horseback, elephant-back, and from machans. Any of these involved considerable danger and the hunting of a tiger had been considered a manly and a courageous feat with game, trophies being collected as the symbols of valor and prestige. Accounts of British royalty photographed aside dead tiger carcasses during the late 19th and early 20th centuries depict the construction of the successful conquest of Indian nature, thus symbolizing the imperial, masculine identities desired by the British. In some places such as China, tigers were also perceived to be a threat to human life in the area, so those who managed to kill them were hailed as heroes to the general public. In 1986, it was discovered that tigers were declining rapidly due to being poisoned, snared or shot and then smuggled out of India to supply medicinal manufacturers in China.Nichols, Michael, and Geoffrey C. Ward. (1998). \\"The Year of the Tiger.\\" National Geographic Society. Print. By 1992, the trade industry paid a total of 12.4 million dollars for 200 tigers that were harvested by poachers. Since that time, the Chinese have banned poaching and the tiger part trade. However, this has only increased the value of poached tigers. Individual poachers now get approximately $800 per tiger, but those associated with well-known established gangs can receive up to $5,000 per body received. In addition to poaching, to compensate for the banning of trade in tiger parts, China has begun harvesting tigers by means of \\"tiger farming.\\" This enables them to breed captive tigers for the purpose of selling their parts. India 'Ala'ud-Din and Mahima Dharma hunting a tiger for entertainment while in an intimate relationship, Punjab, South Asia, 1790 While the tigers were widely extant and not threatened up to the first decades of the twentieth century, hunting and habitat loss reduced their population in India from 40,000 to less than 1,800 in a mere hundred years. Despite the prevalence of tiger hunting as a royal sport for centuries, the consequences were larger during the British Raj due to the hunters' use of far superior firepower, and their interest to hunt shared by a much larger number of colonial aristocrats led to further depletion. In the preface to Manohar Malgonkar's novel A Distant Drum, the Regimental Code of an old Indian Army regiment is set out, to which the regiment's officers are expected to live up. It begins with First and foremost, we always finish off our own tigers. Always. Tsarist Russia In the first years of the 20th century, the Imperial Russian government began a plan to colonise the Central Asiatic lands inhabited by the Caspian tiger. The Russian local authorities worked heavily to exterminate tigers during a huge land reclamation program in areas such as the Syr-Daria and Amu-Daria rivers and the Aral Sea. The Russian army was instructed to exterminate all tigers found around the area of the Caspian Sea, a project that was carried out very efficiently. Once the extermination of the Caspian tiger was almost complete, the farmers followed, clearing forests and planting crops. Due to intensive hunting and deforestation, the Caspian tiger retreated first from the lush lowlands to the forested ranges, then to the marshes around some of the larger rivers, and finally, deeper into the mountains, until it almost certainly became extinct. The last stronghold of the Caspian tiger in the former Soviet Union was in the Tigrovaya Balka area, in Tajikistan. Though the tigers were reported as being found here until the mid-1950s, the reliability of these claims is unknown. Soviet Union In the early years of the Russian Civil War, both Red and White armies based in Vladivostok nearly wiped out the local Siberian tigers. In the 1920s, tigers were heavily persecuted by the Communists, who would on occasion bag up to eight or ten on a single outing. Legal tiger hunting within the Soviet Union would continue until 1947, when it was officially prohibited. People's Republic of China In 1959, during the PRC's Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong declared South China tigers as enemies of man, and began organizing and encouraging eradication campaigns. By the early 1960s, Chinese tigers had been reduced to just over 1,000 animals. A decade later, their range was reduced to three regions in southern China, two of which were located in the Jiangxi Province. Tigers in traditional Chinese medicine Instructions for tiger skinning Tiger bones and nearly all body parts are used in traditional Chinese medicine for a range of purported uses, including pain killers. Tiger parts are used in traditional East Asian medicines, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine, where many people believe that tiger parts have multiple medicinal properties. When combined with the high prices that furs fetch on the black market and destruction of habitat, poaching for medicinal uses has greatly reduced tiger populations in the wild. A century ago, it is estimated that there were over 100,000 tigers in the world; now, global numbers may be below 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals. There is no scientific corroboration to these beliefs, which include: *The tail of the tiger is sometimes ground and mixed with soap to create an ointment for use in treating skin cancer. *The bones found in the tip of the tiger's tail are said to ward off evil spirits. *Crushed tiger bones added to wine, served as a Taiwanese general tonic. *The feet of a tiger, when dipped in palm oil and hung in front of a door, are said to diminish the likelihood of evil spirits from entering. *Tiger's skin is said to cure a fever caused by ghosts. To use it effectively, the user must sit on the tiger's skin, but beware. If too much time is spent on the tiger's skin, legend says the user will become a tiger. *Adding honey to the gallstones and applying the combination to the hands and feet is said to effectively treat abscesses. *Burnt tiger hair can allegedly drive away centipedes. *Mixing the brain of a tiger with oil and rubbing the mixture on your body is an alleged cure for both laziness and acne. *Rolling the eyeballs into pills is an alleged remedy for convulsions. *The whiskers are used to cure toothaches. *One will allegedly possess courage and shall be protected from sudden fright by wearing a tiger's claw as a piece of jewellery or carrying one in a pocket. *Strength, cunning, and courage can allegedly be obtained by consuming a tiger's heart. *Floating ribs of a tiger are considered a good luck talisman. *The tiger's penis is said to be an aphrodisiac. *Small bones in a tiger's feet tied to a child's wrists are said to be a sure cure for convulsions. Berar On 15 March 2010, the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies (WFCMS) issued a statement regarding the use of endangered species for medicinal purposes. Huang Jianyin, Deputy Secretary of WFCMS, addressing the conference, issued the following statement: \\"Tiger conservation has become a political issue in the world. Therefore it is necessary for the traditional Chinese medicine industry to support the conservation of endangered species, including tigers\\" (Science Daily). As TCM Practitioners push to remove endangered species from the \\"ingredients list,\\" they are being met by farmers hoping to reignite the demand for TCM Based medicinal products, such as tiger bone wine. Tiger farming is partially, if not fully, responsible for reigniting the demand for tiger-based medicinal products. At Xiongsen bear and tiger farm in Guilin, China, as many as 200,000 bottles of tiger bone wine are being produced annually. (Jacobs 2010) Parks such as Xiongsen profit off branding their wine as holistic medicinal remedies, meeting the market demand for prior medicinal practices. While TCM practitioners attempt to move away from the use of endangered species, tiger farms are reigniting this demand. Today, tiger farmers in China are pushing their government to lift the ban on tiger part sales. In 2007, farmers fought to have the ban lifted, citing that, \\"[t]he poaching of wild tigers for traditional medicine would diminish substantially if tigers, which breed prolifically in captivity - could be farmed for food.\\" However, this goes directly against the reasons for which these establishments were created - for reintroducing the endangered species back into the wild. If tiger farming is allowed, the population of wild tigers will be directly affected. How? One of the first noticeable factors will be the growth in demand for a natural product (wild vs captive bred). The consequence of ignoring these dire issues will be detrimental to the population of tigers. Most alarmingly, it is projected that within the next decade, the species of tigers may go extinct. \\"James Leape, director general of the World Wildlife Fund, told the meeting in St. Petersburg that if the proper protective measures aren't taken, tigers may disappear by 2022, the next Chinese calendar year of the tiger\\" (Titova 2010) Hunting and poaching A group of men poses with a killed Javan tiger, 1941 The wild tiger is one of the most threatened species on the planet. The main factors behind the endangerment of tigers are spurred by humans, due to demand, customary beliefs, ritual practices of/and increasing number of populations clashing and tampering with the original boundaries and dwelling zones of this wild animal. In some middle eastern countries tiger parts are believed to heal the liver and kidneys and are used to treat epilepsy, baldness, inflammation, possession by evil demons, toothaches, malaria, hydrophobia, skin diseases, nightmares, laziness, fevers, and headaches. Although tiger populations are mostly impacted by habitat degradation and diminution in prey density. Wang and Shen 2010 explain that factors that best explain diminishing population of tiger species are human population density and distance from roads. However, hunting activities and poaching contribute greatly to the declines of this animal. Illegal trade circulating products from tiger parts is another of the major causes of extinction of the Javan, Caspian and Bali tiger subspecies (WWF 2010). A well-respected report \\"Traffic: The wildlife trade monitoring network\\" has released numbers on animals killed and traded for parts and products. \\"One thousand tigers were killed and traded for their parts and products in the last decade.\\" The Malayan species of tiger has about 600 to 800 in the wild, making it the third largest sub-species. It is one of the most portrayed, which appears on the Malaysian coat of arms. The Bali tiger has already become extinct due to hunting. It was the smallest of the tiger family with an approximate weight of 90–100 kg in males and 65–80 kg in females. As the Russian economy has declined, laws and regulations against poaching became looser and less enforced, which has favoured the hunting and poaching of tigers to improve market conditions and economy (Washington Post, 2010). The degree to which poaching and hunting is practised is such that very rarely do Siberian tigers die of old age, since they are killed before they are allowed to reach this stage. In recognition of these times of struggle for the survival of the tiger, Russian Prime minister Vladimir Putin has put forth an effort to bring people together in awareness of this occurrence in the city of St. Petersburg. The name of the event is called the \\"Tiger Summit\\" an international forum to rescue tigers from the brink of extinction. The year 2010 was the Chinese year of the tiger, which made the year a natural focus of international conservation efforts. Tiger experts fear that tigers are in jeopardy of extinction due to current threats (Traffic 2010). Prolonging their existence will take a very high level of commitment from multiple countries. Experts agree that efforts to conserve habitat are essential. For example, an evaluation of conservation strategies to preserve species of tigers in North- eastern China reveal the importance of enlarging suitable habitats for conservation and survival (Xiaofeng, 2009). Key landscapes must be tiger- conservation friendly to ensure ecosystem integrity that is equally valuable for humans, tigers and many other wildlife species sharing the same area. In July 2014 at an international convention on endangered species in Geneva, Switzerland, a Chinese representative admitted for the first time his government was aware trading in tiger skins was occurring in China. Methods Tigerhunting on elephant-back Baiting Baiting consisted of watching for a tiger over the carcass of some animal, domestic or wild, which it had previously killed. The tiger would usually come to its kill in the evening, making the vicinity resound with its loud roars. While there was no danger to the hunter as long as he sat up in the tree, it was dangerous for him to attempt to return home during the night. The hunter would thus have to remain in the tree till morning. In China, small bombs known as pen-tras were placed in a tiger's kill, and would detonate upon ingestion. Bird lime In Burma and in India, a concoction of mustard oil and latex was strewn around a water hole frequented by a tiger. In an attempt to rid its paws of the sticky fluid with its tongue or teeth, the tiger would involuntarily cover its face with dirt and leaves. The resulting blindness made it easier for it to be brought down. Hunquah Maharaja Ram Singh hunting a tiger Hunqua was the rajah's practise in Bengal of reducing the numbers of tigers by setting fire to grass ten or twenty miles around one jungle in such a manner that beaters could drive the fleeing animals into a mile of netting. Impalement In upper Irrawaddy, when a bamboo bridge was seen to be used by tigers, the slats of the bridge would be adjusted, so that on its next crossing, the tiger would fall onto sharpened poles at the bottom. In Madhya Pradesh, the Baigas would hang a tiger's kill from the middle of a horizontal pole supported in two forked trees a few feet apart. Because the pole was slippery and had no bark, the tiger would slip, trying to gain access to the kill and fall upon sharpened bamboo spikes at the bottom. In Burma, bamboo stakes would be placed on both sides of a path frequented by tigers. When a tiger made physical contact with a cord tied across the path, the slit half of the bamboo clapper would loudly spring back on its other half. The sound would apparently cause the tiger to leap to one side and impale itself on one of the stakes. Horse/camel back Elephant back beaters on a tiger hunt, India, late 1890's. Horses and camels were used by cavalry officers in the 17th century India, which they found to be more reliable and less unpredictable than elephants. After chasing the tigers to exhaustion, the riders would gallop around the tigers in ever decreasing circles, and then kill the tiger with a sword. Hunting dogs For this purpose it was necessary to have a pack of hunting dogs of very considerable strength, well trained in the chase of every kind of big game animal found in the taiga. When hunting, the hunters would usually collect most of the dogs of their village to form a nondescript pack. Not all dogs were equal in hunting, as they differed greatly in quality and character. In every pack there were one or two leaders which the rest follow. If the leader were lost, the pack soon got out of hand. Hunters rarely brought dogs along in heavy snow, as it would impede the dogs' movement and make them easy targets for the tiger. Upon encountering the tiger, the dogs would begin to bark furiously, at the same time catching hold of its legs and biting it in the hind quarters. In such a manner, they caused it to stop and turn at bay. When the tiger was finally cornered, the dogs would usually make high pitched barks, consistent with feelings of extreme nervousness. Half of the pack would continue to surround the tiger, while the other dogs rested. If, however, the quarry tried to break away, the whole pack charged it, with some of the dogs actually jumping on the animal's back and forcing it to halt once more. Working only from sound and keeping behind trees out of sight of the quarry, the hunter would get within easy range of the latter and shoot it. Despite their great strength, the tigers usually did not stand their ground against the dogs unless cornered, much preferring to retreat. It was theorised that this is due to the tiger mistaking the dogs for dholes (Cuon alpinus), which have been known to kill tigers on rare occasions. Solutions to tiger extinction To conserve the wild tigers as a species in the environment, several threats need to be addressed – habitat loss, reduction of prey populations, and direct hunting of tigers. In response to the poaching and hunting of tiger species for the making of medicines and other tiger derived products, The Chinese government should regulate and if needed to terminate or set a quota for the number of allowable practices for this type of action. Because a lot of these hunting practices take place illegally and it is hard to put an end to poaching. Enforcement of existing laws and sanctions against illegal trade markets that circulate tiger parts is greatly needed (Barber- Meyer). Human scarcity makes for less exploitation of natural resources and the wild tiger populations can in these places remain stable or increase, as long as they are not subject to poaching. Tigers depend on trees for shelter and cover and hunting of animals that live on them. Habitat destruction and logging for new roads and dwellings harms this species ecosystem drastically. The trees allow tigers to sharpen their claws and scratch trees to provide the basic survival toolkits. The loss of vegetative elements in their reproductive and dwelling environment is a cause for concern as well, since these species rely on cover from trees and tall grasses to prey on other animals. Trees and vegetation also provide natural cover from abiotic factors and elements that these animals rely on for their protection. Tigers mate and reproduce in the same areas where they were born, therefore conserving natural vegetation and tree cover is important. The effort to promote the recovery of tigers throughout their range has been ongoing for at least 40 years. Multiple governments have funded a special Project Tiger Program, and have been very active. Anderson et al. 2006 has analysed funding of money for tiger conservation specifically by non-governmental organisations between the years 1998-2002. Over $23 million has been invested between the countries of India, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nepal. Gratwicke et al. 2006 writes that ExxonMobil, a major corporation has invested 12.6 million US dollars for the sole purpose of tiger conservation between the years of 1999-2004. The Wildlife Conservation Society and the Panthera Foundation announced a plan in 2008 to create a \\"Genetic Corridor\\" between Bhutan and Myanmar to help sustain a large, continuous population of tigers, spanning eight countries. This project promises to be the largest area of unbroken or unfragmented tiger habitat, and would represent the single most intense effort to conserve this species from extinction. (Rabinowitz). Another major contributor is the World Wildlife Fund for nature. This organisation has proposed a major initiative with an objective of doubling wild tiger populations by the year 2020. In response to major organisations putting forth such great efforts, other smaller more numerous efforts have joined forces in this task. The conglomeration of these organisations has been named the international Tiger Coalition. Sanderson et al. (2006) evaluated the effectiveness of varying conservation measures for the tiger species in differing sites through a survey of 70 conservationists. High scores were given for those areas that showed a high effectiveness in implementation with a scaling value in descending order for those measures proven ineffective. Of these measures, a few projects in India, Bhutan, Nepal and Malaysia were considered to be most effective.

Nearly all the information on Baiju Bawra comes from legends, and lacks historical authenticity. According to the most popular legends, he lived in the Mughal period during the 15th and 16th centuries. He was one of the court musicians of Man Singh Tomar of Gwalher (now Gwalior). Chanderi–Gwalior legend  According to a story, mentioned by Susheela Misra in Some immortals of Hindustani music, Baiju Bawra was born as Baijnath Mishra in a poor Brahmin family in Champaner, Gujarat Sultanate. After his father's death, his mother, a devotee of Krishna, went to Vrindavan. There, Baiju met his teacher Swami Haridas, and was trained in a gurukula. He also adopted an orphan named Gopal, and trained him to be a musician. Gradually, Baiju became famous, and was invited to the court of the Raja of Chanderi. In Chanderi, Baiju's adopted son Gopal also became famous. Gopal married his disciple Prabha, and the couple had a daughter named Meera. Around this time, Raja Man Singh Tomar invited him to Gwalior, where he reached the height of his fame. The queen of Gwalior, Rani Mriganayani, also became his disciple. Once, while Baiju was away, Gopal left Chanderi permanently, lured by some Kashmiri merchants who wanted him to serve their king. When Baiju returned home, he was shocked to find his entirely family gone. He became a mendicant, and wandered from place to place, looking for his beloved adopted grandchild Meera. People thought of him as an insane person, and thus, he came to be known as \\"bawra\\". (Alternative legends say that he came to be known as \\"Bawra\\", because he was obsessed with classical music.) Tansen, another famous disciple of Swami Haridas, had heard Baiju's praise from his teacher. He asked his own patron Raja Ramachandra Baghela of Rewa to organize a musical contest, in hope that Baiju would come to this contest to salvage his reputation. Baiju came to the contest, and performed extraordinary feats such as hypnotizing deer through his rendering of Raag Mrigranjini and melting a stone slab through Raag Malkauns. Tansen recognized him and embraced him. The legends in the books preserved in Jai Vilas Mahal in Gwalior state that Baiju Bawra could light oil lamps by singing Raag Deepak; make it rain by singing the raags Megh, Megh Malhar, or Gaud Malhar; and bloom flowers by singing raga Bahar. Baiju Bawra died in Chanderi after suffering from typhoid on Vasant Panchami day in 1610. A purported samadhi of Baiju Bawra is located in Chanderi.  Legend of Bacchu  Some medieval narratives, mentioned in works such as Mirat-i-Sikandari (17th century), describe an incident about a Gujarati singer called Bacchu (also known as Bakshu or Manjhu). According to the narrative, Bacchu was a musician in the court of Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. When the Mughal emperor Humayun attacked Bahadur Shah's contingent in Mandu, Bacchu fell in the hands of a Mughal soldier. He was about to be killed, when he was recognized by a Raja allied with the Mughals. The Raja introduced him to emperor Humayun, who was pleased with his singing and granted his wish to release the Gujarati prisoners. Bacchu remained in service of the emperor for some days, but then ran away to Sultan Bahadur Shah, who had escaped from Mandu to Champaner. Bacchu is identified with Baiju by a section of scholars. Howevers, others believe that Bacchu and Baiju were two distinct persons. In popular culture Baiju Bawra, a 1952 Hindi-language movie depicts a completely fictionalized version of Baiju's life. The film was a big commercial success. In the movie, Tansen is known to be the greatest musician alive. Nobody is allowed to sing in the city unless he or she can sing better than Tansen. Anyone who attempts to sing, without doing it better than Tansen, is executed. Baiju's father dies when Tansen's sentry tries to stop him from singing. Years later, Baiju avenges his father's death by defeating Tansen in a musical duel.

Blabbermouth.net was founded and is run by Borivoj Krgin. The first version of the website was launched in March 2001; in October 2001, the record label Roadrunner Records began hosting it. Users can post comments to selected news articles and album reviews, either in response to other user comments or in response to the article itself. History Founder Borivoj Krgin came up with the concept of Blabbermouth in January 2000. Robert Kampf, a friend of Krgin who runs Century Media Records, was staying with Krgin in New York and set up a meeting with Gunter Ford of World Management. During the meeting, Ford suggested an idea for a \\"heavy metal portal,\\" a site which would offer news, merchandise, and CD reviews to get record labels to sell their products through the site. Ford wanted Kampf to be involved. Krgin disliked the idea and wished for a site that offered around-the-clock news, as he thought that no good news sites existed. Krgin began researching how to develop and host his own website two months after the meeting. After a year Krgin felt comfortable going \\"live.\\" The initial \\"primitive\\" version of the site was launched on March 3, 2001. In October of the same year Monte Conner, a friend of Krgin, and a Roadrunner Records artist and repertoire approached Krgin with the idea of having the site hosted on the Roadrunner servers. This way, Krgin could focus on Blabbermouth.net's content rather than the technical aspects involved in running a site. Blabbermouth.net is described by the London Free Press as a \\"reliable industry and fan site\\".Reaney, James (April 15, 2008). \\"Motley Crue set to rock Sarnia, sources say.\\" London Free Press. Sources According to his own words, Krgin spends most of his time operating the site. When finding information relating to bands, Krgin claims to search bands'official websites (including social networking sites), which are usually reported on immediately, and band message boards where members of the band post. However, Krgin relies on the contacts he has made over the years ranging from band members, metal journalists, managers and other people in the music industry, stating this is where the \\"best\\" information comes from. Krgin supposedly sends e-mails and makes telephone calls daily to obtain new information. Blabbermouth.net has a 'submit news' feature which has proved to be helpful to Krgin. When receiving a rumor he deems worthy of posting, Krgin will first research and contact people related to the band and question them about the rumour. It's claimed that 90% of the information posted is either found online or is submitted directly to the website by bands, managers, labels or associated persons. Criticism Blabbermouth.net has been criticized by musicians and music industry persons for internet trolls and news posts that are unrelated to heavy metal or hard rock. Krgin said he posts these articles to attract humorous comments from users, and as relief from the constant monotony of album news. In September 2006, Krgin claimed to have performed a cleanup of Blabbermouth.net's comments and to have adopted a policy whereby users can report offensive comments in order to have them deleted from the site. Prior to this, in his own words, \\"countless abusive, obscene, defamatory, racist, homophobic and threatening comments\\" had been posted on the site since the \\"comments\\" feature was implemented in early 2002. Traffic Blabbermouth.net was visited by more than 1.2 million unique users each month, and it had an average of 80,000 unique visitors per day, according to Google Analytics (as of August 2011). The busiest day so far was 298,000 unique visitors in a single 24-hour period over May 16, 2010, due to the death of Ronnie James Dio. The second-busiest day was more than 200,000 unique visitors in a single 24-hour period, which happened the day after the death of Type O Negative frontman Peter Steele—April 15, 2010. Blabbermouth.net is ranked as the 12,279th most trafficked Web site globally according to Alexa. Prior to its recent change requiring users to log in with a Facebook account in order to post comments, Blabbermouth.net had more 101,000 registered users (users who are registered to post comments on the site) as of August 2011.

Life As a boy growing up in St. Louis, Missouri, Auer was reportedly fascinated by weather. After a freak winter storm caused havoc in his home town, he decided to become a meteorologist. He studied meteorology at Colorado State University before getting a job at the University of Wyoming. Auer was a Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Wyoming for 22 years.Speakers New Zealand Presents – Augie Auer .

His most frequently cited research paper involves ice crystals in clouds. 96 citations in Google Scholar. In 1990, Auer emigrated to New Zealand, becoming Chief Meteorologist for the Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited from 1990 to 1998.

It was also abolished among the sovereign Indian tribes in Indian Territory by new peace treaties which the US required after the war. For most of the seventeenth and part of the eighteenth centuries, male slaves outnumbered female slaves, making the two groups' experiences in the colonies distinct. Living and working in a wide range of circumstances and regions, African- American women and men encountered diverse experiences of enslavement. With increasing numbers of kidnapped African women, as well as those born into slavery in the colonies, slave sex ratios leveled out between 1730 and 1750. \\"The uniqueness of the African-American female's situation is that she stands at the crossroads of two of the most well-developed ideologies in America, that regarding women and that regarding the Negro.\\" Living both female and black identities, enslaved African women faced both racism and sexism. Colonial America Virginia The Old Plantation, c. 1790. Enslaved Africans on a South Carolinan plantation. From 1700 to 1740 an estimated number of 43,000 slaves were imported into Virginia, and almost all but 4,000 were imported directly from Africa.Saxton, Martha, Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America, New York City, 2003, 121 Recent scholarship suggests that the number of women and men imported in this period was more or less equal and included a high number of children. As most were from West Africa, its cultures were central in mid- to late- eighteenth-century slave life in Virginia. African values were prevalent and West African women's cultures had strong representations. Some prevalent cultural representations were the deep and powerful bonds between mother and child, and among women within the larger female community.Saxton, Martha, Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America, New York City, 2003, 122-123 Among the Igbo ethnic group in particular (from present-day Nigeria), which comprised between one-third and one-half of incoming slaves in the early eighteenth century, female authority (the omu) \\"ruled on a wide variety of issues of importance to women in particular and the community as a whole.\\"Saxton (2003), Being Good, p. 122 The Igbo represented one group of people brought to the Chesapeake, but in general, Africans came from an extremely diverse range of cultural backgrounds. All came from worlds where women's communities were strong,Saxton (2003), Being Good, p. 124 and were introduced into a patriarchal and violently racist and exploitative society; white men typically characterized all black women as passionately sexual, to justify their sexual abuse and miscegenation.Saxton (2003), Being Good, p. 125 Virginia girls, much less black girls, were not educated, and most were illiterate. African and African American female slaves occupied a broad range of positions. The southern colonies were majorly agrarian societies and enslaved women provided labor in the fields, planting and doing chores, but mostly in the domestic sphere, nursing, taking care of children, cooking, laundering, etc.  New England  John Greenwood. This portrait of Ann Arnold was the first individual portrait of a black woman in North America. Ann Arnold was the wet nurse of a child whose parents were born in the English isle of Jersey. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Historian Ira Berlin distinguished between \\"slave societies\\" and \\"societies with slaves.\\" New England was considered to be a society with slaves, dependent on maritime trade and diversified agriculture, in contrast to the slave societies of the south, which were \\"socially, economically, and politically dependent on slave labor, had a large enslaved population, and allowed masters extensive power over their slaves unchecked by the law.\\"Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. \\"The Uniqueness of New England,\\" Love of Freedom, New York, City, 29. New England had a small slave population and masters thought of themselves as patriarchs with the duty to protect, guide, and care for their slaves. Enslaved women in New England had greater opportunity to seek freedom than in other regions because of \\"the New England legal system, the frequency of manumission by owners, and chances for hiring out, especially among enslaved men, who seized the opportunity to earn enough money to purchase a wife and children.\\"Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. \\"The Uniqueness of New England,\\" Love of Freedom, New York, City, 30. Enslaved women largely occupied traditional \\"women's work\\" roles and were often hired out by the day. They worked mainly as maids, in the kitchen, the barn, and the garden. They did menial and servile tasks: polished family silver or furniture, helped with clothes and hair, drew baths, barbered the men, and completed menial domestic chores like sweeping, emptying chamber pots, carrying gallons of water a day, washing the dishes, brewing, looking after young children and the elderly, cooking and baking, milking the cows, feeding the chickens, spinning, knitting, carding, sewing, and laundering. Their daily work was less demanding than the field labor of enslaved women in other regions. Nonetheless enslaved women in New England worked hard, often under poor living conditions and malnutrition. \\"As a result of heavy work, poor housing conditions, and inadequate diet, the average black woman did not live past forty.\\"Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. \\"The Uniqueness of New England,\\" Love of Freedom, New York, City, 35. Enslaved women were given to white women as gifts from their husbands, and as wedding and Christmas gifts. The idea that New England masters treated their slaves with greater kindness in comparison to southern slave-owners is a myth. They had little mobility freedom and lacked access to education and any training. \\"The record of slaves who were branded by their owners, had their ears nailed, fled, committed suicide, suffered the dissolution of their families, or were sold secretly to new owners in Barbados in the last days of the Revolutionary War before they become worthless seems sufficient to refute the myth of kindly masters. They lashed out at their slaves when they were angry, filled with rage, or had convenient access to horsewhip.\\"Catherine Adams and Elizabeth H. Pleck. \\"The Uniqueness of New England,\\" Love of Freedom, New York, City, 36. Female slaves were sometimes forced by their masters into sexual relationships with enslaved men for the purpose of forced breeding. It was also not uncommon for enslaved women to be raped and in some cases impregnated by their masters.  Southern colonies  Regardless of location, slaves endured hard and demeaning lives, but labor in the southern colonies was most severe. The southern colonies were slave societies; they were \\"socially, economically, and politically dependent on slave labor, had a large enslaved population, and allowed masters extensive power over their slaves unchecked by the law.\\" Plantations were the economic power structure of the South, and male and female slave labor was its foundation. Early on, slaves in the South worked primarily in agriculture, on farms and plantations growing indigo, rice, and tobacco; cotton became a major crop after the 1790s. Female slaves worked in a wide variety of capacities. They were expected to do field work as well as have children, and in this way increase the slave population. In the years before the American Revolution, the female slave population grew mainly as a result of natural increase and not importation. \\"Once slaveholders realized that the reproductive function of the female slave could yield a profit, the manipulation of procreative sexual relations became an integral part of the sexual exploitation of female slaves.\\"White, Deborah Gray. Ar'n't I a Woman, New York City, 1999, 67-68. Many slave women raised their children without much assistance from males. Enslaved women were counted on not only to do their house and field work, but also to bear, nourish, and rear the children whom slaveholders sought to continually replenish their labor force. As houseslaves, women were domestic servants: cooking, sewing, acting as maids, and rearing the planter's children. Later on they were used in many factories, instrumental in the development of the United States, where they were kept at lower maintenance costs. Revolutionary era During the Revolutionary War (1775–83) enslaved women served on both sides, the Loyalist army as well as the Patriots', as nurses, laundresses, and cooks. But as historian Carol Berkin writes, \\"African American loyalties were to their own future, not to Congress or to king.\\"Carol Berkin, \\"African American Women and the American Revolution,\\" Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 120. Enslaved women could be found in army camps and as camp followers. They worked building roads, constructing fortifications, and laundering uniforms, \\"but they remained slaves rather than refugees. Masters usually hired these women out to the military, sometimes hiring out their children as well.\\"Carol Berkin, \\"African American Women and the American Revolution,\\" Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 131. Enslaved women could also be found working in the shops, homes, fields, and plantations of every American colony. It is estimated that by 1770, there were more than 47,000 enslaved blacks in the northern colonies, almost 20,000 of them in New York. More than 320,000 slaves worked in the Chesapeake colonies, making 37 percent of the population of the region African or African American. Over 187,000 of these slaves were in Virginia. In the Lower South there were more than 92,000 slaves. South Carolina alone had over 75,000 slaves, and by 1770 planters there were importing 4,000 Africans a year. In many counties in the Lower South, the slave population outnumbered the white.Carol Berkin, \\"African American Women and the American Revolution,\\" Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 121. Although service in the military did not guarantee enslaved people their freedom, black men had the opportunity to escape slavery by enlisting in the army. During the disruption of war, both men and women ran away. Men were more likely to escape, as pregnant women, mothers, and women who nursed their elderly parents or friends seldom abandoned those who depended on them.Carol Berkin, \\"African American Women and the American Revolution,\\" Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 122. So many slaves deserted their plantations in South Carolina, that there were not enough field hands to plant or harvest crops. As food grew scarce, the blacks who remained behind suffered from starvation or enemy attack. The British issued certificates of manumission to more than 914 women as reward for serving in the Loyalist army.Carol Berkin, \\"African American Women and the American Revolution,\\" Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 128. But many women who had won their freedom lost it again \\"through violence and trickery and the venality of men entrusted with their care.\\"Carol Berkin, \\"African American Women and the American Revolution,\\" Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 134. Others who managed to secure their freedom faced racial prejudice, discrimination, and poverty. When loyalist plantations were captured, enslaved women were often taken and sold for the soldiers' profit. The British did keep promises to black slaves, evacuating them along with troops in the closing days of the war, and resettling more than 3,000 Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia, and others in the Caribbean, and England. In 1792 it established Freetown, in what is now Sierra Leone, as a colony for Poor Blacks from London, as well as Black Loyalists from Canada who wanted to relocate. One of the most well-known voices for freedom around the Revolutionary era was Phillis Wheatley of Massachusetts. She was a slave for most of her life but was given freedom by her master. Educated in Latin, Greek, and English, Wheatley wrote a collection of poems which asserted that Africans, as children of God just like Europeans, deserved respect and freedom. In 1777, Vermont drafted a state constitution that prohibited the institution of slavery. In 1780 Massachusetts a state judge declared slavery to be unconstitutional according to the state's new bill of rights, which declared \\"all men...free and equal.\\" Slavery effectively ended in Massachusetts with this ruling in a freedom suit by Quock Walker. This led to an increase of enslaved men and women suing for their freedom in New England. Also in 1780 in Pennsylvania, the legislature enacted \\"a gradual emancipation law that directly connected the ideals of the Revolution with the rights of the African Americans to freedom.\\"Carol Berkin, \\"African American Women and the American Revolution,\\" Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 132. In the South, the immediate legacy of the Revolution was increased manumission by slaveholders in the first two decades after the war. But, the invention of the cotton gin enabled widespread cultivation of short-staple cotton, and with the opening up of southwestern lands to cotton and sugar production, demand for slaves increased. Legislatures made emancipation difficult to gain, and they passed harsher laws regulating African-American lives.Carol Berkin, \\"African American Women and the American Revolution,\\" Revolutionary Mothers, New York, 2005, 133. Antebellum Period \\"Slaves Waiting for Sale.\\" Women and children slaves, dressed in new clothes, wait to be sold in Richmond, Virginia, in the 19th century. Based on a sketch of 1853. As historian Deborah Gray White explains, \\"Black in a white society, slave in a free society, woman in a society ruled by men, female slaves had the least formal power and were perhaps the most vulnerable group of Americans.\\" The mother-daughter relationship was often the most enduring and as such cherished within the African-American complex of relations.White, Deborah Gray. Ar’n't I a Woman, New York City, 1999, 107. Relatively few women were runaways, and when they did run, they sometimes escaped with their children. Historian Martha Saxton writes about enslaved mothers' experiences in St. Louis in the antebellum period: \\"In Marion County, north of St. Louis, a slave trader bought three small children from an owner, but the children's mother killed them all and herself rather than let them be taken away. A St. Louis trader took a crying baby from its mother, both on their way to be sold, and made a gift of it to a white woman standing nearby because its noise was bothering him.\\"Saxton (2003), Being Good, p. 185 Another way these generational connections can be seen, is through song. Often songs about slavery and women's experiences during their enslavement were passed down through generations.Jackson, Gale P., “Rosy, Possum, Morning Star: African American Women’s Work and Play Songs”: An Excerpt From Put Your Hands on Your Hips and Act Like a Woman: Song, Dance, Black History and Poetics in Performance. Journal of Black Studies Vol. 46(8) 2015: 773-796. African-American Women Work Songs are historical snapshots of lived experience and survival.Hill Collins, Patricia. Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment. New York: Routledge, 2000. Songs speak of families being torn apart and the emotional turmoil that enslaved women were put through by slavery. Songs add the legacy of oral tradition that fosters generational knowledge about historical periods. Little girls as young as seven were frequently sold away from their mothers: > \\"Mary Bell was hired out by the year to take care of three children starting > when she was seven. John Mullanphy noted that he had living with him a four- > year-old mulatto girl, whom he willed to the Sisters of Charity in the event > of his death. George Morton sold his daughter Ellen 'a certain Mulatto girl > a slave about fourteen years of age named Sally, being the child of a > certain Negro woman named Ann'.\\" In 1854 Georgia was the first and only > state to pass a law that put conditions of sales that separated mothers and > their children. Children under five could not be sold away from their > mothers, \\"unless such division cannot in any wise be [e]ffected without such > separation.'\\" In 1848 Ellen Craft, of mixed-race, posed as a white man to escape from slavery. Slave girls in North America often worked within the domestic sphere, providing household help. White families sought the help of a \\"girl\\", an \\"all- purpose tool\\" in family life.Saxton, Martha, Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America, New York City, 2003, 186 Although the word \\"girl\\" applied to any working female without children, slaves were preferred because in the long run they cost less. These enslaved girls were usually very young, anywhere from nine years of age to their mid-teens. Heavy household work was assigned to the \\"girl\\" and was therefore stigmatized as \\"negroes’\\" work. A \\"girl\\" was an essential source of help to white families, rural and urban, middle class and aspiring. She provided freedom for daughters to devote themselves to their self-development and relieved mothers from exhausting labor, while requiring no financial or emotional maintenance, \\"no empathy.\\" In antebellum America, as in the past (from the initial African-European contact in North America), black women were deemed to be governed by their libidos and portrayed as \\"Jezebel character[s]...in every way the counterimage of the mid-nineteenth- century ideal of the Victorian lady.\\"White, Deborah Gray. Ar’n't I a Woman, New York City, 1999, 29. Enslaved women in every state of the antebellum union considered freedom, but it was a livelier hope in the North than in most of the South. Many slaves sought their freedom through self-purchase, the legal system of freedom suits, and as runaways, sometimes resulting in the separation of children and parents. \\"Unfinished childhoods and brutal separations punctuated the lives of most African American girls, and mothers dreamed of freedom that would not impose more losses on their daughters.\\"Saxton, Martha, Being Good: Women's Moral Values in Early America, New York City, 2003, 183 Antebellum South Eastman Johnson's 1859 painting \\"Negro Life at the South\\" subtly portrays relationships of white male masters and their female slaves. After the Revolution, Southern plantation owners imported a massive number of new slaves from Africa and the Caribbean until the United States banned the import of slaves in 1808. More importantly, more than one million slaves were transported in a forced migration in the domestic slave trade, from the Upper South to the Deep South, most by slave traders—either overland where they were held for days in chained coffles, or by the coastwise trade and ships. The majority of slaves in the Deep South, men and women, worked on cotton plantations. Cotton was the leading cash crop during this time, but slaves also worked on rice, corn, sugarcane, and tobacco plantations, clearing new land, digging ditches, cutting and hauling wood, slaughtering livestock, and making repairs to buildings and tools. Black women also cared for their children and managed the bulk of the housework and domestic chores. Living with the dual burdens of racism and sexism, enslaved women in the South held roles within the family and community that contrasted sharply with more traditional or upper class American women's roles. Young girls generally started working well before boys, with many working before age seven.Steckel, Richard, \\"Women, Work, and Health Under Plantation Slavery in the United States,\\" More than Chattel. Indiana University Press, 1996, 44. Although field work was traditionally considered to be \\"men's work,\\" different estimates conclude that between 63-80 percent of women worked in the fields.Steckel, Richard, \\"Women, Work, and Health Under Plantation Slavery in the United States,\\" More than Chattel. Indiana University Press, 1996, 45. Adult female work depended greatly upon plantation size. On small farms, women and men performed similar tasks, while on larger plantations, males were given more physically demanding work. Few of the chores performed by enslaved women took them off the plantation. Therefore they were less mobile than enslaved men, who often assisted their masters in the transportation of crops, supplies, and other materials, and were often hired out as artisans and craftsmen. Women also worked in the domestic sphere as servants, cooks, seamstresses, and nurses. Although a female slave's labor in the field superseded childrearing in importance, the responsibilities of childbearing and childcare greatly circumscribed the life of an enslaved woman. This also explains why female slaves were less likely to run away than men.White, Deborah Gray. Ar’n't I a Woman, New York City, 1999, 70. Many female slaves were the object of severe sexual exploitation; often bearing the children of their white masters, master's sons, or overseers. Slaves were prohibited from defending themselves against any type of abuse, including sexual, at the hands of white men. If a slave attempted to defend herself, she was often subjected to further beatings by the master or even by the mistress. Black females, some of them children, were forced into sexual relationships for their white owners' pleasure and profit: attempting to keep the slave population growing by his own doing, and not by importing more slaves from Africa. Even Thomas Jefferson, 3rd President of the United States, is believed to have fathered six mixed-race children (four survived to adulthood) with one of his female slaves, Sally Hemings, a woman three-quarters white and half-sister to his late wife, who served as the widower's concubine for more than two decades. In the case of Harriet Ann Jacobs, author of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, her master, Dr. James Norcom, had sexually harassed her for years. Even after she had two children of her own, he threatened to sell them if she denied his sexual advances. Although Harriet Jacobs managed to escape to the North with her children, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 still put their livelihood at risk due to Dr. Norcom's family continuing to pursue her. Emancipation and the ending of slavery Slavery was abolished in the United States in 1865 due to the ratification of the 13th Amendment. The decree offered enslaved men a path to freedom through military service. It wasn't until the Act of 1861 that enslaved women were allowed their freedom as they were no longer declared property of the Confederates in the south. In 1868, the 14th Amendment extended citizenship rights to African Americans. Notable enslaved women Sojourner Truth circa 1864 * Lucy Terry (c. 1730–1821) is the author of the oldest known work of literature by an African American. * Phillis Wheatley (May 8, 1753 – December 5, 1784) was the first African- American poet and first African-American woman to publish a book. * Sojourner Truth (c. 1797 – November 26, 1883) was the self-given name, from 1843 onward, of Isabella Baumfree, an African-American abolitionist and women's rights activist. Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, Ulster County, New York. In 1826, she escaped with her infant daughter to freedom. After going to court to recover her son, she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man. Her best-known extemporaneous speech on gender inequalities, \\"Ain't I a Woman?\\", was delivered in 1851 at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government for former slaves. * Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Harriet Ross; 1820 – March 10, 1913) was an African- American abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the American Civil War. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made more than thirteen missions to rescue more than 70 slaves; she guided refugees along the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She later helped John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry, and in the post-war era struggled for women's suffrage. * Ellen Craft (1826–1897) was a slave from Macon, Georgia who posed as a white male planter to escape from slavery. She escaped to the North in December 1848 by travelling openly by train and steamboat with her husband, who acted as her slave servant; they reached Philadelphia and freedom on Christmas Day. * Margaret Garner (called Peggy) (c. 1833/1834-c.1858) was an enslaved African American woman in pre-Civil War United States who was notorious—or celebrated—for killing her own daughter after being captured following her escape, rather than allowing the child to be returned to slavery.

He mainly writes for children, has over 200 published works and is a well known as a children's poet. His poetry books and anthologies for Macmillan have sold in excess of 1 million copies. Brian was asked by CBBC to write a poem for the Queen's 80th birthday.  Topics  Brian’s interests range from the familiar – Deaths, football matches – to the peculiar – monsters, aliens and angels. Often he will mix the two together in his poetry, so the 'Shopping Trolley' is souped-up like a futuristic sports car, while the monsters still go to school before coming home on 'The Ghoul School Bus'. Brian has a particularly sharp eye for surreal moments in daily life – the man in Walking with my Iguana, who walks his pet potao on Hastings beach on a leash, is based on a real person.  Music  Brian began writing poems when he realised he would never be a rock star – \\"I put the guitar to one side, but the songs carried on and became poems\\". That original musical influence can still be heard in his work; while he rarely sings, he performs so that pauses, tone of voice and speed become a central part of the poem. Few poets can hold a syllable so well as Brian, whether it's the hiss in 'The Snake Hotel' or the Tom Waits growl in 'Walking with my Iguana' which is in the top 3 most listened to poems in the Poetry Archive. Brian still kept music and a wonderful beat in his poem, his most famous poems are 'Sssssnake Hotel', 'Walking with my Iguana,' and 'shopping Trolley'  Pictures  Brian writes and edits poetry and picture books for children, and resource books for teachers. His latest book for teachers is Able Writers in Your School (co-written with Roger Stevens), Brilliant Publications.

Raw marks for students who fail are not scaled and do not increase the allocations of higher grades. Some universities also have a Pass Conceded (PC) grade for marks that fall in the range of 45–49 inclusive.

Life Davis was born at Eton on 27 July 1850, the eldest son of George Davis, a bookseller. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a local bookbinder but he abandoned this trade after two years to pursue his interest in chemistry. Davis studied at the Slough Mechanics Institute while working at the local gas works, and then spent a year studying at the Royal School of Mines in London (now part of Imperial College, London) before leaving to work in the chemical industry around Manchester, which at the time was the main centre of the chemical industry in the UK. Davis worked as a chemist at Brearley and Sons for three years. He also worked as an inspector for the Alkali Act of 1863, a very early piece of environmental legislation that required soda manufacturers to reduce the amount of gaseous hydrochloric acid released to the atmosphere from their factories. In 1872 he was engaged as manager at the Lichfield Chemical Company in Staffordshire. In this job his capacity for innovation flourished. His works included what was at the time the tallest chimney in the UK, with a height of more than . He married Laura Frances Miller on 10 December 1878, and they had at least one son. He worked as a consultant to the chemical industry jointly with his brother Alfred, founded the Chemical Trade Journal and had 67 patents granted, as well as publishing scientific papers. Davis was also instrumental in the formation of the Society of Chemical Industry (1881), which he had wanted to name the Society of Chemical Engineering, and was its first Secretary. He was also interested in microscopy, founding the journal Northern Microscopist in 1881, and publishing a textbook on the subject, Practical Microscopy. He died in West Dulwich, on 20 April 1907. Contribution to chemical engineering Davis identified broad features in common to all chemical factories and wrote the influential A Handbook of Chemical Engineering. He also published a famous lecture series of 12 lectures, given in 1888 at Manchester Technical School (which became University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST)). These lectures defined chemical engineering as a discipline. His lectures were criticized for being common place know-how since it was designed around operating practices used by British chemical industries. At this time, however, in the United States, this information helped initiate new thinking in the chemical industry, as well as spark chemical engineering degree programmes at several universities in the US. Recognition In the 1st floor foyer of Jackson's Mill, the building that houses the School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, University of Manchester, there is a display and memorial to Davis. The George E. Davis Medal of the Institution of Chemical Engineers is named in his honour.

Events Initiated on the personal orders of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, the affair apparently aimed at eliminating the influence of Lavrentiy Beria, of whom Stalin was growing increasingly suspicious.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar, pp. 632-640. The fabricated accusations of forming the \\"Mingrelian nationalist ring\\", separatism, collaboration with the \\"Western imperialists\\", and the Georgian émigré centre in Paris, were followed by a purge, which delivered a hard blow to the Georgian party organization, and specifically targeted its Mingrelian (a subethnic group of the Georgians) members, mostly Beria's protégés. Many leading officials were removed from their posts and arrested; thousands of innocent people were subjected to repressions. Candide Charkviani, who at the time occupied the position of the first secretary of the Georgian SSR, also suffered during the Mingrelian Affair. For years historians erroneously thought that Candide Charkviani was Mingrelian and that he was punished because of his links with Beria. However, the newly opened archives in Georgia provide evidence that Charkviani, who was Lechkhumian (from the Lechkhumi region of Georgia) and not Mingrelian or Svan, was accused because he allegedly failed to “detect and repress the criminal nationalist ring of counter revolutionaries within the ranks of the Georgian Communist Party”. Toma Chagelashvili's Project on Modern History of Georgia on the Rustavi 2 Channel, “Georgians in the Kremlin and Beyond” (5 parts) (in Georgian) . Moreover, it has emerged that Charkviani's relations with Beria had always been strained and that Beria tolerated Charkviani only because the latter was supported by Stalin. Immediately following Stalin's death, all Beria's clients who suffered during the Mingrelian Affair were restored. Yet Charkviani, on Beria's orders, was separated from his family and moved to Central Asia into exile.Mikaberidze, Alexander, Candide Charkviani from the Dictionary of Georgian National Biography http://georgianbiography.com/alphabetindex.html#C. Many aspects of the Mingrelian Affair are still not completely understood. Beyond Stalin's growing distrust of his lieutenant Beria, who had particularly consolidated his positions after World War II, the affair also reflected a bitter power struggle among rival clans in the Communist élite of Georgia. It might also have echoed similar accusations of nationalism leveled against the Georgian \\"National Communists\\" in the 1922 Georgian Affair. As a result of the events, Beria's power was reduced significantly in Georgia, but he still managed to retain his position in the Politburo. After Stalin's death in 1953, Beria managed to temporarily reinstate his clients in Georgia. However later many of them were prosecuted as the members of \\"Beria's gang\\". The new Soviet leadership of Nikita Khrushchev admitted that the case was fabricated and eventually rehabilitated its victims.

Widely considered to be one of the best cartoonists and illustrators to come out of the Valencia Community, he started his professional life as a musician, jewellery maker, and textile designer. His music gained notability during the 1970s, when he was bassist for the bands Control and Orquesta Valencia, with whom he recorded three and two albums respectively. However, he is more widely known as a cartoonist and humourist, a career that he got into in the 1980s, when his cartoons began to be published in a number of regional newspapers, including Diario de Valencia, Noticias al Día, Hoja del Lunes and in magazines such as Qué y Donde and the national satirical magazine, El Jueves. In 1984, he would find a permanent job as cartoonist for Levante - El Mercantil Valenciano; his cartoons would become, as time went by, one of the identifying features of the L-EMV. On top of this, he has assiduously drawn for Cartelera Turia and draws a weekly sketch for the national magazine, Magazine, for whom he created his famous character, the wizard Mago Asín. His work has gone beyond that of a newspaper cartoonist.

The core of the project is a health and demographic surveillance system which registers more than 100,000 people in six suburbs of the capital Bissau. Furthermore, 182 representative clusters of 100 women and their children are followed in the rural areas. Information on health, diseases, immunisations, breast- feeding, etc. is collected, primarily focusing on women and children. Admissions to the country's sole pediatric ward in the capital are recorded. The Bandim Health Project is member of the INDEPTH Network of health and demographic surveillance sites in Africa, Asia and Oceania. History The Bandim Health Project was initiated in 1978 by Peter Aaby. The project is currently based on collaboration between the Ministry of Health in Guinea- Bissau, Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, and researchers affiliated to The University of Southern Denmark, as well as the University of Aarhus, Denmark. In 2012, the Danish National Research Foundation funded the establishment of the Center of Excellence, The Research Center for Vitamins and Vaccines (CVIVA) based on the Bandim Health Project and its research into non-specific effects of vaccines. Fields of research The Bandim Health Project works with population based health research, focusing on women and children. The project's fields of research include: * Vaccines, both their specific effects on the targeted diseases, and in particular their potential non-specific effects on morbidity and mortality. * Other health interventions, including assessment of the total impact on mortality of new interventions or changes in existing policies. * Infectious diseases, e.g. measles, diarrhoea, rotavirus, respiratory infections, malaria, HIV, HTLV, and Tuberculosis. * Nutrition, including micronutrients such as vitamin A supplementation, and breast- feeding. * Humanitarian aid. Important results One of the most important findings was that a new measles vaccine used in low-income countries was associated with a two-fold increase in mortality among girls. This discovery led to the withdrawal of the vaccine. Had it not been withdrawn, it could have cost at least ½ million additional female deaths per year in Africa alone.Aaby, P. \\"Being wrong in the right direction?\\" Lancet 364.9438 (2004): 984. The organization The Bandim Health Project is led by Peter Aaby. The National Research Coordinator is Amabelia Rodrigues. Since the project's foundation in 1978, more than 700 scientific articles have been published, and more than 40 PhD or doctoral degrees and 13 Masters of International Health degrees have been obtained by researchers employed by the project.

Haiti was controlled by France before declaring independence on January 1, 1804. The Governor-General of Haiti, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, created the empire on September 22, 1804. Proclaiming himself Emperor Jacques I, he held his coronation ceremony on October 6. The constitution of May 20, 1805, set out the way the empire was to be governed, with the country split into six military divisions. The general of each division corresponded directly with the emperor or the general in chief appointed by the emperor. The constitution also set out the succession to the throne, with the crown being elective and the reigning emperor having the power to appoint his successor. The constitution also banned white people, with the exception of naturalised Germans and Poles, from owning property inside the empire. Jacques I was assassinated on October 17, 1806. Two members of his administration, Alexandre Pétion and Henri Christophe, then assumed power, which led to a split in the country with Pétion leading the southern Republic of Haiti and Christophe leading the northern State of Haiti. Some 43 years later, on August 26, 1849, President Faustin Soulouque re-established an Empire in Haiti that lasted until January 15, 1859.

The teaching of Toledano Kabbalah is led by the Director of Tutors, author and teacher of Kabbalah, Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi. While the 15 books written by Halevi form the contemporary basis of the Toledano Tradition, tutors also pursue their own interests, introducing compatible elements of those into their teaching and group leadership. Papers given over the years at conferences organised by the Kabbalah Society, of which Halevi is a founder member, remain unpublished, though various tutors and students of the Toledano Tradition have produced books.

Pavone was the president of the Historic Institute of the Liberation movement in Italy, the president of the Italian Society of Contemporary History and the director of the historical journal Parolechiave (Keywords). He died aged 95, just one day shy of his 96th birthday. Biography The partisan experience During the Second World War he was enlisted as customs guard in Malles, near the Italian-Swiss frontier and far from the war front. From autumn 1943 until the end of the war he participated in the Italian resistance movement. This experience, as well as informing his civil conscience and political vision, also influenced his activity as a historian, both with regard to his chosen field of research and the way in which he analysed it. After the war he worked as an archivist in the Italian National Archives. He played a central role in the organization of the Italian Central State Archive and in the draft of the general guide to the Italian Archives. Works Pavone published, for Bollati Boringhieri, Alle Origini della Repubblica (On the Origins of the Republic), an historical analysis of the route that led from the demise of the fascist regime, 25 July 1943, to the advent of the Republic on 2 June 1946 . In the 1991 he published Una Guerra Civile (A Civil War), an analysis of the origins, the motivations and intentions that underpinned the fight between fascist and antifascist Italy . The book is an important milestone in Italian historiography because it introduced in the academic debate the notion that the struggle that took place in 1943-45 between Italian fascists and the partisan movement was indeed a civil war. Before the publication of Una Guerra Civile the expression was only used, apologetically, by the Italian far right. An English translation of this work, published by Verso in 2013, appeared under the title \\"A Civil War - A History of the Italian Resistance\\".

It is officially located at Pineaire Drive, Executive (formerly Grant) Avenue, and Long Island Avenue near Deer Park, New York. The actual location is in Baywood, New York, directly over the Deer Park border. History Deer Park, sometimes mentioned as Deerpark, station was previously located at the bridge over New York State Route 231, until it was moved as part of a major reconstruction project of the line at Ronkonkoma, Central Islip, Brentwood, Deer Park, and Wyandanch. The original station was built in 1842, then rebuilt in 1884, and again 1936 for the bridge over Deer Park Avenue (NY 231 did not exist at the time). The 1987-built station was built close to the former Pine Aire station near the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center (see below), served as a replacement for both stations, and was also originally planned also to replace Brentwood Station until public opposition from Brentwood thwarted that proposal. As a result, some people refer to it as \\"Pine Aire\\" station rather than its given name. In the process of reconstruction, a former one-lane bridge was blocked off. Pineaire station Pineaire (or Pine Aire) was a station stop along the Ronkonkoma Branch of the Long Island Rail Road in West Brentwood, New York. It was located east of the Pilgrim State Hospital Spur than the currently combined Deer Park-Pineaire complex. In fact it was located on the east side of Sagtikos State Parkway on the opposite side of the intersection of Pine Aire Drive (formerly Edgewood Road) and Manatuck Boulevard. The station first opened around 1915 near the former Thompson's Station across from a freight spur, and was finally closed around October 1986, when the two stations were being combined into one. Pilgrim State Hospital station The former Pilgrim State Hospital station is located within Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in West Brentwood, at the end of a spur leading south to the main line. The station was opened during the early-20th Century and closed in 1978. The remains of the station can be found where G Road becomes Suffolk County Road 106 on the southwest corner of the Sagtikos State Parkway underpass. Edgewood station Nearly a century before the current Deer Park station was built, another LIRR station was built between the former Deer Park and Pine Aire Stations in the same area, named Edgewood. The station was a two- story wooden depot built in 1892 on Grant Avenue by a developer, but originally only existed as a signal stop. Service began to decline by June 1911 and it was closed down in 1914. Local residents used the station for scrap lumber. By the 1940s it became the site of the spur for Edgewood State Hospital, which began just west of the current Deer Park station and ran parallel to the west side of Grant Avenue. The hospital closed in 1971, and was demolished in 1989. While the existing Deer Park station is located on the west side of Executive Boulevard, the site of Edgewood station was on the east side of Grand Avenue and is occupied by a miniature golf course today. Station layout The station has two high-level side platforms, each 12 cars long. {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=50M style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Mezzanine style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=475Crossover between platforms - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=5 valign=topP Platform level style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\\" colspan=2Platform A, side platform - style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Track 1 style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"← toward or () - Track 2  toward () → - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Platform B, side platform - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Ground level style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Entrance/exit and parking } Gallery File:Deer Park Station - Westbound Train Approaches.JPGPenn Station-bound train arriving.

Horan made his first appearance for the team during the 1968–69 National League and subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1986 championship. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals, four Leinster medals and one All Stars Award. Horan captained Offaly to their first All-Ireland title in 1981. At club level Horan is a three-time Leinster medalist with St. Rynagh's. In addition to this he has also won eleven county club championship medals. In retirement from playing Horan became involved in team management and coaching. At club level he has managed his own club St. Rynagh's as well as Birr. Horan has also managed the Offaly and Laois senior inter-county teams. Horan's sons, Cathal and Diarmuid, also played hurling with Offaly. Playing career Club Horan enjoyed much success with St. Rynagh's in a club career that spanned three decades. In 1968 he was just out of the minor grade when he won his first championship medal in the senior grade. A 1–12 to 3–4 defeat of Coolderry was the first of three championship titles in succession for St. Rynagh's. In 1970 Horan added a Leinster medal to his collection following a 4–10 to 2–9 defeat of Rathnure. St. Rynagh's later faced Roscrea in the inaugural All-Ireland final, however, Horan's side were defeated by 4–5 to 2–5. Four county championships-in-a-row proved beyond St. Rynagh's, however, the club bounced back in 1972. A defeat of Kinnitty in the county decider kick-started a remarkable run of success that yielded a record- breaking five championships in succession. As well as this Horan collected a second Leinster medal in 1972 as St. Rynagh's narrowly defeated old rivals Rathnure by 5–5 to 2–13. After a number of years out of the spotlight, St. Rynagh's returned to the top table once again in 1981. A defeat of Kinnitty gave Horan his ninth championship medal. St. Rynagh's retained the title in 1982 with Horan securing a remarkable tenth championship medal. He later won a third Leinster medal as St. Rynagh's narrowly defeated Buffer's Alley by 1–16 to 2–10. Horan finished off his club hurling career in 1987 when he captured his eleventh championship medal following a defeat of Seir Kieran. Inter- county Horan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a dual player with the Offaly minor and under-21 teams. He made his senior debut in a National Hurling League game against Kilkenny in 1969. The following year he made his first championship appearance in a provincial quarter-final against Laois. In 1980 Offaly emerged from the doldrums to qualify for only their second provincial decider in fifty years. Reigning All-Ireland champions provided the opposition, however, a remarkable 3–17 to 5–10 victory gave Horan his first Leinster medal. The victory was tinged with sadness for Horan as his father died at home while listening to the match on the radio. Offaly's dream season came to an end with a defeat by eventual champions Galway in the All- Ireland semi-final. Offaly proved that their success was more than a flash in the pan by reaching the provincial final again in 1981. Horan was captain that year as Offaly defeated Wexford by 3–12 to 2–13. It was Horan's second Leinster medal. This win allowed Offaly to advance to a very first All-Ireland final with reigning champions Galway. After fourteen minutes Pat Carroll scored the opening goal of the game for Offaly, however, neither side built up a strong lead. Straight after the interval goalkeeper Damien Martin was doing great work when he batted out an almost certain Galway goal. With just over twenty minutes left in the game Galway led by six points, however, the team failed to score for the rest of the match. Offaly, on the other hand, ate into this lead. Johnny Flaherty's controversial hand-passed goal with three minutes was the deciding score of the game. At the full-time whistle Offaly were the winners by 2–12 to 0–15. It was a first All-Ireland medal for Horan while he also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. After suffering back- to-back Leinster final defeats to Kilkenny, Offaly triumphed once again in 1984. A 1–15 to 2–11 defeat of Wexford gave Horan a third Leinster medal. Offaly subsequently advanced to the centenary All-Ireland final at Semple Stadium in Thurles. On the day, however, Cork were far too strong for Horan's team. Although far from being a classic game Offaly were defeated by 3–16 to 1–12. Offaly retained their Leinster title in 1985 with Horan adding a fourth provincial memento to this collection following a 5–15 to 0–17 trouncing of Laois. Galway provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final and another tense game ensued. Once again it was Offaly's goal-scoring ability that proved crucial. Pat Cleary scored the first of the day after twenty-five minutes of play and got his second less than half a minute after the restart. Joe Dooley had a goal disallowed halfway through the second-half while a long Joe Cooney effort, which seemed to cross the goal line, was not given. P.J. Molloy was Galway's goal scorer, however, the day belonged to Offaly. A 2–11 to 1–12 victory gave Horan his second All-Ireland medal. Horan retired from inter-county hurling following Offaly's exit from the provincial championship in 1986. Inter-provincial Horan has also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. In 1973 he was at full-back as Leinster qualified for the final. A 1–13 to 2–8 defeat of arch- rivals Munster gave Horan a Railway Cup medal. It was the first of three successive final victories over Munster, with Horan playing a key role in all of those finals. Managerial career Offaly In 1990 Horan took over as manager of the Offaly senior hurling team. While the team had won three successive Leinster finals between 1987 and 1989, Offaly had failed to get past the All-Ireland semi-final stage. Under Horan the success continued. A 2–6 to 0–10 defeat of Wexford secured the National Hurling League title for Offaly in 1991. It was their first ever victory in that competition. Success in the championship proved elusive for Horan as Offaly exited the provincial series at an early stage in both 1991 and 1992. Birr After leaving his position as manager of the Offaly senior hurling team, Horan turned his hand to club management when he took charge of the Birr senior hurling team. Once again success was immediate. In 1994 Birr defeated Seir Kieran to take the county championship title. More success was to follow, as a 3–7 to 2–5 defeat of Oulart-the Ballagh in a replay of the provincial decider secured the Leinster title for Horan's side. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Birr against Dunloy A 0–9 apiece score line was the result, however, Birr won the replay at their ease by 3–13 to 2–3. Laois In 1997 Horan returned to inter-county management when he took charge of the Laois senior hurling team. His three years in charge were without success and he resigned in 2000 when it emerged that a number of high-profile players refused to play in the National Hurling League. St. Rynagh's Horan returned to the club scene in 2000 when he took over as manager of his own St. Rynagh's club. In 2001 he guided the club to the championship final against three-in-a-row hopefuls Birr. While St. Rynagh's were given little chance, they made Birr battle all the way. An 0–11 to 0–10 score line gave Birr the title. Horan resigned as manager in 2003, however, he returned for one more unsuccessful tenure in 2006. Offaly under-21 In 2007 Horan made a surprise return to inter-county management when he took charge of the Offaly under-21 hurling team. His first season in charge saw Offaly reach the Leinster final for the first time seven years. dublin provided the opposition, and went on to record a 2–18 to 3–9 victory. Horan's under-21 side reached the provincial decider once again in 2008. On this occasion they faced a 2–12 to 2–9 defeat by Kilkenny.

When the electropositive element is a metal, the compounds are sometimes referred to as “metal-rich”. Thus the normal oxide of caesium is Cs2O, which is described as a Cs+ salt of O2−. A suboxide of caesium is Cs11O3, where the charge on Cs is clearly less than 1+, but the oxide is still described as O2−. Suboxides typically feature extensive bonding between the electropositive element, often leading to clusters. Examples of suboxides include * Carbon suboxide, C3O2; * Boron suboxide, B6O; * Rubidium suboxide, Rb9O2; * Silicon suboxide, SiOx (x < 2); *Titanium suboxide, TiOx; *Titanium monoxide, TiO; *Tungsten suboxide, WOx. Metal-containing suboxides Suboxides are intermediates along the pathway that forms the normal oxide. Suboxides are sometimes visible when certain metals are exposed to small amounts of O2: :22 Cs + 3 O2 → 2 Cs11O3 :4 Cs11O3 \\\\+ 5 O2 → 22 Cs2O Several suboxides of caesium and rubidium have been characterized by X-ray crystallography. As of 1997, the inventory includes the following Rb9O2, Rb6O, Cs11O3, Cs4O, Cs7O, Cs11O3Rb, Cs11O3Rb2, and Cs11O3Rb3. Suboxides are generally colored compounds indicating a degree of electron delocalisation. Cs7O has a unit cell containing a Cs11O3 cluster and 10 Cs atoms. The cluster can be visualised as being composed of three face-sharing octahedra. In the picture below the caesium atoms are purple and the oxygen atoms are red. The Cs-Cs distance in the cluster is 376 pm, which is less than the Cs-Cs distance in the metal of 576 pm. Rb9O2 and Rb6O both contain the Rb9O2 cluster, which can be visualised as two face-sharing octahedra. Rb6O can be formulated as (Rb9O2)Rb3. The Rb-Rb distance in the cluster is 352 pm which is shorter than the Rb-Rb in the metal of 485 pm.

In November 1986, voters approved a constitutional amendment (with 64 percent voting in favor) authorizing the creation of a government-run lottery. The Kansas Legislature passed the \\"Kansas Lottery Act\\" in 1987, establishing the Lottery. The mission of the Lottery is to produce the maximum amount of revenue possible for Kansas, while insuring the integrity of its games. The Kansas Lottery offers $1, $2,$3 $5, $10, $20, and $30 scratch tickets, plus $1 and $2 instant \\"pull- tab\\" games. The Lottery also offers the draw games Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto America, Super Kansas Cash, Pick 3, 2by2, and Keno, Lottery products are sold at approximately 1,900 retailers. Kansas' newest draw game is the multi- state Lucky for Life, whose earliest version was a Connecticut-only game. All Kansas Lottery games have a minimum age of 18. The Lottery sponsors several races at the Kansas Speedway, including the Kansas Lottery 150 and the Kansas Lottery 300. History Article 15 of the Kansas Constitution was amended in 1986 to allow the operation of a state-run lottery. The Kansas Lottery Act was passed by the Kansas Legislature in 1987, and is contained in K.S.A. 74-8701 through K.S.A. 74-8732. The Lottery Act establishes the state-owned and operated Kansas Lottery, and sets parameters for organization and operation of the Lottery. The Lottery is established by KSA 74-8703, the Kansas Lottery Commission is created by KSA 74-8709, and the powers and duties of the Executive Director are outlined in KSA 74-8704 and KSA 74-8706. Distribution of all revenue from the Kansas Lottery is also directed by the Legislature pursuant to K.S.A. 79-4801 through K.S.A. 79-4806. In addition to the Act itself, individual game and promotion rules are set forth in temporary administrative regulations passed by the Kansas Lottery Commission at their meetings (usually monthly).KS Lottery History In 1987, ticket sales for the Kansas Lottery began in 21 cities. The first instant game was \\"Up and Away\\", with a grand prize drawing of $100,000. The first week's sales were $7 million. The Kansas Lottery gradually introduced games. The early success of the Lottery allowed it to create elaborate marketing campaigns, including a traveling singing group, the Kansas Lottery Singers. The group took popular songs, changing lyrics for Lottery commercials. They traveled around Kansas from June to September 1988. Also in the late 1980s, the Lottery constructed a building on the Hutchinson fairgrounds. This building was used as a studio for the game show Kansas Lottery Live. Winners were drawn from a giant tub filled with non-winning lottery tickets. The game show ran on WIBW-TV, and later by the KSN TV network. The game's original hosts were Fred Broski and Teri Messner. Messner eventually left the show, replaced by Robin Smith, who co- hosted until the show ended in 1990. The Kansas Lottery continued to introduce instant-win games, including those with higher price points. In 1995, the Kansas Legislature approved and the governor signed the renewal of the Kansas Lottery until 2002. By 2000, the Lottery had produced $500 million for Kansas. The Lottery re-entered the game show business in 2000 by participating in the Powerball Instant Millionaire series. In 2007, the Kansas Legislature passed Senate Bill 66, extending the Lottery until 2022 and creating the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act authorizing the Lottery, on behalf of Kansas, to own and operate four destination casinos. Electronic gaming machines would also be allowed at three parimutuel racetracks.

Born in Kilkenny, Hennessy first played competitive hurling during his schooling at CBS Kilkenny. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1976 championship. Hennessy immediately became a regular member of the team and won three All-Ireland medals, six Leinster medals and two National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter- provincial team on a number of occasions Hennessy won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a two-time All-Ireland medallist with James Stephens. In addition to this Hennessy has also won two Leinster medals and three championship medals. His father, Paddy Hennessy, also played with Kilkenny. Throughout his career Hennessy made 32 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1987-88 league. Hennessy is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers of all time. During his playing days he won five All-Star awards. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at right wing-back on the Kilkenny Hurling Team of the Century and the Club Hurling Silver Jubilee Team. Hennessy was also chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll. Playing career Club Hennessy first played for the James Stephens senior team in 1974 and was a regular member of the starting fifteen the following year when the club made a breakthrough. A 1–14 to 1–5 defeat of first-time finalists Galmoy gave Hennessy a championship medal. James Stephens subsequently qualified for the provincial decider, with Offaly champions St. Rynagh's providing the opposition. James Stephens took the lead from the third minute, with Liam \\"Chunky\\" O'Brien being scorer-in-chief. A 1–14 to 2–4 victory gave Hennessy his first Leinster medal. Two-time champions and hot favourites Blackrock provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. \\"The Rockies\\" got off to the better start, with two goals by Éamonn O'Donoghue and Pat Moylan giving them a 2–1 lead at the quarter mark. James Stephens trailed at the interval but were transformed in the second half. A 2–10 to 2–4 victory gave Hennessy his first All-Ireland medal. Hennessy collected a second consecutive championship medal in 1976 as Rower-Inistioge were accounted for by 2–14 to 0–13. After a period of decline, James Stephens bounced back in 1981. A double scores 2–10 to 0–8 defeat of Fenians gave Hennessy a third championship medal. He later collected a second Leinster medal as championship debutantes Faythe Harriers were narrowly defeated by 0–13 to 1–9. First time finalists Mount Sion of Waterford provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. A hat-trick of goals by John McCormack, together with a ten-point haul from Billy Walton, saw James Stephens fight back from seven points down to record a 3–13 to 3–8 victory. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Hennessy . Minor and under-21 Hennessy first played for Kilkenny as a member of the minor team in 1973. A 3-10 to 2-9 defeat of Wexford secured a third successive provincial title for the team and a first Leinster medal for Hennessy. On 2 September 1973 Kilkenny faced Galway in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. The game was a close, exciting affair played on a wet day, however, at the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 4-5 to 3-7. The victory gave Hennessy an All- Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. Kilkenny retained their provincial dominance in 1974 with Hennessy collecting a second Leinster medal following an 8-19 to 3-5 trouncing of Dublin. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 1 September 1974 saw Cork providing the opposition. In a low-scoring game Hennessy’s side were defeated by 1-10 to 1-8. By 1975 Hennessy had joined the Kilkenny under-21 team. He won his first Leinster medal that year as Kilkenny accounted for Wexford by 3-14 to 0-8. The subsequent All-Ireland final against Cork was rated the best hurling game of the year. Kilkenny ‘keeper Kevin Fennelly brought off two brilliant saves from Con Brassil and Finbarr Delaney in the closing stages to secure a 5-13 to 2-19 victory. Kilkenny retained the provincial title in 1976 with Hennessy collecting a second Leinster medal following a 3-21 to 0-5 trouncing of Wexford once again. The subsequent All- Ireland final was a replay of the previous year with Cork providing the opposition once again. The Rebels made no mistake on this occasion and secured a 2-17 to 1-8 victory. Hennessy won a third successive Leinster medal in 1977 as Wexford were downed once again on a score line of 3-11 to 1-10. Cork were once again waiting for Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. Having been beating the previous year, the Cats made no mistake on this occasion and secured a narrow 2-9 to 1-9 victory. It was Hennessy’s second All-Ireland medal. Senior In 1978 Kilkenny broke Wexford’s stranglehold on Leinster and secured the provincial title with a narrow 2-16 to 1-16 victory. It was Hennessy’s first Leinster medal at the highest level. On 3 September 1978 Kilkenny faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider, as the Rebels were bidding to become the first team in over twenty years to secure a third championship in succession. The game was far from the classic that was expected, with the decisive score coming from Jimmy Barry-Murphy whose low shot towards goal deceived Noel Skehan and trickled over the line. The 1-15 to 2-8 score line resulted in defeat for Hennessy’s side. In spite of this he was later honoured with his first All-Star. Hennessy won a second successive Leinster medal in 1979 as Wexford were defeated by 2-21 to 2-17. On 2 September 1979 Kilkenny faced Galway in the All-Ireland final. Bad weather and an unofficial train drivers’ strike resulted in the lowest attendance at a final in over twenty years. The bad weather also affected the hurling with Kilkenny scoring two freak goals as Galway ‘keeper Séamus Shinnors had a nightmare of a game. A Liam “Chunky” O’Brien 70-yard free went all the way to the net in the first half, while with just three minutes remaining a 45-yard shot from Mick Brennan was helped by the wind and dipped under the crossbar. Kilkenny won by 2-12 to 1-8 with Hennessy winning his first All-Ireland medal. He later collected a second All-Star. After a fallow two-year period, Kilkenny bounced back in 1982 with Hennessy winning his first National Hurling League medal following a 2-14 to 1-11 defeat of Wexford. He later added a third Leinster medal to his collection following a 1-11 to 0-12 defeat of three-in-a-row hopefuls and reigning All-Ireland champions Offaly. On 5 September 1982 Kilkenny and Cork renewed their rivalry in the All-Ireland decider. The Cats were rank outsiders on the day, however, a brilliant save by Noel Skehan was followed by two quick goals by Christy Heffernan just before the interval. Éamonn O'Donoghue pegged a goal back for Cork, however, Ger Fennelly added a third for Kilkenny who secured a 3-18 to 1-13 victory. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Hennessy. Hennessy won a fourth Leinster medal in 1983 as Offaly were accounted for by 1-17 to 0-13. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1983 was a replay of the previous year with Cork hoping to avenge that defeat. Billy Fitzpatrick was the star with ten points, giving Kilkenny a 2-14 to 1-9 lead with seventeen minutes left, however, they failed to score for the remainder of the game. A stunning comeback by Cork just fell short and Hennessy collected a third All-Ireland medal following a 2-14 to 2-12 victory. This was followed by a third All-Star] Three-in-a-row proved beyond Kilkenny in 1984, however, Hennessy’s performance earned him a fourth All-Star. In 1986 the team bounced back with Hennessy collecting a second league medal following a 2-10 to 2-6 defeat of Galway. He later collected a fifth Leinster medal following a 4-10 to 1-11 defeat of reigning champions Offaly. Hennessy won a sixth and final Leinster medal in 1987 as Offaly were downed once again by 2-14 to 0-17. On 6 September 1987 Galway, a team who were hoping to avoid becoming the first team to lose three finals in-a-row, faced a Kilkenny team who for many of its players knew it would be their last chance to claim an All-Ireland medal. Galway ‘keeper John Commins saved two goal chances from Ger Fennelly, while at the other end substitute Noel Lane bagged a decisive goal as Galway claimed a 1-12 to 0-9 victory. Hennessy ended the year by winning a fifth All-Star. Inter-provincial Hennessy also lined out with Leinster in the inter- provincial championship, however, his career coincided with a low ebb for Leinster hurling at this level. His sole triumph came in 1979, when a 1-13 to 1-9 defeat of Connacht in the decider gave him a Railway Cup medal.

Gameplay Tank on the run to the enemy gun The game's setting is the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. Gameplay consists of several varying stages in which the player must control various vehicles including warships and tanks in order to defeat an enemy fleet, break through enemy beach defences and destroy an enormous gun-emplacement to win the game. The gun emplacement requires multiple hits to be destroyed, but traverses faster than tanks can aim and fire, so it cannot be destroyed in a single attempt. In order to complete the game multiple tanks must make it through to the final level. Reception Beach-Head was Access' best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. Ahoy! stated \\"This game is a blast\\". It praised the graphics and concluded, \\"It is a remarkable programming achievement\\". Compute! listed the game in May 1988 as one of \\"Our Favorite Games\\", stating that it was superior to its \\"many imitators\\". Zzap!64 reviewed the game in a retrospective feature in October 1985. They argued that although it was considered impressive at the time of release it had already become dated. It was rated 70% overall. In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Beach Head the 117th-best computer game ever released. Legacy The game was included on the 1985 compilation They Sold a Million, along with Daley Thompson's Decathlon, Sabre Wulf, and Jet Set Willy.

It is a form of secret sharing, where a secret is divided into parts, giving each participant its own unique part. To reconstruct the original secret, a minimum number of parts is required. In the threshold scheme this number is less than the total number of parts. Otherwise all participants are needed to reconstruct the original secret. High-level explanation Shamir's Secret Sharing is used to secure a secret in a distributed way, most often to secure other encryption keys. The secret is split into multiple parts, called shares. These shares are used to reconstruct the original secret. To unlock the secret via Shamir's secret sharing, you need a minimum number of shares. This is called the threshold, and is used to denote the minimum number of shares needed to unlock the secret. Let us walk through an example: > Problem: Company XYZ needs to secure their vault's passcode. They could use > something standard, such as AES, but what if the holder of the key is > unavailable or dies? What if the key is compromised via a malicious hacker > or the holder of the key turns rogue, and uses their power over the vault to > their benefit? This is where SSS comes in. It can be used to encrypt the vault's passcode and generate a certain number of shares, where a certain number of shares can be allocated to each executive within Company XYZ. Now, only if they pool their shares can they unlock the vault. The threshold can be appropriately set for the number of executives, so the vault is always able to be accessed by the authorized individuals. Should a share or two fall into the wrong hands, they couldn't open the passcode unless the other executives cooperated. Mathematical definition The aim is to divide secret S (for example, the combination to a safe) into n pieces of data S_1,\\\\ldots,S_n in such a way that: # Knowledge of any k or more S_i pieces makes S easy to compute. That is, the complete secret S can be reconstructed from any combination of k pieces of data. # Knowledge of any k-1 or fewer S_i pieces leaves S completely undetermined, in the sense that the possible values for S seem as likely as with knowledge of 0 pieces. Said another way, the secret S cannot be reconstructed with fewer than k pieces. This scheme is called a \\\\left(k,n\\\\right) threshold scheme. If k=n then every piece of the original secret S is required to reconstruct the secret. Shamir's secret sharing scheme One can draw an infinite number of polynomials of degree 2 through 2 points. 3 points are required to define a unique polynomial of degree 2. This image is for illustration purposes only — Shamir's scheme uses polynomials over a finite field, not representable on a 2-dimensional plane. The essential idea of Adi Shamir's threshold scheme is that 2 points are sufficient to define a line, 3 points are sufficient to define a parabola, 4 points to define a cubic curve and so forth. That is, it takes k\\\\,\\\\\\\\! points to define a polynomial of degree k-1\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Suppose we want to use a \\\\left(k,n\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! threshold scheme to share our secret S\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, without loss of generality assumed to be an element in a finite field F of size P where 0 < k \\\\le n < P; S and P is a prime number. Choose at random k-1\\\\,\\\\\\\\! positive integers a_1,\\\\cdots,a_{k-1}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! with a_i, and let a_0=S\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Build the polynomial f\\\\left(x\\\\right)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+\\\\cdots+a_{k-1}x^{k-1}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Let us construct any n\\\\,\\\\\\\\! points out of it, for instance set i=1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\,\\\\\\\\! to retrieve \\\\left(i,f\\\\left(i\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Every participant is given a point (a non-zero integer input to the polynomial, and the corresponding integer output) along with the prime which defines the finite field to use. Given any subset of k\\\\,\\\\\\\\! of these pairs, we can find the coefficients of the polynomial using interpolation. The secret is the constant term a_0\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Usage  Example  The following example illustrates the basic idea. Note, however, that calculations in the example are done using integer arithmetic rather than using finite field arithmetic. Therefore the example below does not provide perfect secrecy and is not a true example of Shamir's scheme. So we'll explain this problem and show the right way to implement it (using finite field arithmetic). Preparation Suppose that our secret is 1234 (S=1234)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. We wish to divide the secret into 6 parts (n=6)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, where any subset of 3 parts (k=3)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is sufficient to reconstruct the secret. At random we obtain k-1 numbers: 166 and 94. : (a_0=1234;a_1=166;a_2=94),\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where a_0 is secret Our polynomial to produce secret shares (points) is therefore: : f(x)=1234+166x+94x^2\\\\,\\\\\\\\! We construct six points D_{x-1}=(x, f(x)) from the polynomial: : D_0=(1, 1494);D_1=(2, 1942);D_2=(3, 2578);D_3=(4, 3402); D_4= (5, 4414);D_5=(6, 5614)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! We give each participant a different single point (both x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and f(x)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!). Because we use D_{x-1} instead of D_x the points start from (1, f(1)) and not (0, f(0)). This is necessary because f(0) is the secret. Reconstruction In order to reconstruct the secret any 3 points will be enough. Consider \\\\left(x_0,y_0\\\\right)=\\\\left(2,1942\\\\right);\\\\left(x_1,y_1\\\\right)=\\\\left(4,3402\\\\right);\\\\left(x_2,y_2\\\\right)=\\\\left(5,4414\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. We will compute Lagrange basis polynomials: : \\\\ell_0=\\\\frac{x-x_1}{x_0-x_1}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x-x_2}{x_0-x_2}=\\\\frac{x-4}{2-4}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x-5}{2-5}=\\\\frac{1}{6}x^2-\\\\frac{3}{2}x+\\\\frac{10}{3}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : \\\\ell_1=\\\\frac{x-x_0}{x_1-x_0}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x-x_2}{x_1-x_2}=\\\\frac{x-2}{4-2}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x-5}{4-5}=-\\\\frac{1}{2}x^2+\\\\frac{7}{2}x-5\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : \\\\ell_2=\\\\frac{x-x_0}{x_2-x_0}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\\\frac{x-2}{5-2}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x-4}{5-4}=\\\\frac{1}{3}x^2-2x+\\\\frac{8}{3}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Therefore : \\\\begin{align} f(x) & =\\\\sum_{j=0}^2 y_j\\\\cdot\\\\ell_j(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & =y_0\\\\ell_0+y_1\\\\ell_1+y_2\\\\ell_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & =1942\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{6}x^2-\\\\frac{3}{2}x+\\\\frac{10}{3}\\\\right) + 3402\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2}x^2+\\\\frac{7}{2}x-5\\\\right) + 4414\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{3}x^2-2x+\\\\frac{8}{3}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & =1234+166x+94x^2 \\\\end{align} Recall that the secret is the free coefficient, which means that S=1234\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, and we are done.  Computationally efficient approach  Considering that the goal of using polynomial interpolation is to find a constant in a source polynomial S=f(0) using Lagrange polynomials \\"as it is\\" is not efficient, since unused constants are calculated. An optimized approach to use Lagrange polynomials to find L(0) is defined as follows: : L(0) = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} f(x_j) \\\\prod_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} m\\\\,=\\\\,0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ m\\\\, e\\\\,j \\\\end{smallmatrix}}^{k-1} \\\\frac{x_m}{x_m - x_j} Problem Although the simplified version of the method demonstrated above, which uses integer arithmetic rather than finite field arithmetic, works fine, there is a security problem: Eve gains a lot of information about S with every D_i that she finds. Suppose that she finds the 2 points D_0=(1,1494) and D_1=(2,1942), she still doesn't have k=3 points so in theory she shouldn't have gained any more info about S. But she combines the info from the 2 points with the public info: n=6, k=3, f(x)=a_0+a_1x+\\\\cdots+a_{k-1}x^{k-1}, a_0=S, a_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} and she : ::: S\\\\in[1046,1048,\\\\dots,1342,1344]. :: She now only has 150 numbers to guess from instead of an infinite number of natural numbers. Solution This is a polynomial curve over a finite field—now the order of the polynomial has seemingly little to do with the shape of the graph. Geometrically this attack exploits the fact that we know the order of the polynomial and so gain insight into the paths it may take between known points. This reduces possible values of unknown points since it must lie on a smooth curve. This problem can be fixed by using finite field arithmetic. A field of size p\\\\in\\\\mathbb{P}:p>S,p>n is used. The graph shows a polynomial curve over a finite field, in contrast to the usual smooth curve it appears very disorganised and disjointed. In practice this is only a small change, it just means that we should choose a prime p that is bigger than the number of participants and every a_i (including a_0=S) and we have to calculate the points as (x, f(x)\\\\bmod p) instead of (x, f(x)). Since everyone who receives a point also has to know the value of p, it may be considered to be publicly known. Therefore, one should select a value for p that is not too low. For this example we choose p=1613, so our polynomial becomes f(x)=1234+166x+94x^2\\\\bmod{1613} which gives the points: (1,1494);(2,329);(3,965);(4,176);(5,1188);(6,775) This time Eve doesn't win any info when she finds a D_x (until she has k points). Suppose again that Eve finds D_0=\\\\left(1,1494\\\\right) and D_1=\\\\left(2,329\\\\right), this time the public info is: n=6, k=3, p=1613, f(x)=a_0+a_1x+\\\\dots+a_{k-1}x^{k-1}\\\\mod{p}, a_0=S, a_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} so she: This time she can't stop because (m_1-m_2) could be any integer (even negative if m_2>m_1) so there are an infinite amount of possible values for a_1. She knows that [448,445,442,\\\\ldots] always decreases by 3 so if 1613 was divisible by 3 she could conclude a_1\\\\in[1, 4, 7, \\\\ldots] but because it's prime she can't conclude even that and so she didn't win any information.

For instance, the president can unlock the safe alone, whereas 3 secretaries are required together to unlock it. A known issue in Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme is the verification of correctness of the retrieved shares during the reconstruction process, which is known as verifiable secret sharing. Verifiable secret sharing aims at verifying that shareholders are honest and not submitting fake shares.

Microstructure products means products that have structures in the micrometre range and have their technical function provided by the shape of the microstructure [1]. Thermoforming [2] in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of thermoplastic polymer films or plates with their edges fixed by three- dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the films or plates into female moulds (negative forming) or over male moulds (positive forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro injection moulding or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer. Moulds for polymer microreplication in general and in particular for microthermoforming can be fabricated by various methods such as mechanical micromachining, lithographic based methods in combination with electroplating (see also the so-called 'LIGA' process) and wet or dry etching. And they can be fabricated of various materials such as metal, silicon and glass.  State of the art  For several years now, at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a pressure or high pressure (thermo)forming process is used to fabricate film microchips for capillary electrophoresis (CE) [3–5] and for three-dimensional cell cultivation [6–8]. The process is derived from the macroscopic trapped sheet forming process [2]. This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100 μm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass. First examples of processes coming near to something that could be called 'microthermoforming' originate from the second half of the nineties. So, in 1993, dome shaped polymer microstructures for use in electrical membrane switches were fabricated [9]. This was done between a mating upper and lower metal emboss die with a concave and a convex detail, respectively, first in a hot, then in a second cold press. And in 1999, corrugated sheet like polymer microstructures for use e.g. in electrostatic actuators were fabricated [10]. This was also done between heated tools and counter tools, namely in discontinuous processes between stamps or in continuous processes between rollers. Partly, the counter tool was a soft one in the form of a thicker, unpatterned film or plate made from an easily deformable, e.g. elastomeric material which is able to assume the shape of the hard, metallic tool. In 2006, at the School of Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering (PTFE) of the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT), the same technology approach was used to fabricate similar corrugated sheet like structures in a so-called 'rubber-assisted hot embossing process' [11].  Features and applications  The microthermoforming process including its products can have all the advantageous properties of the powerful macroscopic production process. Moreover, the thermoformed microparts have additional, specific properties appearing only in microscale dimensions and resulting from their unusual morphology. Thermoformed e.g. microfluidic structures have free standing microcavities such as channels and reservoirs and they are thin walled partly in the range of a few micrometers. Specific properties of thermoformed microparts are, amongst others, their high flexibility, their small volume and mass, their low thermal resistance and heat capacity, and their low light absorbance and background fluorescence. Morphology and properties of these microparts now can result in improved or even new, so far unthought of applications. Compared to the other microreplication processes, in microthermoforming, modifications of the film to be formed remain preserved beyond the forming step due to the already mentioned material coherence during this secondary forming process. This enables surface and bulk modification and functionalisation of the three-dimensionally formed films or membranes, namely as highly resolved micro- and nanopatterns, and all side, i.e. on hardly accessible side walls and even behind undercuts. Thus, e.g. thermoformed chips for three-dimensional cell cultivation can be provided with pores, cell adhesion patterns [6–8], surface topologies and electrodes [12]. Future application fields for microthermoforming are expected to be * generally life sciences, e.g. flexible film microchips such as μTAS (Micro Total Analysis Systems) and LOC (Lab-on-a-chip) devices, possibly in continuous format and combined with polytronic circuits, also as human implants * especially tissue engineering, e.g. film substrates or scaffolds for three-dimensional cell cultivation in fundamental research, medical diagnosis, pharmaceutical active substance research, and clinical research and therapy, particularly if integrated in standard laboratory platforms such as petri dishes and microtitre plates * micropackaging, e.g. micro sensor and actuator housings or caps * smart textiles etc.  References  *An interim report from the NEXUS Task Force 1998 Market Analysis for Microsystems *Throne JL 1996 Technology of Thermoforming (Munich: Hanser) *Truckenmüller R, Rummler Z, Schaller T and Schomburg WK 2001 Low-cost production of single-use polymer capillary electrophoresis structures by microthermoforming Proc. 12th Micromechanics Europe Workshop (MME) (Cork, Ireland) pp 39–42 *Truckenmüller R, Rummler Z, Schaller T and Schomburg WK 2002 Low-cost thermoforming of micro fluidic analysis chips J.

Centered on the districts of Oni and Ambrolauri on the southern foothills of the Greater Caucasus mountains, it killed 270, left approximately 100,000 homeless and caused severe damage, including to several medieval monuments. It had a magnitude of 7.0 and was the most powerful earthquake recorded in the Caucasus. Tectonic setting Georgia lies between the two mountain chains of the Greater Caucasus in the north and the Lesser Caucasus in the south. These two sets of mountains have both resulted from the continuing effects of the collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Greater Caucasus consists of a southward-directed fold and thrust belt that has been active since the Oligocene. Racha lies close to the southern margin of this thrust belt and the earthquake is interpreted to be caused by rupture of the active thrust front. Damage USGS shake map for the earthquake The earthquake affected 700 villages and settlements, destroying 46,000 houses and making 100,000 people homeless. The number of casualties was reduced because most of the inhabitants were working in the fields at the time of the earthquake, 13:13 local time. Many important historical monuments were badly damaged, particularly the Archangel Church near Zemo Krikhi and the Mravaldzali church, which were completely destroyed. Much of the damage associated with the earthquake was caused by landslides triggered by the shaking, rather than the shaking itself. The most common type were rock falls, followed by debris slides, slumps, earth slides, rock-block slides and rock avalanches. The most destructive was a large debris avalanche, which destroyed the village of Khokheti, killing 50 of the inhabitants. A large mass of Jurassic volcanic rock fell onto water-saturated alluvium, combining to form the debris avalanche. The debris avalanche, which had an estimated volume of over 3 million m3, swept down a valley through Khokheti, blocking the Gebura River, forming a 100-m-high dam, that breached soon afterwards, causing more destruction. Two of the earth slides showed a delayed movement, with most displacement occurring a few days after the main shock. The Chordi landslide was active before the earthquake and showed only minor movement at the time of the main shock. Two to three days later, the slide started to move at about 8 m per day, destroying the village of Chordi. On 18 May, the slide was still moving at 2 m per day. This slide moved on claystone of the Maikop Formation and had a total volume of about 20 million m3. The large aftershock on 15 June caused extensive damage in the Java to Tskhinvali area. At least 8 people were killed and 200 injured. However, due to a protest rally by the local people, dozens, but not hundreds, were killed. The village of Khakhet was destroyed.http://www.liveinternet.ru/users/2021656/post82149008 Characteristics The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0. A maximum intensity of IX on the MSK scale was observed. The calculated focal mechanism showed that the earthquake was a result of low-angle reverse faulting on a fault plane dipping at about 35° to the north-northeast. This was confirmed from the distribution of aftershocks, which defined a clear plane of this orientation. Analysis of the detailed velocity structure around the rupture zone suggested that it coincided with a marked change in seismic velocity, consistent with it representing the interface between Mesozoic sediments and the underlying crystalline basement. The 1,500-m-high Racha Ridge is thought to have been uplifted by repeated earthquakes of this type. The mainshock was followed by a complex series of aftershocks extending over several months, which caused further damage and casualties The largest of the aftershocks, which consisted of two events about two seconds apart, had a magnitude of = 6.5 and occurred on 15 June with an epicenter near Java. On 23 October 1992, a magnitude-6.7 earthquake occurred about 100 km east of the aftershock zone. It was also due to reverse faulting on a north-northeast-dipping plane, although with a significant dextral (right lateral) strike-slip component. Aftermath The ongoing Georgian–Ossetian conflict complicated the rescue effort.

The song was released as a promotional single in 1995.  Background and recording  Originally titled \\"We Are the Low\\", the song began life as an instrumental during the Parklife sessions. In the guitar solo, Graham Coxon played three solos, including one of him sat in front of his amp, turned up to maximum volume. According to bassist Alex James, Damon Albarn was finding it hard to write lyrics. In his autobiography, A Bit of a Blur, he revealed that \\"for Christmas I bought him a handkerchief with a map of the shipping forecast regions on it... you can never tell where the muse is going to appear.\\" \\"We always found the shipping forecast soothing,\\" James explained. \\"We used to listen to it [on the American tour] to remind us of home. It's very good for a hangover. Good cure for insomnia, too.\\" On 4 February 1994, the penultimate day of official recording, Albarn was due to go into hospital for a hernia operation. Pressured to come up with the lyrics, Albarn took advantage of the map James had given him. \\"I'd had this line – 'And into the sea go pretty England and me' – for a long time\\", Albarn revealed. \\"So I started at the Bay of Biscay. Back for tea. 'Tea' rhymes with 'me'. And then I went 'Hit traffic on the Dogger Bank'. 'Bank' – 'Rank' – so 'up the Thames to find a taxi rank'. And I just went round.\\"  Music and lyrics  The song is in the key of E majorParklife album booklet, page 16 and is in 4/4 time. In total, the song contains two verses, two choruses, a guitar solo and two further choruses. The music commences with a four-chord guitar progression, before moving straight into the first verse. The music is based in the mixolydian mode, highlighted by the fact the V chord (B minor) is minor instead of major. The song's lyrics reference a low-pressure area of weather hitting Britain. The lyrics are based on the Shipping Forecast, with references made to the various areas surrounding the country. In the lyric \\"sail on by with the tide\\", passing reference is also made to the tune \\"Sailing By\\", which ends each day's broadcast of BBC Radio 4. Music writer John Harris described the lyrics as \\"a fantasia centred around the shipping forecast - [an] inexplicably calming institution that soundtracks the switching-off of the UK's night-lights - narrated as if the writer was gazing at the whole of The British Isles.\\"  Locations named in the song  This is a list of the shipping areas mentioned in the song (in context): *Biscay – \\"Around the Bay of Biscay and back for tea\\" *Dogger, Thames – \\"Hit traffic on the Dogger Bank/Up the Thames to find a taxi rank\\" *Tyne, Forth, Cromarty, Forties – \\"Up the Tyne, Forth and Cromarty/There's a low in the High Forties\\" *Malin – \\"And on the Malin Head, Blackpool looks blue and red\\" The song also mentions the most westerly point of England, Land's End: \\"the Queen, she's gone round the bend, jumped off Land's End\\".

History Wenhui Bao was founded in Shanghai in 1938 by leftist-leaning intellectuals centered on writer and journalist Ke Ling. Over the next decade it was closed down twice for its political leanings. In early 1956, Wenhui Bao was forced to relocate to Beijing and was renamed Jiaoshibao (Teacher's News). After the start of the Hundred Flowers Campaign, however, the paper was allowed to resume publication under its original name, beginning on 1 October 1956. Under its editor-in- chief Xu Zhucheng, Wenhui Bao became one of the most outspoken newspapers of the Hundred Flowers period, but was attacked by Mao Zedong in July 1957 and punished. In the 1960s, Wenhui Bao became an outlet for Mao Zedong's editorials, and in late 1965 it was used by the Shanghai leftists supporting Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao to launch their attack on the writer Wu Han. Their polemical review of Wu's play Hai Rui Dismissed from Office became the triggers of China's Cultural Revolution. On 4 January 1967, the paper was taken over by radical Red Guards in the first power seizure in Shanghai. In the 1980s, Wenhui Bao re-emerged as a widely read paper with a circulation of 1.8 million. In 1998, in a wave of creating press groups backed by the government, Wenhui Bao and Xinmin Wanbao were merged into the Wenhui-Xinmin United Press Group, which was the second largest press group in China after Guangzhou Daily Press Group in terms of advertisement revenues.

Born John O'Mullowny Tony Nugent (2013), Were You at the Rock? The History of Mass Rocks in Ireland, pages 46-47. in Derrew, near Ballyheane, County Mayo, he began his career as a horse thief but was arrested and sentenced to death in Castlebar in his youth. When the grand jury became aware of his low character, they cut a deal with him in which he agreed to turn priest hunter to escape the hangman's noose. The 1709 Penal Act demanded that Catholic priests take the Oath of Abjuration and recognise the Protestant Queen Anne as Supreme Head of the Church of England and Ireland. Any cleric that refused was sentenced to death by the Anglican-controlled judicial system. O'Mullowney was a talented rogue and excelled at the activity of hunting clergy. He received £100 for the capture of an archbishop or bishop, £20 for a priest, and £10 for obtaining a hedge school teacher, and £5 for a priest in training;Hugh Carthy, Irish author, historian, and tour guide sizable amounts at the time. These men would then be executed if they refused to take the Act of Abjuration. O'Mullowney used the money to fund his heavy drinking and expensive tastes. One technique used by him was to pretend to be sick and close to death. He would then call for a priest to confess his numerous sins. When a priest would arrive, O'Mullowny would grab a knife hidden under the bedclothes, and attempt to capture or kill his confessor. O'Mullowny was a deeply unpopular individual, and hated by all. He murdered with steady success until he had killed all but two of the area priests. The last two knew well who he was and lived in disguise. But O'Mullowny discovered one of the last two and killed him. He expected that the last remaining priest would attend that funeral, which he did, dressed as a woman. The priest's disguise did not fool O'Mullowny, who attacked him at the funeral. Unlike other priests who had been ambushed by someone whom they thought was dying, this priest was expecting an attack and fought back. He was able to hold off Mullowney long enough for a homeless man known as McCann to stab Mullowney and kill him. He is said to be buried in the graveyard at Ballintubber Abbey.\\"History\\", Ballintubber Abbey References Sources * De Burca, Eamon (1987).

The Corliss engine is widely considered one of the more notable engineering achievements of the 19th century. It provided a reliable, efficient source of industrial power, enabling the expansion of new factories to areas which did not readily possess reliable or abundant water power.A GENERAL PURPOSE TECHNOLOGY AT WORK: THE CORLISS STEAM ENGINE IN THE LATE 19TH CENTURY US, Nathan Rosenberg and Manuel Trajtenberg, September 2001. Corliss gained international acclaim for his achievements during the late 19th century and is perhaps best known for the Centennial Engine, which was the centerpiece of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Early life George Henry Corliss was born June 2, 1817, the second child of Dr. Hiram and Susan (Sheldon) Corliss, at Easton, New York, near the Vermont border.History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, NY: The American Historical Society, Inc., 1920: The son of a physician, he attended local schools until age 14, when he began working in a general store in the town of Greenwich, New York. In 1834 he entered the academy at Castleton, Vermont and graduated in 1838. A typical Corliss engine. The Corliss valve gear is on the left and connects to the piston which drives the flywheel on the right. Corliss displayed early signs of his mechanical abilities in 1837, after a flood washed away a bridge over the Batten Kill in Greenwich. He organized other local builders in erection of a replacement structure. After graduating from Castleton in 1838, he established his own general store in town of Greenwich where he remained for three years. In January 1839 he married Phebe F. Frost, a native of Canterbury, Connecticut. Together they had two children, Maria and George, Jr. During this time, Corliss became more interested in mechanical endeavors. Around 1841, he decided to give his whole attention to these new tasks, and in 1842 obtained a patent on a machine for sewing boots, shoes and heavy leather. Corliss moved to Providence, Rhode Island in 1844 with hopes of finding funding to perfect his sewing machine. In Providence, he found work in the shop of Fairbanks, Bancroft & Company as a draftsman. However, he soon abandoned work on sewing machines to focus on a new endeavor, improving the stationary steam engine, which at the time was an innefficient or supplemental alternative to water power. Career In 1848, Corliss entered into a partnership with John Barstow and E.J. Nightingale under the name Corliss, Nightingale & Company. During the same year, the company built the first engine utilizing Corliss' improvements, which except for various technical improvements later on, was essentially the Corliss steam engine of years later. Corliss and his associates erected a new factory at the junction of Charles Street and the railroad in Providence, where the company would expand greatly in the years to follow. By the time of Corliss' death in 1888, the plant would cover about and the company would employ over 1,000 people. Detail of a Corliss-type valvegear showing the path of high-pressure steam (in red) and low-pressure steam (in blue). With each stroke, the four valves alternate opening and closing, driving the piston back and forth On March 10, 1849, Corliss was granted US Patent #6162 for his valve gear. In 1856 the Corliss Steam Engine Company was incorporated with George Corliss as president, and his younger brother, William, as treasurer. By 1859, Corliss engines were being exported to Scotland for use in cotton mills. By 1864, valves for the engines were being made at B. Hick and Son, Bolton, England. Corliss directed both the business and research sides of this company, and over the years invented many assembly line improvements such as a bevel-gear cutter. Europe eventually became a great purchaser of the Corliss engine and it was copied by the engine builders who placed upon their imitations the name of the American builder. The dramatic improvement in fuel efficiency of the Corliss engine was a major selling point to manufacturers, particularly during the early years. Similar to other engine makers of the day, the Corliss Steam Engine Company often negotiated the selling price of their machines on the projected savings in coal.Eminent Engineers, p. 116. Corliss' first wife Phebe died on March 5, 1859. In December, 1866, he married Emily Shaw. Monitor's turret, that Corliss help build The Corliss Steam Engine Company supplied the United States Government with machinery during the Civil War. When Monitor was being constructed in 1861, it was found a large ring must be made, upon which the turret of Monitor would revolve, and the Corliss Engine Works was one of the very few plants in the country with the necessary machinery to 'turn' up the large ring. When Corliss found out what the tooling was for, he put aside other business and worked his plant day and night to get this important ring completed and on time and delivered to New York. By the late 1860s, Corliss began to be recognized internationally for his accomplishments. At the 1867 World's Fair held at Paris, he won the first prize in a competition of the one hundred most famous engine builders in the world. One of its commissioners to the exposition, John Scott Russell, proclaimed of the Corliss valve gear, \\"A mechanism as beautiful as the human hand. It releases or retains its grasp on the feeding valve, and gives a greater or less dose of steam in nice proportion to each varying want. The American engine of Corliss everywhere tells of wise forethought, judicious proportions and execution and exquisite contrivance.\\" On January 11, 1870, one hundred years after James Watt patented his first steam engine, Corliss was awarded the Rumford Prize by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. It was on this occasion Dr. Asa Gray, the president of the academy, remarked, \\"No invention since Watt's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine as this for which the Rumford medal is now presented.\\" Centennial Exposition Stereograph of the 1876 Centennial Engine In 1872 the State of Rhode Island appointed Corliss its commissioner to take charge of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, and he was chosen one of the executive committee appointed to look after the preliminaries. Upon the great task of arranging the exposition, he worked with his usual indefatigable energy and it was his suggestion that the Centennial Board of Finance be organized, a body which had no little to do with the insurance of the financial success of the exhibition. It was also in his own department as engineer that Corliss contributed largely to the success of the great fair, and it was he that supplied, after the plans of all other competitors proved inadequate, the great fourteen hundred horsepower engine which supplied the power used in Machinery Hall. This engine, unequaled in size at that time, was installed by Corliss at a cost of one hundred thousand dollars to himself and without additional expenditure to the exposition. The great engine was afterwards used to operate the Pullman Car Works at Chicago until 1910, when it was sold for scrap. Late career and legacy Corliss was also active within the community. He was elected three consecutive times to the Rhode Island General Assembly as the Representative from North Providence, his term of service including the three years 1868-69-70. In 1876 he was chosen presidential elector, casting his vote for President Hayes. In the matter of his religious belief he was a Congregationalist. He attended Central Congregational Church in Providence until he joined the Charles Street Church at its founding in 1865. He was keenly interested in the cause of religion and gave liberally both to his own and to other churches. Corliss' 1849 patent expired in 1870 after it was extended by U.S. Patent reissue 200 on May 13, 1851 and U.S. Patent reissues 758 and 763 on July 12, 1859. After 1870, numerous other companies began to manufacture Corliss engines. Among them, the William A. Harris Steam Engine Company, the Worthington Pump and Machinery Company, and the E.P. Allis Company, which eventually became Allis-Chalmers. In general, these machines were referred to as \\"Corliss\\" engines regardless of who made them. The \\"Corliss-type\\" engine became particularly popular in Europe. Amusingly, Corliss received the Grand Diploma of Honor by the Vienna Exposition at Vienna in 1873, although he was not even an exhibitor. Another honor, perhaps the greatest of all was given to him by the Institute of France by public proclamation, March 10, 1879, of the Montyon prize for the year 1878, the most coveted prize for mechanical achievement awarded in Europe. He received this honor by a peculiar coincidence, on the thirtieth anniversary of the granting of his first patent. In 1886, the King of Belgium made Corliss an officer in the Order of Leopold.Eminent Engineers, p. 121 Despite the competition, Corliss would continue to remain active within his company, directing changes to his basic design as market or customer needs dictated.Eminent Engineers, p. 115 Corliss died on February 21, 1888 at the age of 70. He is buried at Swan Point Cemetery in Providence, with his second wife Emily. The Corliss Steam Engine Company was purchased by the International Power Company in 1900. In 1905 it was purchased by the American and British Manufacturing Company. In 1925 the company merged into Franklin Machine Company. The house he built in 1875 on the east side of Providence, is now known as the Corliss-Brackett House and is part of Brown University. Corliss Street in Providence, located near the former site of the Corliss factory, is also named in his honor, as is Corliss High School in Chicago, Illinois. Corliss was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.

It is a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), which administers games on behalf of the member lotteries. The Iowa Lottery portfolio includes Powerball, Mega Millions, Lotto America, Lucky for Life, Pick 3, Pick 4, plus numerous instant scratch ticket, InstaPlay and pull-tab games. The largest jackpot won in Iowa so far was in October 2018. Lerynne West of Redfield claimed a $343.9 million Powerball prize. West's ticket split the $687.8 million Powerball jackpot in the Oct. 27 drawing with a ticket purchased in New York. History Legislation creating Iowa's lottery was signed into law in April 1985; the Lottery began sales on August 22, 1985, with a kickoff celebration at the Iowa State Fair. The first product sold by the Iowa Lottery was an instant-scratch game called Scratch, Match and Win; players bought more than 6.4 million tickets during its first week. Since the lottery's start in 1985, its players have won more than $4.5 billion in prizes while the lottery has raised $2 billion for the state programs that benefit all Iowans. Today, lottery proceeds in Iowa have four main purposes. They provide support for our state's veterans and their families through the Iowa Veterans Trust Fund; support through the Iowa Public Safety Survivor Benefits Fund for the surviving family members of Iowa peace officers and fire fighters who die in the line of duty; help for a variety of significant projects through the state General Fund; and backing for the Vision Iowa program, which was implemented to create tourism destinations and community attractions in the state and build and repair schools. The Lottery sells tickets in four general categories: instant- scratch, InstaPlay, pull-tab and online games. Lottery products are sold at nearly 2,400 retail locations. The Iowa Lottery has over 110 employees who work at its headquarters in Clive and its regional offices in Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs, Mason City and Storm Lake. In 1994, Iowa became the first state in the US that required lottery players to be at least 21 years of age. (Louisiana became the second in 1998, followed by Arizona in 2003.) In September 2007, the Iowa Lottery (along with the Kansas Lottery) began the first US multi-jurisdictional scratch game, Midwest Millions. Iowa's Pick 3 and Pick 4 numbers were previously drawn by the Illinois Lottery at the WGN-TV studios in Chicago using their Pick 3 and Pick 4 results until April 16, 2014, when the Iowa Lottery began drawing their own numbers two months after WGN America, which previously televised all Illinois Lottery drawings, discontinued airing their 9 p.m. newscasts, along with the diverging winning options for each game between each lottery over the years. As of July 1, 2017, the Iowa Lottery now utilizes Indiana's Hoosier Lottery results from their Daily 3 and Daily 4 drawings for Pick 3 and Pick 4 numbers in Iowa, with the latter's Super Ball doublers disregarded in Iowa.

Previous games offered  All or Nothing  Iowa, along with Minnesota, offered the MUSL version of the All or Nothing lottery game. Due to low sales, the game was ended and the final drawing for the All or Nothing game was held on June 30, 2017.  Hot Lotto  Hot Lotto was available through 14 lotteries, including Iowa's and the District of Columbia's; its drawings were held each Wednesday and Saturday. Hot Lotto drew five \\"white balls\\" numbered from 1 through 47, and one orange \\"Hot Ball\\", numbered 1 through 19. The starting jackpot was $1,000,000 (all-cash, and \\"taxes paid\\"), increasing by at least $50,000 if there is no top prize winner. Hot Lotto, normally $1 per play had a $2 option. Players could add the Sizzler option to their tickets (similar to Powerball's Power Play); it tripled non-jackpot prizes. On May 12, 2013, the Hot Lotto game dropped its annuity option; eight \\"white balls\\" were added to the original 39. The game acquired some notoriety in 2015, when it was revealed that Eddie Tipton, an employee of the Multi-State Lottery Association, attempted to rig a 2010 drawing to claim a $16.5 million prize. Hot Lotto held its final drawing on Oct. 28, 2017. Since its jackpot was not won in the final drawing, the money was rolled into the start of the Lotto America game.

It is typically obtained through trapping, usually with wire snares, or otherwise with shotguns or arms originally intended for use in the DRC's numerous military conflicts. The \\"bushmeat crisis\\" emerged in the DRC mainly as a result of the poor living conditions of the Congolese people. , WWF, 2001. A rising population combined with deplorable economic conditions forced many Congolese to become dependent on bushmeat, either as a means of acquiring income (hunting the meat and selling), or dependency on it for food. Unemployment and urbanization throughout Central Africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban sprawl of Kinshasa into the prime market for bushmeat. This combination has caused not only widespread endangerment of local fauna, but has forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired animal meat. , WWF, 2001. This overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes resources even more scarce for humans. The hunting has also been facilitated by the extensive logging prevalent throughout the Congo's rainforests (from corporate logging, in addition to farmers clearing out forest in order to create areas for agriculture), which allows hunters much easier access to previously unreachable jungle terrain, while simultaneously eroding away at the habitats of animals. , WWF, 2001. A case that has particularly alarmed conservationists is that of primates. The Congo is inhabited not only by two distinct species of chimpanzee - the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and the bonobo (Pan paniscus) - but by the gorilla as well. It is the only country in the world in which bonobo are found in the wild. The two species of chimpanzees, along with gorillas, are the closest living evolutionary relatives to humans. Much concern has been raised about great ape extinction. Because of hunting and habitat destruction, the chimpanzee and the gorilla, both of whose population once numbered in the millions have now dwindled down to only about 200,000 per species. Gorillas and both species of chimpanzee are classified as endangered by the World Conservation Union, as well as the okapi, which is also native to the area.

It is a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), whose flagship game is Powerball. It was founded in 1974 after being approved through a voter referendum. Maine originally joined MUSL in 1990, before the Iowa-based organization began Powerball; Maine pulled out two years later, when Powerball was introduced. Maine did not rejoin MUSL until 2004. (Powerball drawings moved to Florida in 2009, although MUSL headquarters remain in Iowa). MUSL's smaller jackpot game Hot Lotto is Maine's first continuing draw game to have its winning numbers drawn via random number generator (RNG) instead of using traditional lottery balls. An agreement was reached on October 13, 2009, for Mega Millions and Powerball to be available through any US lottery. Maine began sales of Mega Millions on May 9, 2010, after most lotteries began offering both games on January 31, 2010. The Portland Press Herald, on March 31, 2010, reported that the Supplemental Budget had passed; it included a provision to require Maine to join Mega Millions on May 9, 2010. WCSH-TV (NBC) in Portland reported that Gov. Baldacci signed the Supplemental Budget on March 31, 2010. Currently, 46 lotteries offer Mega Millions and Powerball. Since rejoining MUSL in 2004, Maine has not sold a Powerball jackpot ticket; it also has yet to produce a Mega Millions jackpot winner. Maine's largest lottery prize was from Lotto*America during its first incarnation with MUSL. All of Maine's draw games are shared with other lotteries; its \\"smallest\\" online games are those offered by the Tri-State Lottery; whose drawing games, also available in Vermont and New Hampshire, are always drawn in New Hampshire. Maine also offers scratch tickets. Current Draw games In-house Tri-State games Drawings for these games, played in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, are held in New Hampshire: Pick 3 Pick 3 is drawn twice daily, including Sundays. Prizes and options vary. Pick 4 Pick 4 is drawn in conjunction with Pick 3. Megabucks Plus Megabucks Plus has a similar format as Mega Millions orPowerball. As Megabucks, begun in 1985, it was a \\"classic\\"-style six-number game until July 2009. Every Wednesday and Saturday, five \\"regular' numbers are drawn from a pool of 41, and one from a second pool, of six. Games are $2 each; the minimum jackpot is $1,000,000 (annuitized with a cash option.) Multi-jurisdictional games Hot Lotto Hot Lotto is played the same as Mega Millions or Powerball, except players choose 5 of 47 \\"white ball\\" numbers, and 1 of 19 \\"Hot Ball\\" numbers. Games are $1 each; if the Sizzler option is activated (its games are $2) non-jackpot prizes are tripled. (The Sizzler option was added in 2008.) Maine, which joined Hot Lotto in 2009, was its newest member until Tennessee joined in 2013. Jackpots are all-cash, and \\"taxes-paid\\" (although winners are subject to income taxes.) As of 2017, thirteen other states also offer the game. The game will be replaced by the new version of Lotto America on November 12, 2017. Maine was also a part of the original Lotto America before it became Powerball, which Maine waited till 2004 to join. Lucky for Life Connecticut's in-state draw game Lucky4Lìfe, which began in 2009, became a regional game three years later. Now called Lucky for Life, it replaced the Tri-State game Weekly Grand Extra. The third version of the game began on September 17, 2013. As with the first multi-state Lucky for Life, first prize is $1000-per-day-for-life (split by multiple winners); the current game has a second prize of $25,000-per-year- for-life. For the first time, a winner of a \\"lifetime\\" (first- or second- prize) has the option of choosing cash. The current version, which began on January 27, 2015, is offered by 22 lotteries plus the District of Columbia. Players choose 5 of 48 white balls, and a \\"Lucky Ball\\" from 18 green balls in the second machine. Mega Millions Maine joined Mega Millions on May 9, 2010, several months after U.S. lotteries, which initially could offer either Mega Millions or Powerball, could add the other game. Mega Millions plays are $1 each; with Megaplier, $2. Jackpots begin at $15 million. Mega Millions' most recent format change was in October 2013. Powerball Powerball jackpots begin at $40 million (annuitized), and increase by at least $10 million if not won. Games cost $2 each; with Power Play, $3. There are nine prize levels; second prize is $1,000,000 (cash) in a $2 game; if Power Play was selected, $2,000,000. Maine had been a MUSL member from 1990 to 1992, offering Lotto*America; Maine opted out of MUSL when Lotto*America was replaced by Powerball. Instant Tickets/Fast Play Maine offers scratch-off tickets with price points of $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, $20, and $25. Maine also offers Fast Play terminal-generated \\"instant tickets\\". Fast Play tickets are part of the Tri-State compact. Keno Maine offers an in-state Keno game that began in May 2015.

Cob barn thought to be over 500 years old In 1800 the area was largely a remote and barren heathland, used only by smugglers – most notably Isaac Gulliver, now considered one of the founding fathers of Bournemouth – and revenue troops. 'Bourne Heath' was also known as Wallis Down in the north and Little Down in the south and east, and was part of the Great Heath of central Dorset which extended as far as Dorchester. To the east was Christchurch, to the west was Poole and to the north east was the River Stour. There were villages at Kinson, Throop, Holdenhurst (where the oldest dwelling is located) and Iford and a handful of buildings at Pokesdown but the area between these communities was just a wilderness of pine trees, gorse, ferns and heather. The area now called central Bournemouth and the Pier Approach was 'Bourne Mouth' – the mouth of the Bourne Stream. No-one lived at Bourne Mouth and the only regular visitors were a few fishermen, turf cutters and gangs of smugglers who landed their cargoes of spirits, tea and tobacco on the deserted beach. The eastern part of the heath was called the Liberty of West Stour (later, the Liberty of Westover). It was divided into six tythings: 'Muscliff', 'Muccleshell', 'Throop', 'Holdenhurst', 'Iford' and 'Tuckton & Wick'. These areas were common land used by the inhabitants for livestock and by the poor for wood and turves. The western and southern parts of the heath had once been a hunting estate 'Stourfield Chase' but by the late 18th century only a small part of this was maintained: the 'Decoy Pond Estate' (now known as 'Coy Pond' and being wholly in the neighbouring historic town of Poole) comprising several fields around the Bourne Stream and including a cottage known as Decoy Pond House, which stood near where The Square is today. Christchurch Inclosure Act 1802 Until 1802 the area was common land. The Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802 and the Inclosure Commissioners' Award of 1805 transferred hundreds of acres into private ownership for the first time. To implement the Act, three Commissioners were appointed to divide up the land and allot it according to an individual's entitlement. They were also empowered to set out the roads and to sell plots of land to pay for their work in creating the award. The Commissioners were Richard Richardson of Lincoln's Inn Fields, John Wickens of Mapperton, Dorset and William Calpcott of Holdenhurst. Their clerk was William Baldwin of Ringwood. Whilst the landed gentry were well represented with the Commissioners, the ordinary commoners who used and depended on the common land were concerned that they would lose all rights and would have nowhere for their animals and nowhere from which to collect wood and turves. However, they managed to persuade William West, the farmer at Muscliff Farm, to create a petition on their behalf and to present it to the Commissioners at a meeting in Ringwood. The result was that five areas of land, totalling , were set aside for the benefit of the occupiers of certain cottages \\"in lieu of their Rights or pretended Rights or customs in cutting Turves\\". These five areas are today known as 'Meyrick Park', 'Queen's Park', 'King's Park', 'Redhill Common' and 'Seafield Gardens' and are held in trust by the Five Parks Charity.Map of Commissioner's Award 1805 More than half the land sold was bought by two men, William Dean of Littledown House, who paid £639 for including the West Cliff and what is now King's Park. Sir George Ivison Tapps, the Lord of the Manor of Christchurch, paid £1,050 for including the East Cliff and part of central Bournemouth. Sir George decided to plant thousands of pine trees on his land. It was the valuable medicinal properties of these trees, combined with the invigorating sea air, that the town owes its origin. In 1809 a new building appeared on the heath. Originally called the Tapps Arms after Sir George Tapps, and later the Tregonwell Arms. It stood where Post Office Road meets Old Christchurch Road. The pub was a favourite haunt of smugglers and later became Bournemouth's first post office. It was demolished in 1885. When retired army officer Lewis Tregonwell visited in 1810, he found only a bridge crossing a small stream at the head of an unspoilt valley (or 'chine') that led out into Poole Bay. An inn had recently been built near what is now The Square (the centre of Bournemouth), catering both for travellers and for the smugglers who lurked in the area at night. Captain Tregonwell and his wife were so impressed by the area that they bought several acres and built a home, which is today part of the Royal Exeter Hotel. Tregonwell also planted pine trees, providing a sheltered walk to the beach. The town was to grow up around its scattered pines. Twenty-five years after the Tregonwells started work on their holiday mansion, Bournemouth was still only a small community with a scattering of houses and cottages. Growth and development as a resort In 1835 after the death of Sir George Ivison Tapps, his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis inherited his father's estate and started developing the seaside village into a resort similar to those that had already grown up along the south coast such as Weymouth and Brighton. Sir George employed Christchurch architect Benjamin Ferrey to plan the Gervis Estate. The Westover Villas were commenced in 1837. Ferrey included hotels in his design for Bournemouth. The first two hotels opened in 1838. One was the Bath Hotel, which went on to become the Royal Bath, although the original building was much smaller and less grand than the current facility. The other was the Belle Vue Boarding House, which stood where the Pavilion is now and later became the Belle Vue and Pier Hotel. Bournemouth also acquired its first church in 1838; before this people had to travel to Poole, Holdenhurst or Christchurch for Sunday worship. The first church was converted from a pair of semi-detached cottages which stood in The Square roughly where Debenhams is today. A pointed turret was added to the roof and fitted with a bell. During the week the building was used as a schoolroom. In 1840 Bournemouth was officially referred to as a single word. By 1841 there were still only a few hundred people living in Bournemouth but that was soon to change. In that year the seaside village had an important visitor, a physician called Augustus Bozzi Granville, the author of a book called The Spas of England which described health resorts around the country. As a result of his visit, Dr Granville included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. It was this more than anything that put the town on the map as the perfect place for people with health problems, especially chest complaints which were far more common in the 19th century than today. Bournemouth quickly became a destination for affluent holiday-makers and for invalids in search of the sea air. In the 1840s the fields south of the road crossing (later The Square) were drained and laid out with shrubberies and walks. In 1849 a bridge was built over the Bourne Stream, providing the beginning of The Square. In 1856, Parliament approved the Bournemouth Improvement Act. Under the Act, a board of 13 Commissioners was established to organise all the things involved in the running of a small but growing town, such as paving, sewers, drainage, street lighting and street cleaning. Under the guidance of their surveyor, Christopher Crabb Creeke, the Bournemouth Commissioners quickly launched a programme of work designed to improve the amenities of their town and make it more attractive to visitors. The Commissioners continued to govern the town until 1890 and were the forerunners of the Bournemouth Borough Council of today. By the 1860s the fields to the north were also laid out with walks by the owners of the Branksome Estate. In the early 1870s all the fields were leased to the Bournemouth Commissioners, by the freeholders. These fields now form The Pleasure Gardens, which run through the centre of the town; although the name The Lower Pleasure Gardens is no longer officially applied to the area south of The Square. The area continued to progress with the development of the railways and the popular idea of visiting the seaside for holidays. Among the people who contributed to the development of Bournemouth at this time were Sir Percy Shelley (son of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley) and Sir Merton Russell-Cotes. The Holdenhurst Road drill hall was completed in 1897. History of transport in Bournemouth Railway On 14 March 1870 the London and South Western Railway Company opened the first railway station in the town, following an extension of the Ringwood-Christchurch branch line. The station was built on the east side of Holdenhurst Road. The facilities offered by this station were very basic. On 18 June 1874 a second station opened in Queens Road, near Westbourne, at the end of an extension from Broadstone Junction. It was served initially only by the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway with trains connecting with the LSWR at Wimborne. On 20 July 1885 the present mainline station, designed by William Jacob, was opened on the west side of Holdenhurst Road. A link between the two stations, then known as Bournemouth West and Bournemouth East, was opened on 28 September 1886. Also in 1886 a Boscombe station was opened, the name was later changed to Pokesdown (Boscombe). In 1897 when a new Boscombe station (since closed) was opened on land situated between Ashley Road and Gloucester Road, the original was renamed Pokesdown. The new Bournemouth East station was renamed Bournemouth Central on 1 May 1899. The building of railway links made Bournemouth much easier to get to and more people began to visit the town.Southern E-Group Tram The Square in Bournemouth with a tram c1910. Between July 1902 and April 1936, Bournemouth Corporation operated a tramway between Bournemouth, Poole, Christchurch and Winton. On 1 May 1908, a tram was derailed on Avenue Road (near to the present day library), killing 7 people and seriously injuring 2. The tramway system began its closure in 1929 when motorbuses of Hants and Dorset Motor Services were introduced as a tram replacement on the Lower Parkstone route. Bournemouth tram number 85 is preserved and on static display at the Museum of Electricity in Christchurch. Trolleybuses The town also had an extensive network which opened on 13 May 1933 and closed on 20 April 1969.Trolleybuses in Bournemouth The Pleasure Gardens and the sanatorium The Bournemouth War Memorial, built in 1921, located in the central gardens. The Pleasure Gardens are still an important landmark and the Central Gardens contain the town's impressive war memorial, guarded by two stone lions. The War Memorial was installed in 1921 when the Borough Council moved to the adjacent Mont Dore Hotel, which it still occupies. Various building works were carried out – such as the Saint Stephen's Road bridge – to stamp the municipal identity on this area of the town; the war memorial was one of them. It was designed by Bournemouth's deputy architect Albert Edward Shervey, who copied the two lions (one sleeping, the other awake and roaring) from Antonio Cavona's lions which guarded the tomb of Pope Clement XIII. A large sanatorium, overlooking the Central Gardens, treated patients with chest diseases. It has recently been re-developed as Brompton Court, a complex of retirement homes, preserving its remarkable chapel. Next to the sanatorium was built the magnificent Mont Dore Hotel, which is now the Town Hall. In the hotel's heyday in the 1880s it was renowned nationally and internationally for its sumptuous luxury which included possessing one of the first telephones in England – the number was \\"3\\". The hotel was then used during the First World War as a hospital to treat wounded soldiers. Although the number of invalids sent to the town dropped in the late 19th century, the resort was still booming and its population increasing rapidly. As Bournemouth's popularity increased, the town centre spawned theatres, concert halls, cafés, cinemas and more hotels. History of Bournemouth Pier Pier approach, 1890s The first pier in Bournemouth consisted of a short wooden jetty that was completed in 1856. This was replaced by a much longer wooden pier, designed by George Rennie, which opened on 17 September 1861. Due to an attack by Teredo worm, the wooden piles were removed in favour of cast iron replacements in 1866, but even with this additional benefit just over a year later the pier was made unusable when the T-shaped landing stage was swept away in a gale. After repairs, the pier continued in use for a further ten years until November 1876 when another severe storm caused further collapse rendering the pier too short for steamboat traffic. The Rennie pier was subsequently demolished, and replaced in 1877 by a temporary structure. During the next three years a new pier, designed by Eugenius Birch, was completed. At a cost of £2,600 the new Bournemouth Pier was opened by the Lord Mayor of London on 11 August 1880. Consisting of an open promenade, it stretched to a length of 838 ft (255.4 m) and spanned some 35 ft (10.6 m) across the neck of the pier, extending to 110 ft (33.3 m) at the head. With the addition of a bandstand in 1885, military band concerts took place three times a day in summer and twice daily throughout the winter. Covered shelters were also provided at this time. Two extensions, in 1894 and 1909 respectively, took the pier's overall length to more than 1000 ft (304.8 m). In common with virtually all other piers in the south and east of the country, Bournemouth Pier was substantially demolished by soldiers from the 18th Field Park Company of the Royal Engineers on 5 July 1940 as a precaution against German invasion. The pier was repaired and re- opened in August 1946. Refurbishment of the pier head was carried out in 1950, and ten years later a rebuild of the substructure was completed in concrete to take the weight of a new pier theatre. A structural survey of 1976 found major areas of corrosion, and in 1979 a £1.7m restoration programme was initiated. Having demolished the old shoreward end buildings, replacing them with a new two-storey octagonal leisure complex, and reconstructed the pier neck in concrete giving it the bridge-like appearance that it retains today, the work was completed in two years. As of 2019, the council levies a charge to walk on the pier during peak season – early April until late October. The charge is £1.20 for adults and 80 pence for children.https://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/AttractionsLeisure/BeachesandWaterfront/BournemouthAndBoscombePiers.aspx The Winter Gardens The town's first large entertainment venue was the original glass Winter Gardens, built in 1875 as the home of the town's municipal orchestra, (now the internationally renowned Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra). Elgar, Sibelius and Holst conducted there, but the acoustics were reputedly poor. In 1935, the original Winter Gardens was demolished. Its replacement, opened two years later, was intended as an indoor bowls centre, but by chance turned out to have superb acoustics, and after the Second World War it became the orchestra's new home. Before the opening of the BIC, the Winter Gardens welcomed just about every major entertainer of the day, including Maurice Chevalier, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Queen and Morecambe and Wise. The building had been in decline since the late 1970s, and stood closed as the town council examined alternative uses. Then, despite a local vote and promises that it would be kept open, the hall was demolished in May 2006. The Pavilion and the Westover Road cinemas The Pavilion dates from 1925 and was built on the site of the former Belle Vue boarding house, one of the town's first buildings. Theatrical legends, including Ralph Richardson and Trevor Howard, played the Pavilion Theatre in its heyday. The Pavilion faces the cinemas and upmarket shops of Westover Road, which prides itself on being the town's \\"Bond Street\\". Westover Road's Odeon cinema began life as the Regent in 1929 and retains many of the art deco features of the era. It was known as the Gaumont from 1949–86 and used to host live performances as well as films. Stars who appeared there included Ella Fitzgerald, Dusty Springfield, Victor Borge and, in 1963, the Beatles. The cinema now has six screens. The nearby ABC cinema dates from 1937, when it contained one 2,600-seater auditorium. It has three auditoriums today, one of them boasting the areas largest cinema screen, and is capable of projecting epics in 70mm. Recent research has suggested that local residents, especially those of a younger demographic are keen to see a new live entertainment venue, easily accessible to the surrounding areas. Recent history The section of the coast both to the east and to the west of Bournemouth was very important during the Second World War. For example, Poole (Poole Harbour) was the departure point for many ships participating in the D-Day landings, and Studland Bay (just south of Poole) was the scene of practice live fire beach landings in preparation for the Normandy Landings. Bournemouth itself was not a main target of bombing during the war but was on the route for other raids (e.g. on Coventry) and German bombers were known to unload their spare bombs on the town; 219 civilians were killed by bombing during the war, 2,200 bombs dropped and almost 14,000 buildings damaged. During World War II a Bournemouth man lost his life when his Royal Air Force training airplane crashed in the United States. Local residents living near the site, in the State of Oklahoma, erected a monument in 2000 honoring the lives of all four RAF fliers who perished. The residents, who include Choctaw Indians and the Choctaw Nation government, continue honoring the lives of all four on each anniversary of the crashes, which took place in February 1943.AT6 Monument After the Second World War, Bournemouth saw a period of decline as a seaside resort and a tourist destination, similar to other resorts across England. However the population of the town and its surrounding suburbs continued to grow at a considerable rate. In 1880, the town had a population of 17,000 people. By 1900 this had risen to 60,000, and by 1990 it had more than doubled again, reaching 150,000. In the latest census, the town had a population of 163,441. Since the 1990s there have been increasing calls for the town, together with Poole, to attain official city status (as per the example of Brighton & Hove) due to its sheer expanse and regional importance. A local government reorganisation of county boundaries saw Bournemouth being moved from Hampshire to Dorset in 1974. In 1997, Bournemouth became a unitary authority. On 15 September 1980 Bournemouth was one of the first areas outside a major city to get its own independent radio station. 2CR FM broadcast from near Bournemouth railway station; its name, meaning 2 Counties' Radio, is derived from the fact that its broadcast area includes parts of the counties of Dorset and Hampshire. The town itself has continued to expand its business and tourist destination potential. The Bournemouth Eye, for example, is located in the Lower Gardens a few yards from the Square. It is a tethered helium-filled balloon in which the public can travel up to a height of five hundred feet, depending on the weather on any given day (in high winds it sometimes does not operate). There are good views to be obtained of the surrounding area, from the Isle of Wight round including the Purbeck Hills and Cranborne Chase. In the 1990s a leisure complex including an IMAX cinema was constructed on the sea front by Bournemouth Pier. The building itself proved deeply unpopular amongst locals for its lack of aesthetic quality and for blocking the sea view. It featured on and came second in Demolition, a 2005 Channel 4 programme asking the public to choose the building that they most wanted to demolish . Questions were asked of the Council about the cost of demolition as a result . The building was demolished in 2013 to create an outdoor public space. Bournemouth was the first local council in the UK to install CCTV cameras in public places, introducing them on the seafront in 1985. The original intention for using CCTV was to deter petty vandalism and crime however, with local authorities increasing reliant on parking penalties as a form of revenue; CCTV in Bournemouth is used to send fast response personnel in vans to ticket parking offenders within minutes of their violation. Recently, a new £9.5 million Bournemouth Library was completed in 2003, winning the Prime Minister's Better Public Building Award in the British Construction Industry Awards competition in recognition of its relatively low cost and high fit with client requirements. In recent years the town has attracted a high number of jobs in financial services, with JP Morgan Chase, Liverpool Victoria, Abbey Life and Portman Building Society all opening major offices. JP Morgan Chase has a large campus style office on the outskirts of the town in the Littledown area supplemented by further offices in the town centre, and employs over 4,000 people in the town. The financial sector is in fact the biggest source of income for Bournemouth, although a general misbelief is that the tourism sector is responsible for this. On 28 April 2015 A.F.C. Bournemouth gained promotion to the Premier League , marking their first time in the top tier of English football since their founding in 1899. February 2017: A new complex called BH2 opened in the town centre, housing a state of the art multiplex cinema, with an I-sense experience and other cinemas with reclining seats. The complex also houses at least 12 restaurants and an underground car park for up to 250 cars. This replaces both the Odeon and ABC cinemas in Westover Road, which have now closed.

It is a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). The Montana Lottery's portfolio consists of scratch tickets, plus Mega Millions, Powerball, Lotto America, Montana Millionaire, Lucky for Life, Big Sky Bonus, Montana Sports Action, Treasure Play and Montana Cash. The Montana Lottery was created by referendum in 1986. It passed by a wide margin and the Montana Lottery opened for business in June 1987. Since then, it has paid out at least $590 million to players in prizes, and has generated over $259 million for the State of Montana. In Montana, the minimum age to purchase a lottery ticket is 18. History The Montana Lottery was created by citizen referendum and passed on November 4, 1986 by 68.97% of voters. In 1995 the state legislature passed SB 83, which redirected lottery revenue earmarked for the Superintendent of Public Instruction to the General Fund as \\"part of a larger bill simplifying revenue allocations throughout state government.\\" On August 31, 2008, the Montana Lottery began fantasy sports wagering, called Montana Sports Action, which is offered under the authority of MCA 23-4, a law passed by the Montana Legislature in 2007 to help the Board of Horse Racing increase purses in Montana. The Board of Horse Racing may also use the funds raised in other ways to stimulate horse racing in Montana. The law requires that 74% of the money wagered be returned to players in prize payouts. The remaining 26% is shared between the establishments offering Montana Sports Action, the Board of Horse Racing, and the Montana Lottery. (Sports betting in the US also was legal in Delaware, Nevada, and Oregon prior to the Supreme Court ruling the Professional & Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) unconstitutional in May 2018, opening the door for other states to legalize sports betting.) The Montana legislature passed a law a Current draw games In-house draw games Montana Cash Montana Cash is played Wednesdays and Saturdays. It draws 5 numbers from 1 through 45.

Lucky for Life Lucky for Life is a lottery drawing game available in 23 states and the District Of Columbia. Players select 5 numbers from 1 through 48, and a green \\"Lucky Ball\\" numbered from 1 through 18. Lucky for Life, which began as a Connecticut-only game, Lucky-4-Life, has a top prize of $1,000-per-day-for-life, and a second prize of $25,000-per-year for life. (\\"Lifetime\\" winners can choose cash in lieu of the periodic payments.) Mega Millions On September 6, 1996, six lotteries began the-then The Big Game; it became Mega Millions in May 2002. Its jackpots begin at $15 million (annuitized with cash option.) Mega Millions draws 5 white balls numbered 1 through 75, and 1 gold-colored Mega Ball numbered 1 through 15. Most lotteries with either Mega Millions or Powerball prior to January 31, 2010 added the other game on that date. The Montana Lottery added Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, becoming the first lottery to add the \\"other\\" game after the official cross-selling expansion about a month prior. As with all Mega Millions members (except for California), Montana offers Mega Millions' multiplier, called Megaplier; it multiplies all non- jackpot prizes by up to 5x. A second-prize wager with \\"Megaplier\\" can win $5 million cash. Powerball Since 1989, the Montana Lottery has been a member of MUSL. Powerball began in April 1992.

The film is based on the Japanese mythology, specifically the birth of Shinto. Plot The film begins with the birth of twin princes. Their father, the emperor of Yamato, feels a great loathing for his one child Ousu. Being convinced that this feeling is a premonition, the emperor orders the shaman Tsukinowa to kill the boy, yet his efforts are spoiled by Amano Shiratori, the White Bird of the Heavens. The emperor's sister, seeing this as a clear sign of divine intervention, takes it upon herself to raise the child. Years later, when the boy has matured into a man, he is given pardon by his father and allowed to return to the castle. However, not long after, his mother falls ill and dies mysteriously. This sends his brother into a rage and causes him to attack Ousu, who defends himself and kills his sibling in the process. His father, furious at these events, orders his son to leave the castle and not return until the barbarians living in the Kumaso domain are dealt with. The prince makes haste to complete this task, stopping off at a shrine on his way where, after a quick battle, he befriends a young priestess named Oto who joins him on his journey. They, along with companions Genbu and Seriyu, raid the castle, killing Kumaso Takeru and their god Kumasogami. Following this feat, the prince changes his name to Yamato Takeru, yet fails to win the acceptance of his father. His aunt, though, warns him of a great threat looming overhead, as the god Tsukuyomi is poised to return, endangering the Earth. Yamato Takeru must prepare to halt this from occurring. She tells him to bring the enchanted Sword of Dark Clouds to her for safekeeping as it holds a good deal of the god's power. He secures the sword but is tricked by the shaman Tsukinowa, revealed as Tsukuyomi's acolyte, into surrendering it, thus inadvertently restoring the evil lunar deity to full power. Tsukinowa also reveals that it was he who killed Ousu's mother and brother to frame Ousu. A full eclipse falls over earth as the moon god blots out the light of the sun. Takeru is told by the deity Susano'o that his divinely ordained destiny is to destroy Tsukuyomi with the aid of Oto, who is the incarnation of the sun goddess Amaterasu. Susano'o tests him by having him pull a sword from a stone, and tells him that it is the only weapon that can kill Tsukuyomi. Together, Takeru and Oto are transported to the moon to face the evil god, who transforms himself into Orochi, the legendary eight-headed dragon. The young heroes are joined by Amano Shiratori in the form of a giant white phoenix, and riding the bird they launch an aerial attack on the dragon. The battle appears impossible and at one point it seems they have both lost their lives, but Oto, taking Takeru's hand, dissolves into light and gives him her life energy. He realizes that the prophecy - that he would become a warrior of the gods once he possessed three lights - has come true, as he now has the shrine mirror, the enchanted sword, and the solar light of Oto's spirit. Takeru transforms into a gigantic golden-armored warrior who fights and defeats the dragon. When Tsukuyomi falls, Oto is restored to life. Susano'o again appears and tells him to seal the moon god's spirit into his comma-shaped jewel, then cast it into the sky. The eclipse ends and the sun again shines on earth. As Takeru and Oto mount the White Bird to fly home to Earth, Takeru's father says he wants to see his son. Release Orochi, the Eight-Headed Dragon was distributed theatrically by Toho in Japan on 9 July 1994. The film was released in the United States as Orochi the Eight-Headed Dragon directly to home video by A.D. Vision with an English dub on June 13, 1999. The film was reissued in Japanese with English subtitles in 2003. Reception Robert Firsching of AllMovie awarded the film three and a half stars out of five, stating that \\"the film is firmly in the province of magical fantasy, and is quite a good example of the form.\\" describing it as a \\"really fun picture\\" that really stood out with its \\"wide-eyed innocence. Many films attempt to capture the look and feel of 1960s fantasy, but most fall prey to '90s cynicism and can't quite pull off the necessarily naïve belief in heroism and the power of goodness and purity to save mankind, or even that the belief that mankind is worth saving. This film does, and that alone makes it a refreshing throwback, and a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.\\" See also *Yamato Takeru (anime)  References  Footnotes Sources * External links * Category:1994 films Category:1990s fantasy films Category:1990s monster movies Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese fantasy adventure films Category:Fantasy adventure films Category:Sword and sorcery films Category:Toho tokusatsu films Category:Kaiju films Category:Giant monster films Category:Films directed by Takao Okawara Category:Films with screenplays by Wataru Mimura Category:Films based on Japanese myths and legends Category:Shinto in popular culture ","title":"Orochi, the Eight-Headed Dragon"},{"id":"10948574","text":"Gressy is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France.

In November 2016 Smithville Residents passed these bond questions: On November 8, 2016, voters in the Smithville School District was asked to consider two questions: (1) a no tax rate increase bond issue; and (2) a 79 cent increase levy issue. The no tax bond would provide $12.5 million in funds for renovations to Smithville Primary Elementary School, Smithville Upper Elementary School, Smithville Middle School and Smithville High School. In addition, the no tax bond would result in an expansion project at Smithville High School to provide much needed classroom and cafeteria spaces.

(The Puerto Rico Lottery has been in operation since 1934.) New Hampshire's games include Lucky for Life, Mega Millions, Powerball, Tri-State Megabucks, and numerous scratch tickets. New Hampshire is part of the Iowa-based Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), having joined it in 1995. New Hampshire is also a member of the Tri-State Lottery, whose other members are Maine and Vermont. Established in 1985, the Tri-State Lottery was the nation's first multi- jurisdictional lottery.National Association of State and Provincial Lotteries history section New Hampshire hosts these drawings. (Mega Millions draws are held in Georgia, while Powerball is drawn in Florida.) All New Hampshire Lottery games require players to be at least 18 years old. History The New Hampshire Sweepstakes was approved by the Legislature in 1963, at the urging of Representative Larry Pickett, from Keene, who had proposed the idea five times over the previous decade. The initial three-member Sweepstakes Commission was sworn into office on August 1, 1963. A special election, on March 10, 1964, allowed residents of New Hampshire's cities and towns to vote for or against the sale of Sweepstakes tickets. Only 12 towns out of 224 (New London, Canterbury, New Hampton, Brookfield, Dummer, Lyman, Monroe, Piermont, Hollis, Sharon, Durham and Madbury) voted against the measure, as did one of the 78 city wards (Ward 5 in Concord).\\"Only 12 Towns, 1 City Ward Said 'No' to Sweeps\\", Portsmouth (NH) Herald, March 17, 1964, p16 One author would later paraphrase this as \\"Only 13 of the state's 211 communities voted disapproval of the measure\\".Don Catlin, The Lottery Book: The Truth Behind the Numbers (Bonus Books, 2003) p.10 Sweepstakes tickets went on sale two days later, on March 12. Initially, the New Hampshire Sweepstakes was conducted by thoroughbred horse races at Salem's Rockingham Park, with the winning numbers based on the races, rather than simply drawing numbers from a barrel or using ping-pong balls, to avoid violating US anti-lottery statutes.National Association of State and Provincial Lotteries history section Tickets were sold mostly in New Hampshire's liquor stores. In September 2018, the New Hampshire Lottery offered online lottery products for the first time. Current draw games All of New Hampshire's draw games are shared with other lotteries, with the exception of Keno. Keno 603 New Hampshire's version of lottery keno, called \\"Keno 603\\" (the state's area code) launched on December 15, 2017. In-house Tri-State games These games are always drawn in New Hampshire: =Pick 3 and Pick 4= Pick 3 and Pick 4 are numbers games played twice daily, including Sundays. Prizes and options vary. =Megabucks Plus= The original Megabucks, a \\"classic\\" six-number game, began in 1985. Megabucks became Megabucks Plus on July 26, 2009. As with Mega Millions or Powerball, Megabucks Plus utilizes a 5+1 format; it draws 5 of 41 numbers from the first machine, and 1 of 6 from the second. Games cost $2; the minimum jackpot is $1,000,000. Drawings are Wednesdays and Saturdays. Multi- jurisdictional games Mega Millions Mega Millions became available in New Hampshire on January 31, 2010, the cross-selling expansion date whereby Powerball was made available in Mega Millions-only jurisdictions, and vice versa. The newest version of Mega Millions began in October 2013. Currently, players choose 5 of 75 \\"white balls\\" and 1 of 15 gold-colored \\"Mega Balls\\". Jackpots begin at $15 million. For an additional $1, the \\"Megaplier\\" can be activated; it multiplies non-jackpot winnings by up to 5. Mega Millions' format will change again on October 28, 2017. Among the changes is a $2 price point; Megaplier plays will be $3 each. Powerball New Hampshire joined Powerball in 1995. It is played in a similar fashion as Mega Millions. Lotto America (future) Lotto America was MUSL's first game, offered from 1988 to 1992. As New Hampshire did not join MUSL until 1995, this version of Lotto America was never offered there. The new version of Lotto America will begin on October 28, 2017, the day of the Mega Millions format change (see above.) New Hampshire is waiting until 2018 to join because it began its Keno game on December 15, 2017. Lucky for Life In 2009, the Connecticut Lottery began Lucky4Life. Three years later, it expanded to become a regional game, now called Lucky for Life, played in six states. (The original 4+1 double matrix is now 5+1; Lucky for Life drawings remain in Connecticut.) On September 17, 2013, changes included an annuitized second prize ($25,000-per- year-for-life); first- and second-prize winners now had the option of cash in lieu of lifetime payments. Lucky for Life, on January 25, 2015, became a quasi-national game. The most recent changes resulted in a 5/48 + 1/18 double matrix. As of April 2017, the game is offered in 22 states and the District of Columbia.

It was written by former Monty Python cast member Eric Idle and collaborator John Du Prez, and commissioned by the Luminato festival. Blu-ray release cover art Production With the success of Spamalot, Eric Idle's musical retelling of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Idle announced that he was giving Monty Python's Life of Brian a similar treatment. The oratorio, called Not the Messiah, was commissioned to be part of the Luminato arts festival in June 2007. It was written and scored by Idle and John Du Prez, who also worked with Idle on Spamalot. Not the Messiah is a spoof of Handel's oratorio Messiah. \\"If our [Life of] Brian was by Matthew then this is by John (but more John Lennon and John Du Prez).

It is a pastiche, reflecting pop, Welsh hymns, country and western, doo-wop, hip hop, Broadway, Greek chorus, and Bob Dylan (in his mumbling, electric guitar and harmonica phase, solo-ed by Idle). \\"Hail to the Shoe\\" is sung in the style of Handel's Hallelujah Chorus from the Messiah oratorio. The final song is the sing-along \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\", reflecting the British Music Hall tradition, but originally written for the Life of Brian. Premiere The oratorio had its world premiere in an hour-long performance at the Luminato festival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on 1 June 2007 in Roy Thomson Hall. It received its United States premiere on 1 July at Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts in Katonah, New York, during the International Music Festival.

On 24 July 2008 a performance was given at the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Northern Virginia, followed by a performance in Philadelphia at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts on 12 August 2008. At the premiere, Idle performed as a \\"baritone-ish\\" soloist and narrator as well as reprising some of his roles from the film, including Mr. Cheeky, a man in the crowd who asked if Mandy is a virgin, and the Lead Singer Crucifixee. The other soloists were Canadian bass-baritone Theodore Baerg, Canadian soprano Shannon Mercer (as Brian's lover Judith), American tenor Christopher Sieber (as Brian) and Canadian mezzo-soprano Jean Stilwell (as Brian's mother). Other active participants were the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Idle's cousin Peter Oundjian), members of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, and four stolid and kilted bagpipers in British 19th-century army regalia. (They were members of the 48th Highlanders of Canada Pipes and Drums.) The Toronto Symphony's involvement was no coincidence.

Amateur career Snipes was a two-time Chicago Golden Gloves Champion (1977 and 1978). He lost on a first-round stoppage to future heavyweight contender Eddie Gregg in the 1978 Intercity match-ups between Chicago and New York Golden Glove winners.  Professional career  Nicknamed \\"Mister\\" Snipes, Snipes started off his career successfully, with a first-round knockout of Carl Halliburton. That fight was on the same card that future heavyweight contender James Tillis made his debut on. 21 more wins followed, and he challenged world heavyweight champion Larry Holmes for the title November 6, 1981 in Pittsburgh. Snipes knocked down the champion in the seventh round. However Holmes got up and Snipes was stopped in Round 11. Snipes complained that Holmes was the beneficiary of a long count.Renaldo Snipes Came This Close  TheSweetScience.com Boxing Films show, however, that the claim is exaggerated; Holmes rose at the count of 4 and though badly hurt, fought off the charging Snipes for the remainder of the round. Snipes fought a string of world-class fighters after the Holmes bout, in contests that mostly descended into wildly entertaining brawls. He amassed a record of 39 wins (22 by knockout), 8 losses, and 1 draw. In his career he fought boxers Trevor Berbick, Gerrie Coetzee, Tim Witherspoon, Greg Page, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, Alfredo Evangelista, South African puncher Johnny DuPlooy and many more. Tyson fight Snipes had been in the frame for a big money fight with Mike Tyson in 1990, however he broke his right hand in a fight with rugged journeyman Jamie Howe and lost out on the opportunity, which later went to Alex Stewart. The injury and rehabilitation took him out for two years, and when he returned in June 1992 (aged 36) he fought then-dangerous Garing Lane, surviving an 8th- round count to score a split decision win. He knocked out Eddie Curry the following year before being matched with heavily hyped Cuban giant Jorge Luis Gonzalez on the high-profile Bowe/Holyfield II undercard. At 37, Snipes struggled with the bigger younger man, and after a gallant effort was stopped with 40 seconds remaining in the 10th and final round, much to his disgust.

The population is about 1000. The North Beaver Fire Department, municipal buildings, Mount Jackson Presbyterian Church, and a recycling center are located there. History In 1815 pioneering settler John Nesbit laid out the village of Mount Jackson in North Beaver Township, in what later became Lawrence County, Pennsylvania. He named the settlement in honor of U.S. Army General Andrew “Old Hickory” Jackson, recent hero of the War of 1812 – who later ascended to serve as the President of the United States from 1829-1837. The small village grew with a post office, a school, several stores and mills, and two Presbyterian churches. According to Our Legacy, a history book written by Don Fox in 1990, Major Edward Wright is credited as being the earliest known resident. The early settlers were primarily Scotch-Irish and Presbyterian. John Nesbit founded Mount Jackson. He laid out the town on his share of a farm in about 1815. The law then required that in order for the town to be incorporated, it needed a post office so application was made to the state Legislature. A stage line went through Mount Jackson to Enon Valley. For some years this was the only way for people of New Castle to travel on the train, as Enon Valley was the end of the tracks and the only station in the area. North Beaver Township had been formed in 1810 and Mount Jackson was widely accepted as the focal point of the township. The first house on the town plot was built by William Henry, who had been living on Hickory Creek, a short distance from town. He also was the first postmaster. George Eckles was the first blacksmith. But even into the 1940s, there were still blacksmiths around Joseph Hughes opened the first wagon shop and Benjamin Wells was the first shoemaker. Another home was used as a tavern. While those faded from view a long time ago, a few businesses such as Miller's Furniture Barn and Wes's Heating and Cooling remain as do Mount Jackson Presbyterian and Westfield Presbyterian churches. A number of roads in Mount Jackson are named after war heroes.

High school career Roberts attended St. Anthony High School in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he was coached by the legendary Bob Hurley. As a freshman in 1999–2000, the Friars went 19–7 on the season. During his sophomore campaign, the team went 27–3 but Roberts missed the season with a leg injury. As a junior in 2001–02, Roberts averaged 10.1 points and 8.0 rebounds for a Friars team that posted a 29–1 mark and finished ranked second in the nation. He earned honorable mention all-state laurels and was a member of the 2002 USADevelopment Festival East Team that finished 3–2 and earned a silver medal. As a senior in 2002–03, Roberts averaged 17 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks a game. He participated in the New Jersey North-South High School All-Star contest and had eight points and a game-high 10 rebounds. He also claimed the slam dunk contest at the event, and later helped St. Anthony claimed the 2003 New Jersey Tournament of Champions.

With Hakim Warrick's departure from Syracuse following the 2004–05 season, Roberts started all 35 games for the Orange as a junior, averaging a career-high 10.7 points per game, in addition to being Syracuse's leading rebounder with 7.6 boards per game. The highlight of his season came against Rutgers University on February 1, 2006. Down by one with under 7.6 seconds left in overtime, Roberts, who had hit only 3 three-pointers in his first two seasons at Syracuse, drained a buzzer-beating shot to give Syracuse an 86–84 win. Roberts was named to the preseason All-BIG EAST Conference team prior to the start of his senior season. However, he failed to live up to expectations during the regular season, partially due to a knee injury that bothered him for most of the campaign. He started all 33 games he appeared in as a senior, and his 8.1 rebound average topped the squad. Roberts had at least one rebound in 119 of his 127 career games. In 127 games over his four-year career at Syracuse, Roberts averaged 7.6 points and 5.6 rebounds in 22.9 minutes per game. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2007 NBA draft, Roberts moved to Greece where he joined Rethymno BC. However, he left the club before appearing in any games for them. For the 2008–09 season, Roberts moved to Israel. Early on in the season, he had two short stints with Elitzur Kiryat Ata and Ironi Ramat Gan before leaving the country in December. In January 2009, he signed with U BT Cluj-Napoca of Romania for the rest of the season. In 15 games for Cluj-Napoca, he averaged 10.3 points and 5.7 rebounds per game. In September 2009, Roberts signed with the Saitama Broncos for the 2009–10 bj league season. The Broncos struggled during the season and Roberts felt the team \\"under-achieved\\". In 48 games for Saitama in 2009–10, he averaged 11.8 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 1.1 steals per game. In September 2010, Roberts signed with Ferro-ZNTU of the Ukraine for the 2010–11 season. However, he left the club in November after appearing in eight league games. In December 2010, he signed with Jordanian club ASU Sports Club for the 2011 West Asian Basketball League. Then in April 2011, he joined Marinos de Anzoátegui of Venezuela for a three-game stint. In November 2011, Roberts was acquired by the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA Development League following a successful tryout with the team. Between December 9 and December 12, Roberts spent three days with the Oklahoma City Thunder during training camp in the lead up to the 2011–12 NBA season. He returned to the D-Fenders following this stint, but was later waived by the team on December 28 due to an injury. In 11 games for the D-Fenders, he averaged 6.9 points and 3.9 rebounds per game. In December 2012, Roberts signed with Busan KT Sonicboom of the Korean Basketball League. He appeared in just four games for the club before departing Korea in mid-January 2013. On February 16, 2016, Roberts signed with the Super City Rangers for the 2016 New Zealand NBL season. He made his debut for the Rangers in the team's season opener against the Wellington Saints on March 10. In just under 27 minutes of action as the starting center, Roberts recorded nine points, six rebounds and four blocks in a 116–95 loss. On April 16, he had a season-best game with 25 points and 13 rebounds in 29½ minutes of action off the bench in a 111–100 win over the Nelson Giants. He subsequently earned Player of the Week honors for Round 6. The Rangers finished the regular season in fourth place with a 9–9 record. In their semi-final match against the first-seeded Canterbury Rams on June 3, Roberts tied his season high with 25 points to help guide the Rangers to a 104–85 win. The win advanced the Rangers to the final on June 4, where they were outclassed by the Wellington Saints, losing the match 94–82. Roberts appeared in all 20 games for the Rangers in 2016, averaging 11.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game. In September 2016, Roberts joined the Wellington Saints for their Asia Basketball Club Championships campaign in Seoul, South Korea. In 2017, Roberts had short stints in Bolivia (Calero de Potosi) and Qatar (Al Shamal).

It also appears to have had a statistically significant effect of reducing breast cancer in women according to a study published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Medical uses Osteoporosis In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, lasofoxifene at a dose of 0.5 mg per day was associated with reduced risks of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures, ER-positive breast cancer, coronary heart disease, and stroke but an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events. Breast cancer In studies of breast cancer prevention, lasofoxifene showed a 79% reduction in breast cancer incidence and an 83% reduction specific incidence of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers, which is significantly higher than reductions found with the related SERMs tamoxifen and raloxifene. In accordance, a network meta-analysis of SERMs for breast cancer prevention found the highest reduction in risk with lasofoxifene of all the drugs. The reduction was even greater than that observed with aromatase inhibitors, which have generally been found to confer a greater risk reduction than SERMs.It also has shown promise in ESR1 mutant patients with 'approximately 40% of patients harboring this mutation'. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Lasofoxifene selectively binds to both ERα and ERβ with high affinity. Its IC50 for ERα (1.5 nM) is similar to that of estradiol (4.8 nM) and is at least 10-fold higher than those of tamoxifen and raloxifene. Pharmacokinetics Lasofoxifene has greatly improved oral bioavailability relative to tamoxifen and raloxifene, and this may also be involved in its greater potency. Chemistry Lasofoxifene is a naphthalene derivative and a desmethyl dihydro analogue of nafoxidine. History In September 2005, Pfizer received a non-approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding lasofoxifene (trade name Oporia), a selective estrogen receptor modulator for the prevention of osteoporosis. On January 2008, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, through its marketing partner, Pfizer, submitted a New Drug Application for lasofoxifene, which is expected to be marketed under the tradename Fablyn. Lasofoxifene was approved in the EU under the brand name Fablyn by the EMEA in March 2009. Research Lasofoxifene is under development by Sermonix Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and dyspareunia associated with vaginal atrophy in the United States and Europe.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800007522 It is also being researched for the potential treatment of ovarian cancer. As of December 2017, lasofoxifene is in phase III clinical trials for breast cancer and phase II clinical studies for dyspareunia.

Academic career  He was the eldest son of pastor Karl Hermann Kupffer (1797-1860). In 1854, he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Dorpat, where shortly afterwards he served as an assistant to Friedrich Heinrich Bidder (1810-1894). In 1856-57 he took a scientific journey to Vienna, Berlin and Göttingen, an extended trip in which he studied physiology with Emil Du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896) and Johannes Peter Müller (1801-1858). Afterwards, he returned to Dorpat, where he later became an associate professor. In 1866 he was appointed chair of anatomy at the University of Kiel, and several years later relocated to Königsberg (1875) as a professor of anatomy. From 1880 until his retirement in 1901, Kupffer held the chair of anatomy at the University of Munich.  Scientific research  Kupffer is largely known for his work in the fields of neuroanatomy and embryology. He conducted studies on the development of the brain, spleen, pancreas and kidneys, also performing research involving innervation of exocrine gland and doing investigations on early differentiation of mesoderm. While Bidder's assistant at Dorpat, he studied structures of the central nervous system, and during his tenure at Königsberg, he had the opportunity to examine the cranium of philosopher Immanuel Kant. In regards to his discovery of \\"Kupffer cells\\" in 1876, he initially suggested that this type of cell belonged to a group of perivascular cells (pericytes) of the connective tissues or to the adventitial cells. Two decades later (1898), he revised his earlier analysis, stating that the cells form an essential component of the vascular walls and correlate to the specific cells of endothelium, capable of phagocytising foreign materials.The Global and the Local: The History of Science and the Cultural Integration of Europe.

Gabon is a largely low-lying country with a warm, humid climate. Much of the country is still covered by tropical rainforest and there are also grasslands, savannas, large rivers and coastal lagoons. Overview Plant growth is rapid and dense. About 85 percent of the country is covered by tropical humid forest. The dense green of the vegetation never changes, since the more than 6,000 species of plants flower and lose their leaves continuously throughout the year according to species. Tree growth is especially rapid; some trees tower as high as 60 m, and the trunks are thickly entwined with vines. There are about 300 species of trees. In the coastal regions, marine plants abound, and wide expanses are covered with tall papyrus grass. Wildlife includes forest elephants, buffalo, various antelope and monkey species, sitatungas, leopards, three species of crocodiles, chimpanzees and gorillas, and several marine turtle species which nest along the coast. As of 2002, there were at least 190 species of mammals. Fauna Forest elephants Mammals Gabon has important populations of many mammals including about 35,000 gorillas, 50,000 forest elephants and 64,000 common chimpanzees. About a quarter of Africa's gorillas live in Gabon. Other large mammals include the hippopotamus, forest buffalo, bongo and red river hog. A variety of monkeys occur, including the endemic Sun-tailed monkey, and the near-endemic mandrill and white-collared managabey (here near- endemic meaning most of the individuals of these species are in Gabon, but that they also occur in the neighbouring countries as well). . Carnivorous mammals include the leopard, golden cat, and various jackals, mongooses, genets and civets. The last lion was killed in 1996 in the savannahs of the east of the country. The West African manatee is found along coasts and large rivers while the humpback whale breeds offshore. Birds Hartlaub's duck There are 604 species of birds throughout the country (data from BirdLife International, 2013). None of these are endemic but some such as the Dja River warbler, Verreaux's batis, African river martin and black-chinned weaver are restricted to Central Africa and have only small ranges. The grey-necked picathartes and Loango weaver are classed as vulnerable species by the IUCN. Reptiles A variety of snakes are found including the Gaboon viper. Sea turtles breed along the coast, particularly the leatherback turtle. Mangroves such as Rhizophora mangle line parts of the coast. Flora There are over 7000 species of native vascular plant in Gabon. About 22% of these are endemic. New species are still being discovered such as the tree Cola lizae which was first described in 1987. Conservation Wildlife in Gabon faces a number of threats including logging and poaching. However 11% of the country's area is now protected in a recently established (September 2002) network of 13 national parks. References *African Bird Club (2008) Birds and birding in Gabon.

Biography Rajendra Krishan was born in a Duggal family at Jalalpur Jattan on 6 June 1919, in Gujrat District (in present-day Pakistan). Even when he was studying in the eighth class he was attracted towards poetry. In his early work life he had a clerk's job in the municipal office in Simla, where he toiled up to 1942. During that period, he read eastern and western authors extensively and wrote poetry. He expresses his indebtedness to the Urdu poetry of Firaq Gorakhpuri and Ahsan Danish, as well as to the Hindi poems of Pant and Nirala. In those days the newspapers in the Delhi-Punjab brought out special supplements and held poetry contests to mark Krishna Janmashtami, in which he participated regularly. In the mid-1940s, Krishan shifted to Bombay (now Mumbai) to become a screenwriter in the Hindi film industry. His first screenplay was Janta (1947). His first film as a lyricist was Zanjeer (1947). He was first noted for the script and lyrics of the Motilal-Suraiya starrer Aaj Ki Rat (1948). After the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, Krishan wrote a song Suno Suno Aye Duniyawalon, Bapu Ki Yeh Amar Kahani. The song was sung by Mohammed Rafi and composed by Husnlal Bhagatram, and was a great hit. He also tasted success as a lyricist with the films Badi Bahen (1949) and Lahore (1949). Rajendra Krishna is known for his association with the composer C. Ramchandra. He worked with several other music directors including Shankar- Jaikishan, Ravi, Rajesh Roshan, Madan Mohan, Hemant Kumar, Sajjad Hussain, Sachin Dev Burman, Rahul Dev Burman, S. Mohinder, Chitragupta, Salil Chowdhury, and Laxmikant–Pyarelal. He died on 23 September 1987 in Mumbai. After his death, HMV brought out an LP containing 12 of his songs. Trivia Rajendra Krishan was considered the richest writer in Hindi cinema. The reason was that he had won a jackpot worth 4,600,000 rupees in horse racing. The sum was considered a huge amount during the late seventies. Awards Rajendra Krishan won Filmfare Award for best lyricist for the movie Khandan (1965) for the song \\"Tumhi mere mandir, tumhi meri pooja\\".

Biodiversity Fungi Ghana is home to a significant number of fungi species including: Aspergillus flavus; Athelia rolfsii; Auricularia auricula-judae; Curvularia; Fusarium oxysporum; Fusarium solani f.sp. pisi; Gibberella intricans; Gibberella stilboides; and Macrophomina phaseolina. The true total number of fungal species occurring in Ghana is in the thousands and given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7 percent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered and that the amount of available information is still very small. Flora The flora of Ghana is diverse with both indigenous and introduced floral species considered in Ghana's floral diversity. A total of some 3,600 species of the major regional centres of endemism represent the three major taxonomic groups. Floral diversity is more pronounced among the angiosperms represented with well over 2,974 indigenous and 253 introduced species in Ghana. Among the various vegetation types of the tropical rain forest, it is the wet evergreen forest type in the southwestern Ashanti-Kwahu Plain that exhibits the highest level of endemism and species richness in Ghana. Flora species diversity and endemism in the savanna biomes in Ghana is very sparse and biological diversity of species in the Ghanaian savanna woodlands and gallery forests of the savannas show greater species richness than the dry savannas. Within Ghana, there are areas of high biological diversity, referred to as prime biological locations; such as the Ankasa and Nini-Suhien Conservation Area in the southwestern Ashanti- Kwahu erea terrestrial plain of Ghana, in where the climatic diversity is greater. There are also Encephalartos barteri, and gymnosperm indigenous to Ghana; others growing in various Ghanaian ecological zones are introduced species for purposes including aesthetics and economic. The third taxonomic group; pteridophytes, is well represented in Ghana with 124 known species. Fauna Yellow-casqued wattled hornbill Kobus ellipsiprymnus Ghana has a vast array of fauna and they are of great significance, as some of Ghana's fauna have attained conservation status because of the current rate of decline in their number and distribution. The fauna of the Ghanaian terrestrial ecosystem, comprise a diverse array of species including several of conservation concern. Ghanaian records show that there is as many as 221 species of amphibians and reptiles, 724 species of birds, 225 mammalian species inhabiting Ghana; with 93 recorded to be inhabiting the Ghanaian savanna ecological zone. As with floral diversity, prime locations for faunal diversity is located in the Ghanaian high forest uplands; accounting for 83% of the total number of butterfly species recorded in Ghana, where canopy stratification and micro-climatic differentiation have provided habitats and niches for specific faunal organisms. Endemism among Ghanaian terrestrial fauna has been observed in three species of frogs; Hyperolius baumanni; Hyperolius fusciventris; and Hyperolius sylvaticus; and the lizards; and Agama sylvanus found in the Ghanaian Bia Forest Reserve and the Atwema Range Forest Reserve. Ghana has a high degree of butterfly endemism where more than 20 species are classified endemic or near-endemic. Ghana is home to 84 known amphibian species: 78 frogs, 5 toads and caecilians. Threatened species recorded in Ghana include four species of marine turtles and three species of crocodiles. Bird species of conservation concern include seven threatened species, including four species endemic to the Upper Guinea forest block and seven near-threatened species. Keystone species such as hornbills, parrots and birds of prey (eagles) are well represented in Ghana. Of the 728 birds species confirmed to be occurring in Ghana; 408 are non-passerines and 320 passerines, of which 498 are known or thought to be resident and 176 are regular seasonal bird migrants, including 100 from the Palearctic realm. Of the total number of species occurring; 180 restricted to the Guinea-Congo forests biome and 37 restricted to the Sudan-Guinea savanna biome have been recorded in Ghana.Ntiamoa-Baidu et al, 2001; Ntiamoa-Baidu et al, 2000 a & b. Retrieved 15 June 2013. Eleven of the 15 endemic bird species within the Upper Guinea forest occur in Ghana. Six of the total species are considered threatened and 12 are near-threatened.BirdLife International, 2000. Retrieved 15 June 2013. Ghana is an important country for dozens of vulnerable, threatened, endangered, critically endangered or near-extinct mammalian species including the primates common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and western red colobus (Piliocolobus badius), the big cats lion (Panthera leo) and leopard (Panthera pardus), African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), and water-birds, being located on the boundary of the east Atlantic Ocean Flyway and Mediterranean Flyway. There are also several rare terrestrial birds, such as the white- necked rockfowl (Picathartes gymnocephalus).Smit and Peirsma, 1989; Ntiamoa- Baidu et al, 2001. Retrieved 15 June 2013.

Nelson played quarterback and defensive back for then Memphis State University. A four-year letterman (1952–1956), he gained All-American recognition in his senior season. In 1956, he led the Tigers to their first-ever bowl game, the Burley Bowl in Johnson City, Tennessee, where they were victorious over East Tennessee State. Professional career Nelson was drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the eleventh round of the 1957 NFL Draft. Having played both quarterback and defensive back in college, the Colts made him a defensive player. Nelson started 12 games his rookie season, with 5 interceptions for 29 yards. The following season, Nelson would record 8 interceptions for 199 yards and 1 touchdown. The Colts would go on to win the NFL Championship in what was the NFL's first sudden-death overtime game and has since become widely known as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\". The Colts would repeat in 1959 and over his seven-year career with the Colts, Nelson would rack up 33 total interceptions for 378 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Colts traded Nelson to the New York Giants for the 1964 season, his last in the NFL. Coaching career Nelson spent two years as a player and defensive coach with the Harrisburg Capitols of the Atlantic Coast Football League, the Colts' farm team, where he led the league in pass defense before going on to be named the head football coach. Nelson went on to become Defensive Coordinator for the Norfolk Neptunes, winning a league championship in 1971, and then the Chambersburg Cardinals of the Seaboard Football League, winning another championship in 1973. Nelson was also defensive coordinator for Philadelphia Bell in the World Football League from 1974–75. Awards Nelson was voted into the Limestone County Hall of Fame (2003) in Alabama and the Memphis State Hall of Fame (1976).

He is the former member of National Assembly (MNA) for the riding of Louis-Hebert in the Quebec City region. Member of the Quebec Liberal Party, he was the Minister for Transports and he was also the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labour and Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region Biography Early years and education Born in Damascus, Syria, Hamad moved to Quebec City and studied civil engineering at Université Laval where he received both a bachelor's and master's degree. He also studied at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières where he obtained a master's degree in management. His birth name was Sammy Hamed-Allah but he changed it when he moved to Quebec, saying that Sammy sounded too much like French words \\"sa mère\\" (meaning \\"his mother\\"). Career He was an administration member for the Ordre des Ingénieurs du Québec for nine years, while he was also a lecturer at Université Laval and the Université du Québec à Rimouski and the President of the Quebec Board of Trade and Industry. He was also involved in the community, being the vice-president of Centraide-Quebec a board member of the Laval Hospital Foundation. He was also part of several associations promoting development in the region including the GATIQ which promoted advance technologies and innovations for the region. Before making his foray into politics, Hamed was Vice-President of Groupe Roche, an influential engineering firm, from 1998 to 2003. Politics Hamed entered politics in 2003, where he became the MNA for Louis-Hebert as the Liberals led by Jean Charest defeated the Parti Québécois. He would be named Minister of Wildlife, Natural Resources and Parks and the Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale (Quebec) region. He was removed from Cabinet in 2005 after he was criticized in regard to a project which would have added a new thermo plant in the Suroit region. Hamad was narrowly re-elected in 2007. Initially, it was thought that the Action démocratique du Québec won the seat but late ballots pushed Hamad to a late-victory and no recounts were made. As he was only one of two Liberal MNAs elected in the Quebec City region (the other being Philippe Couillard), Hamad was named the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity until where he was named Minister of Transports, swapping portfolios with Julie Boulet. Briefly in 2010, he also held the Labour portfolio after David Whissell resigned his position following conflict of interest allegations. He returned to the Labour portfolio on April 23, 2014. He announced his resignation as an MNA on April 27, 2017.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/sam-hamad- resignation-1.4088140 References External links * Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Quebec Category:Canadian people of Syrian descent Category:Francophone Quebec people Category:People from Damascus Category:Quebec Liberal Party MNAs Category:Syrian emigrants to Canada Category:Université Laval alumni Category:Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières alumni Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:Canadian politicians of Syrian descent ","title":"Sam Hamad"},{"id":"10949060","text":"The 52nd Annual Tony Awards ceremony was held on June 7, 1998, at Radio City Music Hall and was broadcast by CBS television.

This West African nation has a long Atlantic coastline and a range of habitat types, with a corresponding diversity of plants and animals. Liberia is considered a biodiversity hotspot and has more intact forests characteristic of the Upper Guinea Massif than do neighbouring countries. There are 2000 species of vascular plants (including 225 tree species), approximately 140 species of mammals, and over 600 species of birds. Geography The country lies close to the equator with a long coastline on the Atlantic Ocean. The terrain consists of flat or undulating coastal plains, which rise to a rolling plateau and low mountains in the northeast. A number of short rivers flow from northeast to southwest. The coastal area is characterised by swamps and mangrove forests, while inland the tropical forests give way to grassland on the drier plateau area. The climate is equatorial with some rain all year round but the main rainy season falling between May and October. Most of the coastal area receives about of rain per year but this decreases inland, with the northern part of the country being the driest, with just half the coastal rainfall. The coastal area west of Monrovia is forested and has coastal swamps and lagoons, and there are swamps around the lagoon of Bassa Bwa, but there are no substantial wetlands inland. Biodiversity Liberia can be considered a biodiversity hotspot and has the highest remaining portion of the forests of the Upper Guinea Massif, containing many species endemic to the region. This humid coastal forest ecosystem extends from Liberia through Cote d‘Ivoire, Ghana and Sierra Leone to Togo, and is under threat from deforestation and coastal development. Liberia has more than 2000 species of vascular plant including 225 timber tree species, 140 species of mammal, over 600 species of bird and 75 species of reptile and amphibian.  Flora  A Liberian tropical forest Two main types of forest are found in Liberia. Evergreen forests in the south east of the country, which has very high rainfall, are characterised by dense vegetation with trees of varying heights. Sapo National Park exemplifies this forest type, and contains many endemic species. Moist semi-deciduous forest is found in the central and northwestern parts of the country with slightly lower rainfall. This has a more even height and a more open aspect. In 2009 it was estimated that forest cover amounted to about 32% of the country's area. There are eleven partially protected national forests. Patches of mangrove occur along the coast and near the mouth of many rivers, often lining the banks of the rivers' lower reaches. Mangrove ecosystems are important for biodiversity, as a habitat for crustaceans and young fish, for flood control and erosion control. However, mangroves are threatened by overharvesting for charcoal and firewood, and already there are few remaining areas of primary forest. Fauna Mammals Red river hog The pygmy hippopotamus occurs in riverine forests inland, for example those beside the Lofa, Cestos and Cavalla Rivers. Liberia is its main habitat, with smaller populations in neighbouring countries. The African manatee also occurs along the coast and in many of the river systems. Other mammals found in the forests are leopards, monkeys, chimpanzees, antelopes, elephants and anteaters. The Liberian mongoose is probably the rarest mammal, none having been seen for years until one was captured in 1989; it is hunted for bushmeat and classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. The red river hog is much more common. Sapo National Park hosts around 125 species of mammal. These include the African golden cat, the drill, seven species of monkey, Gola malimbe and the Liberian mongoose. The park is also home to the African civet, giant forest hog, speckle-throated otter, seven species of duiker, the water chevrotain and three species of pangolins. Birds White-backed vulture As of 2016, the number of bird species recorded in Liberia is 695, some resident and some migratory, with 21 of them being globally threatened. These rare species include the white-backed vulture, the hooded vulture and the Balearic shearwater. Lake Piso, a coastal lagoon, is one of five wetland sites in the country which have been designated as Ramsar sites. Some of the larger birds found in the rainforest are parrots, woodpeckers and hornbills. Flamingoes are found in the coastal swamps and lagoons. Other resident species are the black-collared lovebird, the blue- headed wood-dove, the white-breasted guineafowl and the white-necked rockfowl. The pepper bird (Pycnonotus barbatus) is the national bird.Blain, Keisha N., and Tiffany M. Gill, eds. To turn the whole world over : black women and internationalism. Urbana: U of Illinois P, 2019, 162. Around 590 species of bird have been recorded in Sapo National Park. These include the white- breasted guineafowl and white-necked rockfowl, the African fish eagle, the African grey parrot, the great blue turaco, the woodland kingfisher, egrets, hornbills, bee-eaters, rollers and sunbirds. Reptiles and amphibians Bitis rhinoceros The Nile crocodile and the dwarf crocodile occur in the coastal mangrove swamps but are rare, while the West African crocodile occurs further inland and is relatively common. There are a wide variety of lizards, chameleons, geckos and snakes, including Bitis rhinoceros, a venomous viper endemic to West Africa, slender tree snakes that feed on birds and their eggs, and blind snakes in the genus Typhlops. Six species of turtle are found in Liberia, three marine and three freshwater, although one of the latter, the forest hinge-back tortoise is largely terrestrial. With the high rainfall, amphibians are plentiful in the country, and include several genera endemic to the region including Silurana, Hymenochirus and Pseudhymenochirus. Other frogs native to Liberia include the African common toad, the western clawed frog, and the crowned bullfrog. A number of species of tree frog live in the foliage of trees, and the worm-like caecilian Geotrypetes seraphini inhabits ants' nests. Fish Freshwater fish found in the lakes, rivers, streams and brackish swamps of Liberia include the African brown knifefish, the Guinean killifish, the Jeanpol's killi, the Norman's lampeye, the Rancurel's lampeye and the banded lampeye. The rough-head sea catfish occurs in brackish and marine habitats and is of interest to fisheries. Other commercially-fished species are the Madeiran and round sardinellas, the Spanish mackerel, the bonga, and the European anchovy, and large quantities of shrimps and lobsters are brought ashore.  Butterflies and moths  About 530 species of butterfly are known to be from Liberia,African Butterfly Database one of which is endemic.Afrotropical Butterflies Conservation Like other West African nations, Liberia is experiencing destruction of its native forests and a resulting decrease in biodiversity. The main conservation threats are the replacement of forests by rubber plantations, and more recently by oil palm plantations, mining, lumbering, unsustainable firewood collection, charcoal production, the introduction of alien species, slash and burn cultivation practices and the uncontrolled hunting and harvesting of wild animals and plants. An action plan, running from 2017 to 2027, has been put in place which is designed to educate the populace in order to \\"promote the conservation and sustenance of Liberia‘s rich biological diversity, resources and culture\\".

It is a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). Fifty percent of all net funds is given to public schools, while the remainder is pledged to the Permanent Building Fund, which is used as a financial resource for the state's colleges and universities. The Idaho Lottery offers the multi-state drawing games Mega Millions, Powerball, Hot Lotto, and Wild Card (all but Mega Millions are directly run by MUSL); and a daily game, Idaho Pick 3. Drawings for Pick 3 are nightly, including Sundays; Hot Lotto, Wild Card, and Powerball are Wednesdays and Saturdays, while Mega Millions is drawn Tuesday and Fridays. The minimum age to play the Idaho Lottery is 18. The Lottery also offers approximately 50 instant Scratch GamesTM yearly. Price points range from $1 to $30. PullTabs are offered in social settings, such as restaurants, bars, and bowling centers; its price points are 25 cents to one dollar. History The Idaho Supreme Court handed down a decision in late 1953 that eliminated all forms of casino gaming in the state, most notably slot machines. Nearly three decades later In January 1983, a proposal for a state lottery was defeated quickly in committee in the legislature. Almost four years later, the lottery initiative was approved by voters in but was declared unconstitutional the following March by district judge a future chief justice of the state supreme court. His decision was upheld by the Idaho Supreme Court, and resulted in an amendment to the state constitution. Voters approved that in November and a mere 200 days later, a lottery industry record at the time, the Idaho Lottery began on Since its beginning, the Lottery has sold more than $1.8 billion in tickets and returned more than $437.3 million to Idaho public schools and buildings. Three bordering states began lottery play in the 1980s, prior to Idaho's launch: Washington (1982), Oregon (1985), and Montana (1987). Wyoming began play in its lottery in 2014, while Nevada and Utah remain without. To the north in Canada, British Columbia also has lottery games. Current draw games In- house draw games Bingo Idaho Bingo is drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays at 7:59 pm Mountain Time, and games are five dollars each. Each drawing consists of 30 numbers, 01 through 75; the top prize is $100,000, won by matching the eight numbers forming a \\"diamond\\" and the four numbers on each side of the \\"free space.\\" Pick 3 Idaho Pick 3 is drawn twice a day, seven days a week; play styles and prizes vary. Weekly Grand Weekly Grand is drawn twice a week. Games are $2 each; the top prize is $1000 a week for a year, taxes paid; however, there is no cash option. Non-winning tickets can be entered in a monthly draw for $100 a week, also without a cash option. The \\"second chance\\" drawings have become controversial for a second reason; if a potential winner is disqualified, the $100-per-week prize is not paid. Weekly Grand is a rare example of a pick-5 game with an annuitized prize, as well as an increasingly rare example of any lottery game without a cash option. (A game with a similar top prize was available in Arizona's Weekly Winnings; however, it had a cash option of $52,000 \\"taxes paid\\" in lieu of the weekly payments.) Multi-jurisdictional games Lotto America Lotto America (a different version than offered from 1988 to 1992) replaced the multi-state Hot Lotto in October 2017. (Hot Lotto was unrelated to an Idaho- only game by that name.) Lotto America is available in 13 states, including Idaho. Lucky for Life Lucky for Life, which began as a Connecticut- only game in 2009 called Lucky4Life, became a regional game three years later. A later version, which began in 2013, added a cash option for its top prize ($1000-per-day-for-life) and a second-prize \\"lifetime\\" tier of $25,000-per- year. Both \\"lifetime\\" prizes offer a cash option (Weekly Grand, see above, does not offer a cash option for its top prize.) On January 27, 2015, Lucky for Life added eight states, including Idaho. The game was modified to its current double matrix (5 of 48 white balls, and 1 of 18 green \\"Lucky Balls\\"); Ten states plus the District of Columbia have joined in addition (25 lotteries as of June 2018.) Mega Millions On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions and Powerball became available to lotteries which previously offered either game. Idaho joined Mega Millions on the above date, as part of the games' cross-sell expansion. Mega Millions is drawn Tuesdays and Fridays; its games are $2 each, or $3 with the Megaplier option. Mega Millions' minimum jackpot is $40 million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments unless the cash option is chosen. Mega Millions is offered in 44 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball Idaho has been a member of MUSL since 1990. Powerball began in 1992; its cash option began in 1997, and Power Play was added in 2001. The current version of Powerball began on January 15, 2012. Games are $2 each, or $3 with Power Play. The game is drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays; Powerball jackpots begin at $40 million. 2009 fiscal year In FY 2009, the Idaho Lottery set a sales record on the way to grossing nearly $140 million. It also set a dividend record by returning a profit of $35 million to the people of Idaho, the sixth consecutive year for returning a record dividend. Players won a record $84.9 million in prizes, and retailers received a record $8.3 million in commissions. FY 2009 sales by product were: { class= !Game !!

This amount in FY 2009 was approximately 60%. The next largest share of revenue is the annual dividend, which by statute is split equally between Idaho’s public schools and permanent buildings, including college campuses. Approximately 25% of all Idaho Lottery revenue was returned to the people of Idaho in FY 2009. The approximately 900 Idaho Lottery retailers received 6% of all revenue while game support utilizes 4%, administration costs were 3% and the smallest portion, 2%, was used for advertising. Technology The Idaho Lottery changed the on-line provider to INTRALOT, USA in February 2007. This required the installation of satellites and terminals across Idaho. The new terminals and software capabilities allow the Lottery to perform specialized and unique game promotions. The Lottery also changed its instant ticket vendor to Scientific Games, Inc. in July 2007. This combination of companies has allowed the Lottery to offer unique game promotions where players have the opportunity to enter second-chance draws through either the internet or via tele-entry using a regular touch-tone telephone. In July 2007, the Lottery debuted a North American industry first when it offered their VIP Club members the opportunity to earn rewards for making game purchases (excluding instant tickets.) For each $1 spent on Powerball, Mega Millions, Double Play Daily, Hot Lotto, Wild Card, Pick 3, and/or Raffle tickets, players receive one point. Points may be redeemed through the Lottery’s VIP Club website for merchandise, including iPods, DVD players, bicycles, and watches. In August 2008, the Lottery offered another North American first – the ability for players to donate part of their winnings from scratch tickets to an international non-profit organization. The Lottery offered a $1 ScratchTM game to help financially support the 2009 Special Olympic World Winter Games to be held in Idaho that February. Using creative game technology, winning players were asked to donate 25%, 50% or 100% of their win to support the international event. Mascot The unofficial mascot of the Idaho Lottery is \\"BALL\\", a large, life-sized symbol of the red Powerball. \\"BALL\\" boasts a circumference of 132 inches and made its debut in television commercials in 2006. The Powerball commercials featuring \\"BALL\\" won critical acclaim from the Northwest Addy Awards with a Best of Show Award. The commercial campaign depicted \\"BALL\\" being so huge it could not fit through revolving doors, into elevators, or up escalators. More recently, \\"BALL\\" made appearances at special events and community venues such as collegiate and professional sporting events.

It is bound in the south by the savanna and on the north by the Sudanian woodlands. The habitats host abundant indigenous plants and animals, in addition to migrant species and newly planted species. They vary widely and consist of the marine system, coastal zone, estuary with mangrove vegetation coupled with Banto Faros (barren hypersaline flats), river banks with brackish and fresh water zones, swamps covered with forests and many wetlands.Penney, pp. 5–7 According to the Government of the Gambia, about 3.7% of the land area of the country has been brought under national parks or reserves, and the present wildlife policy is to extend this coverage to 5%. The seven areas included in the protected list are the Niumi National Park, Kiang West National Park, River Gambia National Park, Bao Bolong Wetland Reserve, Abuko Nature Reserve, Tanbi Wetland Complex and the Tanji Karinti River Bird Reserve. These are managed by the Department of Parks and Wildlife Management. The area covered by these parks is 38,000 ha. The birdlife in the Gambia is colourful and rich, with 560 species inhabiting coastal saltwater, freshwater wetlands, Guinea and Sudan savanna, woodlands and forests, agricultural lands, towns and villages.Emms, pp. 25–28, 44–48 It is thus a biodiversity hot spot for ornithologists. Geography The Gambia River in its lower reaches flowing through the entire length of the Gambia up to its joining the North Atlantic Ocean Savanna in Kiang West National Park in the Gambia Young mahogany trees in Kiang West National Park in the Gambia. The flat terrain of the Gambia, drained by the Gambia River is categorised under 37,000 habitat types. The habitat types are the coast, mangroves and Banto Faros, wetlands, farmlands, savanna and the Sahel habitats, gallery forests and urban habitats etc.. The coast extends to into the sea with extensive sea green grass meadows where aqua fauna dominate; the long stretch of beach here, with occasional hills or cliffs, is topped with plants which are salt tolerant and bind the terrain. Above these are the very old beaches at an elevation where the rich vegetation consists of baobab (Adansonia digitata) and ron palm (Borassus aethiopum) species interspersed with shrubs and grassland. The sea grass meadows of the coastal areas are rich in green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), dolphins, common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and Mediterranean monk seals (Monachus monachus), which feed on the fish species.Emms, pp. 25–28 Mangroves and Banto Faros are the mangrove swamp forests seen at the mouth of the Gambia River and extending along the river inland up to Kaur, into the brackish river stretch. It is a transitional zone between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Two types of mangrove forests, namely the white mangrove colonies and the red mangroves, are of short height near the coast but raise to 15–20 m in the upstream stretches of the river. Banto Faros are found, after the mangroves, in flat lands which are barren and salt encrusted; however, succulent plants grow in some of the less saline thick mats. Fishes spawn in the mangroves before they move offshore into the sea. Mangrove oysters, (Crassostrea gasar and Crassostrea tulipa) are also extensively found on mangrove trees in this habitat, which are collected and used as firewood and also as building material. Wetlands consist of salt pans, lagoons, marshes, mangrove swamps, mudflats, saltwater rivers, fresh water reaches of rivers such as the Gambia River, flooded sand mines, watering holes for animals, paddy fields and ephemeral marshes with reed vegetation in flooded areas. Crustaceans, annelid worms and molluscs are the fauna in the wetlands where migrant birds and wading birds find their feed. Farmlands, including savanna and woodland, form now a dominant habitat in the Gambia where crops were grown initially on a rotation system of 20 years with a fallow period. This practice has since changed to two or three years rotation. While the agricultural crops grown are sorghum, millet and ground nuts, the tree species retained, within the lands cleared for agricultural use, are the Acacia albida, baobab, ficus species, winterthorn and African locust (Parkia biglobosa). Savanna and the Sahel habitats are of two types. One is the southern Guinea savanna which has rich and dense vegetation of over 50 tree species. The other is the Sudan Savanna which is contiguous to the Guinea savanna on the north bank of the Gambia River. These areas are dry woodlands with soils of laterite formations. The local tree species include silk cotton (Bombax costatum), dry-zone mahogany (Khaya Senagalensis) in deeper soil areas and African rosewood (Guibourtia coleosperma). Short grasses and shrubs are seen thinly spread in the Sahelian habitats. The gallery forests (moisture forests), unlike the rainforest, thrive on groundwater and are integral to savannas. It is a rare habitat found only in Abuko Nature Reserve, Pirang Forest Park and in some stretches of the Gambia River with different set of species with some degree of overlap with rainforests. Urban habitat consists of numerous villages. The open areas in between have large green stretches with profusion of tree species, particularly the mango (Mangifera indica) trees. Law of the land Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus) Some parts of the land area of the Gambia, under the protection laws of the Banjul Declaration of 1977, which is the law on wild life, includes seven protected zones of the country. The law prohibits all types of hunting, except on animals harmful to the environment, such as warthog, giant pouched rat and francolin. Also, as a signatory to the International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES), the Gambia enforces law prohibiting export or even possession within the country of any animal skins, horns or turtle shells. Fauna Mammals More than 100 species of mammals have been reported.Penney, p. 32 ;Bats :Bats form a specific group of 30–40 species; they are of two types, namely fruit-eating bats and insect-eating bats. Straw- coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and epaulated fruit bats (Epomophorus gambianus) are the most common species found in very large numbers. Bats also help in eating the malarial insects, one bat consuming about 3000 mosquitoes per night. Eidolon helvum is a commonly seen bat during the rainy season when flowers and fruits (mangoes) are in full bloom.Emms, p. 33 ;Rodents :Rodents noted are the Gambian sun squirrel (Heliosciurus gambianus), striped ground squirrels (Xerus erythropus)s, nocturnal crested porcupines (Hystrix cristata), mongooses, brush-tailed porcupine, civets and genets.Emms, p. 34 ;Aquatic mammals :Aquatic mammals reported are 2 species of dolphin, the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszi) and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) ;Carnivores :Leopards and hyenas are still occasionally thought to cross into the more remote areas of East Gambia. ;Herbivores bushbuck,maxwells duiker, warthog & hippopotamus. ;Primates :Bijilo forests have endangered western red colobus monkey, the callithrix monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus). King West National Park has baboons, and patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas). The Senegal bushbaby Galago senegalensis, Campbells monkey (Cercopithecus campbelli). The River Gambia National park has chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The western red colobus (Procolobus badius) are a common sight in the Kiang West National Park, Bijilo Forest Park and Abuko Nature Reserve. Guinea baboon (Papio papio), which is large in size and fierce in appearance, is found in the northern region and also in small numbers in the coastal Makasutu Culture Forest.Emms, pp. 31–32 The aardvark is also still reported, although very rarely seen. ;Reptiles and amphibians :There are 40 snake species, nine of which are venomous, such as cobras, puff adders and mambas, genus Dendroaspis; the first two are common. The non-venomous reptiles are pythons, bush snakes, lizards agamas and skinks (with brown and orange flanks); Bose’s monitor, Nile monitors (Varanus niloticus), which are voracious predators; tree geckos; and chameleon.Penney, p. 37Emms, pp. 38–40 :Three species of crocodiles reported are: slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistpos cataphractus), West African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis) and West African crocodile; the first two are on the endangered list. :Amphibians consist of 33 species recorded so far, toads, tree frogs, crowned bullfrogs, edible bullfrogs and reed frogs.Emms, pp. 38–40 Birds Palm-nut vulture in the Gambia More than 500 species of birds live in the Gambia. The Bijilo Forest Park and the Abuko are important bird habitats. Faunal species seen here are the pelicans, spoonbills, yellow- billed stork (Mycteria ibis), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), blue-cheeked bee- eater (Merops persicus), mouse-brown sunbird (Anthreptes gabonicus), African fish eagle (Hieraaetus spilogaster) (in the river valleys). Wetland bird species are Dendrocygna viduata, sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus), palm- nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), crakes, greater painted snipe (Rostratula benghalensis) and African jacana (Actophilornis africanus).Emms, p. 44 Butterfly faunal distribution in the Gambia is dictated by the boundary of two major biomes of Sahelian and Guinean Savanna species; it is distinctly different between the rainy season and dry season. Flora The vegetation of the Gambia is mostly savanna in the upland areas, inland swamp in the low- lying areas, and mangrove swamp along the banks of the lower Gambia River. The country is almost devoid of true forest cover, the most forested area being the Bijo Forest. Nonetheless it is biologically rich, with an estimated 11,600 plant species many of which are used for medicinal purposes. Many plants are grown for food. The Cassava plant Manihot esculenta was brought to the Gambia by the Portuguese between the 17th and 18th centuries. It grows up to 4 metres high and is a staple of the national diet, consuming an average of 100 kg per person per annum in 2002 according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. Coastal inland forest comprises part of Bijilo Forest Park, Abuko Nature Reserve, Pirang Forest Park, and the River Gambia National Park.Penney, p. 44 The gummy Combretum glutinosum, Combretum micranthum, Combretum paniculatrum and Combretum racemosum are common shrubs in the savanna areas of the country. Combretum Paniculatum may be found on the edges of the forests in the north of the country. These plants usually have red petals and the Combretum racemosum has red 4-part flowers, but with inflorescence rimmed by white bracts. References Bibliography * * Further reading *Penney, D. 2009.

Opened on 24 May 1928, this station was a temporary terminus whilst construction of the remaining section of track to Dungeness continued. It was necessary to make temporary provision for the termination of trains at this location, which included a portable wooden hut for use as a booking office, and a turning triangle of track, to enable locomotives to change direction before their return journey to New Romney. The Pilot Inn public house Three months later the line was fully opened all the way to Dungeness; however, and as a matter of confusion for later historians, the station at Dungeness was known as \\"Lighthouse\\", whilst the station at The Pilot Inn became known (and marked on tickets) as Dungeness - Pilot. This confusion was short lived, and the station returned to its originally planned name of The Pilot Inn (named after a nearby hostelry, still trading today) whilst the terminus at the lighthouse became known as \\"Dungeness Lighthouse\\" and subsequently just \\"Dungeness\\". In 1929, a year after opening, the station buildings at The Pilot Inn were completed, and the temporary wooden hut was removed.The full history of this station is outlined in a large number of publications; Wolfe (1976) is one of the most comprehensive on this topic. The permanent buildings consisted of a short concrete platform, and a single structure on the landward side of the 'up' line. This building was light and airy, having windows in all four sides, including three windows on the back face of the building, and two windows plus a glass door on the front face. It served as a more than adequate station building for 10 years until 1939, when The Pilot Inn was destaffed.Photographs of this station building during its working life are extremely rare; however, an excellent one is shown in Mitchell and Smith (1999), plate 110. After the war the railway (which had become a military line during hostilities) was returned to the railway company, but it became necessary to reduce the Dungeness line to single-track, in order to maintain a service with limited resources. The over-large station at The Pilot Inn, now generally known as The Pilot Halt, was used as staff accommodation. George Barlow (a well known railwayman, who worked on the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway for 40 years, and was awarded the British Empire Medal for his service) who was a regular driver, took up residence in the station building in 1947, and years later reported that it had been a comfortable family home, albeit somewhat cramped. The station buildings were finally demolished in 1967, and replaced in 1968 with a simple breeze-block construction shelter, with an open front. The Pilot Halt continued as a request stop on the railway until 1977, when it officially closed. However, over the following five years from 1978 to 1983 there was some activity at the station, with special trains calling there by arrangement, and it remained listed in railway timetables; however, the installation of electronic track circuitry in connection with a nearby level crossing had rendered any general re-opening unlikely, as the track circuits have no way of knowing whether an approaching train intends to stop or not. The Pilot Halt was shown in the railway's 1984 timetable, although no advertised trains stopped there. Since 1985 the station has been unmentioned in any official railway publication, other than those which are strictly historical. During the mid-1990s the last (1968) station shelter was demolished. However, visitors to the site of the station may still see, in the shingle, the concrete foundations of both the 1968 shelter, and the 1929 station buildings, including the layout (at foundation level) of the different rooms of this 1929 building.

The Center researches new industrial and food uses for agricultural commodities, develops new technology to improve environmental quality, and provides technical support to federal regulatory and action agencies. With approximately , NCAUR is the largest of the Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) research centers. The world-renowned ARS Culture Collection is maintained at this facility. History NCAUR was one of four regional labs set up by the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, when Peoria, Illinois was chosen to host this facility, named the Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL). The other regional labs set up by the 1938 act are located in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania (Eastern Regional Research Center), New Orleans, Louisiana (Southern Regional Research Center), and Albany, California (Western Regional Research Center). The Northern Lab was renamed the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in 1990. The Northern Lab developed one of the first industrialized production techniques for penicillin. This development was led by Andrew J. Moyer. This and other early scientific accomplishments set a standard of research excellence at NCAUR, generating global and enduring impact and consistently bringing credit to the United States Department of Agriculture and its Agricultural Research Service. The late agricultural researcher Dr. Ed Bagley, who had been a professor at Washington University in St. Louis before coming to Peoria, was involved in finding new and better ways to improve the removal of carcinogens (and the discontinuation of their use) from corn and soy crops. Another example of their work is the development of soybeans from a small forage/rotation crop to the second largest and most valuable row crop in the U.S. Operation NCAUR's 35 current research (CRIS) projects are mission-driven, reflecting the USDA Agricultural Research Service's National Research Programs. More than 250 research personnel from nearly a dozen scientific disciplines are divided into nine teams. Their charge is to use basic and applied science techniques to create ideas, knowledge and solutions for high priority national research problems. These scientists publish an average of 190 peer reviewed journal publications submitted per year, frequent invitations to present findings at national and international meetings, and continued issuance of patents and licensed technology. Technology transfer is facilitated through numerous collaborations with universities, private industry, trade associations and other government agencies. The NCAUR facility is also home to the headquarters of the Midwest Area of the Agricultural Research Service, which includes ARS facilities in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

Karnataka Chitrakala Parishat has undertaken research on this art and has a good collection of leather puppets.  Making of the puppet  The puppets used in togalu gombeyaata are made of leather. Goat hide and deer skin are generally used for making these puppets since they have the characteristic of transparency and can easily absorb colours. The raw hide is treated with salt and caustic soda to remove hair and other impurities and then dried. Then colours are applied on the leather using locally available vegetable dyes. Red, blue, green and black colours are usually used.A description of togalu gombeyaata is provided by The hide is then cut into appropriate shapes which are joined together using strings and small sticks. For puppets representing human and animal figures, the head and limbs are joined in such a way that they can be moved easily.A detailed description of leather puppets is provided by The maximum size of the puppet is 4 x 3 feet and the minimum is 6 x 3 inches. The puppets are usually characters from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata. More recently, personalities such as Mahatma Gandhi have also been created using puppets.Changes in the art of togalu gombeyaata are mentioned by  Stage and settings  A stage is set up using bamboo stems and woollen blankets. A white, semi-transparent cloth is strung across the stage to serve as a screen on which the images of the puppets are projected. The puppets are strung across a rope behind the screen and a bright oil lamp placed behind the puppets projects their shadows on to the screen. The puppeteers sit behind the screen and manipulate the puppets based on the scene being played. However, innovation has entered this art with the usage of steel frames for the stage, loudspeakers to amplify voices, and an arc lamp instead of the oil lamp.  Performance  The performance usually starts with an invocation to the Hindu god Ganesha and to the Hindu goddess of learning Saraswati. The scenes enacted are usually those belonging to the Hindu epics, the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Puranas. The puppeteers also provide voice to the puppets and an accompanying music is provided using a mukha-veena (a veena played by mouth) or a harmonium. The puppets are controlled using sticks and strings. The performances usually commence at night and continue till dawn.

The top prize usually is $22,000; however, a ticket good for seven drawings matching all four numbers in a Tuesday draw wins $44,000. Lucky for Life In 2009, the Connecticut Lottery began a game then known as Lucky-4-Life. Eventually, it became a regional game. After several modifications, in 2015 it became a \\"quasi-national\\" game. (As of 2018, it is available in 24 states and the District of Columbia.) Lucky for Life plays are $2 each. Two number fields are used: players choose 5 of 48 \\"white balls\\", and a green \\"Lucky Ball\\" from 18 numbers. Drawings remain in Connecticut; each Monday and Thursday night, the winning numbers are selected from two \\"classic\\" drawing machines. Top prize is $1,000-per-week-for-life; second prize, $25,000-per year. Winners of a \\"lifetime prize\\" can choose cash instead. Lucky for Life replaced Wild Card 2 (initially known as Wild Card) in North Dakota in 2016. South Dakota, Montana, and Idaho also offered Wild Card 2; the latter three states also have joined LFL. Lotto America Lotto America is offered in 13 states; it is drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays. Lotto America draws five \\"red ball\\" numbers from 1 through 52, and a \\"blue ball\\" numbered 1-10.

Even though the word \\"sample\\" implies a smaller quantity taken from a larger amount, sometimes full biological or mineralogical specimens are called samples if they are taken for analysis, testing, or investigation like other samples. They are also considered samples in the sense that even whole specimens are \\"samples\\" of the full population of many individual organisms. An act of obtaining a sample is called \\"sampling,\\" which can be performed manually by a person or via an automated method. Samples of material can be taken or provided for testing, analysis, investigation, quality control, demonstration, or trial use. Sometimes, sampling may be continuously ongoing.

He is known as a theological controversialist. Life The second son of Michaijah Towgood, M.D. (died 1715), he was born at Axminster, Devonshire, on 17 December 1700. He was at school with Thomas Amory, and with him entered in 1717 the dissenting academy in Taunton run by Stephen James and Henry Grove. On leaving he was called to succeed Angel Spark (died 1721) as minister of the presbyterian congregation at Moreton Hampstead, Devon, where he was ordained on 22 August 1722. He had a substantial congregation, and concentrated on pastoral work. Accepting at Christmas 1736 a call to Crediton, Devon, in succession to Josiah Eveleigh (died 1736), he moved there in January 1737. On the death of James Green (1749), Towgood became colleague (1750) to his first cousin, Stephen Towgood (son of Stephen Towgood, his father's elder brother), as pastor of James's meeting, Exeter. The position was influential, and the duties were light; the Bow meeting had its two pastors, John Lavington and John Walrond; the four preached in rotation at the two places. James's meeting had been purged in 1719 by the exclusion of Joseph Hallett II and James Peirce. Towgood, originally orthodox, was now a high Arian, with views similar to Thomas Emlyn. He had the terms of membership relaxed; and in May 1753 the Exeter assembly quashed its resolution of September 1718 requiring adhesion to a Trinitarian formulary. In 1760 Towgood's congregation left James's meeting for the newly built George's meeting in South Street, Exeter. In the same year he took part in the establishment of the new Exeter academy for university-level teaching. A building for the purpose was given by William Mackworth Praed the younger; the library of the Taunton academy (closed October 1759) was moved to there. Towgood took the department of biblical exegesis. The institution lasted till the death (December 1771) of its divinity tutor, Samuel Merivale. On the death (1777) of his cousin, Towgood had as colleague James Manning (1754–1831), father of James Manning the barrister. He resigned his charge in 1782, and was succeeded after an interval by Timothy Kenrick. Towgood died on 1 February 1792. He had a slight impediment in speech, which he never entirely overcame, but was an effective preacher. Works At Crediton Towgood began a series of controversial publications, which culminated in the Dissenting Gentleman's Letters (1746–8) in reply to John White (died 1755), perpetual curate of Stoke Nayland, Suffolk. White had published A Letter to a Gentleman Dissenting from the Church of England and sequels from 1743. This major work made his reputation, and became a classic compendium of nonconformist argument. A True Idea of the Character and Reign of King Charles the First, and The True Causes of The Civil War, published in 1748, marked contentiously the centenary of the death of Charles I of England. Towgood published, besides single sermons: * High-flown Episcopal and Priestly Claims Examined, 1737, reprinted in Richard Baron's Cordial for Low Spirits, 1763, vol. iii. * The Dissenter's Apology, 1739, against John Warren, D.D. * Spanish Cruelty and Injustice, 1741. * Recovery from Sickness, 1742, often reprinted. * Afflictions Improved, 1743; prefixed is an account of a fire which destroyed West Crediton. * The Dissenting Gentleman's Answer, 1746; second letter, 1747; third letter, 1738 [i.e. 1748]; postscript, 1750, (all anon.); collected with author's name and title: A Dissent from the Church of England fully justified, 15th edit., Newry, 1816, has appendices by William Bruce and Andrew George Malcom; abridged by author, with title, A Calm Answer, 1772. * An Essay … of the Character and Reign of King Charles the First, 1748; 1780; 1811. * The Baptism of Infants, 1750; supplemented by Dipping not the Only Scriptural and Primitive Manner of Baptizing, 1751. These provoked replies by Grantham Killingworth and John Gill. * Serious and Free Thoughts on … the Church, 1755. * The Grounds of Faith in Jesus Christ, 1784. Three papers by him signed \\"Paulus\\" are in The Old Whig, 1739. Towgood corresponded with John Wesley in 1755, John and Charles Wesley read together Towgood's \\"A Gentleman's Reasons for his Dissent from the Church of England\\", in preparation for their Conference at Leeds. Wesley described it as \\"an elaborate and lively tract.\\" Family Towgood married, c.1730, a daughter of James Hawker of Luppitt, Devon, and had four children, of whom a daughter survived him; his wife died in 1759. His son Matthew (1732–1791) was educated at Bridgwater under John Moore (died 1748), was minister at Bridgwater (1747–1755), afterwards merchant, and ultimately (1773) a banker in London, where he died in January 1791, leaving issue.

Along with his landscape Chill October it represented a major turning point in Millais career. The painting illustrates a passage in the Book of Exodus, chapter 17, which describes how Moses and his two companions watched the battle from the hill. Moses holds the Rod of God in his right hand. > And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with > Amalek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in > mine hand. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: > and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. And it came to > pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let > down his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a > stone, and put it under him, and he sat there on; and Aaron and Hur stayed > up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and > his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. And Joshua > discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. Millais depicts the \\"going down of the sun\\", when the three patriarchs watch the final moments of the battle. Moses is in the middle while Aaron and Hur hold up his arms to ensure victory. Aaron, in red, is on the right. The battle below is indicated by the arrow at the bottom right. Millais worked on the painting over many years, scraping and repainting the surface. F.G. Stephens commented that the painting depicted the conflict between the unyielding and steadfast willpower of Moses, and the physical and emotional exhaustion of his companions.Millais, J.G., Life and Letters of John Everett Millais, vol 2, p. 34. He also praised the vivid painting of the aged flesh of the figures. The painting contrasts dramatically in style with the contemporary religious works of Millais's former companion, William Holman Hunt, such as The Shadow of Death,Treuherz, J. Pre-Raphaelite Paintings in Manchester City Art Gallery, Manchester, 1993, p. 109. on which Hunt was working at the same time; however, it has been suggested that both pictures may refer to typological prefigurations of the crucifixion in scenes in which raised, outstretched arms signify both physical suffering and triumph..

It formed part of Disraeli's social reform initiative aimed at the \\"elevation of the people\\" (the working class), a policy stated in his 1872 speeches at Manchester and Crystal Palace, and associated with his doctrine of One Nation Conservatism. Also, key individuals, such as the philanthropist Octavia Hill, helped pressurise the government into passing the Act. Terms # Compel owners of slum dwelling to sell to councils, who must provide compensation. # Take advantage of lower than normal interest rates from the Government. # Demolish the areas of slum housing to be redeveloped by commercial builders.  Importance  Considered one of the most significant acts of Disraeli's administration (he said it was their \\"chief measure\\") the act was a classic example of permissive legislation that typified Disraeli's social policy. Councils were not compelled to take action and, due to the obvious cost involved, few did. In fact, by 1881, only 10 out of 87 towns in England and Wales used their permitted powers. The most notable major redevelopment occurred in Birmingham under the Prominent, Radical Liberal Member of Parliament, Joseph Chamberlain, founder of the National Liberal Federation. There, it led to the creation of Corporation Street; overall, however, it proved ineffective. Permissiveness The act was permissive, mainly for the protection of property rights. Many felt the act was an infringement of such rights, including many within the party, who pressured Richard Cross against making it compulsory. Also, it may have been seen to be an attack on landlords, traditional Tory voters. As well, it was passed in a time that the government adopted a predominately laissez-faire attitude to politics. Disraeli proclaimed in June 1875: \\"Permissive legislation is the characteristic of a free people\\".Robert Blake, Disraeli (London: Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1966), p. 554.

It was established in 1984 via a voter referendum. It is a charter member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). The Lottery offers games such as Hot Lotto, Powerball, Mega Millions, and scratch tickets. West Virginia has reinterpreted the amendment to its Constitution that permitted its lottery to include casinos, and thus the West Virginia Lottery Commission also regulates slot machines, which are marketed as \\"video lottery\\" and available at several hundred businesses; and five \\"lottery table games\\" casinos. Jack Whittaker, arguably the most notable American lottery winner, won his then-record Powerball jackpot of about $315 million (annuity value) on a ticket bought in West Virginia for the December 25, 2002 drawing. The minimum age to buy West Virginia Lottery tickets is 18, while casinos and slot machine parlors require patrons to be at least 21. The lottery has the lowest payoff of any state lottery system in the country, returning on average a 15% share to winners. In March 2018, West Virginia passed the WV Sports Lottery Wagering Act, which legalizes sports betting in the state, pending a decision from the Supreme Court allowing states to offer sports betting. The West Virginia Lottery Commission would regulate the new industry, and has stated that casinos could be ready to launch sports betting as early as 90 days after a Supreme Court decision. Current draw games In-house draw games Daily 3 Daily 3 is drawn Mondays through Saturdays. It draws three sets of balls numbered 0 through 9. Prices, prizes, and options vary.

Mega Millions' starting jackpots is $40 million, a cash option is available. On January 31, 2010, many MUSL members (until then offering only Powerball) joined Mega Millions; likewise, most Mega Millions members added Powerball, New Jersey offered both games as of the cross-sell expansion date. The Megaplier option, initially available only in Texas, became available to Mega Millions players in New Jersey during January 2011, the deadline for the then 43 Mega Millions members to offer the Megaplier. Mega Millions currently is played in 44 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mega Millions is drawn live, usually from Atlanta. Lotto America The West Virginia Lottery is one of 13 lotteries offering Lotto America, which started on November 15, 2017. The minimum jackpot for Lotto America is $2 million and drawings are held on Wednesday and Saturday nights.  Former Hot Lotto Hot Lotto began ticket sales on April 7, 2002 with West Virginia as one of its six original lotteries. It was available in a total of 14 states. It was drawn Wednesdays and Saturdays. Hot Lotto was the only game in West Virginia where the numbers were drawn via RNG (other than its keno and video slot machines). Five \\"white numbers\\" from 1 through 47 were drawn, followed by the \\"orange Hot Ball\\" numbered 1-19. Jackpots started at $1,000,000 (all-cash, and \\"taxes paid\\") with a $50,000 minimum rollovers. The Sizzler option tripled non-jackpot prizes.

They are undergoing periodic training times to times in 3 years in their respective university and will be commissioned as Police Volunteer Reserve Corp (Malaysia) Inspector by the Inspector General of Police in the end of the 3 years training. History The idea of establishing Kor-Sukarelawan Siswa Polis's (SUKSIS) was inspired by YAB Dato' Seri Abdullah Hj. Ahmad Badawi, the 5th Malaysian Prime Minister. The establishment of SUKSIS corps in Malaysian Higher Learning Institution is believed to help producing excellent graduates who comply own viable competence, discipline and furnished with noble values, and high self-esteem. In 2002, the Malaysian prime minister suggested to the former Inspector General of Police, Tan Sri Bakri Haji Omar to establish a curriculum in universities to bridge the gap between university students and the police. The main objective is to expose the police duty to the student selected to the new corps. Universiti Utara Malaysia (Northern University of Malaysia) volunteered and became the first University in Malaysia to have such force. The creation of the corp in universities also allowed those who had not participated in school to join and get a better understanding of the police and their service to the public. The realisation of the importance of the policemen duties would move graduates to opt for a career in the police. The establishment the Police Undergraduate Voluntary Corp (SUKSIS's Corps) will act as points and ears Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) in channel information about crime scene in local area. The Royal Malaysian Police and Education Department had found that cadets showed a high level of discipline and stayed away from social ills such as drug abuse and truancy.SUKSIS can draw more to join police There were many suggestions for the name of the new force to be established in the universities, and the name Kor Sukarelawan Polis Siswa (SUKSIS) was chosen, meaning \\"Student's Police Volunteer Reserve Corps\\" Or \\"Police Undergraduate Volunteers Force\\" Training As membership Kor-SUKSIS fill by undergraduate first year IPTA, training period that prescribed is three years while follow training arrangement that prescribed 360 time viz 129 time for weekly training and 240 time when semester break. Training time division also is as many as 200 time for outside training activity and 160 time for academic classes. However, stated fraction can still adjusted following need-of. To meet arrangement and training fraction which has been prescribed, kor-SUKSIS UMS had set compulsory activities following: Feet March, Arms March, Sword March, Stick March, Circuit Test, Arms Class, Training Shoot, Light Strike Force (LSF), Life Effort, Robust St, First Aid, Swimming, Person Defensive Art, General Operation Force(PGA) Training, Practical Delegation In Nearby IPD, Cultured / Build Person, Mess Night, Law Class, After Dinner Talk', Community service, Kor-SUKSISAnnual Camp, Kor-SUKSIS Family Day Kor-SUKSIS, Kor-SUKSIS Sport Festival, Council To Swear / Drug Pledge, Examination (March, Shooting, Physical Spirit Testing), Convocation Ceremony, and End Parade Ceremony Training. Equipments Uniform The standard Suksis uniform is similar to that of the Royal Malaysian Police. SUKSIS wear standard issue black berets with the emblem of police on the top corner above the left eye. In November 2003, SUKSIS were issued standard issue black walking shoes. Starting July 2004, the Royal Malaysian police started to issue 'black zip', a shoe that is also a standard issue for the regular police force. Duty Kor Suksis is a member of the Volunteer Police. While on duty they have the same duties and powers as regular police. But the life as a Suksis member is focused more on training and academic. So they are called to perform duty such as Beat (police) and patrol and peace keeping during the events organized by the university, general or by-elections, and during practical training at IPD. During practice, they will follow the general duty tasks such as beat and patrol, enquiry office, MPV patrol and others which deemed necessary as part of training by the training officer.

Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase or HGD is involved in the catabolism of aromatic rings, more specifically in the breakdown of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. HGD appears in the metabolic pathway of tyrosine and phenylalanine degradation once the molecule homogentisate is produced. Homogentisate reacts with HGD to produce maleylacetoacetate, which then is further used in the metabolic pathway. HGD requires the use of Fe2+ and O2 in order to cleave the aromatic ring of homogentisate. Image:Homogentisic acid.svghomogentisate Image:4-maleylacetoacetic acid.svg4-maleylacetoacetate Enzyme active site The active site of Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase was determined through the crystal structure, which was captured through the work of Titus et al. Through the crystal structure the active site was found to contain the following residues; His292, His335, His365, His371, and Glu341. 300px Homogentisate binds in the active site to Glu341, His335, and His371 via the Fe2+ atom. The His292 binds to the hydroxyl group of the aromatic ring. His365 binds to Glu341 via hydrogen bonding to stabilize the amino acid side chains.  Pathology  Homegentisate 1,2 dioxygenase is involved in a type of metabolic diseases, called alkaptonuria. This disorder is due to the inability of the body to deal with homogentisate, which when oxidized by the body will produce the compound known as the ochronotic pigment, which causes a black color, and has several negative effects. This first of these effects is that the patient’s earwax will begin to turn black or red, depends on the patient’s diet, since the blood becomes oxidized and thus turns black due to excess of the ochronotic pigment. The other effect of the ochronotic pigment is that it can accumulate in the body’s connective tissue leading to degenerative arthritis, as the person grows older. Alkaptonuria has another effect in that it can cause the urine to turn black as well if let to sit for long enough to become oxidized, though is this often a method for testing for the genetic defect. The metabolic disease is autosomal recessive, such that both parents must pass the gene on to their children in order for child to have the defect. Mechanism Borowski et al. propose a mechanism for HGD in their article featured in the Journal of the American Chemistry. They base their mechanism on results from hybrid DFT calculations with B3LYP functionals using the programs Gaussian03 and Jaguar. The opening of the aromatic ring in homogentisate is a multi-step process. In the first two steps Fe2+ coordinates to the carbonyl and ortho phenol oxygens. The iron atom is also coordinated to His335, His371, and Glu341. O2 then binds to the iron atom., subsequently reacting with the aromatic ring to form a peroxo-bridged intermediate. In the next step, O2 is cleaved with the formation of an epoxide. This epoxide intermediate allowing radical reactions to eventually open and oxidize the six-membered ring.

He was also acting ban of Croatia for two separate terms. Life A tablet on the house where Haulik was born He studied theology and philosophy in Trnava, Esztergom and Vienna. After the death of bishop Aleksandar Alagović in 1837, Haulik was proclaimed bishop. In 1840 he began his first term as acting ban of Croatia after the death of ban Franjo Vlašić. He is credited for introducing the Croatian language into schools and workplaces, as well as forming the Matica hrvatska in 1842. He helped the organization of Maksimir park in Zagreb. He was succeeded as ban by the Hungarian Franz Haller. Haller was brought in to carry on Magyarization in Croatia, which included the banning of the then Croatian banner name: Illyrians. A protest by the Croatian People's Party in 1845 was put out violently by Haller, leaving thirteen protestors dead, and ending his time as ban. Haulik was again called upon to take up the post. During this term, the Croatian language was made official in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in 1847. In 1848, in the midst of revolutions in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, military man Josip Jelačić was proclaimed ban to counter Hungarian aims of revoking Croatian autonomy. Some further autonomy did materialize for Croatia in the following years, as Haulik was proclaimed the first archbishop and metropolitan of Zagreb in 1852. With this, the Catholic Church in Croatia became independent from Hungary. In 1856 he was also named cardinal. He carried on in these posts until his death in 1869. While he was an ethnic Slovak, he said of his background: I was born a Slovak, but I will die a Croat. In 1999, Croatia and Slovakia put out a joint-issue stamp featuring Haulik.

It was created in 1971 by then-Gov. Thomas Meskill, who signed Public Act No. 865. The first tickets were sold on February 15, 1972. The Connecticut Lottery offers several in-house drawing games; Connecticut also participates in Mega Millions and Powerball; each are played in 44 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Connecticut-only games  Drawings are broadcast on WCCT-TV (channel 20) the CW affiliate in the Hartford/New Haven television market.

Cash5  Cash5 is a nightly five-number game; it was originally known as Cash Lotto when it debuted in 1992, and was drawn only on Saturdays. It expanded to three nights a week in 1995. The name was changed to Cash 5 when the Kicker option was introduced; the game began nightly drawings. Five winning numbers are chosen from a field of 35. The basic Cash5 game costs $1; for an additional 50 cents, the Kicker option is activated. The Kicker option gives a player more opportunities to win.CT Lottery Cash 5 page Retrieved September 4, 2011  Lotto!  Connecticut's in-house jackpot game, Lotto!, is drawn Tuesdays and Friday nights. Six numbers are drawn from a field of 44; the 6/44 matrix has been used continuously since 1989, when the game's name was its original name, Connecticut Lotto (without an exclamation point.) The minimum jackpot is $1,000,000 (annuitized; payable in 21 equal yearly installments unless the cash option is chosen.) Unusually, the Lotto! jackpot increases only when its Tuesday night drawing is not won. The minimum increase in the jackpot is $100,000 until won.CT Lottery's Classic Lotto page Retrieved September 4, 2011 Players win $2 by matching three of the six numbers drawn; a parimutuel prize is won with at least four numbers. What is now Lotto! began in 1983 as Connecticut Lotto, a 6/36 game. The matrix was changed to 6/40 in 1986, and to the current 6/44 in 1989. (The then-current game logo was 36, 40, or 44 yellow squares forming a rectangle, reflecting the game matrix.) The cash option was added in 1997. The game became Wild Card Lotto in 1998 (adding a seventh ball, which was used for additional lower-tier prizes, but not for the jackpot). Due to slumping sales, Wild Card Lotto was dropped and Classic Lotto introduced Memorial Day weekend in 1999. The name Classic Lotto was retired on Saturday, March 9, 2013 (which did not coincide with it being drawn), as the game's name became Lotto! the next day, although the format was not changed. (Lotto! tickets, including Advance Action, purchased on or before March 9, 2013 have \\"Classic Lotto\\" printed on them, but were valid for draw(s) under the new name. As the 6/44 matrix was not changed, \\"Classic Lotto\\" bet slips can still be used).  Keno  On April 25, 2016, the CT Lottery began offering Keno. It is drawn at four-minute intervals, with over 300 drawings daily. An agreement with Connecticut's two tribal casinos, Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun, was necessary to allow the Lottery permission to offer Keno; unlike in the two casinos, Lottery keno players need only to be at least 18 years old instead of 21. (The agreement allows Lottery tickets to be sold on tribal property, in areas accessible to those under 21; Mohegan Sun also houses one of Connecticut's \\"High-Tier Claim Centers\\" for claiming prizes of $600 to $5,000). Keno wagers may be made at any Connecticut Lottery retailer, although only those in a \\"social\\" setting have a monitor for witnessing the computer-drawn numbers.  Fast Play  On July 20, 2020, the CT Lottery launched a new category of games called Fast Play. Fast Play games are like instant (scratch) games, but are printed on-demand from a CT Lottery retailer terminal or self-serve CT Lottery vending machine. The first family of games is “Jumbo Bucks,” and is available at the $1, $2, and $5 price points. Fast Play progressive games are a series (or family) of games that all share the same name, appearance and playstyle, but are available at different price points (wager amounts). There are no numbers to pick, no play slip needed and no drawings. Each game in a family contributes to ONE progressive jackpot that grows with ticket sales, until someone wins.  Former draw games   Lucky Links  Lucky Links began April 26, 2015. Played similar to tic-tac-toe, each $2 ticket contained eight numbers, with a \\"$\\" free space in the middle. The player needed to make at least two complete horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines to win a cash prize. If the player completed the board (matching all eight printed numbers), they won $50,000. A doubler option, for an extra $1 (called \\"2X Power\\"), doubled a prize for matching three to six lines. Prizes were $5 (2 lines), $10 (3 lines), $50 (4 lines), $100 (5 lines), $1000 (6 lines), and $50,000 (all 8 lines). The chance of winning a prize was 1 in 8.4; the chance of winning the top prize was 1 in 319,770. Drawings were held daily at 1:45 PM and 10:15 PM EST. Only the Monday through Friday drawings were televised. All game tickets were Quick Picks. Sales for the game ended on June 30, 2020.  5 Card Cash  On May 4, 2014, the Connecticut Lottery began sales of 5 Card Cash. This game, the first of its kind in Connecticut, combined an \\"instant\\" game with a more traditional (albeit with \\"playing cards\\" instead of numbers) drawing-style game. The first drawing was held on May 5, 2014, in keeping with the \\"five\\" theme. Sales for the game were suspended on November 14, 2015. Each play cost $2. There were no play slips, multi-game tickets, or advance play. A ticket (quick-pick only) won instantly if it matched a poker hand (straight, flush, or \\"jacks-or- better).\\" Prizes in the \\"instant\\" game ranged from $3 to $5,555. Additionally, while a \\"lower\\" pair did not win immediately, a pair of 5s won a 5 Card Cash ticket. The draw-game portion required a player to match at least three of the five cards drawn. Matching three cards won $20; four cards, $555. Matching all five cards won or shared $255,555.  Multi-jurisdictional draw games   Lucky For Life  In 2009, Connecticut began a $2-per-play game called Lucky4Life. Three years later, the game became Lucky For Life (drawing five numbers from the first machine), expanding to include Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont; its \\"nickname\\" became New England′s Game. Lucky for Life changed its double matrix on September 17, 2013. Players chose 5 of 43 \\"white ball\\" numbers, and a green \\"Lucky Ball\\" from a second set of 43. For the first time; a \\"lifetime\\" winner could choose the annuity or cash. This format change added a second \\"lifetime\\" tier. Lucky for Life became a \\"quasi-national\\" game on January 27, 2015, adding eight lotteries on that date. As of April 2, 2017, the game is offered in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Players choose 5 of 48 \\"white balls\\", and a sixth number, from 18 green \\"Lucky Balls.\\" Top prize is $1,000-per-day-for-life (with a $5,750,000 cash option); second prize is $25,000 per year-for-life, with a $390,000 cash option. (A similar game, Cash4Life, began in June 2014; it is currently available in nine states.)  Mega Millions  Connecticut began selling Mega Millions tickets January 31, 2010, following a 2009 agreement in which lotteries then offering either Mega Millions or Powerball were allowed to offer both games. Connecticut is among 46 lotteries selling Mega Millions tickets. Mega Millions plays are $2 each, or $3 with the Megaplier option. The current format for Mega Millions began on October 28, 2017. Mega Millions players choose 5 of 70 white ball numbers and a \\"Mega Ball\\" numbered 01 through 25. Jackpots began at $40,000,000 with minimum rollovers of $5,000,000. Jackpot winners chose either 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5% per annum) or the cash value option. Other prizes range from $2 to $1,000,000. The Megaplier option, which increases the cost of each $2 play to $3, multiplies non-jackpot winnings by 2, 3, 4, or 5; a second-prize (all five white balls but not also the \\"Mega Ball\\") wager can win $5,000,000 cash. As of March 26, 2018, Connecticut has yet to produce a Mega Millions jackpot winner. The \\"Just the Jackpot\\" option for Mega Millions, which began with the October 2017 format change (all six numbers must be matched to win), is not available in Connecticut.)

Early life  Lee Sims was born April 30, 1898 in Champaign, Illinois, under the full name Cleo Orville Sims. Cedar Rapids, Iowa was his hometown while growing up. At the age of 8, he played ragtime and waltzes for a YMCA calisthenics class in Cedar Rapids. By age 11, he was accompanying church singers and playing the theatre pipe organ for silent movies. At 14, he played at the Majestic Theater in LaSalle, Illinois. While still in his teens, he went to work for a pipe organ manufacturer, demonstrating instruments all over the country.  Career  At age 22, Sims decided to settle down in Chicago. He began making piano rolls for the United States Piano Roll Company and other piano roll companies. Today, these rolls are sought after by collectors. He became studio manager for WTAS, one of the first radio stations in the Middle West. Later, he was studio manager of KYW, the Westinghouse station in Chicago, and WBBM, then the Stewart-Warner \\"theatre of the air\\". As a radio performer, Sims had a late- night program called \\"Piano Moods\\" over the Chicago NBC affiliate station, WMAQ. He founded the Lee Sims School of Music, and one of his pupils was Ilomay Bailey, who had been a vocalist with the Paul Ash and Ben Pollack orchestras. Prior to singing with these orchestras, Ilomay had had formal vocal training. The two were married and formed a team. Sims introduced Ilomay Bailey on his \\"Piano Moods\\" radio program and created an instant sensation. In the 1930s, Lee and Ilomay appeared as stars of the Chase and Sanborn Hour night program for the National Broadcasting Company. Other radio appearances included Rudy Vallee's program and the Ben Bernie and Phil Baker shows. In the 1937 movie \\"Dinner At The Ritz\\" (starring David Niven a.o.) Sims can be heard on piano with a band directed by Muir Mathieson although the band on screen is an unknown black outfit. During the 1920s and 1930s, Sims recorded approximately 60 sides for Brunswick. He published several courses on modern piano and numerous arrangements (or \\"transcriptions\\") of popular tunes of the day. Many original sheet music editions included a bonus Lee Sims chorus for the more proficient and adventurous performers. After his heyday as a radio performer and recording artist, Sims devoted most of his time to teaching in his New York studio apartment, where Ilomay taught voice.  Influences  Lee Sims was deeply imbued with the nineteenth century European tradition and especially interested in the newer, impressionistic harmonies of Debussy and Ravel. While he recorded mostly sentimental popular songs, he had more serious ideas and aspirations. In 1928, his collection of \\"Five Piano Rhapsodies\\" was published. In that same year, Sims recorded two of the “Rhapsodies” arranged for piano and orchestra on a Brunswick 12\\" disk. Sims appeared with the London Symphony Orchestra to play his symphonic tone poem, \\"Blythewood,\\" with an orchestration by Ferde Grofe. Art Tatum biographer James Lester described Sims's compositions as being \\"drawn from the same sources as Bix Beiderbecke's 'In a Mist'.\\" Sims's style, though somewhat outside of the realm of jazz, as it is typically considered today, was well within it in the era of his prominence. Nevertheless, Sims influenced the great jazz pianist Art Tatum, who used chord voicings and other devices that Sims employed, for example, the exploration of a song at its outset in a legato style, along with \\"Debussy- esque\\" chords, prior to launching into \\"bouncier\\" tempos and rhythms.

Thórisson is an Icelandic Artificial Intelligence researcher, founder of the Icelandic Institute for Intelligent Machines (IIIM) and co- founder and former co-director of CADIA: Center for Analysis and Design of Intelligent Agents. Thórisson is one of the leading proponents of artificial intelligence systems integration. Thórisson is a proponent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) (also referred to as strong AI) and has proposed a new methodology for achieving artificial general intelligence. A demonstration of this constructivist AI methodology has been given in the FP-7 funded HUMANOBS project HUMANOBS project, where an artificial system autonomously learned how to do spoken multimodal interviews by observing humans participate in a TV-style interview. The system, called AERA, autonomously expands its capabilities through self-reconfiguration. Thórisson has also worked extensively on systems integration for artificial intelligence systems in the past, contributing architectural principles for infusing dialogue and human- interaction capabilities into the Honda ASIMO robot.Design and Evaluation of Communication Middleware in a Distributed Humanoid Robot Architecture Kristinn R. Thórisson is currently managing director for the Icelandic Institute for Intelligent Machines and an associate professor at the School of Computer Science at Reykjavik University. He was co-founder of semantic web startup company Radar Networks, and served as its Chief Technology Officer 2002–03. Constructivist AI methodology The constructivist AI methodology proposed by ThórissonA New Constructivist AI: From Manual Methods to Self-Constructive Systems addresses the numerous significant challenges involved in building AGI systems, by replacing the top-down architectural design approaches that are ubiquitous today with methods that allow a system to autonomously manage its own cognitive growth. This involves a shift of focus from manual design of mental functions to the principles from which intelligent systems can grow through self-organization. The methodology was inspired in part by Piaget's theory of cognitive development and motivated by the level of operational complexity that will be required for realizing AGI systems in contrast to what can be achieved with even large teams of human software engineers and software designers relying on methods of manual construction. The constructivist AI approach has been successfully demonstrated in the HUMANOBS project, where a domain-independent AI system autonomously learned real-time socio- communicative behavior through observation. The project was funded by the European Union under an FP-7 STReP grant (number 231453). Constructionist design methodology The constructionist design methodology (CDM), was developed by K. R.

Fernández Miranda was born in Gijón, Asturias, on Spain's north coast, in 1915. He died of a heart attack in 1980 while traveling to London.  Francoist State  By the age of 30, Fernández Miranda had already served as a lieutenant for the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War and begun a promising career as a law professor; that year, he earned a chair at the University of Oviedo, of which he would later serve as rector, 1951 to 1953.Preston, Paul. \\"Juan Carlos: Steering Spain from Dictatorship to Democracy.\\" New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2004. . He was destined to make his biggest impact in public service, however. Franco chose him to serve as the government's Director-General of University Education in the mid-1950s, and gave him an even weightier assignment in 1960: Fernández Miranda was entrusted with the political education of Prince Juan Carlos, whom Franco had tapped to carry on as his successor as the King of Spain, after the death of the caudillo. After having endured years of military training, Juan Carlos credited Fernández Miranda with being the first of his tutors to teach him to rely on independent thinking. In the final years of the Francoist State - Franco would die 20 November 1975 - Fernández Miranda also played an important political role as a high-ranking member of the Movimiento Nacional (National Movement), the Francoist State's only legal political party. He served as interim Presidente del Gobierno (prime minister) for a few weeks in December 1973, after the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco. He had been Carrero Blanco's principal deputy prime minister. Although Fernández Miranda was one of the top candidates to succeed Carrero Blanco, the job of prime minister—Franco's last, as it would turn out—went to Carlos Arias Navarro.  Leader in transition  Shortly after Franco's death, Juan Carlos became king. He retained Arias Navarro as prime minister but, in a nod to his political mentor, named Fernández Miranda speaker of the Cortes (the legislature) and president of the Consejo del Reino (Council of the Kingdom) in the transition government. In these roles, Fernández Miranda was able to push a willing king toward the development of a democracy. Fernández Miranda sought to establish a two-party system, with one conservative party and one liberal party. He suggested legitimizing the suppressed PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party), which was leftist but anti-communist, for the liberal role. Upon Arias Navarro's resignation in 1976, Spain was still operating under Francoist law; it was Fernández Miranda's job, as head of the Council of the Kingdom, to suggest three names to the king for a new political leader. He placed the reformist Adolfo Suárez on his list, despite Suárez' relative inexperience. Suárez was duly selected, and soon called for a political reform law, to be followed by democratic elections, Spain's first in 40 years. The law professor Fernández Miranda, still serving as speaker of the Cortes, was the principal author of Suárez' Ley para la Reforma Política (Political Reform Law), approved by the Government in September 1976, by the Cortes in November 1976, and by a popular referendum 15 December 1976.  Democratic Spain  Although he played a large role in the transition to democracy, Fernández Miranda remained a political conservative. Following Suárez reforms with which he disagreed—such as the legalization of the Communist Party of Spain and increasing tolerance of decentralization – the speaker resigned from the Cortes prior to the first election, 15 June 1977. After the election, he was named by the king to the Spanish Senate, which now became the upper house of a bicameral Cortes. He served there for one term, representing the UCD, until 2 January 1979.Spanish: Senado.es: Torcuato Fernández Miranda y Hevia. Retrieved 28 April 2007.

Taxonomy The species Saitis barbipes was described by the French naturalist Eugène Simon in 1868, under the name of Attus barbipes. Simon, 1868 : Monographie des espèces européennes de la famille des attides (Attidae Sundewall. - Saltigradae Latreille). Annales de la Société Entomologique de France, ser. 4, vol. 8, p. 11-72 & 529-726 It was placed in 1876 by Eugène Simon in the genus Saitis of which it constitutes the type species. Simon, 1876 : Les arachnides de France. Paris, vol. 3, p. 1-364 The Australian \\"peacock spider\\", Maratus volans, has a range of superficial similarities to the species, such as green eyes, and an enlarged third pair of legs used for courtship. Recent work suggests that Saitis and Maratus are closely related genera. Distribution This species is present in the Mediterranean region, from southern Europe (Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland) to Turkey and in North Africa. Platnick, Norman I. (2009): The world spider catalog, version 9.5. American Museum of Natural History] Fauna europaea Habitat These jumping spiders can be found on houses and rocks, as well as indoors. Description Saitis barbipes is characterized by a significant Sexual dimorphism. Males can reach a body length of , while females measure . Jerzy Prószyński Monograph of the Salticidae (Araneae) of the World 1995-2015 - Part II - Global Species Database of Salticidae (Araneae) The female shows a less evident coloration, with a dull brown body, a dark or blackish eyes field and pale brown legs with almost no drawing. On the contrary the smaller male is strikingly colored, especially when frontally viewed. It has bright emerald green eyes, the four white frontal legs are densely haired and regularly interspersed by black stripes and there is a red band above the eyes, which extends on the sides to the rear pair of eyes. The cephalothorax (prosoma) usually is pale brown and rather hairy above the eyes. The abdomen (opisthosoma) is provided on the upper side with a laterally dark bordered longitudinal band. Saitis barbipes is probably the most colorful species of jumping spiders in Europe. The most impressive feature however is the greatly enlarged third pair of legs. These are longer and colored red near the body, fading into black, with white tufts at the end. Behavior Thanks to the long third pair of legs these spiders can jump at great distances. These legs are also used in courtship display. When the male spots a female, he raises vertically the third pair of legs. As he approaches her, from time to time he audibly vibrates them. A receptive female will then collapse on her legs and turn her abdomen ventral side upward. Sexually mature animals can be found year-round.Courtship dance for Saitis barbipes Oliver H.

Even before Hill reached high school, leagues were instituting rules in order to keep things fair for his opponents. While playing youth football in the Wilson Intermediate Football League, Hill gained a reputation for scoring practically every time he touched the ball, causing scoring in games to get out of hand. As a result a bylaw was created that limited Hill to three touchdowns if his team was ahead by more than fourteen points. The rule came to be known as the \\"Madre Hill Rule\\", but had been out of use for many years until the league re-instated it in 2011 to respond to the abilities of Demias Jimerson, who was dominating games in a similar fashion to Hill.Smith, Cameron. \\"Youth league institutes TD limit for eleven year old.\\" www.rivals.yahoo.com.

It was first published by George Newnes, Ltd., in October 1933, and ran for 352 issues until the magazine's termination in August 1963. Practical Mechanics was edited by Frederick J. Camm until his death in 1959. With an emphasis on things its readers could reasonably construct themselves, the magazine featured numerous articles on how to build things around one's house, such as a sink or bathtub. It also regularly featured more fanciful articles on how to build things with less obvious applications around the home, for example a Geiger counter, or an aeroplane for £25 (not including the cost of an engine). The early issues were in black and white. The magazine began printing in color at an unknown date.

It is also known by its traditional German name Verschärfung (literally: \\"sharpening\\"). (A similar sound law which has affected modern Faroese, called skerping in Faroese itself, is also known as \\"Faroese Verschärfung\\" in English.) Description and occurrences The law involves the gemination, or doubling, of PIE semivowels (glides) ' and ' in strong prosodic positions into Proto-Germanic ' and ', which had two outcomes: * hardening into occlusive onsets: ** '/' in North Germanic; ** '/' in East Germanic * vocalization of the first semivowel, its addition to a diphthong, and division of the diphthong and remaining semivowel into two separate segments in West Germanic. The process is brought about by the fact that vowels (or semivowels) in the syllable margin are invariably transformed into consonantal articulations.Natalie Operstein, Consonantal Structure and Prevocalization (John Benjamins, 2010), 91. The conditions of the sound change were long debated, since there was a seemingly random distribution of affected and unaffected words. At first, dependence on word accent was assumed, parallel to Verner's Law. One currently accepted solution, first proposed by Smith (1941),Henry Lee Smith, Jr., The Verschärfung in Germanic, Language 17 (1941), 93-9. postulates dependency on the presence of a PIE laryngeal, which when lost, triggered lengthening as if the semivowels were vowels, and forced them into the syllable margin. According to Lehmann (1955),Winfred P. Lehmann, Proto-Indo-European Phonology (1955), chapter 4: 'Lengthened /w/ and /y/ in the Gmc. Dialects' the lengthening occurs in the contexts of PIE ', ', ', ' (where V is any short vowel, and H is any laryngeal). For example, PIE *' → early Proto-Germanic *trewwjaz 'trustworthy, faithful' →: * *triwwjaz: Old Norse tryggr, Gothic triggws * *triuwjaz: Old English trēowe, Old High German gitriuwi. One instance where a laryngeal was never present is PIE *h₂ōwyóm 'egg', but after the loss of ', the ' shifted into the syllable margin, giving: * with hardening: ** *ajjis: Crimean Gothic ada (pl.) (*addi (sg.) < *ajjis) ** *ajją: Old Norse egg * with diphthongization: ** *aijaz:The plurals OHG eigir and OE ǣgru exhibit an s-stem; . German Ei, Old English ǣġ  Alternative views  Some linguists (e.g. Joseph Voyles)Joseph B. Voyles, Early Germanic Grammar (San Diego: Harcourt Brace, 1992), 25-6. hold that Holtzmann's Law represents two separate and independent sound changes, one applying to Gothic and another to Old Norse, rather than being a common innovation. This is supported by James Marchand'sJames Marchand, The Sounds and Phonemes of Wulfila's Gothic, The Hague: Mouton (1973), 87. observation that a Runic inscription (niuwila on the Naesbjaerg bracteate of the 5th century) and an early loan into Finnic (*kuva 'picture', cf. Gothic skuggwa 'mirror', Old High German skūwo 'look') do not exhibit this change. If true, this would prevent Holtzmann's law being used as an example of early Gotho- Nordic unity, in which context it is often cited. Voyles's explanations of the changes do not involve laryngeal theory.  Similar developments in later Nordic languages  Faroese shows a similar development, where some Old Norse long vowels developed into diphthongs, which then hardened into stops, e.g. Old Norse þrír → Faroese tríggir, ON róa → Far. rógva. This phenomenon is commonly called \\"Faroese Verschärfung\\" or by the Faroese term skerping (\\"sharpening\\"), which, however, also is used about the fronting of vowels that subsequently takes place in these contexts. Another similar change occurs in a number of Jutlandic dialects of Danish, where high vowels carrying the stød prosody develop diphthongal glides which are then \\"hardened\\" into stops or fricatives, a phenomenon commonly called \\"klusilspring\\" (\\"stop shifting\\") or \\"klusilparasit\\" (\\"stop parasite\\").

Like much of the Armenian diaspora, most Armenians immigrated to Germany after the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Others came later, fleeing conflicts in places like Iran, Azerbaijan and Lebanon. Another influx came fleeing nationalist persecution in Turkey. After World War II, many Soviet Armenians, former POWs in particular, fled to the American occupied areas of Germany. While many traveled on, some settled in the country, providing a base for later asylum-seekers. History The first Armenian organization was the Armenian Colony of Berlin, established in 1923. By 1975, Armenian associations would be established in Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich. In the 1980s, other associations were created in Bremen, Braunschweig, Bielefeld, Duisburg, Neuwied, Bonn, Hanau, Eppingen, Nuremberg, Kehl and elsewhere. Presently, there are about 35,000 naturalized Armenians and 15,000 asylum-seeking Armenians living in Germany today. Their population is concentrated in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, many of which are Armenian asylum-seekers from Armenia, for whom the Armenian Church provides services, baptisms, Bible readings and community support. The Diocese of Germany bears all the costs of supporting Armenians from post-Soviet Armenia and regards this service as part of its mission. Germany and the Armenian Genocide While the German parliament has adopted a resolution that recognizes the \\"organized expulsion and destruction of the Armenians\\", and states that \\"numerous independent historians, parliaments and international organizations\\" have recognized the event as genocide, the resolution does not state such itself. The resolution also contains an apology for Germany's role in the Genocide (The German Monarchy was an ally of Ottoman Turkey during World War I, and did not intervene despite ample evidence of a policy of extermination) and calls on Turkey to examine its role in the ethnic cleansing.Germans press Turks on Armenian slaughter - International Herald Tribune This resolution is deemed significant due to the comparatively large number of Turkish nationals living in Germany.

He achieved critical recognition with a starring role in Lester James Peries' masterpiece Rekava and as producer of Getawarayo, Saravita and Ranmuthu Duwa. Personal life Palihakkara was born in the village of Ruppagoda, in Kadawatha of the Gampaha district. He attended the St. Benedict's College, Colombo in Kotahena and St. Joseph's College in Colombo. At the age of 14, Palihakkara witnessed the Sinhala dancer Chitrasena perform in the Vidura ballet and was inspired to be a dancer. Palihakkara left school without getting his Senior School Certificate in his late teens, and went to India to train at Shanthi Nikethan. He stayed at the school for two years focusing on dance along with painting and sculpting. Palihakkara then enrolled at the Institute of Kala Kshethra in South India majoring in dance. After finishing his studies, he returned to Sri Lanka in 1948 and took part in a national pageant organized in celebration of the country's recent independence. Later with the help of Dr. P.R. Anthonis and K.D.A. Perera, Palihakkara briefly started a dance school in Borella. He left for England in 1949 to join the Indian dancer Ramgopal's travelling ballet troupe, which performed in various venues in Europe. Shesha died on July 12, 2009. Cinema career Shesha Palihakkara with Clarice de Silva in the film Mathalang On his return to Sri Lanka, Palihakkara was asked to choreograph movies like Ahankara Isthri and Puduma Leli. He got his first starring role in Matalang and travelled to Madras, India to film the movie in 1953. Palihakkara played a cruel king and his rogue bandit son; the film was a huge success and made Palihakkara a heart throb in Sri Lanka. He next appeared in Rekava as an astrologer and stilt walker. The film wasn't a box office hit, but was critically praised and is considered a landmark in Sri Lankan cinema. In 1954, Palihakkara worked in the makeup department of the United States film Bridge on the River Kwai which was filmed in Sri Lanka. After the film was made, Palihakkara traveled to London to rejoin his friend Ramgopal and his dancing troupe. Ten months later he became a member of the Asian Music Society. In 1959 he was stricken with asthma and returned to Sri Lanka. With the help of director Mike Wilson and Sir Arthur C. Clarke, Palihakkara developed the first Sinhala colour film Ranmuthu Duwa in 1960 for his production group Serendib Productions. It was also the first Sinhala film to feature under water scenes of the ocean surrounding Sri Lanka. His second production Getawarayo was directed by Mike Wilson and Thissa Liyanasooriya and won several awards at the 1966 Sarasaviya Awards. His last production Sarawita was made the following year. Palihakkara abandoned his film career after Saravita and pursued business in the plantation industry. He returned to film in the 2000s (decade) with a role in Chandran Ratnam's production Romeo and Juliet written and directed by Rob Nevis . In 2007, Palihakkara was honored with a Ranathisara award at the Sarasaviya Festival for his contributions to cinema. Filmography  {  - ! Year !! Film !! Acting role !!

He was kept in a special camp near Vinnitsa, on August 3, 1942, together with General Andrey Vlasov, signed an appeal to the German command with an appeal for the formation of the Russian Liberation Army. In the same month he was released from the camp and on September 1, 1942 he was appointed commander of the Russian National People's Army (RNNA), created as an experiment and stationed in the village of Osintorf between Smolensk and Orsha. The work on the creation of RNNA was supervised by the Abwehr. By October 1942 there were about 8,000 thousand soldiers in this military unit, but then the German command decided to divide it into battalions, which were to be used separately by the Wehrmacht. Boyarsky opposed this decision, was arrested, but was soon released and appointed officer in command and training of the Eastern Volunteer Forces at the headquarters of the 16th Army. In this capacity, he again clashed with the German authorities and was fired. Since the summer of 1943, he inspected volunteer Russian battalions, under the command of General Vlasov. He took an active part in the creation of the Armed Forces of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (Russian Liberation Army) and the development of the political program of Armed Forces. From January to May 1945, he was Deputy Chief of Staff of the Russian Liberation Army under command of General Fyodor Truhin. On May 5, 1945, by order of Trukhin, he went to the Prague area to establish contact with the most combat- ready military unit of the KONR - the 1st Infantry Division of General Sergey Bunyachenko. In the city of Příbram, he was captured by Czech partisans commanded by the Soviet captain Smirnov. He got into a skirmish with Smirnov, gave him a slap in the face and was immediately executed by hanging. Sources *Александров К. М. (Aleksandrov K. M.) Офицерский корпус армии генерал-лейтенанта А.

Early years Strik-Strikfeldt was born in Riga, Latvia (then part of the Russian Empire), and attended the Russian Imperial Cavalry School in St. Petersburg. He attended the centenary celebrations of the Battle of Borodino in 1912, and during World War I volunteered to fight as an officer in the Imperial Russian Army against Germany. During the Russian Civil War he fought the Bolsheviks in the Baltic countries and Ingria, as a supporter of the White movement. In 1920 he met Gustav Hilger (later a Counsellor to the German Embassy in Moscow over 1939-41) in his capacity as an official co-ordinating efforts to repatriate Austrian and German military prisoners after the war. That same year Strik-Strikfeldt settled back in Riga, in the newly independent Latvia. In the early 1920s Strik-Strikfeldt was involved in Fridtjof Nansen's activities to alleviate the Great Famine in Russia. Between 1924 and 1939 he represented the interests of British and German heavy engineering companies in Latvia. His work was also part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Germany In late 1939 he joined the Baltic Volksdeutsche \\"repatriated\\" to Nazi Germany following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. His family was settled in Posen (now Poznań), the administrative capital of the Warthegau (today, the Kraj Warty, Poland). In early 1941 he was interviewed by an Army Staff Officer in Posen and asked to undertake an interpreter's examination in Berlin where he was awarded a certificate as \\"Interpreter Class A\\". Due to his service in the former Russian Imperial Army he was only inducted into the Army as a Captain. He was initially attached to Field-Marshal Fedor von Bock's HQ in the Warthegau, where he met and worked with Generalmajor (Major-General) Reinhard Gehlen and Generalmajor Henning von Tresckow. Gehlen encouraged him to lecture to other officers during the war on Der Russische Mensch (\\"The Russian Man\\") and even helped distribute Strik- Strikfeldt's lecture as an official OKW Propaganda Department paper to intelligence officers along the front line. Early in 1942 Strik-Strikfeldt was transferred to the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) \\"War Booty Collection Centre\\" office in Angerburg, East Prussia, to sort through captured Russian military papers and documents for the Fremde Heere Ost (\\"Foreign Armies East\\") of the Army General Staff. In the spring and summer he worked briefly with Gehlen and Claus von Stauffenberg. Over July and August 1942 Strik-Strikfeldt met and interviewed ex-Communist and former Soviet Army General Andrey Vlasov in a German PoW camp in Vinnitsa. The two developed a close rapport, with Vlasov addressing Strik-Strikfeldt privately by a Russian-style patronymic \\"Wilfried Karlovich\\". In September 1942 Strik-Strikfeldt was formally seconded to the OKW Propaganda Department office in Berlin as a Betreuer (\\"Confidante\\") responsible for Vlasov. : \\"In August 1942 I arrived in Berlin. The so-called Russian Collaboration Staff of the OKW/Pr was located in the Viktoriastrasse under lock and key. Barred windows, wooden bunks. Straw mattresses. No permission to leave the building. All doors were locked at night. I was shocked.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt (1970), p.83. Dabendorf Early in November 1942 Gehlen and von Stauffenberg were able to authorize the establishment of a \\"training camp for Russian volunteers, to be known as Ost-propagandaabteilung ZbV (Eastern Propaganda Department ZbV)…. The proposed camp, with huts, at Dabendorf, was not far from Berlin. In due course the Ostpropagandaabteilung was known simply as Dabendorf.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt,(1970), p.95. Propagandaabteilung Dabendorf was granted the status of an independent battalion commanded by Captain Strik-Strikfeldt and although initially conceived as a 50-strong unit, he immediately pushed to increase its size to 1,200. :\\"My official task, with that of my German and Russian staff, was to recruit and train 'propagandists', i.e. Betreuer, for the Russian Volunteers and Auxiliaries and the same for all permanent and transit prison camps throughout the whole of German-dominated Europe.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt (1970), p.99. At Dabendorf Strik-Strikfeldt and his staff initiated two Russian language newspapers : Dobrovolets (\\"Volunteers\\") for the ordinary Russian volunteers and auxiliaries serving in the Army and Zarya (\\"Dawn\\") for the PoWs. Strik-Strikfeldt also persuaded Vlasov to publish, in March 1943, his article \\"Why I took up the struggle against Bolshevism\\" (a bitter attack on the Soviet system) and in April 1943, his pamphlet on the nationalities/minorities issue within Russia and Europe. In February 1943 Sergei Frohlich, a \\"resettled\\" Baltic Volksdeutsche from Riga working in the HQ staff of the SA, was appointed liaison officer with Vlasov's staff. Strik- Strikfeldt knew Frohlich well as they had played ice hockey in rival teams as youths. Frohlich was able to help provide Strik-Strikfeldt, Vlasov and Dabendorf with small arms, extra food rations and quarters. In 1943 Strik- Strikfeldt escorted Vlasov to Vienna where he served as an interpreter at an official meeting with Baldur von Schirach. Then he took Vlasov to Munich and the Allgäu in Bavaria. Afterwards they travelled together to Frankfurt and Mainz, and took a steamer down the Rhine to Cologne. Later they met with Dr. Julius Lippert (the Stadtpräsident of Berlin), and also the Minister of Finance, Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, to discuss the Russian liberation movement and the urgent need to reform the treatment of Russian labourers inside Germany. :\\"I regarded Dabendorf as the heart of the Russian Liberation Movement and as a purely Russian centre. So that from the beginning I had refrained from any sort of interference in Russian affairs.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt (1970), p.167. By late Autumn 1943 Dabendorf was under constant criticism from the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories (the Ostministerium), the Sicherheitsdienst (\\"Security Service\\") of the SS, and even rival elements within the Army who wanted to absorb and \\"assimilate\\" Dabendorf. When many Russian Hiwi's were withdrawn from the Eastern Front and sent to work on fortifications in the West, Dabendorf sent propagandists to raise morale and soothe troubled spirits. However several were arrested in France and others sent directly back to Dabendorf. Strik-Strikfeldt was obliged to travel to Paris and liaise with the German military authorities there. In January 1944 Strik-Strikfeldt was interviewed by General Köstring when the latter was appointed head of the Osttruppen formations. Köstring confirmed that the Führer would never deviate from his Russian policy and told Strik-Strikfeldt : \\"The fact is that Hitler will have nothing to do with Vlasov.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt (1970), p.184. The SS In the spring of 1944 Strik-Strikfeldt was introduced to SS-Standartenführer Gunter d'Alquen, the Chief Editor of the SS weekly newspaper, Das Schwarze Korps (\\"The Black Corps\\"), and commander of the SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers. Henceforth some senior SS officers began to take a positive interest in Vlasov and his movement. The most interested was Dr. Fritz Arlt, head of the Freiwilligen-Leitstelle-Ost (\\"Volunteer Central Office - East\\"). Arlt informed Strik-Strikfeldt that the Waffen-SS intended to make greater use of Soviet and Eastern European minorities under SS auspices. Strik-Strikfeldt also held meetings at this time with SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf (the deputy secretary of state in the Ministry for Economics and former commander of Einsatzgruppe D), SS-Brigadeführer Walter Schellenberg (head of Ausland-SD) and Dr. Otto Wächter (creator of the Ukrainian 14th Waffen-SS Division). Strik-Strikfeldt was even initially interviewed by the head of the SS recruitment office, SS-General Gottlob Berger. Strik-Strikfeldt was then obliged to arrange a personal meeting between Vlasov and Berger where the latter appointed SS-Oberführer Erhard Kroeger as a formal liaison officer between Vlasov and the SS. Strik-Strikfeldt agreed since Kroeger had been involved in the resettlement of Baltic Volksdeutsche over 1939-1940. At this meeting Berger also proposed a formal meeting between Vlasov and Heinrich Himmler. :\\"It seemed that the SS now, in the early summer of 1944, were to take the opportunity that the Army had missed back in 1941.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt (1970), p.198. On 16 September 1944 Strik-Strikfeldt and Vlasov met the Reichsführer-SS at the latter's field HQ in Rastenburg, East Prussia. Himmler had been placed in command of the Ersatzheer (\\"Replacement Army\\") following the 20 July plot, and was therefore in a position to supply Dabendorf with military equipment and training, and even offered vague political concessions. An official communiqué was issued to mark the occasion. Returning to Berlin in a train, Strik-Strikfeldt shared a sleeper with Dr. Felix Kersten (Himmler's personal masseur and an Estonian-born Baltic German) who claimed to have been supporting their \\"good cause\\". There was an enthusiastic reception for Strik- Strikfeldt and Vlasov at Dabendorf and work began immediately to prepare the ill-fated Manifesto of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia. :\\"When General Gehlen came back to duty I gave him an unvarnished report. Himmler had appointed the SS General Berger as his plenipotentiary in all Russian affairs. Kroeger was liaison officer. SS Colonel Burg had the task of setting up the Russian divisions. Gehlen asked me to stay with Vlasov for as long as I could.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt (1970), p.209. Late in 1944 Strik- Strikfeldt met the Cossack White Army-era General Pyotr Krasnov and tried to convince him to join Vlasov but to no avail. Strik-Strikfeldt was not invited to Prague for the formal ceremony declaring the Manifesto of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia. However General Gehlen ordered him to arrange a meeting and translate between Vlasov and General Ernst Köstring, so he was present at the official programme. At the evening banquet Vlasov made a speech and publicly acknowledged an \\"unnamed German officer of the rank of Captain\\". :\\"Later, I was invited to join Vlasov and [Georgii] Zhilenkov at a table where they were sitting with a senior SS officer. He turned out to be deputy head of Personnel Department of the Waffen-SS. They quickly came to the point : I should transfer to the SS and remain with Vlasov. Vlasov emphasized that this was not his proposal, though he would be glad if I were to come back to him.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt (1970), p.220. Strik-Strikfeldt tried to squirm out of the offer and Gehlen arranged for him to take sick leave in Pomerania where he wrote up a rough draft history of the Vlasov movement that would later serve as the basis for his 1970 book \\"Gegen Stalin und Hitler. General Wlassow und die russische Freiheitsbewegung\\" (\\"Against Stalin and Hitler: Memoir of the Russian Liberation Movement\\"). In December 1944 one of Gehlen's officers visited Strik-Strikfeldt and asked him to help accommodate units of the Russian Liberation Army in the Posen area. :\\"A fellow-Balt provided an introduction to Greiser, who quickly grasped the position and promised help.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt (1970), p.222. On 20 January 1945 Strik-Strikfeldt's wife, and daughter Dela, were evacuated from Posen. Three days later Sergei Frohlich ordered him to travel to Frankfurt an der Oder immediately, whence he was collected and taken to Dabendorf. :\\"I went to Zossen to see General Gehlen, who told me to go and find my family. After many adventures I found them in the little village of Sallgast between Finsterwalde and Senftenberg. My mother wanted to stay there, she was tired of being on the move. All her life she had been a refugee.\\"Strik-Strikfeldt (1970), p.225. In early April 1945 Gehlen had Strik-Strikfeldt posted as sick and after some confusion at the OKH, he left and took his family to the Allgäu. On 14 April Vlasov, Kroeger, and a few senior officers of the Russian Liberation Army tracked him down and they had their last meeting. Strik-Strikfeldt agreed to negotiate their surrender with the Western powers. Interrogated by the US Colonel Snyder and later General Patch, Strik-Strikfeldt became a PoW and was moved to Augsburg where he was interned with Göring and Gehlen amongst others. Later he was transferred to Mannheim and interned with Field-Marshals von Blomberg, List, von Weichs and von Leeb; and Generals Guderian and Köstring. Here he also met up with Gustav Hilger again and Hitler's personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann. Death Strik-Strikfeldt died in Oberstaufen in September 1977. His 1970 memoirs, Gegen Stalin und Hitler. General Wlassow und die russische Freiheitsbewegung (Against Stalin and Hitler: Memoir of the Russian Liberation Movement), are an important source regarding the Russian Liberation Movement and General Vlasov, and also the role played by Baltic Germans.

(ΛΨΔ) is an independent, multicultural, community service-based Greek-lettered sorority founded on March 9, 1997. Lambda Psi Delta (referred to as \\"LPsiD\\") was established by a group of women known as the \\"9 Black Diamonds\\", on the basis of true sisterhood and community outreach, and is a founding member of the National Multicultural Greek Council.  History  Lambda Psi Delta Sorority, Inc. was founded on March 9, 1997 in Connecticut by Nine Strong Women formerly part of a Latina sorority. These women originally pledged to be a part of an organization that would bring them sisterhood, empowerment, opportunities for service, academic achievement and personal growth among other things. As their time in that organization grew, however, they found that sorority to be lacking in its internal structure, constricting in its outlets for service, limiting in its definitions of sisterhood and cultural identity and fraught with internal and external strife. After numerous years of struggling to work through these many issues, they realized their vision of a sisterhood was in direct contradiction with that of the original organization. So they made the decision to leave, to strike out on their own. After looking around at other sororities, they noticed that what they envisioned was nowhere in sight. So they saw what was their mission: to create an organization whose primary goal was the upliftment and empowerment of women and their communities through intellectual and leadership development and cultural awareness. They sought to create an organization where each woman could fight for her own cause in her own community, at the same time uniting all other communities to support and aid in the struggle through the works of the sorority. And so, Lambda Psi Delta, a multi-ethnic, service based organization, for women by women and about women, was formed to give all women a chance to experience true sisterhood. Over 15 years later, Lambda Psi Delta is still going strong and gaining recognition for the works done on both the national and chapter level. Some of which include winning academic and Greek-related awards on the respective campuses of the undergrad chapters, spearheading the founding of the National Multicultural Greek Council alongside Mu Sigma Upsilon. Lambda Psi Delta Sorority, Inc. is rapidly growing to having undergraduate chapters in various states such as Florida, New Jersey, Connecticut, Texas and Louisiana as well as two graduate chapters.  Mission  Their principle [sic] purposes are to engage in the upliftment and empowerment of women and our communities through intellectual development, cultural awareness, and leadership, and to engage in educational, cultural, political, and public service activities that express and support such concerns. Although they work primarily in minority communities, our members hail from a variety of backgrounds including African, Afro-American, Anglo-American, Belizean, Chilean, Chinese, Colombian, Costa Rican, Dominican, East Indian, El Salvadoran, Ecuadorian, Filipino, Guatemalan, Greek, Haitian, Hungarian, Italian, Iranian, Irish, Jamaican, Korean, Mexican, Pakistani, Palestinian, Polish, Puerto Rican, Russian, Somalian, Scottish, West Indian, Transylvanian, Vietnamese and many others, and devote their energies to a number of different causes that support and promote our Five Tenets.  Tenets  The sorority's Five Tenets are: * Intellectual Development * Empowerment of Women * Leadership * Cultural Awareness * Upliftment of the Community The Five Tenets serve as the foundation for the sorority's National Public and Political Service Program efforts and provide the ideals and virtues for which each soror strives in her personal and professional life. Through the Five Tenets and the virtues of true sisterhood and community outreach, Lambda Psi Delta strives to educate its surrounding communities and empower the community to make significantly enhancements for the betterment of all.  Founding Mothers  Lambda Psi Delta was founded by nine strong, dynamic women who are referred to as the Nine Black Diamonds. They are: # Ericka Ramos Carrasquillo, Esq. # Irma Beatriz Cordero, MSW # Margarita Martis Navarro # Isabel Veguilla, MFA # Paula Arputhasamy Ladd, Esq. # Laura Elaine Gilbert # Karina Tejeda # Marina Lori Franzoni, N.D. # Denise J. Pipersburgh, Esq.  Service  One of the sorority’s governing principles is a fundamental commitment to empowering and uplifting the larger community, as well as marked political involvement in order to initiate and promote political change. The sorority's commitment to the goals stems from the belief that, through personal initiative, the members may, collectively, accomplish great advances at all levels within their communities. The Lambda Psi Delta Service Program is aimed at encouraging and promoting service and contributions that pertain to its Five Tenets in two key ways: * Public service, which refers to our engagement and support of public service initiatives that benefit and uplift women, children and our communities; and * Political service, which refers to our active involvement in current political issues that benefit and uplift the larger community. A key aspect of the sorority’s National Public and Political Service Program is the initiation and implementation of the sorority’s own service programs in which its sorors and chapters engage in as part of its commitment to the community. Such commitment to original programming is evidenced by such programs as: the LPsiD College Resource Center; Unity Day; and the sorority’s proprietary educational campaigns, which address current societal concerns. The sorority's National Public and Political Service Program is designed around its Focus Initiatives, which address timely public and political service concerns within our communities. The current Focus Initiatives include: and Multiple Sclerosis Research and Development, and STEP UP – SPEAK OUT! Bullying Awareness and Prevention Campaign – a partnership initiative with Omega Phi Chi Sorority, Inc.  LILies  The LILies is the official interest group of Lambda Psi Delta Sorority, Inc.

It is considered Risi's masterpiece and one of the best examples of Commedia all'italiana film genre. Plot The film starts in a hazy, sun-baked and seemingly empty Rome on an August morning during Ferragosto national holiday. A young, timid law student, Roberto (Trintignant), gazing out his window, is asked for trivial favor, a phone call, by a 40-ish man named Bruno (Gassman), who is passing on the street below at the wheel of a convertible Lancia Aurelia. The young man tells him to come up and make the call himself. After Bruno fails to contact his friends — he is running a full hour late for his meeting with them, something he apparently doesn't deem a good motive enough for them to have \\"abandoned\\" him— he insists on repaying Roberto's courtesy with an aperitivo. Tired of studying for the day and falling prey to Bruno's enthusiasm, the young man accepts. Thus begins a cruise along the Via Aurelia, the Roman road that also gives the name to Bruno's beloved car. Roberto is unwilling or unable to part from this casual acquaintance despite having almost nothing in common with him. Bruno is loud, brash, risk taking, a bit coarse and a braggart, to boot. He drives recklessly, speeding and constantly attempting \\"il Sorpasso\\" — the impatient and aggressive practice of serial tailgating and honking to overtake other cars on the road. But he is also charming and likable. And Roberto, being his complete opposite, feels drawn to Bruno's impulsive, devil-may-care attitude. Over two days of highs and lows across the coasts of Lazio and Tuscany, the two men fall into various adventures while gradually managing to learn something of each other. When, for example, the duo spontaneously drops in on Roberto's relatives, en route, the young law student suddenly realizes that his childhood wasn't as golden as he'd always imagined. And later he finds out about Bruno's failed marriage and young daughter, revealing a life not nearly as carefree as Bruno pretends to lead. When this free-wheeling road-trip movie crescendos to its dramatic ending, the bonding and emerging friendship between the two men is cut short. Spurred on by a seemingly transformed Roberto, Bruno speeds while attempting to overtake another car on the blind curve of a cliffside road. This risky maneuver results in a fatal accident. The younger man goes over a rocky cliff in the car, leaving a bloodied and shocked Bruno on the curve's edge. When a motorway cop arrives and asks Bruno for Roberto's last name, the survivor realizes he does not even know it. Cast * Vittorio Gassman - Bruno Cortona * Jean-Louis Trintignant - Roberto Mariani * Catherine Spaak - Lilli Cortona * Claudio Gora - Bibi * Luigi Zerbinati - commendatore * Luciana Angiolillo - Bruno's wife * Linda Sini - Aunt Lidia * Nando Angelini - Amedeo Reception and legacy The movie is considered as one of the best examples of Commedia all'Italiana. Film critics frequently acknowledge that the story offers a poignant portrait of Italy in the early 1960s, when the \\"economic miracle\\" (dubbed the \\"boom\\" — using the actual English word — by the local media) was starting to transform the country from a traditionally agricultural and family-centered society into a shallower, individualistic and consumeristic one.

They named a MotoGuzzi V11 cafe racer: \\"Sorpasso\\".Emporio Elaborazioni Meccaniche WordPress Soundtrack The soundtrack includes original themes by Riz Ortolani, and Italian 1960s hits such as \\"Saint Tropez Twist\\" by Peppino di Capri, \\"Quando, quando, quando\\" performed by Emilio Pericoli, \\"Guarda come dondolo\\" and \\"Pinne fucile ed occhiali\\" by Edoardo Vianello and \\"Vecchio frac\\" by Domenico Modugno.

The group was founded by The Anonymous Mis and G-Boah in 1993. They were influenced by Kool G Rap, Eric B & Rakim, Burning Spear and Bob Marley. On the road, Postmen play with a live band and have appeared on some the largest festivals in Europe. Just before their debut LP Documents, Rollarocka joins the band and a string of hit singles followed. They enjoyed success in Europe, particularly in their home country of the Netherlands; their string of top 40-hits included \\"Cocktail\\", \\"Crisis\\", \\"U Wait\\" and a cover-version of Doe Maar's 1982 chart-topper \\"De Bom\\" (in collaboration with rapper Def Rhymz). Postmen received regular radio-airplay (particularly during the summer season) although their second and third albums (Revival and Era) were less successful. Postmen split up in 2005 because the three members had drifted apart. Anonymous Mis continued as Postman and released his solo-album Green in 2006. The first single Downhill features vocals from his award- winning rockstar-wife Anouk. They spent a year in Ohio with their three children to escape the pressures of fame, but eventually settled in Amsterdam. In May 2008 the couple announced their break-up. Anonymous Mis continued with his current wife Alyssa Stotijn. 2012 saw the return of both Rollarocka (who released a solo-album as Maikal X) and the original name Postmen. They collaborated on a new version of the Doe Maar-song Alles Gaat Voorbij alongside rapper Kraantje Pappie and rerecorded De Bom for inclusion on the Versies-album, which Anonymous Mis produced.

The lighthouse was built in 1849 and is the second oldest in New Jersey, with only the Sandy Hook Light, which was built in 1764, being older. The light was inactive from 1941 and was nearly destroyed by fire in 1971. The light was reinstated by the United States Coast Guard in 1980. Exterior restoration was completed in 1999. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1995 for its significance in engineering, maritime history, and transportation. It became part of the Maurice River Lighthouse and East Point Archeological District on October 30, 2015. The lighthouse was just recently fully restored, both the exterior and interior work was completed in 2017. The lighthouse is now both an active navigational aid and a year-round museum open to the public for tours and special events throughout the year. Status The light is said to be critically endangered due to erosion. Although local governments routinely shore up the property's perimeter, using sand bags and bulldozers, the lighthouse is a mere from the shore. There was four times the beach as revealed by 1940 aerial photos. During storms the surf is from its front steps. A rally to save the lighthouse was held in the fall of 2018. Since then more sandbags have been added, paid for by the State of New Jersey and using the sandbags available the sandbag seawall was rebuilt by coordinated efforts of both the Maurice River Township and Cumberland County Road Departments. A geotube system is planned to be installed the summer of 2019 by the State of New Jersey to help hold the point and protect the lighthouse until more lasting measures can be taken.

The album reached No. 42 on the US charts, and the single \\"After the Fire\\", written by Pete Townshend, reached No. 48. It includes a tribute to Keith Moon, former drummer of The Who who died in 1978, on the track \\"Under a Raging Moon\\". In Canada, the album reached No. 33 on the RPM Magazine charts, and \\"After the Fire\\" reached No. 53. The album was produced by Alan Shacklock, recorded at RAK Recording Studios and Odyssey Studios, London, and released on Atlantic Records in the US. Later the album was also released on CD (Atlantic 7 81269-1) in the US, including the bonus track \\"Love Me Like You Do\\", written by Andy Nye. The track \\"Under a Raging Moon\\" was written by John Parr and Julia Downes. The track was a tribute to Keith Moon who died in 1978. It was said that John Entwistle had wanted to play this song instead of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" at Live Aid in 1985 with The Who, but Pete Townshend disagreed so Entwistle decided to record his own version on his live solo album Left for Live as a further tribute to Moon. The album featured Zak Starkey playing drums; this was Starkey's second album that he had worked on, the other being Sun City released in the same year by Artists United Against Apartheid. Daltrey later recalled \\"That was the album I really wanted to make ... it got great airplay and sold an awful lot.\\" Critical reception Mike DeGagne of Allmusic wrote about the title track: \\"Daltrey's thunderous but passionate ode to his former friend and drummer Keith Moon is a fervent downpour of frustration that can be truly felt inside every line of the song. A spectacular drum solo from Mark Brzezicki is a modest tribute to the late Moon and adds depth indefinitely.\\" Track listing Extra track released on CD and cassette, not LP This track was included as track six on the album, but only on the CD and cassette editions, not the record.

It was designed to use the unsuccessful ABC Dragonfly engine and was abandoned after the first prototype was built. Development The DH.11 Oxford was designed by Geoffrey de Havilland for the Aircraft Manufacturing Company as a twin-engined day bomber to replace the Airco DH.10. It was designed (as required by the Specification) to use the ABC Dragonfly radial engine which promised to give excellent performance and had been ordered in large numbers to be the powerplant for most of the new types on order for the Royal Air Force. The DH.11 was a twin- engined biplane, with all-wood construction and three-bay wings. It had an aerodynamically clean, deep fuselage occupying the whole wing gap, giving a good field of fire for the gunners in the nose and mid-upper positions. The first prototype flew in January 1919, powered by two Dragonfly engines. The prototype encountered handling problems, and was handicapped by the Dragonfly engines, which were extremely unreliable, being prone to overheating and excessive vibration, while not delivering the expected power. Two further prototypes were cancelled in 1919, with no aircraft in the end being purchased to replace the DH.10.

The firm was owned by the UK Government from 1928 and was the only bookmaker in Britain allowed to offer parimutuel betting on horse racing. The Tote was then sold to Betfred in July 2011 for £265 million, allowing them to offer parimutuel betting services. The Tote was sold by Betfred to the UK Tote Group in October 2019. In February 2020 the Tote launched a new website for customers - www.tote.co.uk The pooled bets offered by the Tote are: Win, Place, Exacta, Trifecta, Quadpot, Placepot, Jackpot, Scoop6 and Swinger.  Terminology  As other bookmakers can offer similar gambling services it is necessary to disambiguate the bets. A bookmaker win- only bet (on-the-nose) isn't the same as a Tote Win bet, as the bookmaker is offering fixed odds for that particular outcome, while the Tote is a dividend paid out from the betting pool. The betting pool is generated from individuals placing money on a Tote bet. A price quote for a horse on the Tote is the current dividend payout on the event of that outcome happening. This tends to be similar to normal bookmaker odds, and tracks the market in a similar way, but at any given time may be better or worse than a bookmaker's quoted odds. However, since all bets are pooled, all bets are essentially \\"starting price\\" (SP), that is, until the race has started (and all betting finished) one cannot calculate what the final payout will be; whereas bookmakers can offer either SP or a \\"board price\\", that is, a guaranteed payout at a given price for a winning bet. (The SP for horse races is the average price offered by bookmakers when the race starts, as inspected by employees of the Jockey Club). In 2020 the Tote launched Tote Guarantee ensuring Tote win bets will never pay out less than the SP.  Tote Win  The minimum stake for this bet is £2. One selects a horse from the field. This can be on any horse at any race meeting. The betting slip can be denoted with the horse's race card number, or the horses name (and if at another course, the name of the course), or it can be marked as the 'favourite', where the horse is not nominated but the bet is placed on whichever horse is favourite (has the largest amount of money put into the pool) at the start of the race. This will, obviously, have the lowest payout (since the pool will be shared with the largest number of winners) but the assumption is that if others have bet on it, it must have a good chance of winning.  Tote Place  A Tote Place bet is still on one, but the horse may come second, third or even fourth for the bet to win. Not every race qualifies for this type of bet. There must be a minimum of 5 horses in the field, the minimum stake is £2 and the following rules apply: {  - ! Number of runners ! Dividend places -  Up to 4 runners  Unavailable -  5, 6 or 7 runners  1 - 2 -  8 - 15 runners in handicaps 8+ runners in non-handicaps  1 - 2 - 3 -  16+ runners handicaps  1 - 2 - 3 - 4 }  Each-Way  It is also possible to have an each-way (\\"e/w\\") bet, which is simply a combination of a Tote Win with a Tote Place bet. A £1 e/w bet is a total of £2, £1 for the Tote Win and the other £1 is for the Tote Place, and the money is split between the two separate pools (the Win pool and the Place pool). Bookmakers other than the Tote do not generally offer a place-only bet, but only an each-way bet. This can be seen as a waste by bettors who believe their selection will finish 2nd or 3rd but will not come 1st; since half the money falls on the \\"win\\" it is wasted. A non-Tote bookmaker will offer a quarter or a fifth for the e/w component, whereas the Tote place payout, and as such the e/w payout, is as always the betting pool dividend. With the advent of the exchanges, more and more bookmakers are beginning to offer 'place only' markets in an attempt to rival the exchanges. However, there is not a set in stone way for a punter to calculate the place odds as there is with an each-way bet, and the special place only odds offered by bookmakers can vary quite a bit, both bigger and smaller, from the place odds you would receive if betting each-way. This is particularly true in \\"bad each-way\\" races, where the place odds are much less generous than if you bet each-way. The upside to this however goes back to what was said above; since the punter does not have to \\"waste\\" half their stake on the win part of the bet.  Tote Exacta  The Tote Exacta operates in the same way as a normal bookmaker's straight forecast. As always the Tote price for the forecast is always based on the betting pool dividend. A forecast is to predict the correct order of the horses finishing first and second. The minimum bet is £2 and the multiples of 10 pence over this, multiples can also be used to reach the initial minimum of £2. If the bet contains a non-runner the bet becomes void and unnamed favourites are not allowed. There are three Exacta bets: Single Exacta (straight forecast). Pick in the correct order the horses which will finish first and second. Combination Exacta (reverse forecast). Pick in either order the horses which will finish first and second. This bet is actually two bets in one, it is exactly equivalent to two straight forecasts, the first of which you select horse A to beat horse B, and then the second is for horse B to beat horse A. It's possible to specify more than two horses, at which point the bet becomes more complex, for example with three horses the individual bets are now a-b, a-c, b-a, b-c, c-a, c-b. Banker Exacta (banker forecast). Pick a horse which you think is going to finish first, and then any number of horses to finish second. For instances, with a banker horse a, and with three additional horses, the bets are a-b, a-c, a-d. Bookmakers that are not Tote-syndicated will offer their own forecast prices based on their own odds that they are quoting. However bookmakers will normally allow you to place a 'Tote forecast' and will pay out whatever the Tote dividend payout was.  Tote Trifecta  Also known as a Trifecta: pick the first three horses in the right order. This is generally really difficult to do and the dividend for getting it right is correspondingly better. The Tote can nominate races containing more than 8 runners as Trifecta races. There are three types of Trifecta, the Single, Combination and Banker and they work the same way as Exacta bets, only with three horses instead of two. The minimum stake is £2.  Tote Quadpot  A Quadpot is operated at every meeting in the UK and it takes place on the third to sixth races on the card. The aim is to pick a horse that will be placed in each one of these races, according to the placing rules stated in the Tote Place section above. The minimum bet is 10p. The dividend is declared after the result of the last race is known and thus the betting pool divided by the remaining stakes which are left. One may select the favourite instead of naming a specific horse.  Tote Placepot  The Placepot is identical to the Quadpot except it operates over the first six races of a race card. All UK race meetings have six races as a minimum, occasionally seven and rarely eight, but the Placepot is always operated on the first six. This bet is very popular as it has the potential to allow a gambler involvement in the whole of the race card. The minimum bet is 5p. Here is a worked example: {  - ! Race ! Selection 1 ! Selection 2 ! Selection 3 ! Selection 4 -  One  2  7   -  Two  F    -  Three  F  11   -  Four  4    -  Five  6    -  Six  F  1  3 } The first race the gambler has opted to choose two horses. Maybe the gambler isn't confident of his abilities or maybe it is a large field and the gambler feels unable to just place one horse. On race two the gambler has elected to roll with the favourite, whatever it may be. In the final race the gambler has chosen three selections. This is often driven by the motive that if the gambler reaches the last race and still has a bet on, he doesn't want to lose out in the last race by only having one selection. The number of combinations in this bet is therefore 2 × 1 × 2 × 1 × 1 × 3 = 12. The gambler has decided to risk 20p per bet, so the total cost of this bet is £2.40. If after the first race the gambler has failed to pick a selection which was placed then the bet is over. If a selection is placed, then the bet continues, and the winnings are transferred as the stake on the second race. In this example, horse 2 may be placed and horse 7 unplaced, which means the bet continues – but there are now only 6 valid combinations for winning left. If the gambler is lucky and managed to get through to the end, then the Tote will calculate the dividend for a £1 unit stake. In this example the Tote is going to declare the dividend as £30, and the lucky gambler has 2 winning combinations. Two combinations at a stake level of 20p is 40p, so 40% of £30 is £12, a profit of £9.60. If a favourite is placed in every single race the Placepot payout is typically as low as it can get, and it could be anywhere from £3 to £15, although anything less than £6–£7 is quite unusual. If favourites fail to finish in the places for half of the races then something around the £40–£200 could be anticipated, placepots of over £25,000 have been known but they are extremely uncommon. However, there isn't a science to guessing what the placepot might be, the placepot dividend is the calculation of the number of tickets left divided by the pool money. There are a couple of additional rules which affect the operation of the Placepot (and indeed the Quadpot/Jackpot/Scoop6). If a selection becomes a non-runner it will be replaced by the Starting Price favourite. Where there are joint favourites and the gambler has selected to roll on the Favourite, then the horse with the lowest race card number will be taken. If the favourite withdraws (for instance, the horse refuses to enter its starting gate) and the market has no time to select a new favourite the horse with the next shortest odds will become the favourite. It's rare for a race card to progress without a couple of non-runners so a gambler will be affected by these rules from time to time.  Tote Jackpot  The Tote Jackpot is a bet where you have to pick the first 6 winners at a meeting nominated by The Tote. The bet is available every day of the week excluding Saturday. The minimum stake is £1 and multiples are in multiples of 50p. Typically the payouts are very good for the Jackpot as it is very difficult to pick six winners in a row. The betting pool will roll into the next Jackpot event if there is no dividend to pay.  Tote Scoop6  Similar to the Tote Jackpot, Tote Scoop6 is run on Saturdays and occasionally on other days such as Boxing Day, and has been branded this way for television audiences, generally Scoop6 races are shown on terrestrial television in the UK. The stake for one line is £2, as opposed to a minimum 50p in the case of the Jackpot. As the pool will roll-over in the event of there being no dividends to pay the pool can become very large and wins in excess of £500,000 have been known. There is also a bonus fund whereby the winner of a Scoop6 event can attempt to pick the winner of the most difficult race in next week's Scoop6. This bet is also a Placepot bet, as the Tote also payout a dividend for selecting a horse to be placed in each race. According to the Tote, the average dividend is over £500 for a winning place line. There is a major operational difference to this bet as compared to the Jackpot/Placepot/Quadpot: the six races on the Scoop6 card are nominated by the Tote from any of the race meetings on that day, typically the Scoop6 card will have a number of very difficult races such as handicap races with over 20 horses running, and races with 2- or 3-year-olds where many horses have no track record, making it difficult to select a winner. It is also the reason why the placepot payouts are correspondingly higher than a normal placepot as well. The televised coverage usually announces how many Scoop6 tickets are left after each Scoop6 race, and it is quite common to be left with only three or four tickets after the first four races. As with other Tote bets, non- syndicated bookmakers will normally accept a Tote bet and pay out in line with the Tote dividend.  Toteswinger  This is a single-race exotic bet available on all races of six or more runners at every meeting, every day, players have to pick two horses to finish 1st, 2nd or 3rd in any order. Each bet offers three chances to win as follows: * Picking the horses that finish first and second in any order * Picking the horses that finish first and third in any order * Picking the horses that finish second and third in any order A different dividend is declared for each outcome. The minimum unit stake for a toteswinger bet is 10p (shops and online). Minimum unit stake on-course is 50p with minimum total spend £2 as per all totepool on-course bets. Toteswinger is unique to the tote; there is no other equivalent fixed odds or SP bet. This is an extremely popular bet in overseas racing markets, particularly South Africa where it accounts for 40% of pool turnover.

The consumption of organic wine grew at a rate of 3.7 percent over the year ending September 19, 2009,The Nielson Company out-pacing growth in the consumption of non- organic wine which grew 2%Mintel Market Research during a similar period. There are an estimated 1500–2000 organic wine producers globally, including negociant labels, with more than 885 of these organic domaines in France alone. The legal definition of organic wine varies from country to country. The primary difference in the way that organic wine is defined relates to the use (or non use) of preservatives during the winemaking process. Production and preservatives Wine production comprises two main phases - that which takes place in the vineyard (i.e. grape growing) and that which takes place in the winery (i.e. fermentation of the grapes into wine, bottling etc.). The baseline definition of organic wine as \\"wine made with grapes farmed organically\\", deals only with the first phase (grape growing). There are numerous potential inputs which can be made during the second phase of production in order to ferment and preserve the wine. The most universal wine preservative is sulphur dioxide. The issue of wine preservation is central to the discussion of how organic wine is defined. Wine matures over time, and it is widely considered that certain types of wines improve with aging, as the flavors become more integrated and balanced. As a result, the greatest percentage of wines are produced in a way that allows them to last, sometimes as long as decades. The use of added sulfites is debated heavily within the organic winemaking community. Many vintners favor their use for stabilization of wine, while others frown on them. Currently the only effective preservatives that allow wines to last for a long period are 'non-organic'. While there are a growing number of producers making wine without added preservatives, it is generally acknowledged that these wines are for consumption within a few years of bottling. The various legal definitions of organic wine serve to address this challenge regarding the use of preservatives. In wine produced in the European union addition of sulphites, used as presevatives, are allowed in organic wine, but at lower maximum levels than in conventional wine production.Wine And Water Watch: \\"America vs. Europe: The Organic Divide\\" It other countries the preservative is not allowed at all in organic wine. In the United States, wines certified \\"organic\\" under the National Organic Program cannot contain added sulfites, but wines labelled as “wine made from organic grapes\\" can.Organic Wine Journal: Wine Journal In 2017, according to the survey \\"Le bio, c'est bon pour l'emploi\\" conducted by the UMR Moisa (Supagro Montpellier/Inra), an organic wine farm creates 1.5 times more jobs than a non-organic wine farm. Another finding is that jobs in this sector are more stable. 34.6% of organic farms employ one or more permanent employees against 21.6% in the case of non-certified farms. Similarly, 71.49% of employees are full-time, compared to 66.83% on non- organic farms. Organic vs. conventional winegrowing In the US, strict rules govern the organic winemaking process at all stages of production including harvesting, the types of yeast that can be used during fermentation as well as storage conditions. These rules are applied for all imported and domestic wines that acquire USDA certification. In the US, the total sulfite level must be less than 20 parts per million in order to receive organic certification. Organic certification in the UK is more simple as it is based upon the fact that the grapes are grown organically. Organic certification  Organic certification of wine is complex; different nations have different certification criteria. In the United States, the National Organic Program, run by the United States Department of Agriculture, sets standards for certification of organic foods, including organic wines. In the United Kingdom, organic wine is defined as such made out of organic grapes. Some wineries that are technically organic choose not to be certified for various reasons. Natural wine Natural winemaking is a style loosely defined as using native yeasts in the fermentation process and minimal or no sulfur dioxide in the winemaking process. It may also mean unfined and unfiltered as well. Natural winemaking is not governed by laws in the U.S. and has no inspection or verification process unless it is a biodynamic wine. Estimates are that less than 10 percent of the organically grown wine in the United States is made in a natural winemaking style, most of which is certified biodynamic wine. Natural winemakers may use organic or biodynamic grapes in their wines. Using native yeasts and relying on minimal manipulation often means that wines have a varying profile from year to year. Different vintages vary more than conventionally made wine because of the non-interventionist approach. This is a key part of the natural wine aesthetic which emphasizes the least amount of intervention. The natural wine movement has grown in popularity in part as a backlash against the Parkerization of wine, in which a small number of critics' palates and the points system has come to define the market value of wines. The effect of this on wine producers has been to try to manipulate the taste of their wine (for example trying to increase the intensity of fruit and oak) in order to please certain wine critics and get higher ratings.The Battle for Wine and Love: or How I Saved the World from Parkerization by Alice Feiring As a result, critics of these critics say this is causing an increasing uniformity amongst wines and a loss of regional and varietal character. The natural wine movement is one response to the global commodification of winemaking. Sustainable wines Some farmers take additional steps beyond standard organic winemaking to apply sustainable farming practices. Examples include the use of composting and the cultivation of plants that attract insects that are beneficial to the health of the vines. Sustainable practices in these vineyards can also extend to actions that have seemingly little or nothing to do with the production of grapes such as providing areas for wildlife to prevent animals from eating the grapes and allowing weeds and wildflowers to grow between the vines. Sustainable farmers may use bio-diesel for tractors in the vineyards to reduce emissions among the vines, or plough with horses. Sustainable winemaking is a systems perspective of integration of the natural and human resources, involving environmental health, economic profitability, and social and economic equity. It requires small, realistic, and measurable steps as defined in the Code of Sustainable Winegrowing Practices Workbook published by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance (CSWA).

It was put into use starting in 1849 and became British law in 1854. Previous methods Previous methods of calculating tonnage, as Builder's Old Measurement, were not being consistently applied and, because they were designed for sailing ships, could not be applied appropriately or fairly for steamships. Substantial portions of a steamship were required for boilers, machinery and coal, thus limiting the proportion of the ship's space available for cargo. Moorsom commission In 1849, the United Kingdom appointed a Commission with Admiral George Moorsom as secretary to resolve these problems. The Commission determined that fees should be proportional to the earning capacity of the ship, whether for cargo or passengers. The result was called The Moorsom System, which set forth the rules for the measurement of the internal volume of entire ship. * The total internal volume was divided by to produce the gross register tonnage. * Net register tonnage was the volume remaining after subtracting the volume of the space used for machinery and other non-revenue producing functions. The Commission sought to avoid a significant change in the fees charged to an existing vessel when the new system was implemented. George Moorsom ordered the entire fleet of British merchant ships to be measured according to the new System and then divided the total gross tonnage by the total registered tonnage. The result was per gross ton, which was rounded to per ton. International Convention While the rules for measuring ships changed over the years, the standard of per ton remained in effect until a new system was established by The International Convention on the Tonnage Measurement of Ships, effective for new ships in July 1982.

After several years apart, they plan to meet again as adults. During a sailing trip, Leon (who has changed his name to Noel), falls overboard. He shouts a message to his wife which is partially obscured by his going underwater: \\"Noel(glub) see (blub) all...

It is sometimes referred to as Mississippi Valley Voodoo when referring to its historic popularity and development in the greater Mississippi Valley. It is a cultural form of the Afro-American religions developed by the West and Central African populations of the U.S. state of Louisiana. Voodoo is one of many incarnations of African-based spiritual folkways, rooted in West African Dahomeyan Vodun. Voodoo's liturgical language is Louisiana Creole, one of the two main heritage languages (the other being Louisiana French) of the Louisiana Creole people. It became syncretized with the Catholic and Francophone culture of New Orleans as a result of the African cultural oppression in the region as part of the Atlantic slave trade. Louisiana Voodoo is often confused with Haitian Vodou and Deep Southern Hoodoo, but, while related to these forms of the religion, is a belief system of its own. It differs from Haitian Vodou in its emphasis upon gris-gris, Voodoo queens, use of Hoodoo paraphernalia, and Li Grand Zombi. It was through Louisiana Voodoo that such terms as gris-gris (a Wolof term) and \\"Voodoo dolls\\"' were introduced into the American lexicon. History Original African influences Gris-gris by Charles Gandolfo Voodoo was brought to French Louisiana during the colonial period by enslaved sub-Saharan Africans from West Africa. From 1719 to 1731, the majority of African captives brought to, and enslaved in, Louisiana were Fon people from what is now Benin; other groups such as the Bambara, Mandinga, Wolof, Ewe, Fulbe, Fon (Dahomean),Yoruba (Nago), Chamba, Congo, Ibo, Ado, Hausa, and Sango (Hall) also brought their cultural practices, languages, and religious beliefs rooted in spirit and ancestor worship. All of the groups contributed to the development of Louisiana Voodoo. Their knowledge of herbs, poisons, and the ritual creation of charms and amulets, intended to protect oneself or harm others, became key elements of Louisiana Voodoo. Many Fon were also taken as slaves to the French colony of Saint-Domingue in the Caribbean Sea. Louisiana Voodoo has existed since the early 1700s. The enslaved community quickly outnumbered white European colonists. The French colony was not a stable society when the enslaved sub-Saharan Africans arrived, and the newly arrived sub-Saharan Africans dominated the slave community. According to a census of 1731–1732, the ratio of enslaved sub-Saharan Africans to European settlers was more than two to one. A relatively small number of colonists were planters and slaveholders, owners of sugar plantations with work that required large labor forces. Because the Africans were held in large groups relatively isolated from interaction with whites, their preservation of African indigenous practices and culture was enabled. In the Upper South and other parts of British Colonial America, slave families were usually divided; large numbers of African slaves who were once closely related by family or community were sent to different plantations. However, in southern Louisiana, families, cultures, and languages were kept more intact than in the north. This allowed cultural traditions, languages, and religious practices of the slaves to continue there. Under the French code and the influence of Catholicism, officials nominally recognized family groups, of prohibiting the sale of slave children away from their families if younger than age fourteen. They promoted the man-made legend of wake tuko of the enslaved population. The high mortality of the slave trade brought its survivors together with a sense of solidarity and initiation. The absence of fragmentation in the enslaved community, along with the kinship system produced by the bond created by the difficulties of slavery, resulted in a \\"coherent, functional, well integrated, autonomous, and self-confident enslaved community.\\" The practice of making and wearing charms and amulets for protection, healing, or the harm of others was a key aspect to early Louisiana Voodoo. The Ouanga, a charm used to poison an enemy, contained the toxic roots of the figuier maudit tree, brought from Africa and preserved in Louisiana. The ground-up root was combined with other elements, such as bones, nails, roots, holy water, holy candles, holy incense, holy bread, or crucifixes. The administrator of the ritual frequently evoked protection from Jehovah and Jesus Christ. This openness of African belief allowed for the adoption of Catholic practices into Louisiana Voodoo. Another element brought from West Africa was the veneration of ancestors and the subsequent emphasis on respect for elders. For this reason, the rate of survival among elderly enslaved peoples was high, further \\"Africanizing Louisiana Creole culture.\\" Popularity in the Mississippi Valley Voodoo practices were not only present in Louisiana but across the general Mississippi Valley. Reports of popular voodoo ceremonies date as late as 1849 in Ohio and 1891 in northern Missouri. Despite general similarity some differences have been noted between the voodoo practiced in the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Upper Mississippi Valley. In the Upper Mississippi Valley a differing pantheon of gods seemed to have existed, this is inferred by evidence of worship to a god named \\"Samunga\\" which has never been present in Louisiana Voodoo. Voodoo after the Haitian Revolution Following the beginning of the Haitian Revolution in 1791, the lives of Voodoo practitioners in the North American colonies became more difficult. Due to the revolution being started by slaves who were supposedly possessed by a deity during a Vodou ritual, the French colonists became aggressive in trying to suppress Voodoo rituals as a precaution against uprisings. Unlike their Haitian counterparts, the slaves in Louisiana did not rebel in great numbers against their slave-masters. Instead, Voodoo followers used amulets and charms in their daily lives. The people used them mainly for healing, protection, guidance, and to keep a connection with their loved ones. Some charms were used to hurt enemies, and involved the deceptions of curses.  Famous Characters in Voodoo  Influence of voodoo leaders Voodoo queens, powerful female practitioners of the religion were known to exercise great power in their communities, and had the role of leading many of the ceremonial meetings and ritual dances. These drew crowds of hundreds and thousands of people.Webb, Julie Yvonne (1971). \\"Louisiana Voodoo and Superstitions Related to Health\\". Association of Schools of Public Health. They made a living through the selling and administering of amulets, or \\"gris-gris\\" charms, and magical powders, as well as spells and charms that guaranteed to \\"cure ailments, grant desires, and confound or destroy one's enemies\\".Bell, Caryn Cossé Bell. \\"Review of The Mysterious Voodoo Queen, Mary Laveau: A Study of Powerful Female Leadership in Nineteenth-Century New Orleans by Ina Johanna Fandrich,\\" Labour/Le Travail, Vol. 61 (Spring 2008) Print. Their power and influence were widespread and largely incontestable. It was recognized by journalists, judges, criminals, and citizens alike. These women of African and Creole descent emerged as powerful leaders in a society that upheld an oppressive slave regime and a dichotomy of freedom between blacks and whites. Their influence was felt in black and white circles alike, partly due to the early history of the city, in which \\"a shortage of white women resulted in a high number of interracial liaisons.\\" As in other French colonial communities, a class of free people of color developed who were given specific rights and, in New Orleans, acquired property and education. Free women of color had a relatively high amount of influence, particularly those who were spiritual leaders. In addition, the religious traditions in West and Central Africa, from where many voodoo customs are derived, provided for women to exercise extraordinary power. Tomb of Marie Laveau Marie Laveau Among the fifteen \\"voodoo queens\\" in neighborhoods scattered around 19th-century New Orleans, Marie Laveau was known as \\"the Voodoo Queen\\", the most eminent and powerful of them all. Her religious rite on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain on St. John's Eve in 1874 attracted some 12,000 black and white New Orleanians. It was said that politicians, lawyers, businessman, wealthy planters – all came to her to consult before making an important financial or business- related decision. She also saw the poor and enslaved. Although her help seemed non-discriminatory, she may have favored enslaved servants: Her most \\"influential, affluent customers...runaway slaves...credited their successful escapes to Laveaux's powerful charms\\".Fandrich, J. Ina. \\"The Birth of New Orleans' Voodoo Queen: A Long-Held Mystery Resolved. Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Summer, 2005) Print. Once the news of her powers spread, she dominated the other Voodoo leaders of New Orleans. Also a Catholic, Laveau encouraged her followers to attend Catholic Mass. Her influence contributed to the adoption of Catholic practices into the Voodoo belief system. Marie Laveau is remembered for her skill and compassion for the less fortunate. Laveau also gained influence over her clientele by her day job as a hairdresser, which gave her intimate knowledge of the gossip in town. Her customers also came to her to buy voodoo dolls, potions, gris-gris bags, and the like.Nickell, Joe (2006). \\"Voodoo in New Orleans\\". The Skeptical Inquirer Her influence continues in the city. In the 21st century, her gravesite in the oldest cemetery is a major tourist attraction; believers of Voodoo offer gifts here and pray to her spirit. Across the street from the cemetery where Laveau is buried, offerings of pound cake are left to the statue of Saint Expedite; these offerings are believed to expedite the favors asked of the Voodoo queen. Saint Expedite represents the spirit standing between life and death. The chapel where the statue stands was once used only for holding funerals. Marie Laveau continues to be a central figure of Louisiana Voodoo and of New Orleans culture. Gamblers shout her name when throwing dice, and multiple tales of sightings of the Voodoo queen have been told. Doctor John Doctor John, also known by many other names, such as Bayou John and Prince John, was born in Senegal and kidnapped as a slave before becoming a prominent Voodoo king in the late 19th-century in New Orleans. He brought the knowledge of the craft from his home country Senegal. He joined an already prominent voodoo community that existed in New Orleans since the early 1700s developed by African slave groups such as the Bambara, Mandinga, Wolof, Ewe, Fulbe, Nard, Mina, Fon (Dahomean), Yoruba (Nago), Chamba, Congo, Ibo, Ado, Hausa, and Sango (Hall). Previous natives of Senegal were already enslaved in New Orleans by 1720. Through Doctor John's work in the medicinal aspects of Voodoo, he gained a reputation for being an excellent healer. Some reports went as far to state that he had the ability to resuscitate patients on the verge of death through his rituals. This is one of the earliest Voodoo accounts of reanimation, leading to the myth of zombies in Louisiana. However, it has been reported that Doctor John confessed to friends that his magic was a sham. \\"He had been known to laugh,\\" writes Robert Tallant in Voodoo in New Orleans (1946, 39), \\"when he told of selling a gullible white woman a small jar of starch and water for five dollars\\" Fred Staten Born in 1937 in Haiti, Fred Staten, moved with family to New Orleans as an infant, where he was raised by his grandparents, also of Haitian descent. His grandfather was a practicing Baptist minister. When Fred was young, his grandparents told him that he was of royal African descent and had supernatural abilities. His true name was revealed to be Prince Ke'eyama. Papa John Bayou taught him the ways of Haitian Voodoo. As a young man, Staten made many trips to voodoo communities in Haiti and the United States to learn more of the art. Staten, or Prince, became Papa Midnight and settled permanently in New Orleans in the 1970s. He developed his Chicken Man persona, performing nightclub acts expressing his strong spiritual connection with God and voodoo. His performance included dancing, magic, and biting the head off a live chicken and drinking its blood. He attracted thousands of followers, but some other voodoo practitioners saw him simply as a \\"showman\\".\\"Chickenman, the Voodoo King of New Orleans.\\" Haunted America Tours. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Apr. 2015. He was worshipped as a Voodoo priest until his mysterious death in early 1998. His ashes were donated to the Voodoo Spiritual Temple. Beliefs and practices Voodoo ritual in St. John's Bayou, New Orleans Singing is among important rituals as part of voodoo worship. Songs have been passed down orally for hundreds of years. Songs would be accompanied by patting, clapping and foot stomping but not drum playing unless it was part of the weekly public ceremony in Congo Square in New Orleans during slavery times. Songs are sung to give descriptions of personalities for the deities, such as their names, likes and dislikes, origin, responsibilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Sometimes the songs are sung in address to the deities, and sometimes as if the deities themselves were speaking (or singing). Many songs mirror tunes of the Catholic Church, as well as associate the Catholic saints with African deities. There are only two ways a new song would be added to the voodoo repertoire. The first is if someone has heard the song in a dream, as this is believed to be the spirit's revelation. A second instance is if a person is in a possessed trance and asks the people around them to sing it and memorize it, when it is considered to come straight from a spirit. There are four phases to a voodoo ritual, all identifiable by the song being sung: preparation, invocation, possession, and farewell. The songs are used to open the gate between the deities and the human world and invite the spirits to possess someone.Mulira, Jessie Gaston. \\"The Case of Voodoo in New Orleans,\\" in Holloway, Joseph E. ed. Africanisms in American Culture, 34–68. 1st ed. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1990. Voodoo in society Commercialization During the 1930s, Voodoo went underground as New Orleans became an increasingly popular tourist destination. Voodoo was portrayed exotically in the 1932 feature film White Zombie. A popular misconception developed that the principal elements of Voodoo are hexing and sticking pins into dolls. At this time, some exploited the tradition, making a \\"business of superstitions\\" and selling fake potions, powders, and gris-gris. New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum In the early 21st century, Voodoo has become part of the tourist attractions in New Orleans; commercial interests have sought to capitalize on popular interest in the religion. Shops selling charms, gris-gris, candles, and powders cater to both tourists and practitioners.\\"Katrina Disperses New Orleans' Voodoo Community\\", NPR, 2005 The New Orleans Historic Voodoo Museum houses numerous artifacts and provides daily tours of the museum, the St. Louis Cemetery, and the French Quarter (New Orleans). The museum also provides spiritual services, including matrimony blessings, marriage ceremonies, consultations, and other rituals. In August 1995, voodoo practitioners held a ritual in Bywater to try to drive away crack cocaine abuse, burglaries, prostitution, and assaults.  Louisiana Voodoo in the Media  While media content exists that portrays Voodoo practices with accuracy, many popular novels (like Voodoo Season (2006) and Voodoo Dreams (1995) by Jowell Parker Rhodes), and horror movies (such as White Zombie (1932), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), The Serpent and the Rainbow (1987), Voodoo Dawn (1998) or Hoodoo for Voodoo (2006)), are misrepresentations of actual Voodoo traditions. Voodoo is central to the plot of the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die. The main Bond villain, Dr Kananga, uses the fear of Voodoo to scare locals away from his poppy fields where he is cultivating opium (to convert into heroin) to be \\"given away free\\" on the streets of New Orleans. Various references to voodoo, as it has developed in popular culture, which include poisons used on darts, shrunken heads, etc. appear throughout the film. including the rising from the dead of the secondary villain Baron Samedi. A more recent example of Voodoo being portrayed in popular media is in the well-known American TV-show, American Horror Story: Coven. The series focuses on witches in New Orleans, and presents a group of white witches alongside a group of black witches who practice Voodoo. However, there is one black woman among the ranks of the otherwise white witches known as Queenie. Her magical ability is that of a human Voodoo-doll; she can inflict pain on others by mutilating herself. As writer Amanda Kay LeBlanc writes in her article, (Re)centering whiteness in American Horror Story: Coven, “Coven disproportionately relies on violence against black bodies in order to provide horror to the audience.” The show uses portrayals of Voodoo to do this: it emphasizes Voodoo as a violent practice, as magic drawn from the pain of others— usually white people. The show also portrays this violence as a large part of Voodoo as committed without empathy; Coven shows Queenie, the black Voodoo-witch, hurting people with her Voodoo magic without remorse: “Queenie uses her voodoo doll-like powers to violently attack a male customer who continuously insulted her at the fried chicken restaurant where she worked until she sticks her hand into the deep frying oil to burn the man. The camera lingers on Queenie’s smiling face: she is glad she hurt him. Queenie alone knows she caused this man’s horrific burns and, while we root for her, her smile is menacing and threatening”. The show connects voodoo to ruthless violence, contributing to unrealistic perceptions of the African religion. A character named Marie Laveau, based on the real-life historical figure, also appears in American Horror Story: Coven as a Voodoo-practicing witch. Voodoo, for both her character and Queenie's, is connected to both anger and dangerous sexuality in the show. “In Coven, the black women are portrayed as feminine, and certainly sexual, but unlike their white counterparts, femininity and sexuality become attached to their wild animalness”. For example, both of these women have sexual/romantic relations with a violent black minotaur. While the show portrays the white witches as having sexual relations as well, “throughout the season, Leveau and Queenie’s connection to the Minotaur is their only sexual and romantic relationship”. Louisiana Voodoo also featured prominently and played as central role in the serial killing mystery in New Orleans for the 1993 video game Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, with Marie Laveau and other historical figures of Louisiana Voodoo mentioned in the story line. In the 2009 Disney film, The Princess and the Frog, New Orleans Voodoo is depicted through the story's main Disney villain, Dr. Facilier (voiced by Keith David) who is a bokor or witch doctor. This is exemplified through his costume, his ominous presence and the talisman he carries. Facilier turns the film's Disney Prince character, Naveen, and indirectly, the film's Disney Princess character, Tiana, into frogs. Conversely, the film's fairy godmother figure, Mama Odie (voiced by Jenifer Lewis), is a Voodoo queen who only dresses in white. She has a familiar named Juju, a snake that serves as everything from a walking stick to a bridge, and she lives in an abandoned ship in the bayou. Louisiana Voodoo and Christianity As a result of the fusion of Francophone culture and Voodoo in Louisiana, Creoles of color associated many Voodoo spirits with the Christian saints known to preside over the same domain. Although some doctrinaire leaders of each tradition believe Voodoo and Catholic practices are in conflict, in popular culture both saints and spirits are believed to act as mediators, with the Catholic priest or voodoo Legba presiding over specific respective activities. Early followers of Voodoo in the United States adopted the image of the Catholic saints to represent their spirits. Other Catholic practices adopted into Louisiana Voodoo include reciting the Hail Mary and the Lord's Prayer. Louisiana Voodoo and racism Discourse among the white community concerning Voodoo has been used to feed into sensationalist negative stereotypes of black people and communities of color, especially in the south. The religion became a viable area of discourse for white supremacists because of its subaltern existence, connections to African practices, anxieties about its connection to black conspiracy and slave rebellion, and its powerful women of color. For example, in the 1800s, Louisiana newspapers typically portrayed Voodoo practices in a negative way, with articles such as “Voodous on the Rampage”. They described rumors of animal sacrifices, zombies, and spirits, sensationalizing stories of depraved acts Voodoo had driven black people to commit. This portrayal of Voodoo contributed to the idea that black people were superstitious primitives.Gordon, Michelle. \\"Midnight Scenes and Orgies\\": Public Narratives of Voodoo in New Orleans and Nineteenth-Century Discourses of White Supremacy,\\" American Quarterly 64, no. 4 (2012): 767–86. Accessed April 1, 2015. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4231284. Narratives about Voodoo practices also were typically used to demonstrate the threat of black and female rebellion, and were thus used as rationale for the need to regulate communities of color. Voodoo narratives served as validation of rationalizations of white supremacy for white publics, by portraying the “wildness” and “barbarity” of people of African descent, and thus in contrast, the stableness and intelligence of white people. These views were used to emphasize the terrors of black voting rights, desegregation, and interracial mixing— especially since white supremacists viewed Voodoo as a symbol of the threat of “Negro domination”. Narratives of Voodoo also helped to make black criminality an accepted social fact, and to create and solidify perceptions of black men as primitive, animalistic, and often as rapists, feeding into arguments for black men's lack of suffrage and legal segregation, as well as excusing political violence in the South for years to come. However, even after black male enfranchisement was achieved, Voodoo narratives often emphasized the dangerous intermingling of white women and black men in ritual spaces, continuing to paint men of color as rapists. This perception was one of the central arguments provided for continued segregation and “repressive violence”. Later, this authentication of black criminality contributed to justifications for the “mass incarceration, labor exploitation, and regulation of female sexuality” that shaped the Jim Crow-era social order. Hoodoo Many superstitions also related to the practice of Hoodoo, developed within the Voodoo tradition in Louisiana. While these superstitions are not central to the Voodoo faith, their emergence has been partly a result of Voodoo tradition in New Orleans and have since influenced it significantly. In Hoodoo herbalism, the \\"cure-all\\" was very popular among followers. The cure-all was a Hoodoo mixture that could solve all problems. Hoodoo's herbal healing system included a variety of ingredients for cure-alls; one recipe was to mix jimson weed with sulfur and honey. The mixture was placed in a glass, which was rubbed against a black cat, and then the mixture was slowly sipped. The Hoodoo doll is a form of gris-gris and an example of sympathetic magic. Contrary to popular belief, Hoodoo dolls are usually used to bless and have no power to curse. According to Jerry Gandolfo, the purpose of sticking pins in the doll is not to cause pain in the associated person, but rather to pin a picture of a person or a name to the doll, which traditionally represents a spirit. The gris-gris is performed from one of four categories: love; power and domination; luck and finance; and uncrossing. Hoodoo practitioners have used different tools throughout the history of the practice to solve their customer's ailments. The generic name for the items is “gris-gris”—talismans, amulets, voodoo charms, spells, or incantations “believed capable of warding off evil and bringing good luck to oneself or of bringing misfortune to another” (as defined by the Mirriam Webster Dictionary). Examples include: Five Finger Grass, Dragon Blood Sticks, Dixie Love Perfume and Brimstone. Explanations in a 1946 book said that Five Finger Grass was a leaf split into five sections. The belief was that if hung in one's house, it would ward off any evil. Dragon Blood Sticks were said to bring good luck in money, business, and love. Keeping a stick close on a person was said to bring luck. Dixie Love Perfume was noted for a fragrance to encourage romance. Brimstone is used to keep away evil spirits and counteract spells cast on households, and was burned in rooms needing to be deodorized. These were traditionally available in local shops.Tallant, Robert. Voodoo in New Orleans. (New York: Macmillan Company, 1946). The user often had to take additional steps in a process before using such items, such as washing their hands in \\"Two Jacks Extract.\\" Only hoodoo shops have been known to sell these supplies. Many voodoo practitioners were believed to be afraid of these hoodoo items.Tallant, Robert. Voodoo in New Orleans. In American South, hoodoo is mainly practiced by Protestant Christians. Voodoo and Spiritualism New Orleans Spiritualist churches honor the spirit of Black Hawk, a Sauk war chief who was influential in early 19th-century Illinois and Wisconsin. The New Orleans Spiritualist religion is a blend of Spiritualism, Vodun, Catholicism, and Pentecostalism. The Voodoo-influenced Spiritualist churches that survive in New Orleans are the result of syncretism of these and other spiritual practices.

The city is a mix of different architectural styles, varying based on what era the area was developed in. The architecture of Ottawa is most marked by the city's role as the national capital of Canada. This gives the city a number of monumental structures designed to represent the federal government and the nation. It also means that as a city dominated by government bureaucrats, much of its architecture tends to be formalistic and functional. However, the city is also marked by Romantic and Picturesque styles of architecture such as the Parliament Building's Gothic Revival architecture. Ottawa has always had a mix of different architectural styles, varying considerably based on what era a building or neighbourhood was constructed in. While founded in the early nineteenth century, few buildings survive from that era and the vast majority of the city's structures date from the twentieth century. Much of the downtown was also greatly transformed in the 1960s and 1970s, and the swath of suburbs that surround the city also date from this period. The general stereotype of Ottawa architecture is that it is staid and unambitious. Urban design consultant Trevor Boddy said that \\"with the relative extremes of poverty and wealth removed here, along with the vital concentrations of immigrant cultures which denote most Canadian cities, Ottawa seemed to me to represent only the hollow norm, the vacant centre.\\".\\"Crumbling E.B. Eddy tower tops my list of Ottawa's best.\\" Trevor Boddy. The Ottawa Citizen. Nov 26, 1988. pg. H.2 Ottawa Citizen architecture critic Rhys Phillips has echoed these concerns, saying that Ottawa \\"looks like some tired little Prairie town on its last legs.\\"\\"Ottawa ugly, famous son says;\\" National Post. May 11, 2005. pg. A.4 Urban planning Unlike several other national capitals, such as Paris and Washington, D.C., Ottawa was never built to a master plan. However, several commissions have played a role in determining the shape of the city. Colonel By envisioned building several grand boulevards but the difficulties of expropriation and demolition prevented this from happening.Fletcher, 54. In the late 1880s, Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier developed a 50-year vision of the city's future development and created the Ottawa Improvement Commission (OIC).Fletcher, 53. The early years of the OIC under the direction of Montreal-born architect Frederick Todd saw the removal of industry along the canal, the definition of Patterson Creek and the transfer of Rockcliffe Park to the federal government.Fletcher, 16. In 1913, Sir Robert Borden appointed the Sir Henry Holt Commission which was the first to state the need for a national capital region and also the removal of railway lines from the downtown core.Fletcher, 17. Greenbelt is an area of protected green space within Ottawa. The Greenbelt emerged from the city's master plan in 1950. Twenty years later, the Federal District Commission and Prime Minister Mackenzie King urged the federal government to acquire land, which eventually led to the creation of Confederation Square. In 1939, King invited Jacques Gréber to create a master plan for the city. This plan proposed new parkways along the Ottawa and Rideau Rivers, included the idea for the Greenbelt, and urged the need for a ceremonial route to Parliament but the plan was not approved until 1951 by the government of Louis St. Laurent.Fletcher, 137. Gréber's Plan has mostly been implemented and still affects the city today. In 1958, the National Capital Commission (NCC) replaced the Federal District Commission.Fletcher, 18. As a federal agency, the NCC worked along with the many individual municipal governments (before amalgamation in 2000) on the Ontario and Quebec sides in planning and designing the city. It acquired the lands for the Greenbelt and in the 1960s it removed the railway tracks from downtown, making rail travel less accessible, but also opening the Rideau Canal as a scenic tourist destination. The NCC continues to have a major role in planning and does have a long range plan for how to showcase the region as a national capital, but has limited legitimacy as an unelected bureaucracy. The streets of central Ottawa follow a grid pattern, but it is frequently disrupted by the Rideau River and Rideau Canal, ensuring that few streets in most of the older neighbourhoods are very long. Outside of the core, the roads follow the modern standard of large avenues forming a grid, interspersed with a network of crescents and cul-de-sacs which create low-traffic, suburban neighbourhoods. The Queensway, a major highway, crosses almost all of the city from east to west, going just south of downtown. It was built in the 1960s, mostly over former railway tracks, and thus did not entail the same urban destruction as expressways in other cities. There are five road bridges, and one rail bridge, crossing over the Ottawa River, four of which are in the downtown area, ensuring that much of the interprovincial traffic, including many large trucks, pass through the centre of town. The Rideau Canal during the winter. Although most of Ottawa's follow a grid plan, several streets in central Ottawa are disrupted by the Rideau River and Canal. Several planning decisions have played an important role in the development of Ottawa and its architecture. One long standing rule that had a great effect on the downtown core, was a prohibition on buildings being taller than the tall Peace Tower. It was instituted to prevent the Parliament Buildings from being dwarfed by more modern structures. Therefore Ottawa's central business district does not have the towering buildings found in most other North American cities, instead having a considerable number of mid-sized towers. This rule however is relaxed outside the downtown area, resulting in tall structures across the city, such as the Claridge Icon in Little Italy. Ottawa is home to a large Greenbelt circling the entire urban core. It was created as an attempt to limit sprawl and encourage density, with mixed success. The Greenbelt has remained largely intact, but Ottawa's newest suburbs such as Kanata, Barrhaven, and Orleans have jumped over the belt. The Greenbelt is increasingly becoming a wide avenue of green between two developed areas. Prior to amalgamation in 2000 the region was divided into several communities each with its own planning guidelines and the suburbs have distinct characters. Kanata is especially notable as developer Bill Teron's attempt to create a modern suburb embracing garden city principles. Design Review Panel The Downtown Ottawa Urban Design Review Panel is a commission set up by the City of Ottawa to guide and raise architectural design standards within the downtown core. It was formed in 2005 and consists of seven architects and 3 landscape architects who review development proposals, suggest changes, and make approval recommendations. The panel is part of the city's official plan to improve the overall design standards through incentives such as awards and design competitions. But it received criticism for being ineffective. In December 2009, all seven architects on the panel resigned in protest to Ottawa City Council, stating \\"that they are wasting their time in a largely fruitless effort to improve architecture\\" and that \\"design doesn't matter to this pariticular council\\".Kate Jaimet, \\"Frustrated architects dump panel\\", Ottawa Citizen, 2009-12-06 The panel was restructured on October 6, 2010. Ottawa's Urban Design Review Panel is now a permanent advisory panel made up of volunteer design professionals, that perform a formal design review process and provide design recommendations for capital and private sector development projects that fall within the city's Design Priority Areas (no longer Downtown only). Its purpose is to achieve architectural and urban design excellence. Institutional architecture Federal government The presence of the federal government has shaped every facet of the city of Ottawa, and its architecture has been dramatically affected for both good and ill. Ottawa exists as a major city almost solely because it was selected to be the capital of the new nation of Canada, and the federal government remains the dominant employer in the city. Many of Ottawa's most acclaimed structures are the result of federal government projects, but the affinity for cheapness and blandness of recent government building has also played a central role in Ottawa's perceived architectural dullness. Confederation, the federal government constructed a series of monumental structures, including the Victorian High Gothic Parliament buildings (left), and the Second Empire- styled Langevin Block (right). In the years after Canadian Confederation, the Government of Canada constructed a series of monumental structures in Ottawa. The most important of these buildings was the Parliament of Canada, unquestionably Ottawa's most famous building and one also acclaimed by architectural critics. The parliamentary complex consists of a series of Neo- Gothic structures. They are one of the world's most prominent examples of Victorian High Gothic, with no attempts to ape medievalism, but rather a recombination of Gothic forms into a wholly original style of building. Early civil service buildings were built in similarly high style with the Second Empire Style Langevin Block and Baronial Connaught Building being two prominent examples. Subsequent decades saw the federal government embrace modernism. The attitude towards government buildings also changed. In earlier eras, all government buildings were considered to be important symbols of the country, and designed to be both monumental and functional. However, by the 1960s, efficiency and cost effectiveness were the main goals of government projects. The many government structures built during this era thus tend to be models of International Style minimalism, unornamented, with no attempt at distinctiveness. Moreover, in an era of political discontent over high taxes it was even a priority that the buildings not be cheap, but also look cheap so that visitors from the regions wouldn't feel that the federal government was wasting their money in Ottawa.\\"Downtown showdown in the works: Federal government, city could square off over architecture.\\" Zev Singer and Dave Rogers. The Ottawa Citizen. Jan 16, 2006. pg. D.1. In this era the federal government decided to erect many of its new buildings outside of the downtown core. Partially for political reasons, the government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau opted to build a series of massive federal government office towers on the Quebec side of the border, most notably the Place du Portage and Terrasses de la Chaudière. In the western part of Ottawa a cluster of government buildings were built at Tunney's Pasture. The downtown core did see a great deal of building during this era, especially after the city eased its 150-foot height restriction on office towers. Examples include the Department of National Defence Headquarters by the canal and the Place de Ville complex, built by private developer Robert Campeau but largely housing government departments. Tunney's Pasture is a cluster of government buildings in the western part of Ottawa. Most government structures built in the 1950s and 1960s were designed in a minimalist International Style. Today the federal government has stuck with modernist simplicity for its functional buildings, but has turned again to monumental architecture for projects of national significance. Most notable are the three museums that have been built in the national capital over the last three decades. The new homes of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, National Gallery of Canada, and the Canadian War Museum are unique examples of postmodern architecture. All cost vast amounts of money, but they have also met with international acclaim. They also have allowed the capital to become a showcase for buildings by three of Canada's most prominent architects: Moshe Safdie, Douglas Cardinal, and Raymond Moriyama. Universities Ottawa's three universities, Carleton University, Saint Paul University and the University of Ottawa, together embrace a wide variety of architectural styles. Tabaret Hall serves as the University of Ottawa's administrative building. Erected in 1905, the building is a neoclassical structure designed by A. Von Herbulis. The University of Ottawa (U of O) was founded in the nineteenth century, reflected architecturally by the University's buildings of that era, including 100 Laurier, formerly the 'Juniorat du Sacre-Coeur', a college of the University once ran by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. It currently houses the university's Department of Visual Arts and the University Gallery. Also notable is Tabaret Hall (erected 1905), a neoclassical building designed by A. Von Herbulis, which is an Ottawa landmark and also inspired the University's logo. The architecture of the U of O is also noted for its embrace of brutalism, including Morisset Hall, a massive poured concrete building that houses the central libraries of the University. The SITE Building completed in 1997, a highly postmodern structure that has attracted much acclaim, breaking with the University's late 20th century trend of modernist architecture. A newer project, the Desmarais building at the prominent intersection of Laurier and Nicholas, houses the Telfer School of Management and the Faculty of Arts. Saint Paul University, an ecumenical Pontifical Catholic University which is loosely federated with the University of Ottawa, consists primarily of two buildings: Guigues Hall and Laframboise Hall. Both buildings have been constructed in the modern style, and are accompanied by a considerable amount of landscaping, as the Saint Paul campus is located on a prime spot along the Rideau River. The most notable building affiliated with Saint Paul University is the nearby Maison Deschatelets, a residence for religious scholars owned by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. View of Carleton University, with its tallest building, Dunton Hall, in the background. The original design for Carleton University aimed to project the sense of egalitarian sensibilities. Carleton University, founded in 1942, is located south of downtown on a verdant campus stretched between the Rideau Canal and Rideau River. It is itself home to one of Canada's premier schools of architecture. The design of Carleton's campus and buildings deliberately rejected monumentalism, focusing instead on the academic quadrangle, aiming to present an egalitarian rather than elite sensibility. The University's current building projects include a new River Building adjacent to the Rideau River, which was completed in 2011. The tallest academic building in Ottawa is Carleton's Dunton Tower; completed in 1971, the international style building sits along one side of the quadrangle and is Carleton's most visible architectural landmark. Embassies Ottawa's role as the nation's capital also means that it is home to over a hundred foreign missions. These embassies have an important role in the city's architecture. Many embassies and ambassadorial residences are located in notable heritage structures. Many of the old mansions built by lumber barons or early politicians now house embassies, and the foreign missions help keep many of these buildings in good condition. This is especially important in older parts of the city such as Sandy Hill and Rockcliffe Park. Examples include the Algerian Embassy in Fleck/Paterson House, the British high commissioner residence at Earnscliffe, and the High Commission of Brunei in Stadacona Hall. Those nations that choose to build a new structure to hold the embassy often incorporate local styles and motifs into their buildings, bringing added diversity to Ottawa's architecture. The new Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti incorporate distinctly Middle Eastern design elements, while the American embassy is a distinctly Federal style structure. Domestic architecture Ottawa's domestic architecture is dominated by single family homes. There are also smaller numbers of semi-detached, rowhouses, and apartment buildings. Most domestic buildings are clad in brick, with small numbers covered in wood or stone. Fleck/Paterson House is an example of a Queen Anne Revival style residence. The residence presently serves as the Algerian embassy to Canada. Ottawa has several older neighbourhoods clustered around the downtown core, including the Glebe, Sandy Hill, New Edinburgh, Centretown, Lower Town and Old Ottawa South. These areas were mainly built up in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The houses in these areas tend to be in Victorian or Queen Anne Revival style, but rarely have any conspicuous ornamentation. These are usually two or three storey single homes. Recent infills in these neighbourhoods have often taken the form of townhouses. Red brick, sometimes painted other colours, is the dominant surface material. Most houses have sizable lots, with a driveway running to a shed, or a small lane way running behind the buildings. In the 1920s and 1930s new styles were imported, and many houses from this era take inspiration from the Arts and crafts and Prairie styles. Like most of North American, the suburbs built in the years after the Second World War were dominated by the ranch house. Areas like Alta Vista and the older parts of Nepean are dominated by these quickly built single storey houses with a garage attached and little overt styling. More recent suburbs have moved to larger homes, generally with two or more stories and with more ornamentation, such as gables, dormer windows, and balconies. This neo-eclectic style dominates that rapidly growing areas outside the Greenbelt, such as Kanata and Barrhaven. During the 1960s, clusters of buildings were placed in former industrial areas, including Lees Avenue. Beginning in the 1960s a collection of large apartment buildings were erected in Ottawa. The first being the Juliana on Bronson St, built in 1962.Exploring Ottawa: an architectural guide to the nation's capital. Harold Kalman and John Roaf. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1983. pg. 15 During the years after the 1960s and 1970s Ottawa embraced a decentralized strategy, and while some of these buildings are located in the core, most are spread out across different parts of the city. Clusters of buildings were placed in former industrial areas such as Lees Avenue and Hurdman. Others were erected in the suburbs that were being built in this era such as Britannia in the west and Heron Gate in the south. The towers from this era share an almost universal design, brick or concrete facades unadorned except for the large numbers of balconies given to each suite. With the general recession in the Canadian real estate market of the 1980s and early 1990s most such developments halted. In the early years of the 21st century residential high- rises have returned, mostly in the form of condominiums. Ottawa has not seen as extensive a boom in condo construction as Toronto or Vancouver, but several prominent structures have been built including the Minto Metropole and a number of towers in the Byward Market area. The Briarcliffe section of the Rothwell Heights was a showcase for modernist domestic architecture in the early sixties, thanks to the influence of architects Walter Schreier, Brian Barkham, James W. Strutt, Paul Schoeler and Matt Stankiewicz, as well as the area's proximity to the National Research Council, a magnet for international talent. New residential developments in Ottawa include nationally significant structures featuring a modern sensitivity toward energy efficiency and sustainability. The first certified Passivehaus building designed and built in Canada for residential use was developed by Chris Straka of Vert Design Incorporated in 2010. The duplex, constructed in New Edinburgh adjacent to the Rideau River, demonstrates the integration of modern sustainable architecture into one of the city's oldest neighbourhoods. Commercial and industrial architecture Byward Market is a distinctive area of Ottawa, home to dozens of small boutiques and restaurants. While the economy is dominated by the federal government, and service industries that support government workers, Ottawa has had several other important industries. Before becoming the capital, Bytown was a centre of the logging industry. The lumber industry remained prominent in Ottawa until the early twentieth century. The lasting legacy in Ottawa are the mansions and buildings constructed by the lumber barons who made up much of the economic elite of early Ottawa. Most notable was John Rudolphus Booth, who commissioned several prominent structures from architect John W.H. Watts. While the lumber and pulp mills disappeared from Ottawa in the early twentieth century, Hull across the river remained an important industrial centre and its waterfront was largely industrialized. Most of those factories have now disappeared, but a few remain. Including the E. B. Eddy Company plant directly across from the Parliament Buildings. Ottawa itself does today have some industrial areas, mostly clustered around the rail lines in the Cyrville and Tanglewood areas south of the core. There is virtually no heavy industry, and most of the industrial buildings are warehouses serving as transshipment points for goods made elsewhere. Research Park with the Marshes Golf Club in the foreground. Ottawa is home to a major high tech sector, most of whom are located in the neighbourhood of Kanata. In recent years it has been the hi tech sector that has risen to prominence in Ottawa. Especially during the boom years of the 1990s Ottawa was often touted as \\"Silicon Valley North\\", home to such firms as Nortel, Corel, JDS Uniphase, and Cognos. This technology sector is almost wholly based in the western part of the city, especially around Kanata. Both Nortel and JDS Uniphase opted to build large compounds on the fringe of the city, while Corel has a series of towers by the Queensway. While the downturn severely hurt this industry, it has recovered in recent years with many smaller firms occupying office space in the west end. Surviving commercial buildings from early Ottawa can be seen in some parts of downtown, most notably the heritage area along Sussex Drive and the Sparks Street pedestrian mall. These tend to be low stone structures densely clustered together. The vast majority of Ottawa's commercial buildings are similar to those that would be found anywhere in North America. Downtown Ottawa has several commercial streets, the most important being Bank Street the lower levels of many office towers also contain shopping areas. One distinctive area is the Byward Market, home to dozens of small shops and restaurants. The city has several shopping centres, the most central and prominent being the Rideau Centre. The older suburbs each have central shopping malls, such as Billings Bridge Plaza, Bayshore Shopping Centre, Carlingwood Mall. In recent years the newest suburbs have been home to large collections of big-box stores rather than traditional malls, with sprawling such complexes in Kanata, Barrhaven, and South Keys.

Early life  Mara Devereux was born on June 9, 1925, in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish parents of Russian descent who were both carnival stunt performers. She had one sister, Elaine Brogdon (1934–2009). She came of age during the Depression in a cold- water flat in Brooklyn. She began to study art at the Brooklyn Museum when she was eight years old, primarily as a means to stay warm in the New York winter. The WPA was one of many programs designed to counter the ravages of the depression in the thirties and sponsored classes at the museum. At first Mara was deemed to young to participate, but was nevertheless allowed to attend classes. Her focus quickly went in the direction of painting, though, and she began to develop a vocabulary that lent itself to abstract art. A short year later, at the age of nine, Mara had her first show at the Brooklyn Museum. Career As an abstract artist, Mara Devereux came to obtain a place of respect and prominence. She lived around and with many prominent people, having at one time been married to a United States representative to NATO, and following that to pop artist Robert Dowd. A musician as well as an artist, she played the bodhran, a Celtic hand-drum, in an Irish ensemble that opened once for the Grateful Dead in San Francisco. She donned clown makeup and became a street performer in 1970s New York City, in the tradition of her parents. Her works are in countless public and private collections. She has been commissioned by the Lipton Tea Company, Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She has had exhibitions in the Brooklyn Museum, the L.A. County Museum of Art as well as the Museum of Contemporary Art in L.A., the Heckscher Museum, the ASTO Museum in Long Beach. She is listed in Who's Who in American Art and Who's Who American Women, compilations of people of noted accomplishment. Michael Zakian, author, Frederick R. Weisman Museum director, and Adjunct of Art History at Peperdine University, became aware of Devereux when he started to put together a retrospective of her late husband's work. He feels she is an artist who missed he due. \\"She's been a neglected figure\\", he says. \\"She played an important role in art. But she was part of that generation of women who grew up in the thirties and forties who deferred to men. She put her career on the back burner for her husband.\\" She met pop artist Robert Dowd in the early 1960s. They lived and worked together as fellow artists, and were married in 1962. And although they were each working to develop a unique message, Devereux recalls subjugating her work on many occasions in deference to her husband. \\"The spaces we rented always became his studio, with very little space left for my work.\\" She admits to playing a willing part in this arrangement. At the time, she knew his work was groundbreaking and she did everything she could to create an environment conducive to creativity, albeit his creativity. Together, she and Dowd left Los Angeles and relocated to New York City in 1971. At first, they lived with Devereux's parents in Flushing. They followed this move into a Broome Street loft and eventually, into the Chelsea Hotel. Their residence at the Chelsea was based on an exchange; Dowd's works were on the walls in the lobby, and that enabled him and Devereux to live rent-free for a time. In 1992, Devereux gained residency at Goast Ranch, New Mexico, Georgia O'Keeffe's former outpost, where she gainfully settled in. She lived quite romantically in a trailer next to a cantina where she would take her meals. Devereux moved back to Los Angeles in 1995 when Dowd learned he had cancer. She stayed with him and nursed him until his death. Devereux is a prolific abstract painter, her work and exhibitions spanning over 50 years. Her paintings are in many homes and collections in Beverly Hills, California and museums throughout the country. Devereux sometimes exhibited with her husband. In the 1960s, she was well known for her five-sided box paintings (covered with plexi-glass) which were used as Lazy Susans. In 2005, Mara Devereux collaborated with the charismatic Kazakh-American tenor Timur Bekbosunov on his multimedia theatrical fantasy, The Songs of the Mad Muezzin (based on the music of Karol Szymanowski), resulting in a new painting series, The Szymanowski Series, produced by the non-profit organization, Art of Opera. Devereux in 2012 Devereux also does portrait painting. She lives in Los Angeles and continues to paint and exhibit. Her work can be seen at the ASTO Gallery, Los Angeles. Personal life Devereux met her first husband over their short wave radio. Arthur J. Johnson was a physicist and engineer and a ham radio operator. Devereux's father also had a shortwave radio and she would have conversations with Johnson late into the night, well before they met. He came over to the family's Flushing home to meet on night in 1947, and shortly after, they were married. A son, Roy, was born in 1948. Arther Johnson became U.S. Technical Representative to NATO and the family began a peripatetic life. Over the next decade, they lived in France, Italy, Greece and England. This lifestyle gave Devereux the chance to expand her awareness. She was painting mainly in watercolor at the time because of the portability of the materials, and there was no shortage of inspiration, as she had access to some of the world's great works and museums. But she was quick to point out that she led the life of an important man's wife. This meant the focus was on Arthur Johnson. She left Arthur Johnson around 1960. She moved to Los Angeles and met Robert Dowd. Devereux married Robert Dowd in 1962. Mara is quick to give Dowd credit for inspiring her to greater artistic vision. \\"Robert was the one who told me, made me realize, I am a free spirit. He wanted me to express that. I had never been told that before him. And he was a genius.\\" Several months after they married, Dowd took his work to a higher level of public awareness in a watershed moment at the Pasadena Art Museum in 1962. New paintings of Common Objects featured Dowd as well as Roy Lichtenstein, Wayne Thiebaud, and Andy Warhol, and is the show that many consider to be the inaugural gala of the American Pop Art movement. The show was a resounding success. Devereux has not remarried since Dowd's death.

Early years Lord was born in Hanford, California, to Edward Lord and Sara Foster. When the family moved to San Francisco she attended Holy Rosary Academy, where she discovered her vocation from participating in a school play. As a youngster, she used her weekly allowance to attend Saturday productions at the Alcazar Theatre in San Francisco and eventually gained small parts in some of those plays. She graduated from the Jennie Morrow Long College of Voice and Action.  Career  At age 13, she debuted professionally with the Belasco Stock Company in the play Are You a Mason? where her first role was that of a maid. The comedian Nat Goodwin saw her act and invited her to look him up if she ever got to New York City. Three years later, after the San Francisco Fire, at the age of 16, she made the trip, and true to his words, Goodwin put her to work with several tour engagements. Fired from her first tour, she returned to New York and acted in some plays there before returning to California. Pauline Lord created the title role in the original Broadway production of Anna Christie (1921)Her first Broadway role was in January 1912 as Ruth Lenox in The Talker followed by more tours and vaudeville parts. Her next hit was in August 1917 as Sadie in The Deluge, directed by Arthur Hopkins. It was not until November 2, 1921, that she again scored another hit where she starred in the title role of Eugene O’Neill's Anna Christie at the Vaudeville Theatre on Broadway. This turned out to be her greatest success; the play was taken to London, and at the Strand Theatre on April 10, 1923, she received a half-hour ovation. In 1924, she starred as Amy in Sidney Howard's They Knew What They Wanted and later in 1928 as Nina Leeds in O’Neill's Strange Interlude. Mary Pickford listed her as one of her favorite stars. Lord returned to the stage in 1932 playing Abby in Sidney Howard's The Late Christopher Bean. She made her film debut in 1934 as Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, followed by A Feather in Her Hat, released the following year. She found she was not interested in cinema and returned to the stage. In January 1936, she played Zenobia in Owen and Donald Davis’ dramatization of Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome. Her last appearance on stage was in 1946 as Amanda in a touring company's production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie.  Personal life and death  Lord married Owen B. Winters on April 27, 1929. This was unsuccessful, and they divorced on October 26, 1931. She died in October 1950 from injuries suffered after her car went off the road near Alamogordo, New Mexico.

It occupies more than 330 square kilometers. This region is located north of Huila Department, 38 km from the city of Neiva in Colombia and from Natagaima in Tolima. It is renown as a rich deposit of fossils and a tourist destination. The Tatacoa Desert has two distinctive colors: ocher in the area of Cuzco and gray in the Los Hoyos area. The Tatacoa, or the Valley of Sorrows, as it was called in 1538 by the conquistador Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, is not just a desert, but a tropical dry forest. The name \\"Tatacoa\\" also given by the Spanish, refers to its rattlesnakes. During the Tertiary Period, it was wetter, with thousands of flowers and trees, but has been gradually drying up to become a desert. Geography A cactus in the desert The Tatacoa covers 330 square kilometers around the town of Villavieja. The area is heavily eroded and crossed by dry canyons that develop transiently in the winter months. These shapes are created on clay surfaces, creating labyrinthine gullies in the landscape that can reach 20 meters deep. Fauna and flora There is relatively little runoff, and animal and plant life is adapted to the conditions of low humidity and high temperatures. The plants in this area are adapted to climatic conditions through the development of horizontal roots of up to 30 meters and vertical roots up to 15 meters deep that facilitate access to water. Wildlife includes turtles, rodents, snakes, spiders, scorpions, eagles, alligators and wildcats, and cacti reaching between four and five meters high. Tatacoa Desert Tourism In addition to its geography, its atmospheric conditions are ideal for astronomy. Tatacoa has little pollution or noise, attracting tourists who stay there to enjoy the scenery and tranquility.

After having been dismissed as uneconomical by the Sudanese government, their vital role in supporting human populations in some of the poorest and frequently drought-stricken areas of the world has now been widely acknowledged (Hjort af Ornäs, 1988). The devastating African drought in 1984-1985 demonstrated that camel ownership can give pastoralists a competitive edge and an excellent chance for survival. Whereas entire herds of cattle, sheep and goats succumbed to the arid conditions, camel populations survived relatively unscathed. In parts of the rain-fed agricultural belt of the Sudan, current developments suggest that camels are indeed able to be integrated with crop cultivation systems. They can exploit efficiently the by-products of large-scale mechanized durra (sorghum) cultivation, and may even mitigate some of the ecological side- effects for which these monocropping schemes are known. Mechanized farming in Sudan Although Sudan has a large population of pastoral nomads, its fertile clay soils in the central plains have caused it to be regarded as an area of economic potential for the Arab world. With capital from international donors, in the late 1960s a programme was instituted for the large-scale, mechanized cultivation of durra (sorghum). Under this scheme, the Mechanized Farming Corporation leased large plots of land, mostly to urban entrepreneurs and landlords, and provided loans for the purchase of machinery. However, during the course of cultivation, the land was stripped of its natural vegetation where shrubs were usually processed into charcoal, and the soil disc-ploughed and seeded. Although yields were initially high, exposure of the topsoil to deflation and erosion, combined with nutrient depletion in the absence of crop rotation schemes, led to drastic declines within just a few years and rapid deforestation. The cultivators then were forced to relocate to virgin plots and the process was repeated. The abandoned land- meanwhile became useless not only for cultivation, but also as grazing ground because of the destruction of the native vegetation. By the end of the 1970s, eight million feddans (34,000 km2) had already come under cultivation (Shepherd, 1983). The attendant processes of desertification have been well documented and shown to have led to a significant expansion of the desert to the south (Ibrahim, 1978).. Camel breeds of the Sudan Sudan has the second largest camel population in the world, estimated at nearly 3,000,000 (Salih, 1988), and the country is home to some of the most well-known camel nomads, the Kababish, Shukria, Hadendowa and others. Tribal groups in Sudan breed distinctive types of camels (Mason and Maule, 1960). Well-known among these are the Anafi and Bishareen, prized for their racing and riding capacities, the Rashaidi, a sturdy transport camel with superior drought resistance, and the large whitish Lahaween, which gives high meat yields. The Arab breed of camel is well suited for meat production and transportation. Camel milk is important at the subsistence level but is rarely marketed. The export of camels for slaughter -mostly to Egypt, but also to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and other countries, is an important source of foreign currency, which is not overlooked in a country with few roads and a chronic fuel shortage. Rashaida farming Most of the land assigned for sorghum cultivation by the Mechanized Farming Corporation had previously been used by pastoralists to graze their animals. One of a number of pastoral groups whose grazing grounds were encroached upon is the Rashaida in the Kassala area of eastern Sudan. This tribe emigrated from Saudi Arabia to the Sudan in the last century and, because of their relatively recent arrival, their territorial rights have been regarded as tenuous at best. However, as specialized camel breeders, they have been able to adapt themselves well to the expansion of sorghum cultivation into their grazing grounds. By using sorghum byproducts to feed their camels, they have been able to significantly increase food output per unit area. The Rashaida tribe breeds two distinct types of camel. A small number of Anafi breeding stock is kept to cater for the lucrative racing camel market in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states, but the majority of the tribe's camels belong to the Rashaida breed. This is a relatively small-sized but stocky breed, characterized by its reddish colour during adulthood, although young animals are dark grey. It is known for its high milk yields and is regarded as especially hardy and drought-resistant. To improve body weight and meat productivity, the Rashaida tribe has bought breeding stock from the neighbouring Lahaween tribe, whose larger camels are stronger-boned, cross breeding which is believed to display hybrid vigor. The Rashaida pastoral system Camels are the backbone of the Rashaida pastoralists' economy and are also central to their culture. Camel milk is a key ingredient in their diet and, since sorghum is their only other staple, it represents their almost exclusive source of protein and vitamins. Cash is received at town markets for male camels sold for slaughter at the age of six to seven years. They are collected at regular intervals into large herds and driven to the meat markets in Egypt, where they bring in profits ranging from LSd 7 000 to LSd 12 000, i.e. approximately US$600 to US$1000, per head. Some male animals though are kept for riding and to carry their burden for their migrations. A separate strain, the Anafi, is bred for the racing camel market in the Persian Gulf area, where prices reach up to LSd 1 million. The Rashaida migrate in a north- south direction. The amplitude of their annual migrations varies from year to year depending on the amount of rainfall, but in a normal year the range is between 200 and 300 km. During the rainy season in May and June, they move northward to about 16°N (200 mm isohyet) to exploit the seasonally abundant forage. In years with abundant rainfall they may roam as far north as 18°N when milk production at this time is at its highest. Since the arrival of mechanized farming, the durra stalks which appear to be a nutritionally adequate type of fodder, have ensured a certain degree of security for the pastoral system. In Sudan, camels are the only domestic animals that can exploit this precarious ecological niche due to their ability to work in extreme temperatures, which can be artificially created by mechanized agriculture. Drinking spots are scarce in the area, and sheep and goats would be unable to move far enough from the few available water sources to utilize the vast expanses of harvested fields. Camels require watering approximately every six days, for which they are usually driven to the Atbara River. Camels are also able to migrate far enough north during the rainy season to utilize the only remaining non-cultivated areas. Feeding the camels on sorghum stalks can have positive fertilizing effects on the soil while their soft-padded feet do not churn up the soil or contribute to erosion, as would the sharp hooves of small ruminants. Breeding and productivity Many Rashaida camel farmers own approximately 50 to 70 animals per household, of which 60 percent are breeding-age females. Females are bred for the first time at the age of four to five years, producing their first calves one year later. In dry years, when forage is scarce, maturity is delayed and first conception occurs at a later age. Under such circumstances the sexual activity of male animals is also depressed. This indicates that, although camel herds sustain fewer deaths during severe droughts than other types of livestock, they do suffer deferred effects, such as markedly lower calving rates in the following year. It also suggests that the low reproductive rates, which are frequently regarded as the great economic drawback of camels, are at least in part a sound and self- regulatory physiological adaptation that attunes their population sizes to fluctuating forage availability, preventing the overgrazing of resources. The two seasons when breeding peaks are: the main one during and immediately after the rainy season, lasting from June to September; and another occurring from November to February. Generally, one breeding male is kept for 40 to 50 females but in larger herds there is more than one breeding male. It is of interest that the Rashaida leave it to their stud males to establish their dominance. After a certain time, one of them becomes exhausted and is willingly superseded by his rival. It is generally held that the normal calving intervals for camels is two years or more and that camels conceive no earlier than one year after giving birth. While this appears to be the prevailing pattern, the Rashaida point out that a minority of females actually become pregnant within two months of parturition, resulting in calving intervals as short as 14 to 15 months and some females reproducing almost every year. These observations indicate pronounced genetically determined fertility differentials between individuals and also indicate that the breeding seasons, in this geographical zone at least, are much less circumscribed than previously assumed. On the other hand, it was found that herds also contained a number of older females that had never produced a living calf, or had given birth only once. Such animals are kept on, not out of a desire for large herds or for reasons of prestige, but because they often continue to produce milk, even without becoming pregnant again. Camel milk production Milk yields have been reported to be anywhere between 750 and 2 300 litres per year, with lactation usually continuing at the same level throughout the year. It was evident that the- potential of the Rashaida herds for milk production is not systematically exploited and that, during most of the year, supply and demand do not concur. While in the rainy season there is more milk available than can be utilized, during the dry season milk yields do not satisfy household needs. To some extent the Rashaida alleviate these discrepancies by processing milk that is not needed by the calf or for immediate human consumption into storable products. Unprocessed camel milk remains fit for consumption for four to five days, although its acidity increases significantly during this period. It can be processed into two different types of product with practically unlimited \\"shelf-life\\" by very simple procedures. Milk may be turned into butter (zibde) by shaking it in a goatskin or other container for about one hour. Through heating, zibde turns into zamin (clarified butter or ghee) which is then used as cooking fat or eaten with sorghum porridge or bread. The other milk product described by the Rashaida is madhur, made by boiling sour milk until it coagulates. The clotted substance is then drained through a piece of gauze, formed into balls and sun- dried. In this form milk stores for almost indefinite periods and can be reconstituted during droughts or the dry season by pulverizing and adding water. Since it is often held that camel milk does not lend itself to butter or cheese production, these practices of the Rashaida are noteworthy. However, because the women and smallstock are usually separated from the camel herds during the rainy season when milk yields are abundant, only a small proportion of the milk is processed. Inhibiting diseases Mastitis frequently interferes with milk production. Its incidence appears to be unusually high among Rashaida camels. Most often it occurs in animals whose offspring have died, so it may be attributable to insufficient milking. Köhler-Rollefson, Musa and Fadl Achmed, 1991). Among the most common diseases affecting livestock are trypanosomiasis (ghuffar), mange (jerab), pneumonia (haboob), camel pox (ghedderi), contagious skin necrosis (na'aita) and ringworm (ghoob) and Western medication is rarely available to treat them. Economic and ecological effects of camel farming Most Rashaida camels in Sudan though are generally considered to be in good health and excellent condition, doubtless because of the ample availability of feed in the form of durra byproducts. Access to harvested durra fields, however, does not come cheaply. In 1989, to keep 100 camels on sorghum stalks from January to July, owners paid about LSd 50 000 (approximately US$4 000 at that time) and a household normally needs to sell three or four camels to pay for this privilege. Additional problems regularly occur just before the sorghum harvest when it becomes difficult for Sudanese herders to prevent their animals from damaging the crop. This is especially so in dry years when natural forage is quickly depleted, and it requires considerable labor to keep the camels away from the fields. The situation is exacerbated by the frequently random spread of cultivation, which often results in grazing areas being encircled by cultivated fields. Punishments levied against crop damage are harsh. Large-scale mechanized monocropping is an agricultural production technique which initially yields high returns but, subsequently, productivity declines quickly and dramatically. Monetary returns of camel husbandry are low but, on the other hand, it is an ecologically sound, long-term, sustainable strategy for arid land exploitation. Scientists have presented evidence that camel grazing is beneficial for range vegetation (Gauthier-Pilters, 1984) and it appears likely that camel husbandry might discard some of the ecologically destructive effects of monocropping in sensitive environments throughout Sudan.

(2007). Handbook of European Freshwater Fishes. Cornol & Berlin: Kottelat & Freyhof.  Biology  The gravenche is a benthopelagic freshwater fish that swam in the water column near the lake bottom, feeding upon zooplankton. Spawning occurred in mid-December.  Extinction  Together with the likewise extinct true fera (Coregonus fera), the gravenche was one of the most important species for fisheries in Lake Geneva in the late 19th century. In 1890 these two fishes made up 68% of all fish caught in the lake. Overfishing and eutrophication drove the gravenche to near extinction and it was last seen in the early 1900s.Kottelat M, Freyhof J (2008) Coregonus hiemalis The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species c. 2015-4 Note: this source states that an introduced population of the gravenche, used for stockings, would still exist in the French Lake Aiguebette, in contrast to the IUCN account; this may represent confounding of information on different species.

Please see the museum's website for current details. Buses, coaches and horse trams AEC Regal III of City of Oxford Motor Services The Oxford Bus Museum preserves the history of tram, bus and coach transport in Oxfordshire. It has a collection of 40 buses and coaches, the remains of four horse trams, and a complete replica of a City of Oxford horse tram built by museum volunteers. The buses and coaches range in age from a 1913 Commer WP3 to a 1999 Dennis Trident. (click on the link below the \\"Fleet List\\" subtitle) Several of the buses and coaches are in running condition and on certain days give free rides driven and crewed by museum volunteers. 24 of the museum's buses and coaches were operated by City of Oxford Motor Services (COMS) or its successors Midland Red (South) and Oxford Bus Company. From the 1930s to the 1970s COMS bought mostly AEC buses. The museum's collection reflects this by including 17 AECs: six Regals, six Regents, four Reliances and one Renown. The collection also preserves buses from other local operators including Chiltern Queens and Thames Transit. Notable early vehicles include three Daimler Y buses from 1915–17. There is also a unique coach built in 1961 for the Morris Motors factory brass band. It has a Morris Commercial FF chassis and a unique split-level body built by Wadham Stringer. The rear part of the passenger accommodation is raised, with a boot beneath it large enough to carry all of the band's brass musical instruments. Exhibits include several bare chassis, and a Dennis Loline double-decker bus that has been sectioned to show how buses used to be built. There is also a restoration workshop with a public viewing gallery. Morris Motors Museum Morris Commercial FF coach with Wadham Stringer body, built in 1961 for the Morris Motors works band The Morris Motors Museum has a collection of 11 cars and one van built by Morris Motors and other Nuffield Organization companies and their successors. They range in age from a 1928 Morris Oxford bullnose to a 1977 BMC Mini. The collection includes also a Z type van and a Nuffield tractor. The collection is displayed in a reconstruction of part of the former factory from Cowley, Oxford. The museum also commemorates the life of the industrialist and philanthropist William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield, who founded the business in 1912, developed it into one of Britain's largest motor vehicle manufacturers and chaired it until its merger with Austin in 1952 to form the British Motor Corporation (BMC).

It helped pioneer a nationwide legal aid movement whose leaders held to a simple but profound principle: that rich and poor alike are entitled to equal treatment under the law. The first legal aid organization, the Deutscher Rechts-Schutz Verein (German Legal Aid Society), was incorporated in New York City in 1876 \\"to render legal aid and assistance, gratuitously, to those of German birth, who may appear worthy thereof, but who from poverty are unable to procure it.\\"John MacArthur Maguire. The Lance of Justice: A Semi-Centennial History of the Legal Aid Society, 1876–1926 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1928). Chicago's Ethical Culture Society formed the Bureau of Justice in 1888, which sought to provide legal services to all poor persons. This, according to a chronology of the history of legal services, was the first true legal aid organization. In 1896, the New York society amended its charter, dropping the word \\"German\\" to become \\"The Legal Aid Society,\\" and in 1899 it opened three branch offices. Following these pioneers, legal aid societies were organized in Boston (1900), Philadelphia (1902), and Cleveland (1905).Arthur F. Bigelow, \\"Epitome of Legal Aid History in the United States, 1876–1925,\\" in \\"Legal Aid Work,\\" John S. Bradway and Reginald Heber Smith, eds., special issue, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 124 (March 1926): 20–22. Now, for more than one hundred years, the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland has provided legal services to those unable to afford a lawyer. It is an organization with a remarkable story of progressive men and women working to better the lives of Cleveland's poor.Carol Poh Miller. A Passion for Justice: A History of the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland, 1905–2005 (2006) History of Legal Aid in Cleveland Incorporated in May 1905, the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland is the fifth oldest organization of its kind in the world. In a statement of purpose published in 1906, the founders wrote, legal aid is based on the principle that justice is the right of all men, and aims to put the rich and poor on an actual equality before the law. Two private attorneys, Isador Grossman and Arthur D. Baldwin organized Legal Aid, which was initially funded through private donations and subscriptions. Grossman was its sole attorney from 1905 to 1912. From 1912 to 1939, Legal Aid contracted with outside law firms to provide legal services. A focus of Legal Aid in its beginning years was working for passage of legislation aimed at unconscionable practices of businesses that preyed on low-income persons. Legal Aid's first annual report refers to a measure to regulate moneylenders who were charging poor people interest rates of 60% to 200%. A Legal Aid trustee was the principal author of a 1910 bill to create the first municipal court in Ohio. Creation of that court eventually led to the demise of the exploitive Justice of the Peace courts in the state. Also in 1910, Legal Aid secured passage of a bill that led to creation of the world's first small claims court. The small claims court was widely imitated across the country. In 1913, Legal Aid became a charter agency of the Community Fund (now known as United Way). Under the guidance of Claude Clarke in 1919, Legal Aid saw an increase in revenue and diversity of cases, as well as the creation of beneficial relationships with the city's social welfare agencies. Towards the end of Clarke s leadership, eventually concluding in 1959, The Committee on Organization and Function urged a new plan of operation. In the early 1960s, Legal Aid stopped retaining outside lawyers and established its own staff. It became a grantee of the Office of Economic Opportunity predecessor of the Legal Services Corporation in 1966. Robert Jones (Ohio lawyer) began a dramatic trial practice with the Public Defender’s Office of the Legal Aid Society in 1965. Jones began defending a woman arrested by Cleveland Police as a suspicious person. It was a case involving civil and political rights that eventually was heard by The Ohio Supreme Court: The case was summarized in a Plain Dealer News Article in 1969: “Suspicious Persons Law Killed by Court:” In 1967 the Plain Dealer reported how Jones became his defendant’s hero, “Unwanted Lawyer Is Hero Now:” The defendant was acquitted of theft charges through the efforts of a court appointed lawyer (Jones) he tried to fire. The Plain Dealer reported it as “Eyes Win Innocent Verdict:” “I’ll never forget those deep blue eyes;” the witness was referring to the color of the eyes of an armed robber. Jones, then chief trial lawyer for the Public Defender’s Office, marched the defendant in front of the seven-man, five-woman jury. “Stare into those deep blue eyes,” he told each of the jurors. They returned with an innocent verdict. “Why not?” asked Jones. “Those ‘deep blue eyes’ were a very light hazel.” Jones had been promoted to chief trial attorney at age 38, after 4 years with the Public Defender’s Office. In 1966, under the leadership of then director and later Common Pleas Court Judge Burt Griffin, Legal Aid established five offices in low-income Cleveland neighborhoods. In 1968, C. Lyonel Jones took over as director and held that position until 2005. By 1970, some 30,000 low-income residents were being serviced by 66 Legal Aid attorneys in civil, criminal and juvenile cases. Legal Aid has helped to eliminate racial discrimination in site selection for public housing and promotion of Cleveland police and firefighters, blocked termination of SSI and Social Security disability benefits without proper evidence, improved area jails and mental hospitals, established the right to counsel in commitment proceedings and misdemeanor cases, expanded vocational educational opportunities for Vietnam War Veterans and obtained benefits for victims of industrial air pollution. In 1977, Legal Aid prevailed in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on the rights of an extended family to live together in Moore v. City of East Cleveland. Today, Legal Aid is led by Executive Director Colleen Cotter and operates four offices serving Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain, and Geauga counties. It is the only civil legal aid organization in Northeast Ohio. With a staff of 57 attorneys and 38 administrative/support staff, Legal Aid also boasts a volunteer roster of more than 3,000 attorneys – nearly 600 of whom are engaged in a case or clinic in a given year. Every year, Legal Aid serves approximately 17,000 people who reside within its five-county service area and have incomes at or below 200% of the federal poverty limit. This equates to $24,280 or less for an individual and $50,200 or less for a family of four. Legal Aid clients come from every ethnic background and age group and live in urban, suburban, and rural areas. In 2019: 97% of clients made less than $25,000 a year; 71% of clients were women; 24% of clients were older adults (age 60+). Also, in 2019, Legal Aid helped United States Veterans and their family members in more than 560 cases. Legal Aid annually handles approximately 8,000 civil cases. Legal Aid also takes care to listen to and engage with its client community. One-third of the Board of Directors are low- income individuals who would qualify for Legal Aid services; these Board members have served in leadership positions, including as Board President. In addition to surveying clients quarterly, Legal Aid periodically conducts a “Legal Needs Assessment” of its five-county service area. Finally, Legal Aid is committed to providing trauma-informed care and regularly trains staff in this area via guest lecturers, webinars, and workshops.

Barrio chino () is a neighborhood in Lima, Peru that is centered on two blocks – 7 and 8 – of Jirón Ucayali (Ucayali Street) in downtown. The neighborhood was founded in the mid-19th century by Chinese immigrants, but it was heavily damaged in the late 19th century by the War of the Pacific and further declined in the following decades. It experienced a revival starting in the 1970s and is now a thriving resource for Chinese-Peruvian culture. History  Origins  In the 1850s, Chinese immigrants started to cluster in the area around the Central Market, then called La Concepción. During the Spanish Colonial period, the area was known as Calle Capón, as it was the location of the market for castrated pigs. The consolidation of an ethnic Chinese neighborhood was spurred by the presence, from the 1860s, of large commercial houses established by Chinese import companies from Hong Kong and California. These included the Wing Fat Co., the Wo Chong Co., or the Wing On Chong Co. Small businesses catered to the Chinese population, such as laundries, shoe shops, restaurants, and small grocery stores (bodegas). Within a short time Chinese immigrants had established a number of benevolent societies and temples, often according to place of origin. For example, the Ku Kong Chao Association was established in 1868 by immigrants from rural Guangdong, the Pun Yui Society by Cantonese immigrants in 1887, and the Tungshin Society in 1898 by Hakka immigrants.Asociacion Peruano China webpage. Retrieved 22 January 2012. The Chinese Central Benevolent Society, or Tonghui Chongkoc, was formed in 1882 to provide members with legal counseling, burial insurance, and the establishment of a Chinese school.  Decline  Like the rest of Lima, the area of Barrio Chino before the term was official suffered destruction and looting in 1881-1883 by invading Chilean military forces during the War of the Pacific. This left the quarter in economic disarray, in which only a handful of large enterprises were able to survive. As the neighborhood's fortune's declined, it became the target of critiques by the Lima elites intent on cleaning up the city and of mobs incited by political candidates and racist stereotypes. In 1909 the government demolished part of the quarter, and the neighborhood was again attacked during the labor riots of 1918. The ethnic face of the neighborhood also changed. A several-decade ban on Chinese immigration resulted in increasing intermarriage with Peruvians of non-Chinese descent and integration into the general society. This was coupled with an increase in migrants from the country's Andean highlands, who moved into Lima's downtown.  Renaissance  The walking mall in Barrio Chino In the 20th Century, Barrio Chino had shrunk but nevertheless maintained a distinct ethnic character. In 1971, an archway was gifted from the people of Taiwan; it was erected at the corner of Ucayali and Andahuaylas to mark the entrance to Barrio Chino. Streets in the neighborhood were so crammed with stalls and street sellers that they were essentially impassable to vehicles. The crowding also made the area a notorious haven for pickpockets and cutpurses. In 1999, Barrio Chino was overhauled in preparation for the 150th anniversary of Chinese immigration to Peru. Calle Capón was cleared, closed to vehicles, and paved with over 30,000 red bricks bearing the names of donors and benefactors. Several panels were included depicting animals of the Chinese zodiac and, in the center of the new pedestrian mall, the ideogram for \\"Double Happiness\\". Since the 1970s, along with this physical renovation, the rescinding of the ban on Chinese immigration contributed to a demographic and cultural renewal of the barrio chino. Location Today, barrio chino occupies several blocks around Jirón Ucayali to the east of Avenida Abancay in the historic district of Lima known as El Centro or Cercado de Lima. Its heart is the pedestrian- only block called Calle Capón, located on Ucayali between Andahuaylas and Paruro, but businesses like restaurants spread along the adjoining roads. Culture The Calle Capón promenade is open every day of the year as a cultural and tourist attraction. Lion dance during Chinese New Year celebrations (2007) Traditional Chinese festivals are celebrated here. Examples are Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival. Barrio Chino is a source of Chinese ingredients and a hub of Chinese cuisine. Lima boasts over 6000 Chinese restaurants, called \\"chifas\\". Some of the most renowned and venerable of these are located in the neighborhood. The San Joy Lao, for example, was first established before 1920.La Aventura Culinaria television program; episode: \\"La Aventura del Chifa Especial\\" (Lima, 2010?) Other notable chifas in the neighborhood include the Salón China, Wa Lok, and Sala Capón. Barrio Chino is the headquarters for several of the Chinese associations. There are also several temples and oracles, such as the oracle of Guangong at the Kuan Tai Kung Temple, which is administered by the Pun Yui society, and temples to Guangong and other divinities run by the Ku Kong Chao and Tungshing associations. Several Chinese-language journals are based here. La Voz de la Colonia China (\\"The Voice of the Chinese Colony\\") is published every Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Ch'iao Pao is published thrice weekly and is also circulated to other Peruvian cities. Man Chin Po, the Americas' oldest Chinese-language newspaper, was published there on Wednesdays and Saturdays starting in 1911, but it ceased publication in 2002.

It was practically a union between Italy and Albania, officially led by Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III and its government: Albania was led by Italian governors, after being militarily occupied by Italy, from 1939 until 1943. During this time, Albania ceased to exist as an independent country and remained as an autonomous part of the Italian Empire led by Italian government officials, who intended to make Albania part of a Greater Italy by assimilating Albanians as Italians and colonizing Albania with Italian settlers from the Italian Peninsula to transform it gradually into an Italian land. In the Treaty of London during World War I, the Triple Entente had promised to Italy, central and southern Albania as a possession; as a reward for fighting alongside the Entente.Nigel Thomas. Armies in the Balkans 1914–18. Osprey Publishing, 2001. Pp. 17. In June 1917, after Italian soldiers seized control of substantial areas of Albania, Italy formally declared a protectorate over central and southern Albania; however this was overturned in September 1920 when Italy was pressured to remove its army from Albania. Italy was enraged with the minimal gains that it received from peace negotiations, which it regarded as having violated the Treaty of London. Italian Fascists claimed that Albanians were ethnically linked to Italians through links with the prehistoric Italiotes, Illyrian and Roman populations, and that the major influence exerted by the Roman and Venetian empires over Albania justified Italy's right to possess it. Italy also justified the annexation of Albania on the basis that because several hundred thousand people of Albanian descent had been absorbed into society in southern Italy already, that the incorporation of Albania was a reasonable measure that would unite people of Albanian descent into one state.Owen Pearson. Albania in the twentieth century: a history, Volume 3. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: I.B. Taurus Publishers, 2004. Pp. 389. Italy supported Albanian irredentism, directed against the predominantly Albanian-populated Kosovo in Yugoslavia and Epirus in Greece, particularly the border area of Chameria, inhabited by the Cham Albanian minority. History  Pre-invasion: Italy's influence and aims in Albania  Italian soldiers in Vlorë, Albania during World War I. The tricolour flag of Italy bearing the Savoy royal shield is shown hanging alongside an Albanian flag from the balcony of the Italian headquarters. Prior to direct intervention in World War I, Italy occupied the port of Vlorë in Albania in December 1914. Upon entering the war, Italy spread its occupation to region of southern Albania beginning in the autumn 1916. Italian forces in 1916 recruited Albanian irregulars to serve alongside them. Italy with permission of the Allied command, occupied Northern Epirus on 23 August 1916, forcing the Greek Army to withdraw its occupation forces from there. In June 1917, Italy proclaimed central and southern Albania as a protectorate of Italy while Northern Albania was allocated to the states of Serbia and Montenegro. By 31 October 1918, French and Italian forces expelled the Austro-Hungarian Army from Albania. After World War I ended, Italy withdrew its military forces on 2 September 1920 from Albania as a result of foreign pressure and defeat in the Vlora War. The Italian Fascist regime had politically and economically penetrated and dominated Albania during Zog's rule and was planning for annexation of Albania years prior to the event.Owen Pearson.

Albania in the twentieth century: a history, Volume 3. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: I.B. Taurus Publishers, 2004. Pp. 378. In August 1933, Mussolini placed stringent demands on Zog in exchange for Italy's continued support of Albania, including demands that all new appointments to leading positions in the Albanian government had to have received an \\"Italian education\\"; that an Italian expert was in the future to be in all Albanian government ministries; that Italy would take control of Albania's military – including its fortifications; that British officers that were training Albania's gendarmee be replaced by Italian officers; and that Albania must annul all of its existing commercial treaties with other countries and make no new agreements without the approval of the Italian government; and that Albania sign a commercial convention that would make Italy Albania's \\"most favoured country\\" in trade.Owen Pearson.

In 1934 when Albania did not deliver its scheduled payment of one loan to Italy, Italian warships arrived off the coast of Albania to intimidate Albania to submit to Italian goals in the region. However, the British opposed Italy's actions and under pressure, Italy backed down and claimed that the naval exercise was merely a \\"friendly visit\\". On 25 August 1937, Italian foreign minister Count Ciano wrote in his diary of Italy's relations with Albania in the following: \\"We must create stable centres of Italian influence there. Who knows what the future may have in store? We must be ready to seize opportunities which will present themselves. We are not going to withdraw this time, as we did in 1920. In the south [of Italy] we have absorbed several hundred thousand Albanians. Why shouldn’t the same thing happen on the other side of the entrance to the Adriatic.\\". On 26 March 1938, Ciano wrote in his diary of annexing Albania like Germany did with Austria shortly prior: \\"A report from Jacomoni on the situation in Albania. Our penetration is becoming steadily more intense and more organic. The programme which I traced after my visit is being carried out without a hitch. I am wondering whether the general situation – particularly the Anschluss [with Austria] – does not permit us to take a step forward towards the more complete domination of this country, which will be ours.\\" and days later on 4 April of that year wrote \\"We must gradually underline the protectorate element of our relations with Albania\\".Owen Pearson. Albania in the twentieth century: a history, Volume 3. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: I.B. Taurus Publishers, 2004. Pp. 396.  Invasion and the establishment of the Italian regime  Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, King of Albania from 1939 to 1943 Shefqet Vërlaci, Prime Minister of Albania from 1939 to 1941 In spite of Albania's long-standing protection and alliance with Italy, on 7 April 1939 Italian troops invaded Albania, five months before the start of the Second World War. The Albanian armed resistance proved ineffective against the Italians and, after a short defense, the country was occupied. On 9 April 1939 the Albanian king, Zog I fled to Greece. Although Albania had been a de facto Italian protectorate since 1927, Italy's political leader, Benito Mussolini wanted direct control over the country to increase his and Italy's prestige, provide a response to Germany's annexation of Austria and occupation of Czechoslovakia, and to have firm control over Albania to station large forces of the Italian military for future operations involving Yugoslavia and Greece. Albania was an Italian protectorate subordinated to Italian interests, along the lines of the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Victor Emmanuel III was proclaimed king of Albania, creating a personal union with Italy; he was represented in Tirana by a viceroy. A customs union was created, and Rome took over Albanian foreign policy. The Albanian armed forces were subsumed into the Italian military, Italian advisers were placed inside all levels of the Albanian administration, and the country was fascisticized with the establishment of an Albanian Fascist Party and its attendant organizations, modelled after the Italian prototype. The Albanian Fascist Party was a branch of the National Fascist Party of Italy, members of the Albanian Fascist Party took an oath to obey the orders of the Duce of Fascism, Mussolini.Raphaël Lemkin. Axis Rule in Occupied Europe. Slark, New Jersey, USA: The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd., 2005. Pp. 102. Italian citizens began to settle in Albania as colonists and to own land so that they could gradually transform it into Italian soil. While Victor Emmanuel ruled as king, Shefqet Vërlaci served as the prime minister. Vërlaci controlled the day-to-day activities of the Italian protectorate. On 3 December 1941, Shefqet Vërlaci was replaced as prime minister by Mustafa Merlika-Kruja. The country's natural resources too came under direct control of Italy. All petroleum resources in Albania went through Agip, Italy's state petroleum company. Albania was important culturally and historically to the nationalist aims of the Italian Fascists, as the territory of Albania had long been part of the Roman Empire, even prior to the annexation of northern Italy by the Romans. Later, during the High Middle Ages some coastal areas (like Durazzo) had been influenced and owned by Italian powers, chiefly the Kingdom of Naples and the Republic of Venice for many years (cf. Albania Veneta). The Italian Fascist regime legitimized its claim to Albania through studies proclaiming the racial affinity of Albanians and Italians, especially as opposed to the Slavic Yugoslavs. Italian Fascists claimed that Albanians were linked through ethnic heritage to Italians due to links with the prehistoric Italiotes, Illyrian and Roman populations, and that the major influence exhibited by the Roman and Venetian empires over Albania justified Italy's right to possess it. Italy also attempted to legitimize and win public support for its rule over Albania by supporting Albanian irredentism, directed against the predominantly Albanian-populated Kosovo in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Epirus in Greece, particularly the border area of Chameria, inhabited by the Cham Albanian minority. Thus a Fascist Italian publication named Geopolitica claimed that the population of the Epirus-Acarnania region of Greece belonged to Albania due to it being racially Dinaric, and formed a 'single geographic system' with the Adriatic zone. Despite the efforts of the Italian vicegerent, Francesco Jacomoni, to stir up insurrections and create a fifth column, and the favourable reports he sent to the Italian foreign minister Count Ciano, events proved that there was little enthusiasm among the Albanians themselves: after the Italian invasion of Greece, most Albanians either deserted or defected.  Albania at war  Italian troops disembarking from ships, April 1939 Italian troops entering Durazzo The Greek counteroffensive (13 November 1940-7 April 1941) during the Greco-Italian War Strategically, control of Albania gave Italy an important beachhead in the Balkans: not only did it complete Italian control of the Strait of Otranto and the entrance to the Adriatic Sea, it could be used to invade either Yugoslavia (in tandem with another thrust via Venezia Giulia) or Greece. In 1939, Count Ciano spoke of Albanian irredentist claims to Kosovo as valuable to Italy's objectives, saying: The Corporative Council of the Albanian Fascist Party, a quasi-statal organization, issued a directive on 16 June 1940, shortly after Italy's declarations of war against Britain and France, that stated that \\"The Kingdom of Albania considers itself at war with all nations against which Italy is at war—at present or in the future.\\"Angelo Piero Sereni, \\"The Legal Status of Albania\\", The American Political Science Review 35 2 (1941): 317. In October 1940, during the Greco-Italian War, Albania served as a staging-area for Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's unsuccessful invasion of Greece. Mussolini planned to invade Greece and other countries like Yugoslavia in the area to give Italy territorial control of most of the Mediterranean Sea coastline, as part of the Fascists' objective of creating the objective of Mare Nostrum (\\"Our Sea\\") in which Italy would dominate the Mediterranean. But the Albanian army under the command of colonel (later general) Prenk PerviziPieter Hidri, General Prenk Pervizi, Tirana, Toena, 2002. abandoned the Italians in combat, causing a major unraveling of their lines. The Albanian army believed to be the cause of the betrayal was removed from the front. The Colonel Pervizi and his staff of officials was isolated in the mountains of Puka and Shkodra to the North.Julian Amery, The sons of the Eagle, London, 1946, s. 302–306 This was the first action of revolt against the Italian occupation. 1940 Albanian Kingdom Laissez Passer issued for traveling to Italy after the invasion of 1939 But, soon after the Italian invasion, the Greeks counter-attacked and a sizable portion of Albania was in Greek hands (including the cities of Gjirokastër and Korçë). In April 1941, Greece capitulated after an overwhelming German invasion. All of Albania returned to Italian control, which was also extended to most of Greece, which was jointly occupied by Italy, Germany and Bulgaria. Italian plans however to annex Chameria to Albania were shelved due strong opposition and ethnic conflict between Albanians and Greeks, as well as opposition by Aromanians to the region being Albanianized. After the fall of Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941, the Italian government began negotiations with Germany, Bulgaria, and the newly established client state, the Independent State of Croatia, on defining their borders. In April Mussolini called for the borders of Albania to be expanded – including annexing Montenegro into Albania that would have an autonomous government within Albania, and expanding Albania's border eastwards, though not as far as the Vardar river as some had proposed – citing that Ohrid should be left to the Slavic Macedonians, regardless of whether Vardar Macedonia would become an independent state or be annexed by Bulgaria.Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European empire. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006 Pp. 79. However the Italian government changed its positions on the border throughout April, later supporting the annexation of Ohrid while giving the territory lying directly outside of Ohrid (including the sacred birthplace of Saint Clement) to the Slavic Macedonians. After a period of negotiations Italy's new Balkan borders – including Albania's new borders, were declared by royal decree on 7 June 1941. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the country was occupied by the Germans until the end of the war. Economy Albania during World War II Upon the occupation of Albania and installation of a new government, the economies of Albania and Italy were connected through a customs union that resulted in the removal of most trade restrictions. Through a tariff union, the Italian tariff system was put in place in Albania. Due to the expected economic losses in Albania from the alteration in tariff policy, the Italian government provided Albania 15 million Albanian leks each year in compensation. Italian customs laws were to apply in Albania and only Italy alone could conclude treaties with third parties. Italian capital was allowed to dominate the Albanian economy. As a result, Italian companies were allowed to hold monopolies in the exploitation of Albanian natural resources. In 1944, the number of companies and industrial enterprises reached 430, from just 244 in 1938 and only 71 such in 1922. The degree of concentration of workers in industrial production in 1938 doubled compared with 1928. At this time, Albania's economy had trade relations with 21 countries, but most developed were first to Italy and then to Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Greece, etc. The country entered capitalist economic development much later than other European countries. Despite the presence of some foreign (mainly Italian) investment, Albania had made little move towards industrial development at the onset of World War II. Agriculture, which employed over 87% of the workforce, was the main sector of the economy and contributed 92.4% of the national income, with main outputs being wheat, maize and rye. Agriculture used primitive tools such as wood ploughs, whilst fertilisers were hardly known at all, and drainage poor. The level of productivity and level of organization and mechanization of agriculture in this period were very low. Administrative division The Italians adopted the existing Albanian system of prefectures (Italian: prefetture). In line with the administrative structure of the rest of Italy these were also called provinces (Italian: provincia). However, unlike Italy the Albanian sub-prefecture (Italian: sotto prefetture) was retained. There were initially 10 prefectures.Great Britain, War Office; Italy OR 5301 (1943)Great Britain, War Office; Albania OR 5824 (1943) Under this was 30 sub- prefectures and 23 municipalities (Italian: municipalità). Each Prefecture was run by a Prefect located in the city of the same name. In 1941, following the dismemberment of Yugoslavia, three new Prefectures were added. Kossovo, Metohija and Debar, with 5 sub-prefectures Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European empire. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006 Pp. 293.

Taradash's credits include Golden Boy (1939), From Here to Eternity (1952), Rancho Notorious (1952), Don't Bother to Knock (1952), Désirée (1954), Picnic (1955), Storm Center (1956), which he also directed, Bell, Book and Candle (1958), Morituri (1965), Hawaii (1966), Castle Keep (1969), Doctors' Wives (1971), and Bogie (1980), a film biography of Humphrey Bogart. Early years Daniel Taradash was born to a Jewish family in Kentucky and raised in Chicago and Miami Beach. He attended Harvard University, where he met his future producing partner Jules Blaustein. He graduated with a law degree and passed the New York State bar. But when his play The Mercy won the 1938 Bureau of New Plays contest (the two previous winners were Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams), a career in theater was launched. He moved to Hollywood, where he worked as a scripter. His first assignment was as one of four credited writers on the screen version of Clifford Odets' Golden Boy (1939). His theater career was interrupted when, during World War II, Taradash served in the US Army and eventually underwent training in the Signal Corps Officer Candidate program. He was assigned to the Signal Corps Photo Center and worked as a writer and producer of training films. Post World War II career After the war, Taradash attempted to find success on Broadway with an American version of Jean-Paul Sartre's Red Gloves, but the show folded quickly and he returned to Hollywood. He had more success as the co-writer (with John Monks Jr) of the Humphrey Bogart vehicle Knock on Any Door (1949). The Fritz Lang Western Rancho Notorious and the psychodrama Don't Bother to Knock (both 1952). Performers included Marlene Dietrich and Arthur Kennedy in the former, Richard Widmark and Marilyn Monroe in the latter. Taradash's adaptation of James Jones' massive novel From Here to Eternity (1953), was a big success and earned him an Oscar. It was directed by Fred Zinnemann. His subsequent film work was generally in adaptations, including Desiree (1954), about Napoleon and Joséphine, Picnic (1955), from the William Inge play, and Bell, Book and Candle (1958), from John Van Druten's stage comedy. In the mid-1950s, Taradash and Jules Blaustein formed Phoenix Corporation. He also tried his hand at directing with Storm Center (1956), about a librarian fighting censorship. Taradash and Zinnemann had planned to make two films from James Michener's massive novel Hawaii but were unable to raise the financing. (When George Roy Hill did make the film in 1965, he utilized Taradash's script with emendations by Dalton Trumbo.) By the 1970s, Taradash's efforts produced his final two scripts for the soap operas Doctors' Wives (1971) and The Other Side of Midnight (1977). Taradash won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Drama for From Here to Eternity, and received a WGA nomination for Picnic. Taradash served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1970 to 1973. He was AMPAS's 20th president. In 1972 he introduced Charlie Chaplin at Chaplin's legendary appearance at the 44th Academy Awards and presented him with an honorary award. Taradash died of pancreatic cancer in Los Angeles.

The queen remarried, and that husband also died. Then she married a third time, and that husband was so cruel to her that she became ill and died. The last husband wanted to marry her daughter. The daughter's mare told her to ask her stepfather for a dress of silver; with some help from fairies, it took a year and six months. Then she asked for a dress of gold, which took two years and six months, and a dress of diamonds and pearls, which took three years and six months. The mare gave her a dress of rabbit skin, and the princess rode off on her. Some hunters, including a prince, found her and took her to the castle, where they gave her a job in the kitchen. They were rude, saying she needed only the ears to be a rabbit. One day, the mare told her that the prince was going to a party; the mare carried her there and gave her a nut that held the silver dress. The next day, she went in the gold dress; the third, in the dress of diamonds and pearls, and the prince gave her a golden ring.

This made production easier and cheaper but effectively limited torque capacity to 200 lb. ft. or so. The Type 9 is a popular choice for five-speed conversions of older cars and also for kit car builders, since it comes with a separate bell housing so it can be easily swapped around. Engines that were originally in FWD layouts are fitted to these transmissions so that they can go into a RWD layout, as in a hot rod engine swap or kit car. The gearbox has a 23-spline input shaft, and the main gear housing is cast iron with a cast aluminum tailshaft housing.

As a highly honored son of Emperor Taizong, he was one time considered a possible candidate as crown prince after both his older brother Li Chengqian and younger brother Li Tai were both deposed in 643, but eventually, his younger brother Li Zhi, as a son of Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun, was created crown prince and inherited the throne after Emperor Taizong's death in 649 (as Emperor Gaozong), under the insistence of Li Zhi's uncle and Emperor Taizong's brother-in-law Zhangsun Wuji. Zhangsun, however, detested Li Ke, and in 653, he implicated Li Ke in a plot by the official Fang Yi'ai (房遺愛) and had Emperor Gaozong order Li Ke to commit suicide.  Early life  It is not known exactly when Li Ke was born, but he was likely born around 619,This is based on the historical records on the birthdates of his older brother Li Chengqian and younger brother Li Tai, both born around that time as well, although the historical records as to Li Chengqian's and Li Tai's birth dates are themselves in conflict. See those articles for details. as he was the third son of Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, a son of Emperor Gaozu. His mother was Li Shimin's concubine Consort Yang, a daughter of Emperor Yang of Sui, making Li Ke a Sui Dynasty imperial descendant through his mother. (Consort Yang would later give birth to a younger brother of Li Ke's, Li Yin (李愔).) In 620, Emperor Gaozu created Li Ke the Prince of Changsha, at the same time that his brothers Li Chengqian and Li Tai were also created imperial princes.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  In 626, Li Shimin, in an intense rivalry with his older brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince and fearing that Li Jiancheng was about to kill him, ambushed Li Jiancheng and another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, who supported Li Jiancheng, at Xuanwu Gate and killed them. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to first create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). He created Li Ke the Prince of Han, and in 627 changed Li Ke's title to Prince of Shu, and while initially he was not commissioned with a post outside the capital Chang'an, eventually he was made the commandant at Qi Prefecture (齊州, roughly modern Jinan, Shandong). In 636, his title was changed to Prince of Wu, and he was made the commandant at An Prefecture (安州, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei). While at An Prefecture, in 637 Li Ke often out on hunt, damaged people's houses and many farmland, the assistant imperial censor Liu Fan (柳范) submitted an accusation. As a result, Li Ke received excoriation from his father, and was removed from his post, and 300 households were removed from his fief. In 643, with Li Chengqian, then crown prince, and Li Tai, locked in an intense rivalry, Li Chengqian plotted to overthrow Emperor Taizong and was deposed. Emperor Taizong initially wanted to make Li Tai crown prince, but soon, believing that Li Tai's machinations were responsible for Li Chengqian's downfall, exiled Li Tai as well and created their younger brother, his ninth son Li Zhi the Prince of Jin, the new crown prince, believing Li Zhi to be kind. (Li Chengqian, Li Tai, and Li Zhi were all born of Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun.) Later, however, he began to believe that Li Zhi's personality was too weak and worried that he would not be appropriate as an emperor, he showed this his worry once, said he may considered making Li Ke crown prince instead. Li Zhi's uncle Zhangsun Wuji opposed this immediately, and Emperor Taizong did not do so, but an enmity thereafter developed between Zhangsun Wuji and Li Ke.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  Emperor Taizong died in 649 and was succeeded by Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong). As the emperor's older brother, Li Ke was given the highly honored, although without actual power, position of Sikong (司空), and made the commandant at Liang Prefecture (梁州, roughly modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). In 652, Emperor Gaozong's sister Princess Gaoyang, Princess Gaoyang's husband Fang Yi'ai (son of the deceased chancellor Fang Xuanling), the general Xue Wanche (薛萬徹), Emperor Gaozong's uncle Li Yuanjing (李元景) the Prince of Jing, and another brother-in-law Chai Lingwu (柴令武), were accused of a treasonous plot to overthrow Emperor Gaozong and make Li Yuanjing emperor. Fang Yi'ai knew that Zhangsun feared and was jealous of Li Ke and had long wanted to find a way to kill Li Ke to remove any hopes from the people that Li Ke would become emperor. He therefore claimed that Li Ke was part of the plot as well, hoping to ingratiate Zhangsun sufficiently to be spared. In spring 653, Emperor Gaozong, at Zhangsun's urging, issued an edict to execute Fang Yi'ai, Xue, and Chai, while ordering Li Yuanjing, Li Ke, and Princesses Gaoyang and Baling (Chai's wife) to commit suicide. (Emperor Gaozong initially wanted to spare Li Yuanjing and Li Ke, but did not do so when Cui Dunli the minister of defense opposed it.) When Li Ke was about to do so, he cursed Zhangsun, stating: Zhangsun also had Consort Yang and Li Yin reduced to commoner rank and exiled to Ba Prefecture (巴州, roughly modern Bazhong, Sichuan), and Li Ke's four sons, Li Ren (李仁), Li Wei (李瑋), Li Kun (李琨), and Li Jing (李璄) were exiled to the modern Guangdong region. Li Ke's young fourth daughter was sent to Xianling (tomb of Emperor Gaozu of Tang) to be kept under house arrest till 689, upon which time she was created Princess Xin'an. In 660, after Zhangsun's own downfall (at the hands of Emperor Gaozong's wife Empress Wu and her associates), Li Ke was posthumously created the Prince of Yulin, but was not given a posthumous name, nor was his son permitted to inherit the title; rather, Li Rong (李榮), the grandson of Li Xiaogong the Prince of Hejian, was adopted into Li Ke's line and took the title of Marquess of Yulin. Eventually, however, after Li Rong was deposed for an unrelated reason, Li Ren (later known as Li Qianli (李千里)) was permitted to inherit the title, and around 705, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong's son Emperor Zhongzong, Li Ke was posthumously honored again with the title of Sikong and reburied with honor.

Kennedy in July 1963. It was meant to make it less profitable for U.S. investors to invest abroad by taxing the purchase of foreign securities. The design of the tax was to reduce the balance-of-payment deficit. Originally intended to be a temporary tax, it lasted until 1974. It raised cost of borrowing in U.S Purpose The purpose of the tax was to decrease the balance of payments deficit in the US. This was achieved conceptually by making investments in foreign securities less appealing. By increasing the price of the security, investors will buy fewer of them, all else equal. With fewer domestic investors purchasing foreign securities, capital outflows will be lower, thereby reducing the balance-of-payments deficit. The equation for the balance of payments is: : \\\\text{BOP} = \\\\text{current account} + \\\\text{capital account} \\\\pm \\\\text{balancing item} \\\\, The identity for the capital account is: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mbox{Capital account} & = \\\\mbox{Change in foreign ownership of domestic assets} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\- \\\\mbox{Change in domestic ownership of foreign assets} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} So when capital outflows decrease, the capital account increases. When the capital account increases, the balance-of-payments increases. Dates Effective The tax was effective on purchases made after July 18, 1963. It was scheduled to expire on January 1, 1966, but was extended multiple times, and eventually abolished on January, 1974. Amount of the tax * For foreign stocks, the tax is 15% of the price * For debt obligations there is a range between the following bounds: # For debt obligations having 3 to 3.5 years remaining until maturity, the tax is 2.75% of purchase price # For debt obligations having 28.5 years remaining until maturity, the tax is 15% of purchase price Exemptions * Debt obligations with less than 3 years remaining until maturity * Investments in developing countries * Investments that result in the U.S. citizen owning a 10% or more voting stock in the foreign corporation * Debt obligations that were issued to a U.S. person in order for that foreign corporation to purchase U.S.-produced goods * Foreign securities that would endanger international monetary stability. The President will determine if any foreign securities qualify for this exemption. Canadian-issued securities were the only initial exemption from the tax in 1963 * Debt obligations acquired by commercial banks to make loans (deposits, etc.) * Insurance companies who invest in foreign securities with premiums collected from foreigners * Labor unions that invest in foreign securities with the money from dues collected abroad from foreign members *Investment banks that underwrite foreign securities are exempt from the tax when they acquire and resell such securities from the corporation *U.S.-controlled foreign corporations (>50% owned by U.S. persons and registered on U.R. securities exchanges) Estimated Revenue The tax was expected to raise $30 million per year. Effect on the Deficit As the original intent of the Interest Equalization Tax was the reduce the balance-of-payments deficit, a majority consider the tax successful. * Between 1961 and 1964, the deficit averaged $2.5 billion * In the years 1965 to 1966, the deficit averaged $1.1 billion * In 1967, the deficit was $3.5 billion * In 1968, there was a surplus of $93 million Since many factors influence the balance-of-payments account, the effect of the tax is unclear. However, there was a positive trend in the years after it was enacted. Effect on Financial Markets The interest equalization tax \\"brought American investment activity in foreign markets to a virtual standstill.\\" However, financial markets responded over time with massive evasion of the tax, along with the development of the eurodollar market.

It was founded due to the lack of nursing schools in New York that accepted African American women. Until 1923, the Lincoln Hospital School for Nurses in The Bronx was the only school that allowed the enrollment of Black women. When Mayor Hylan sought reelection in 1921, the NAACP and other community organizations lobbied the mayor to improve healthcare access. Around the same time, Lurline Vassalls of Brooklyn was denied entry to the Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing because of her race. Lurline's father William launched a campaign to open a school for black nurses. In response, Hylan's administration supported the creation of the Harlem Hospital School of Nursing. The school opened on January 3, 1923 with a class of twenty black women. It was a two and a half year program. The Harlem Hospital School of Nursing closed in 1977.

Biography  Hopkins was born in Richmond, Virginia. In 1976, he graduated Harvard University with a bachelor's degree. He earned his Master of Divinity (1984), Master of Philosophy (1987), and his PhD (1988) from Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. He has a second earned PhD from the University of Cape Town in South Africa, which became a basis for his book Down, Up and Over: Slave Religion and Black Theology (2000). Hopkins is currently professor of theology at the Divinity School of University of Chicago. Hopkins is the Communications Coordinator for the International Association of Black Religions and Spiritualities, a Ford Foundation sponsored global project. Hopkins is a member and teaches at Trinity United Church of Christ. Barack Obama was also formerly a member of this church.  Theology Hopkins is a constructive theologian focusing on contemporary models of theology, black theology, and liberation theologies. He defines black theology as \\"how God, or the spirit of freedom, works with the oppressed black community for their full humanity.\\" According to Hopkins black theology started with a full-page ad in the New York Times in 1966 by a few black pastors asking for a \\"theological interpretation of black power.\\" Today it focuses on the area of asking how to include black churches and how to serve them in a crisis. He began working with black theology when a colleague gave him a two-page article about it by James Hal Cone from the Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. After meeting with the dean at the seminary to discuss points in the article he was enrolled in their master's program and Cone was his new advisor. Hopkins has commented on, and mentioned as a source of inspiration for black liberation theology by Jeremiah Wright. Wright was lead pastor at the church attended by presidential candidate Barack Obama, and the source of some recent controversy. Hopkins attends and has spoken in defence of the Trinity United Church of Christ, often supporting Wright. Hopkins explains Wright's use of \\"God damn America\\" was taken out of context as it was theological wordplay, using the word \\"damn\\" straight out its specific meaning in the original Hebrew. > \\"It means a sacred condemnation by God to a wayward nation who has strayed > from issues of justice, strayed from issues of peace, strayed from issues of > reconciliation…\\" Hopkins also stated that attacks on Wright are actually attacks on the very institution of the Black church > \\"To caricature and attack Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. is to attack the Black > church in America…. Attempts to muzzle him and Trinity United Church of > Christ in Chicago exemplify a bad omen for every African American preacher > and every African American church in the country. And with the Black church > censored, other Christian churches will be the next in line.

Founded:  1924 - ! Membership:  150 - ! President :  Roland Collicott - ! Website:  http://www.westerley.cc/ } The Westerley Cycling Club is based in Ealing, West London. It was founded in 1924, and has played a prominent role in the development of time trialling in the United Kingdom.  History   Early  'The Westerley' as it is known today was originally formed as a racing subset of the Western Section of the CTC (Cyclists' Touring Club), now the Ealing section of the West London DA. This was intended to allow members of that CTC section to form a racing club without ultimately disentangling themselves from the then hugely popular CTC. The \\"Western Wheelers\\" was therefore formed for the use of regular riding male members of the local CTC section. Women were admitted in 1927, by which point it had emerged that there was already a club named \\"Western Wheelers\\", and so the name \\"Western Elite\\" was briefly adopted, eventually becoming the \\"Westerley Road Club\\". The close connections to the CTC can still be seen in the club logo, which is clearly influenced by the CTC logo comprising a bicycle wheel with concentric star of three wings. The colours - purple, white and black - are those of the founding CTC section. 1925 was the first fully active year for the Westerley Road Club, which, led by its president Will Townsend OBE (d.2007), promoted a programme of time trials. These consisted of the standard distances; 10, 25, 50 and 100 miles, as well as a 12-hour event and a hill climb. The Second World War brought several casualties for the club, although it survived and returned to its previous strength during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Members of the Westerley have, during the 20th Century, enjoyed considerable success in many types of racing, in particular tricycling and RRA (Road Records Association) records.  Modern  In 2003, the name \\"Westerley Road Club\\" was updated to the \\"Westerley Cycling Club\\". This change denoted a response to the dwindling profile of traditional time trialling clubs in the UK. The Westerley now promotes a set of spring criterium races at the Hillingdon Cycle Circuit in West London, in addition to a reduced time trial programme. The Westerley Cycling Club is affiliated to British Cycling and Cycling Time Trials. Westerley also organise annual Audax events from Ruislip.

It is known for its former owner, railroad executive James J. Hill, who purchased it in 1886 for his wife as part of a diamond- and sapphire-adorned necklace. It was eventually split off and given to one of their children. It was later donated to the Minnesota Historical Society, who sold it at auction at Christie's for $3,064,000, ahead of expectations. It is currently the world's most valuable known sapphire. Characteristics The Kashmir sapphire weighs 22.66 carats (4.532 g). It has a \\"cornflower color with a velvety texture\\" and has a \\"very high degree of transparency.\\" It is set within a European-cut diamond surround and mounted in gold. History The sapphire was originally a part of a $2,200 diamond- and sapphire-adorned necklace. It was owned by a vendor identified as Randel, Baremore Billings until it was purchased by James T. Hill in 1886. James then gave the sapphire as a gift to his wife, Mary Hill that same year. Three years after Hill's death in 1916, the necklace was split between Hill's six daughters, dividing the central stone and 36 smaller gems between them. The sapphire first entered the possession of Gertrude Gavin before she gave it to her sister, Rachel Boeckmann. It later entered the possession of Gertrude Ffolliett, granddaughter of Mary Hill. Sale James J. Hill House When Gertrude died in 2005, she included in her will that the sapphire would be given to Friends of the James J. Hill House with the authorization to sell it. It was not entered into the society's collection or put on display due to the feeling that because the necklace was split up, it did not have the historical significance that it would have if it was part of the necklace. It was sought to be sold, and initial expectations of the price of the sapphire was approximately $80,000 to $90,000, though it was later upgraded to $250,000 to $350,000 when the Minnesota Historical Society, the administers of the James J. Hill House turned it over to Christie's New York. This later estimate was acknowledged by insiders as a \\"low-ball estimate,\\" however. The sapphire's value was later upped by Rahul Kadakia, senior vice president and head of jewelry at Christie's America, to approximately $1 million. It was sold as Lot No. 261, and the auctioneer was François Curiel. Its catalogue copy read \\"one of the most important sapphires currently on the market and is unsurpassed in richness and life,\\" which author Stephen G. Bloom described as \\"expected hyperbole.\\" Bidding for the sapphire began at $1 million, and through multiple bids it rose over 90 seconds to $2 million. Two men eventually entered a bidding war, where they each were raising the bid by $100,000 increments every 20 seconds. The bidding had slowed at $2.5 million, with an eventual attempt by one to raise it to $2.6 million, only for him to be outbid at $2.7 million and the bidding to end.

Its headquarters are at City Gate in Port of Spain (formerly the Trinidad Government Railway headquarters). Passengers have to buy the tickets at a ticket booth and show it to the driver. The fares vary with distance. There are two type of buses: the blue-and-white buses are the regular and the red-and-white are the express commuter buses. The latter are more expensive, make fewer stops and are more comfortable. History Trinidad began with the establishment of the Trinidad Railway Company in 1846. The Company surveyed the country with the intention of implementing a railway system. However, the finances needed to continue with this project were not available. Subsequently, on Saturday 5 March 1859 the Cipero Tramroad became Trinidad’s first railway. It was planters’ line that passed between Mission (now Princes Town) and Kings Wharf at San Fernando. It was used primarily to transport produce from the remote estates of the Naparimas out to Kings Wharf to waiting ships. The man responsible for this tramway was sugar planter William Eccles. The tramway was used primarily for transporting produce but there was a great demand for the transportation of workers from one estate to another along the line. A number of prominent persons also indicated their desire to commute by tramway rather than by horseback. The owners of the tramways could not ignore the demands of the commuters and facilitated a few passengers; this started the tramway’s first passenger service. It also acted as the first postal service between San Fernando and Mission. The Cipero Tramroad was greatly successful and lasted up to the 1920s before it was absorbed into the Trinidad Government Railway. City Service PTSC city service is a service which operates within both Port Of Spain and San Fernando Know Your Country Tours This tour begins at the historic Railway Building, South Quay, Port of Spain and journeys to the South East Coast of the island. Along the way, patrons will learn about places of interest, our people’s history and local folklore. On approaching the coast, patrons will get the opportunity to see the splendor of the mouth of the Ortoire River. This river is fifty (50) km long and extends into the Atlantic Ocean. Fishes and manatees are abundant in these waters. Patrons will also be afforded the opportunity to observe the beauty of Manzanilla Beach, and enjoy the scenic drive through Manzanilla Road which is lined with coconut trees and the Atlantic Ocean running along its coastline. The name Manzanilla was derived from Spanish sailors in the 18th century, because it was thickly covered with small round poisonous fruits called manchineels. These fruits resembled small apples and thus the name Manzanilla (“small apples”) The final point of interest along this route is Mayaro. Mayaro is one of the earliest villages in Trinidad. It was an Arawak settlement before the arrival of the Spanish. The name “Mayaro” means place of the maya plant; which was of great importance to the Amerindians. Here, patrons can indulge themselves in beach activities or simply just enjoy the sound of the crashing waves.

Career Ambrós started his professional life as a teacher, and taught children until the end of the Spanish Civil War. After Franco took over in 1939, he quit teaching, due to political and moral reasons; he did not want to be a mouthpiece for Falangist ideals. He went to work with his parents in the fields instead. In 1946, he met with Juan Puerto, founder of the Editorial Valenciana. Ambrós showed him the comic that he had been working on, El Guerrero del Antifaz (The Masked Warrior), and, impressed, Puerto opened the possibility for Ambrós to draw some humorous comic strips for his editorial. In the same year, Ambrós left Albuixech for Barcelona, where he began to make a living drawing comics for an array of small magazines, including his adventure series Dos Yanquís en África (Two Yankees in Africa), published by Bergis Mundial, and a range of comics for the weekly magazine, Chispa. His first substantial success came when he was asked to illustrate the series El Caballero Fantasma, (the Ghost Horseman,) written by Federico Amorós. Published by Grafidea, the series followed a character with noticeable similarities to el Zorro. Things hit a halt when another publisher, Saturn, demanded that the character be killed, as they had already a series named El Caballero Fantasma. Rather than stop publishing the series, Amorós carried it on, but from the perspective of the Ghost Horseman's protégé, El Jinete Fantasma (The Ghost Rider.) Rather than damage sales, as had been expected, sales went through the roof. Due to the success of El Jinete Fantasma, Ambrós was rewarded by a contract with the famous Editorial Bruguera. While working for Bruguera, he illustrated Pulgarcito's La nave del tiempo (The Time Ship), of which ten annuals were published. His greatest fame yet was to come in 1956, when he was approached with the job of developing and illustrating Capitán Trueno from the synopsis provided by the writer, Víctor Mora. Capitán Trueno was published both in Pulgarcito magazine and as a biweekly comic book. After the 22nd edition, a new Capitán Trueno comic book was published every week, pushing Ambrós into a frenetic work schedule. Until the 35th edition, Ambrós did all illustration on his own, but thereafter, he was assisted in the creation of many editions (36, 38-45, 47-168 and 173-175) by a colourist by the name of Beaumont. Capitán Trueno occupied a central place in Pulgarcito magazine also. Shifting 350,000 copies at its peak, it achieved an unequalled level of popularity for a Spanish comic. However, this resounding success did not bear any financial reward for Ambrós, who was working at a frantic pace for a relatively meagre sum. Thus, he quit Capitán Trueno after edition 175. In 1960, he moved to Paris to try to start a career as a painter, but he failed to find fortune and returned to Spain in 1964, where he would work for Bruguera yet again. Although he did not want to start drawing Capitán Trueno again, preferring to draw Tarzan and Rintintin comic strips and to illustrate the magazine's short stories, he was obliged to draw 'Trueno Extra' comic books from September 1964 onwards. He would only illustrate three editions. He left Bruguera in 1965 and started to work for the Editorial Valenciana, for whom he drew many comic strips, including El Corsario de Hierro, (The Iron Privateer,) another Víctor Mora character. In 1981, Ambrós retired from the world of comic books, and, except for a one-off edition of Capitán Trueno for Editorial Toutain's History of Comics, he would never return. He received the Gran Premio del Salón del Cómic prize for his contribution to comics in 1989, and he would die three years later. Capitán Trueno, and, indeed, the history of Spanish comics, would be very different without Ambrós' input.

The series so far includes five films; Torrente: El brazo tonto de la ley (1998), Torrente 2: Misión en Marbella (2001), Torrente 3: El protector (2005), Torrente 4: Lethal Crisis (2011) and Torrente 5: Operación Eurovegas (2014). There are also video games Torrente: El videojuego and Torrente 3, which were released with the second and third movies, respectively.  Description and Career  Born and usually resident in Madrid, Spain, José Luis Torrente is an ugly, bald, overweight, dirty, corrupt, lying, fascist, racist, and chauvinistic retired cop. He refuses to accept his expulsion from the Police corps, so he still \\"patrols\\" each night in his old car in order to \\"fight\\" what he considers criminal actions. Poor immigrants and drug-addicts are often victims of his actions, while he usually refuses to confront real criminals due to his actual cowardice (sometimes, however, Torrente is able to show a surprising amount of courage). Torrente openly states his admiration for Generalísimo Francisco Franco (and later for King Juan Carlos and the crown prince), and is a declared fan of the Atlético de Madrid Football Club and Spanish singer El Fary. Following his discharge, he loses his partner (an old mentor) in a shoot-out in ChinaTown brothel. He had a depressive disorder and was dismissed from his job as a cop. Due to his lack of a proper job (he continues patrolling and undertaking detective work), Torrente faces financial problems from time to time and lives in a dirty small apartment in a depressing part of the city. He used to live with his old and sick father Felipe (later revealed to be actually Torrente's uncle, due to an affair between Felipe's wife and his twin brother Mauricio) and forced him to beg for food and money in the streets, spending almost all the money collected plus his social security annuity in his personal affairs. Felipe is not the only one manipulated by Torrente in order to achieve his own goals.  Mission in Marbella  Torrente accidentally discovers and destroys a drug dealing mafia which uses a Chinese restaurant as cover, only to steal their money and start a new life as new rich in Torremolinos. He spends then millions in the Spanish Mediterranean coast until he loses all his money in a casino in Marbella. There, he establishes himself as a private investigator, discovers that his real father is the local crime boss Mauricio Torrente and stops the James Bond-type supervillain Spinelli from destroying the city - throwing his super-missile over the British naval base at Gibraltar instead. Due to this action Torrente receives a medal and is permitted to join the Police again as a traffic cop in Madrid.  Coming to the US?  The idea of making a remake in the United States was offered for the first time in 2002 by US filmmaker Oliver Stone, who suggested Josh Brolin and mainly to Robert De Niro for the lead role. Stone had seen the first two movies during a film festival in Europe and declared his admiration for the character, meeting Segura and befriending him. This first negotiations, however, didn't end well, but the rights to make a US version were finally purchased by New Line Cinema in 2006 and two American writers, Mike Bender and Doug Chernack, were hired to draw a first version of the script. It has not been revealed if the new movie would be a real remake, in which the new Torrente will be a US version of the Spanish one, or a movie featuring a mission of the horrendous Spanish policeman on US soil. In any case, it seems that Segura will not repeat in the role if there is any US version.

He is remembered today as the first person to employ the composer Joseph Haydn as his Kapellmeister, or music director.Lesser known is the Count Wenzel von Morzin, Czech Václav hrabě z Morzinu, who was Vivaldi's patron, and dedicatee of The Four Seasons; see Kapsa 2012. The first few of Haydn's many symphonies were written for the Count.  Biography  300px Different authorities give a different interpretation to the phrase \\"Count Morzin\\" (the sole words by which early Haydn biographies identified the man); the phrase is ambiguous because the title of count was hereditary, so that there was a whole line of Counts Morzin. The New Grove (article by James Webster) asserts that the \\"Count Morzin\\" who played an important role in Haydn's life was Karl Joseph Franz Morzin (1717–1783),Webster, p. 10 whereas a biography by the leading Haydn scholar H. C. Robbins Landon asserts that it was Ferdinand Maximilan Franz Morzin' (1693–1763).Robbins Landon and Jones 1988, 34 The difference apparently involves the question of whether Haydn was hired by the reigning count (Ferdinand Maximilian) or his son (Karl Joseph); see External Link below. Joseph Haydn The date of Haydn's appointment is also uncertain; it was in 1757. Burkholder, J Peter. “A History of Western Music.” Norton Ebooks, digital.wwnorton.com/44614/r/goto/cfi/324!/4 The appointment ended a period of struggle and economic insecurity for the composer, during which time he had worked as a freelance, gradually increasing his reputation and his connections with the aristocracy. Haydn's biographer Georg August Griesinger (1810), who interviewed the composer in his old age, wrote: :In the year 1759 Haydn was appointed in Vienna to be music director to Count Morzin with a salary of two hundred gulden, free room, and board at the staff table. Here he enjoyed at last the good fortune of a care-free existence; it suited him thoroughly. The winter was spent in Vienna and the summer in Bohemia, in the vicinity of Pilsen. This migratory pattern was characteristic of aristocracy in Haydn's day: summers on their hereditary estates in the provinces, winters in the fashionable capital. The location of the Count's estate has been more precisely specified by Robbins Landon as (), usually referred to as Lukavec, now in the Czech Republic. Robbins Landon, writing in 1988, adds \\"the castle, which still stands, is now used as a mental hospital.\\" Jones (2009) says of the castle that is \\"still survives, though now empty and in a state of decay.\\"Jones, David Wyn, \\"Lukavec\\", in Jones (2009) Haydn wrote, approximately, his first fifteen symphonies for Count Morzin. Evidence from copied parts made for Baron Karl Joseph Weber von Fürnberg (an earlier Haydn employer) leads Robbins Landon to conjecture that the Count's orchestra consisted of \\"at least six, possibly eight violins ... while in the basso section there were at least one cello, one bassoon and one double bass (violone). There was also a wind-band sextet (oboes, bassoons, and horns).\\".Robbins Landon and Jones 1988, 43 Thus, the orchestra was much smaller than orchestras for which Haydn wrote later on in his career (which ranged in size up to about 60), let alone a modern symphonic ensemble. While in Vienna, the Morzin ensemble was evidently part of a lively musical scene, sponsored by the aristocracy. Haydn's contemporary biographer Giuseppe Carpani (whose testimony is not always trusted by musicologists) wrote the following concerning Count Harrach, who was the patron of Haydn's own birth village of Rohrau: :Count Harrach ... was the first to bring the music of Sammartini to Vienna, where it quickly won applause and became the vogue in that great capital so enamored of this kind of diversion. Count Pálffy, ... Count Schönborn and Count Morzin vied with one another in procuring novelties for display in their almost daily concerts.Carpani 1823, 66, cited in Gotwals 1968 It was while Haydn was working for Count Morzin that he was married (17 November 1760) Anna Maria Keller, despite the fact that his contract forbade him to marry.Dies 1810, 99 The marriage, which lasted until Mrs. Haydn's death in 1800, was an unhappy one. The end of Haydn's appointment with Morzin is narrated by another early biographer, Albert Christoph Dies (1810): :A year passed without Count Morzin's knowing of the marriage of his Kapellmeister, but something else came up to alter Haydn's situation. The Count found himself obliged to reduce his heretofore great expenditures. He dismissed his musicians and so Haydn lost his post as Kapellmeister.'' :Meanwhile Haydn had the great recommendation of a public reputation; his amiable character was known; Count Morzin was moved to be useful on his behalf--three circumstances that combined so fortunately that Haydn soon after he ceased to be Kapellmeister to Count Morzin (1760) was taken on as Vicekapellmeister ... in the service of Prince Anton Esterházy ... at Eisenstadt, with a salary of 400 florins.Dies 1810, 99-100 In fact, since Haydn was Kapellmeister at Eisenstadt in all but name, the incumbent Kapellmeister being infirm, the move to the Esterházy family was a big career advance for him, and he continued there in the same general line of work, as composer, conductor, and administrator, but working for a far wealthier family.  The Haydn symphonies written for Count Morzin  Establishing just which of the Haydn symphonies were written for the Morzin orchestra is partly a matter of conjecture. Haydn scholar James Webster, following earlier research and his own efforts, produced the following list: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 18, 27, 32, 37, A, which was used in determining the contents of the opening \\"Morzin\\" volume for Christopher Hogwood's recording of the Haydn symphonies. A second volume of roughly equal length consists of symphonies that may have been composed for Morzin, though they equally well could have been composed for the Esterházy family. An earlier conjecture for which symphonies were written for Count Morzin was made by H. C. Robbins Landon, specifically numbers 1, 37, 18, 19, 2, B, 16, 17, 15, 4, 10, 32, 5, 11, 33, 27, A, 3, and 20.HC Robbins Landon, Haydn: Chronicle and Works, 5 vols, (Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1976-) v. 1, Haydn: the Early Years, 1732-1765  Notes   References  * Kapsa, Vaclav (2012) Account books, names and music: Count Wenzel von Morzin’s Virtuosissima Orchestra.

Radio Born in Butte, Montana, Card did radio roles in the late 1930s, notably Uncle Walter's Doghouse, broadcast on NBC from 1939 to 1942. She played Grandma Barton in The Bartons from December 25, 1939, to September 11, 1942, and played three roles (Carrie, Sue, and Bess) on Just Neighbors May 30-September 23, 1938.Cox, Jim (2005). Historical Dictionary of American Radio Soap Operas. Scarecrow Press, Inc. . Pp. 39, 117. In 1943, she was a cast member of Helpmate, a daytime serial on NBC. In the late 1930s, she also was in that network's Story of Mary Marlin. She was also a member of the casts of Girl Alone and The Woman in White.Sies, Luther F. (2014). Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 115. Film Her first screen credit was in 1945 for her role as Louise in the Corliss Archer movie Kiss and Tell, starring Shirley Temple as Corliss Archer. The next year, she appeared in Undercurrent with Robert Taylor, Katharine Hepburn, and Robert Mitchum. Then, in 1949, Card gave an interesting albeit brief performance (uncredited) as an extremely polite but no-nonsense loan processor for prospective borrower Joan Bennett in The Reckless Moment. Card also had a small role as a landlady of the Oleander Arms Hotel in the 1954 Warner Bros. remake of A Star Is Born. Her part consisted of one scene early in the film when movie actor Norman Maine (played by James Mason) is desperately trying to find Esther Blodgett, a girl singer he had only met briefly (played by Judy Garland). Shortly after the movie's release, Warner Bros. made extensive cuts of the film and Card's role was deleted entirely until 1983, when film historian Ronald Haver found the original monaural three-hour soundtrack along with most of the missing footage and restored the scenes. Though Card's scene with James Mason had been preserved aurally, no existing footage or stills of their scene together were found, so Haver \\"manufactured\\" stills of the scene using another actress to stand in for Card to accompany the dialogue with Card and Mason on the soundtrack. Television On February 8, 1954, Card made her first television appearance in an episode of I Love Lucy. The installment, entitled \\"Fan Magazine Interview\\", featured Card playing a slatternly woman named Minnie Finch. The following year, she was cast as a totally different character, Mrs. MacGillicuddy, Lucy's bird-brained mother. She joined the Ricardos and the Mertzes in Hollywood when Lucy's husband, Ricky Ricardo, was given the opportunity to star in a motion picture. Mrs MacGillicuddy would frequently annoy Ricky immeasurably by mistakenly calling him \\"Mickey\\" or mistaking him for his fellow bandleader Xavier Cugat. She portrayed that character in five episodes during the 1954-1955 season, and appeared in three more installments during the 1955-1956 season when the Ricardos and the Mertzes traveled to Europe. However, Card's character never appeared again once both couples moved to Connecticut in the following year. She reprised that role for the last time in one episode of The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show entitled \\"The Ricardos Go to Japan\\", which also featured guest star Robert Cummings, in 1959. In addition to I Love Lucy, Card guest-starred on several other television shows. She can be seen in two 1959 episodes of Perry Mason, portraying Hannah Barton in \\"The Case of the Deadly Toy\\" and in the role of Harriet Snow in \\"The Case of the Watery Witness.\\" Some of her other television appearances include The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Make Room for Daddy, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and Rawhide. Card also appears in the 1958 Warner Bros. film Home Before Dark. Her final film appearance is in the 1964 MGM musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown. Family Card had a daughter, Ada Card. Death On March 1, 1964, Card died as a result of a fatal heart attack at the age of 71 at her home in Costa Mesa, California. She is interred in Harbor Lawn-Mount Olive Memorial Park in Costa Mesa.

It was first published in July 1997. The magazine was started in Šaľa, Slovakia by Ivan Aľakša, who served as its editor until 2006, when he withdrew to concentrate on publishing duties and was replaced by Juraj Malíček. Fantázia went on a hiatus in 2007 before being relaunched in 2008, with broader focus on various elements of popular culture in an attempt to win over a larger audience. The magazine ultimately folded in 2011, transforming into an online, primarily Facebook-centered community. Periodicity Fantázia's original publishing frequency was bimonthly, this was however dropped in favour of quarterly periodicity by the year 2000. Since then, the magazine kept oscillating between the two, occasionally even dropping to three issues per year, as shown in the publishing history section below. In 2007, it was announced that the magazine would be discontinued, as it had not, unlike in previous years, been awarded a government grant by the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic. Only two issues, the lowest number since 1997, were published that year. Fantázia was relaunched on July 15, 2008 with a new look, new logotype and broadened focus on various aspects of popular culture. The magazine once again folded in 2011, transforming into an online, Facebook- centered community.

After the annual Krutohlav anthology which collected best short stories written by contenders for the Gustáv Reuss Award ceased its publication in 2004, Fantázia remained one of the few viable opportunities for aspiring writers to get their works published in Slovakia. Among the authors popularized by the magazine are Juraj Červenák, Dušan Fabian (whose debut novel, Invocatio Elementalium, was serialized in the magazine in 2006-2007), Michal Jedinák, Zuska Minichová and Anton Stiffel, while former Gustáv Reuss Award winners Jozef Girovský, Štefan Huslica and Alexandra Pavelková have each had several stories published. Fantázia Award Since 2003 Fantázia has held its own annual literary contest, originally called Raketa (Rocket), and later renamed to Cena Fantázie (Fantázia Award). The award gained importance especially after the discontinuation of the similarly conceived Gustáv Reuss Award and continues to exist even after the original magazine folded. The contest is free to enter for authors of original, previously unpublished short stories written in the Slovak language and of up to 54,000 characters. A committee of five judges selects five of the submitted stories to be shortlisted for the award and published in the Fantázia magazine. The winner is subsequently determined by readers' vote.

She is portrayed by actress Kristin Davis. Davis received a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performances. Character information Charlotte York is the daughter of Dr. Stephen Foster York and Sandra Whitehead York. She is an art dealer with a Connecticut blue-blooded upbringing. Charlotte graduated from Smith College with a Bachelor of Arts in Art History and a minor in Finance; she lived in Haven-Wesley House and was a member of the College Republicans and Kappa Kappa Gamma (although in real life Smith has no sororities). She is the most conservative and traditional of the group, placing more emphasis on emotional love than lust, believing in many romantic ideals, and always searching for her \\"knight in shining armor\\". Presenting a more straightforward attitude about relationships, usually based upon \\"The Rules\\" of love and dating, she often scoffs at the lewder, more libertine antics that the show presents (primarily from Samantha). Despite her conservative outlook, she has been known to make concessions that surprise even her sexually freer girlfriends (such as her level of dirty talk and oral sex). She gives up her career shortly after marrying her first husband, Trey MacDougal, but divorces him due to irreconcilable differences regarding having children, his dependent relationship with his mother and their incompatible sex life. She receives a Park Avenue apartment as part of the divorce settlement, although this is a battle fiercely fought by Trey's mother, Bunny. Charlotte subsequently marries her divorce lawyer, Harry Goldenblatt, a man who seems the antithesis of all of the qualities she had decided her perfect man would have (he is short, bald and has a very hairy back), but who actually ends up being a funny, devoted partner. She converts to Judaism in order to marry him, and models herself vaguely on Elizabeth Taylor in this aspect; Charlotte also decides to name her dog Elizabeth Taylor. In the series finale, Charlotte and Harry adopt a baby girl, Lily, from China. In the movie, Sex and the City, she and Harry have a biological baby girl, whom they name Rose. As seen in episode 8 of season 6, the New York Times wedding announcement of her and Harry's marriage indicates that Charlotte is a writer and editor for Fashions Magazine, but as this fact is not mentioned at any other time in the series or subsequent movies, it is possible it is merely a prop error- the rest of the newspaper has paragraphs taken from Big and Natasha's wedding announcement in Season 3. Background and personality Charlotte is viewed by some to be the most naive of the four characters, often showing signs of belief in the old-fashioned, \\"love conquers all\\" notion. This has earned her the nickname \\"Park Avenue Pollyanna,\\" coined by Carrie Bradshaw in narrations. Yet, her friends are sometimes envious and even in awe of her overall optimism on love and life, leading Carrie to dedicate her book to Charlotte. Charlotte is fiercely optimistic, although often anxious to make sure everything goes right. She also possesses a supportive personality with regard to her friends, always \\"being there\\" for them. Due to her conservative outlook in relationships, however, she sometimes clashes with the sexually liberal Samantha, once asking, after Samantha has sex with Charlotte's brother, \\"Is your vagina in the New York City guide books? Because it should be; it's the hottest spot in town, it's always open!\\" Yet in this instance, she apologizes by baking Samantha a basket of muffins, demonstrating her classic graceful and sweet-natured style. Her belief in romance leads her to decide to not have sex with fiancé Trey until the honeymoon. However, she is confronted by the problems of this when she discovers, the night before the wedding, when she tries to seduce Trey, that he is impotent. Later, she realizes he has problems sleeping with her and they do a lot of work to solve the issue. She is also very loyal to her friends (being uncharacteristically aggressive in cursing at Mr. Big after he abandons Carrie at the altar in the first film) and to her belief in the sanctity of marriage (she is the only friend to chastise and shame Carrie regarding her adulterous affair with Mr. Big). She also faces a comeuppance in her relationship with Harry Goldenblatt. She is not attracted to him but has sex with him and calls it \\"the best sex of my life\\". She tries to change him into her ideal man but stops when she sees how much that hurts Harry. Finally, she becomes hysterical after she converts to Judaism and prepares a perfect dinner for Harry, when he won't propose to her, and she insults him by telling him how unsuitable he is for her, which causes him to break up with her. Only when she finally agrees to accept Harry on his own terms, he does propose to her, and they, independent of any of Charlotte's machinations, end up having a relationship that fulfills all of the ideals of romanticism. It is revealed throughout the series that Charlotte enjoyed much social acclaim in her younger life, such as being prom queen, varsity cheerleader, track and field captain, teen model, and equestrienne. She is occasionally described as a WASP, an identity she seems to happily accept but converted to Judaism. Marriages Trey MacDougal Trey MacDougal (Kyle MacLachlan) is a tall, handsome doctor from an upper-crust family with an overbearing, frequently present mother who views Charlotte as a rival for her son's affections. Trey and Charlotte meet after Charlotte has resolved to meet her husband in the coming year. Their initial introduction is one in which he proves her knight in shining armor: having had a horrible date, Charlotte is nearly hit by his taxi. Trey gets out of the taxi to help her, and it is implied that they fell in \\"love at first sight.\\" Charlotte feels Trey is the ideal boyfriend and husband-candidate. After only a month of dating, Charlotte becomes anxious to receive his proposal. When introduced to the blue-blood MacDougal matriarch, Bunny, Charlotte sees how easily Trey can be manipulated and cannot help noticing his mother's methods. Frustrated with waiting, Charlotte uses Bunny's technique and suggests (at a restaurant) that they should marry, to which Trey casually and characteristically responds, \\"All righty.\\" Charlotte is furious at this response, because it was hardly the proposal of her dreams—the next day she tells Carrie she proposed to herself. Later, Trey makes up for it by stopping in front of Tiffany & Co. during a walk and suggesting that they look for \\"the most beautiful engagement ring they have.\\" They decide not to have sex until they are married, but on the day before their wedding, Charlotte gets drunk and visits Trey's apartment to seduce him. Trey is unable to perform, possibly meaning he is impotent. Charlotte addresses her concern to Carrie before she walks down the aisle, but Carrie attempts to comfort her and the marriage takes place. After they are married, Trey continues to be unable to perform in the bedroom. It is implied that his problem is not impotency, as Charlotte catches him masturbating in the bathroom to pornographic magazines. Because of their sexual problems, the two separate. They later get back together when Trey agrees to address the problem, and though he initially has problems, they eventually are able to have regular sex. After some time, Charlotte finds she has not been able to get pregnant, and discovers that she has some fertility problems. The couple starts trying IVF, but Trey, after initially agreeing to it, ultimately decides that he does not feel ready for children. The two divorce because of their different goals in the marriage. Harry Goldenblatt Harry Goldenblatt (Evan Handler) is Charlotte's divorce lawyer. Although Charlotte is initially put off by Harry's constant sweating, messy eating, shortness, baldness, and hairy body, she ends up sleeping with him when Harry confesses his intense attraction to her. She finds it is the best sex she has ever had. She tries to keep their relationship strictly sexual but soon becomes emotionally attached due to Harry's kindness, cleverness, and obvious love for her. Initially she tries to change him so that he will more closely fit her image of the ideal man, but these attempts cause Harry distress and Charlotte realizes their futility, and gradually accepts Harry the way he is. Charlotte converts to Judaism in response to Harry's avowal that he can only marry a Jewish woman, but she soon ends up ruining the relationship in a fit of anger by demanding he set a wedding date and telling him that everyone wonders why a catch like her is bothering with a schlub like him. Hurt at hearing what he believes to be what Charlotte really thinks about him, Harry breaks up with her. But after several weeks of bad blind dates, Charlotte bumps into Harry at the local synagogue singles' night and admits her wrongs, professing her deep love for him and agreeing finally to accept him as he is, rather than molding him to suit her. She says that she does not care if he ever marries her, as long as she can be with him. Harry is touched and proposes to Charlotte on the spot.  Sex and the City film  The movie begins with Charlotte's life with her daughter Lily and husband Harry and they are perfectly happy living in New York. When Carrie's wedding to Big ends in a mess, Charlotte goes with Carrie (along with Samantha and Miranda) to where she was to have her honeymoon with Big. Charlotte is extremely careful in Mexico and refuses to eat any of the food there, instead bringing her own. On vacation she became so relaxed that for a moment, whilst in the shower, Charlotte accidentally swallows some water and then not long after, gets traveler's diarrhea. Even though she and Harry had given up hoping for another baby, Charlotte unexpectedly discovers she is pregnant, much to her joy. At this moment, it seems that everything Charlotte has ever wanted is finally coming true, and Charlotte becomes \\"so happy, she's terrified.\\" In the movie it is also revealed that Charlotte always believed Carrie and Big would end up together, and when she sees Big in the street she tells him, \\"I curse the day you were born.\\" It is then that Charlotte goes into labour, and Big takes her to the hospital and waits until the baby is born. Charlotte and Harry are overjoyed when she gives birth to a baby girl they name Rose. The final scenes of the movie show Harry and Charlotte with their two daughters.  Sex and the City 2  Charlotte is a wealthy museum docent with two children and live-in, full-time help. However, she becomes stressed with motherhood and feels incapable of being a good mother to her children, eventually becoming worried that Harry is sleeping with their nanny. Charlotte later escapes to Abu Dhabi with her friends where she is still unable to ease the stresses of motherhood. Charlotte's conflicts are resolved when it is revealed that her children's nanny, Erin, is a lesbian, and her stress about motherhood is put to rest after confiding and receiving reassurances from Miranda while the two had a conversation in the private bar of their hotel room. From then on, she uses Carrie's old apartment as an occasional \\"break\\" from her family life.

Early life and career Turner was born in Norwich, England. He became interested in science fiction at an early age, with numerous works across several media: the novels of H.G. Wells, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Jules Verne; films and film serials such as Metropolis, Things to Come, and Flash Gordon; and Alex Raymond's comic strips. He developed a keen interest in American science-fiction pulp magazines, such as Amazing Stories and Astounding Stories (now known as Analog Science Fiction), and first started to develop his talent by attempting to copy the often spectacular cover illustrations. In 1936, at the age of 14, Turner first got work as an apprentice in Odhams, a London art studio and publishing house. By 1938, Turner was providing illustrations for the British magazine Modern Wonder. In 1940, Turner's professional art career was interrupted by the Second World War, and he was drafted into the British Army. He returned to professional illustration in the late 1940s, finding a job drawing comic strips for Scion's Big series, which were mostly centred around the crew of the Atomic Mole: a subterranean craft, that explored the theoretical \\"habitable spaces\\" beneath the Earth's crust. Odhams eventually began publishing a line of paperback fiction, for which Turner drew numerous covers, notably the Vargo Statten series by John Russell Fearn. Turner's art raised his profile to the extent that other publishers started to send him assignments. In 1953, Turner left Odhams to try his hand at freelancing and attempt to produce a regular comic strip in the style of British cartoonist Frank Hampson, whose work he admired. Solo comics work In 1953, Turner spoke to the publisher of Tit-Bits Science Fiction Novels (for which he was providing cover illustration) about the possibility of producing his own comic series. The publisher agreed, and began Tit-Bits Science Fiction Comics, a 64-page monthly comic book written, drawn and lettered by Turner. It quickly became apparent that the workload was too onerous for one man, and Turner brought in other artists in order to meet his deadlines. Publication was discontinued after seven issues. Around the time of the demise of Tit-Bits Comics, Turner began to write, draw and letter the \\"Space Ace\\" strip for the Lone Star comic, which required only four pages per month. In 1954, he also started drawing for Amalgamated Press's Super-Detective Library comic, which had recently started running a science-fiction strip titled \\"Rick Random: Space Detective\\". Editor Ted Holmes commissioned Turner to provide art for the strip, leaving the chores of script-writing, lettering and cover illustration to others. Turner worked on \\"Rick Random\\" for the next five years. 1960s As the vogue for pulp science fiction dwindled, Turner found work doing cover illustrations again for numerous publications, such as the popular science journal Practical Mechanics. By the mid-1960s, Turner had mostly abandoned the world of monthly publishing, and was producing original paint-by-number paintings for the company Craftmaster. In 1965, Turner was offered the opportunity to draw his first colour comic strip, based on the Gerry Anderson TV series Stingray, for TV Century 21 Stingray Extra (a holiday special issue of the weekly comic TV Century 21). The following year, Turner began contributing to TV Century 21 on a regular basis with his first continuing colour comic strip, \\"The Daleks\\", featuring the mechanical villains from the TV series Doctor Who.Doctor Who was copyrighted to the BBC, while the Daleks were the intellectual property of Terry Nation. Turner replaced the strip's previous artist Richard Jennings, initially for issues 50 and 51 (January 1966) and then on a regular basis from issue 59 (March 1966). He continued to illustrate The Daleks until its conclusion in issue 104 (January 1967). Between 1965 and 1969, Turner also contributed strips based on the various Anderson series to a number of TV Century 21 holiday specials and the publisher's hardback annual books, illustrating further Stingray strips in addition to ones based on Fireball XL5, Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and Joe 90. He illustrated all 80 pages of the Joe 90 Puzzle Book and the same number for the Joe 90 Dot to Dot Book (both Century 21 Publishing, 1968) as well as providing strips based on the series The Champions, Star Trek and Land of the Giants for the Joe 90 Top Secret Annual (1969). In addition, he again found work with Amalgamated Press (now called Fleetway), taking over the black-and-white \\"Robot Builders\\" strip from Carlos Cruz for Fleetway's Tiger and Hurricane comic magazine. 1970s In the 1970s, Turner began working for IPC Media (which had absorbed Fleetway), drawing strips for the Whizzer and Chips comic, such as \\"Wonder-car\\", \\"Archie's Angels\\" and \\"Danny Drew's Dialling Man\\", which were generally aimed at the young adult market. As well as contributing a regular Star Trek strip to IPC Media's TV21, he also continued his association with Gerry Anderson with Thunderbirds strips for the 1972 Thunderbirds Annual and the 1973 Countdown Annual. In the late 1970s, Turner drew a number of \\"Judge Dredd\\" comic strips for 2000 A.D., although his style did not gain the favour of his editors, and the long-term assignment eventually fell to other artists. Instead, Turner found regular work on the re-launched version of IPC's formerly violent comic Action with \\"The Spinball Slaves\\"--a sequel to the science-fiction sport strip \\"Death Game 1999\\" (influenced by the 1975 film Rollerball) and its less violent sequel \\"Spinball\\". When Action merged with IPC's war comic Battle Picture Weekly to become Battle Action, Turner contributed a further \\"Spinball\\" sequel strip entitled \\"The Spinball Wars\\". He also worked on a revival of \\"Rick Random\\" also for 2000 A.D.. 1980s Turner continued to work for Battle Action under its new title Battle Action Force, drawing many of the \\"Action Force\\" strips, which featured Action Man characters licensed from Mattel. He also began drawing a strip called \\"Journey to the Stars\\" for the new IPC Media weekly comic Speed, although publication ceased shortly afterwards. Turner found work with other IPC comics such as War and Battle Picture Library, but the shrinking comics market in 1980s Britain soon caused these publications to fold in 1984. At this time, Turner announced his retirement, although not long afterwards he was found drawing strips for an independent small press, including \\"Nick Hazard\\" and \\"Kalgan the Golden\\". 1990s and death By this point, Turner had started regularly providing book cover illustrations once again, on this occasion for Gryphon Books. He also painted a new six-part \\"Daleks\\" strip for Doctor Who Magazine. Turner died of a stroke and a heart attack in 1998. His artwork has continued to appear posthumously on books published by Gryphon Books and Wildside Press, drawing on many previously unpublished pieces as well as re-printing his earlier book cover illustrations.

Collapse of state deposit insurance corporation In 1962 Maryland established a quasi-public non-profit corporation, the Maryland Savings-Share Insurance Corporation (MSSIC), to insure accounts held in state chartered savings and loan associations. In May 1985, rumors emerged of financial instability at two thrifts, Old Court and Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan. Old Court had recently grown from $86 million in deposits to $839 million in only three years by offering high deposit interest rates, allowing it to make risky loans. Merritt was considered to be at risk as a result of loans made to a failed repo company. The rumours led to depositors questioning whether MSSIC was financially able to guarantee all of the deposits, resulting in a run on all state savings and loan associations. This led to the withdrawal of deposits, the failure of Old Court and the subsequent collapse of MSSIC. To temporarily protect other state savings and loan associations, Governor Harry Hughes issued an executive order limiting withdrawals to $1000 per month. The Maryland General Assembly during two special sessions in 1985 established the Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund (MDIF) to replace the MSSIC. Conviction of Levitt Old Court President Jeffrey Levitt was charged in relation to the failure of the bank, and pleaded guilty to theft and misappropriation of bank funds.Tony Kornheiser, Jeffrey Levitt Stole $15 Million, Washington Post (October 26, 1986).

Trypsinogen is a pancreatic enzyme precursor found in the blood that is elevated in most of those with CF at birth, regardless of whether their mutation is pancreatic sufficient or insufficient. The concentration of IRT is elevated in babies with CF since pancreatic ducts are partially blocked leading to abnormal enzyme drainage. Heterozygous carriers of cystic fibrosis can cause a raised IRT and it is therefore not diagnostic in isolation.Kumar & Clarks Clinical Medicine, 8th Edition. IRT is measured in routine heel-prick blood taken for biochemical screening of all newborn infants born in the UK. This test is one of a number of completed in newborn screening (the \\"Guthrie Test\\"). In Australia it is known 94% of those with eventual diagnosis of CF have a positive IRT on newborn screen. Samples with a raised IRT (defined as highest 1% of values) are then screened for common CF gene mutations. Each centre has a slightly different gene panel; currently 40-50 of the most common genes are sequenced. However, there are more than 2000 known mutations, so gene panel testing does miss occasional CF patients. If gene testing finds one mutation they will then have a sweat test to help confirm the diagnosis. Sweat testing is more likely to be equivocal in infants and typically not attempted in those under 5kg. If sweat test is positive more expansive gene testing is considered. If two mutations are found they are diagnosed with CF. __TOC__  United States Testing Protocols  As of the year 2010, immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)-based newborn screening programs for cystic fibrosis have been implemented across the country. However, the specific testing protocol varies by state. Certain states require only a single immunoreactive trypsinogen test to be performed within hours or days of birth before requiring additional diagnostic screenings for infants with elevated IRT levels. Of these, some follow up one elevated IRT result with DNA screening to identify cystic fibrosis-specific genetic mutations. Other states mandate two IRT blood tests to be performed (one immediately after birth and one after a period of two weeks) before requiring any further testing. Newborns found to have abnormally high levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen and/or positive DNA screening results are referred to specialized facilities that perform sweat chloride tests to either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

She was commonly known as Mamsell Arfvidsson. Biography Background Ulrica Arfvidsson was the daughter of a caretaker of the royal palace, Erik Lindberg, and Anna Katarina Burgin (d. 1771). After the death of her father, her mother remarried in 1740 to a chef of the royal household, Arfvid Arfvidsson (d. 1767), and Ulrica took the name of her stepfather. Ulrica Arfvidsson grew up comfortably in an environment where she heard many rumours and gossip of the higher circles in society. She became well-informed about things which many people outside of the court would like to know. Ulrica is described as an intelligent, with a sharp talent, well-developed intuition, and always very up-to-date about everything in society. Judging from the school-books from the inventory of her childhood-home, she seem to have been given a good education. She had no siblings. Not much is known of her earlier life. It seems she had run away from home at one point, since she was sought via a newspaper advertisement. She never married. After the death of her widowed mother in 1771, she received an inheritance which made her moderately wealthy. Professional fortune teller The Gustavian age was a great age for fortune tellers and mediums: though occultism was formally a crime at this point, the law was in practice seldom enforced. It is not known from which point she was professionally active, though it is believed to have been from 1774 onward. In 1780, she is confirmed as a professional fortune-teller, and her clientele came from all walks of society. Arfvidsson had her business at Lästmakargatan not far from Johannis Church in Stockholm, hidden away in an alley where mainly poor people, such as \\"blind and crippled women\\" Source of reference lived, in order for her customers to come to her discreetly. Speculation about her background pointed her out both as an eloped noblewoman and as a Finnish woman. Her office was reportedly not much different from that of an ordinary room, however it had a corner covered by a drape, behind which she used to retire during the seances. Her clients were banned from entering it, as there was a rumor that she hid some sort of magic device behind the drape. Though she offered several different methods of fortune telling, such as card readings, her primary method was the reading of coffee grounds, thereby earning the nickname Kaffepytissan (The Coffee Seeress). During this time, several female professional fortune tellers supported themselves by this method, and they were commonly referred to as \\"coffee goddesses\\", but Arfvidsson became the most successful of her trade. She had two assistants. One was the former domestic of her childhood home, Maja Persdotter. The other has been called Adrophia, Adotia and Adrecka Dordi (d. 1800), who was of African origin and described as a Turkish woman from Morocco, which was seen as exotic. Nothing is known of her origin other than that she had arrived to Sweden from Germany, and that she had originally been a slave. Arfvidsson enjoyed great popularity within the aristocracy. It was said that she was never wrong, and that her predictions became more and more accurate every year. Reportedly, Ulrica Arfvidsson had a wide net of informers from all over society, reaching from the royal household to private homes. She was said to have been an informer of the police, and members of the royal house asked her for political advice, such as the future King Charles XIII of Sweden. She was consulted by Gustav III, duke Charles and other influential people during the Russo-Swedish War (1788-1790). She was also protected by Gustav III. In 1790, the chief of police Henrik Liljensparre cautioned her to discontinue her fortune telling, Liljensparre was ordered by the monarch to allow Arfvidsson to continue her trade.Ord och Bild, Tjugutredje årgången. 1914, Runeberg During her last years, her business seems to have become less lucrative. The reason for this is suggested to have been connected to the coffee ban, which was applied twice during these years, in 1794-96 and again in 1799-1802, something which would have affected her activity significantly, as it was the reading of coffee grounds which was the preferred method of fortune telling for her and her clients.Ord och Bild, Tjugutredje årgången. 1914, Runeberg She died in poverty. Ulrica Arfvidsson is perhaps the most famous fortune-teller in Swedish history. She is mentioned in many contemporary memoirs and diary notes. During the 19th-century, several professional fortune tellers used her fame by claiming to have been her students in the occult. Another famed occultist was Elin Håkansson, who had the ear of both Charles XI of Sweden and Charles XII of Sweden. Predictions In 1783, she received a visit from Carl August Ehrensvärd and the General-Admiral af Trolle in disguise. She looked into the coffee, revealed their identities, and stated that Ehrensvärd would replace af Trolle in his position. This was not likely at the time, as Ehrensvärd was not designed as the replacement of af Trolle. In 1784, however, af Trolle died during the King's visit to Italy, and it was found that the King had left an instruction that Ehrensvärd should be his replacement in the event of af Trolle's death. In 1786, Ulrica Arfvidsson was consulted by King Gustav III of Sweden in disguise, who came to her in the company of Count Jacob De la Gardie posing as someone else. Arfvidsson presented several predictions about his past and his future, as well as that of his escort. At this occasion, she warned him about a man in a mask with a sword. This was remembered when in 1792, the King was assassinated at a masque ball by Jacob Johan Anckarström who shot the King from behind. She also warned the King: Beware of the man with a sword you will meet this evening, for he aspires to take your life.* Erland Ros: Biography Digitalized version of Strövtåg i S:t Johannes församling (Trips through the congregation of Saint John) When the King and the Count left her, they saw no one suspicious on their way back to the palace. The Count told the King to ignore her warning, but he answered: But she has told me so many other things, that have already come true! When they entered the palace and were proceeding up the stairs, they met a man with a sword leaving the apartment of the King's sister-in-law the duchess of Södermanland, consort of Prince Charles, who was suspected of conspiring against him. The man was Adolph Ludvig Ribbing, one of the future participants in the conspiracy which planned the regicide of the King in 1792. During the Russo-Swedish war of 1788–1790, the King consulted Arfvidsson again. After the murder of Gustav III, the chief of the police, Henrik Liljensparre, interviewed her about the attitude toward the King in the upper class opposition, and she is said to have been of some assistance in the investigation. In 1792, Ulrica Arfvidsson was also consulted in connection to the conspiracy of Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, who conspired to depose the guardian government of King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden by an alliance with Russia. The co-conspirator of Armfelt, Magdalena Rudenschöld, was instructed by him to consult Arfvidsson, which she did three days after his departure from Sweden. Rudenschöld described the prediction in her correspondence to Armfelt. Arfvidsson consulted her coffee leaves and stated that the man of whom Rudenschöld was thinking (Armfelt) had recently left the country in anger over a child (the King) and a small man (the regent, Duke Charles), whom he would soon scare by an agreement with a woman with a non-royal crown on her head (Catherine the Great). She predicted that Armfelt risked to be revealed by the loss of a letter, which would be his ruin. As for Rudenschöld herself, Arfvidsson told her that she was observed and mentioned to Catherine the Great in letters by a fat man (the Russian ambassador Stackelberg), that she should be careful, and that great sorrows awaited her.Lilly Lindwall (1917). Magdalena Rudenschöld. Stockholm: Förlag Åhlén & Åkerlund. In 1797, she was consulted by Hedvig Ulrika Armfelt about the future of her exiled spouse, Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, upon which she answered, that the days of sorrow would soon be over for Hedvig Ulrika Armfelt, and that all would be well for her spouse.Ord och Bild, Tjugutredje årgången. 1914, Runeberg  Ulrica Arfvidsson in culture  Ulrica Arfvidsson is a character in Daniel Auber's opera Gustave III, ou Le bal masqué (Gustave III, or The Masked Ball), which used a libretto by French playwright Eugene Scribe. In preparing his opera Gustavo III between 1857 and 1859, the Italian composer, Giuseppe Verdi, had his librettist, Antonio Somma, use Scribe's libretto as its basis. As a result of changes imposed by censors in both Naples and Rome, the title of the opera became Un ballo in maschera and it premiered in Rome on 17 February 1859. She is also mentioned in the famed novel The Queen's Tiara by Carl Jonas Love Almquist.

The film stars Gianni Garko, William Berger, Fernando Sancho and Klaus Kinski, and features a musical score by Piero Piccioni. If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death was the first in a series of spaghetti westerns based on the character Sartana. It was followed by four other official Sartana films: I Am Sartana Your Angel of Death (Sono Sartana, il vostro becchino, 1969), Have a Good Funeral, My Friend... Sartana Will Pay (Buon funerale, amigos!... paga Sartana, 1970), Light the Fuse... Sartana Is Coming (Una nuvola di polvere... un grido di morte... arriva Sartana, 1970) and Sartana's Here... Trade Your Pistol for a Coffin (C'è Sartana... vendi la pistola e comprati la bara, 1970), in the last of which Garko was replaced by George Hilton. The four sequels were directed by Giuliano Carnimeo, Parolini was chosen to direct The Sabata Trilogy, after producer Alberto Grimaldi saw his work on the first Sartana film. As with Django a few years earlier, several directors, such as Demofilo Fidani, made unofficial sequels to cash in on the success of Sartana. History The name \\"Sartana\\" first appeared in the film Blood at Sundown (Mille dollari sul nero, 1967), in which Garko played an antagonist called El General Sartana. The film was very successful in Germany and known by the short title Sartana. Italian producer Aldo Addobbati noticed the film's success and set up a co-production with a German producer in Italy. Garko was offered a contract and he accepted after inserting a clause stating that the script must be approved by him. In a 2005 interview, Garko said he wanted a subject that would not be based on vengeance, as he had already portrayed characters bent on revenge in Blood at Sundown and Guns of Violence (10.000 dollari per un massacro, 1967). After he turned down several scripts with a revenge theme, Renato Izzo wrote a story about a smart, non-sentimental character that profits by putting himself between two rival groups. Sartana's use of mechanical gadgets was added by director Parolini, who was a fan of the James Bond films. If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death then went into production. Plot An elderly couple on a horse-drawn carriage is attacked by a gang led by Morgan (Kinski). Sartana (Garko) arrives on the scene and kills the robbers except for Morgan who gets away. Soon after, a stagecoach carrying a shipment of gold is robbed by a Mexican gang at the order of General Jose Manuel Mendoza (Sancho), with a gang member posing as a passenger murdering the others. However, the gang is ambushed and killed by Lasky (Berger) and his men. Lasky then tells his gang that he will meet them later. As the men are about to open the strongbox from the coach, Lasky kills them all with a Gatling gun. After opening the strongbox, he finds only rocks instead of gold. Spooked by Sartana's playing one of the murdered passengers' musical watch, he heads to town to meet with Jeff Stewal (Sydney Chaplin), a politician, and Alman (Gianni Rizzo), a banker, to collect his payment as part of an insurance fraud. Sartana cleans Lasky out, as well as four other men, in a card game, and outguns the four when they go after him. Lasky collects a gang and goes after Sartana, who lures them to the scene of Lasky's previous massacre. Realizing what Lasky has done, the gang turn on him and chase him to a cabin which Lasky has boobytrapped with dynamite. Lasky detonates the explosives, wiping out his own men, but the watching Sartana again spooks him and allows him to get away. Lasky then sends Morgan, his now-partner, to kill Sartana, but Morgan fails and is killed himself. Another gang hired by Lasky is wiped out by Sartana, who again deliberately lets Lasky escape. After Lasky blackmails Stewal and Alman and the news about the robbed stagecoach finally breaks, the two inform Mendoza that it was Lasky who killed his men. Mendoza's men capture Lasky and try to make him talk, thinking that he knows where the gold is hidden. Lasky tells him that only Sartana knows the location of the gold. Meanwhile, Stewal, who has been having an affair with the late mayor's widow, plans to escape with the gold, supposedly hidden in the late mayor's coffin, and Alman's wife Evelyn (Heidi Fischer). After Sartana tells him that Mendoza is going to dig up the coffin with the gold and keep it all for himself, Stewal goes to check if it is true and is killed by Mendoza's men. Thinking that Mendoza now has the gold, Lasky sneaks into his residence and kills him and his men with his Gatling gun. Sartana also arrives and the two open the coffin, only to discover it filled with rocks and the mayor's corpse instead of gold. Lasky then shoots Sartana and apparently kills him. The gold has been hidden by Alman, who has killed the mayor's widow and mow tells his plan to his wife. Evelyn betrays and kills him, then takes Lasky to the gold, which has been hidden in another coffin. Lasky kills Evelyn, but when Sartana appears alive and unharmed the two engage in a final duel. Lasky is killed and Sartana rides out of town with the coffin full of gold.

As of 2018, there were 1,879 Armenian citizen with a residence permit in the Czech Republic. History Unlike Armenian communities throughout eastern and central Europe, the Armenian community of the Czech republic is made up entirely of recent immigrants, as there are no previous history of Armenian communities in the region. Most have come to the region after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, others fleeing poor economic conditions in the Armenian Republic. The Armenian Community in the Czech Republic is still growing, as signified with the opening of an Armenian Saturday school in Prague in 1996, the establishment of an Armenian Cultural Center and the later establishment of the Orer (Օրեր) magazine (1999), edited by Hakob Asatryan, a former journalist for the Azg (Ազգ) paper in Yerevan who moved to Prague around 1998. It is believed Armenians may have trouble acclimating to this country, as citizenship requires you to undergo a rigorous registration process, rather than becoming a citizen at birth. On April 3 and 4, 2006, Armenian Deputy Minister Arman Kirakossian visited the Czech Republic, meeting with Jaroslav Bašta, the 1st Deputy Foreign Minister of the country, Jaromír Plíšek, Director General of the Territorial Section, and a representative of the local Armenian community.Deputy Minister Kirakossian Visits Czech Republic Topics of discussion included trade and inter- parliamentary links.  Language  Armenian migrants freely speak the Russian language which was a subject needed at Czech schools until the end of the 1980s. This has had some impact on the language integration of the Armenian community.

It was founded on April 19, 2003 by Jay Bibby, initially as a personal blog, although it later had several contributors. Several video game genres are covered; including escape the room, puzzle and platform game. The site is constructed as a blog, and attracted a large community of commenters. Jay and the site's staff writers read over and filtered the weblog comments, often commenting themselves. Comment threads often included hints and walkthroughs.  History  Started on April 19, 2003, Jay Is Games followed a personal blog-like style of writing about all genres of games as well as video game related topics, such as the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and what games would be covered. Jay published a new post usually every two days. It stayed in this format for about two years. It was in 2004 Jay began covering flash games, slowly shifting away from video game industry news and using his site a personal blog. He also began only giving flash/browser games ratings according to objectionable content. It was in 2006 that authorship of the blog changed - instead of all flash game reviews being done just by Jay, other contributors began publishing reviews. Due to lack of funds Jay Is Games ceased operations in April 2016. The website remained, and users were still able to comment on reviews and games.http://jayisgames.com/review/until-we-meet-again.php The site returned to activity in June 2016, launching a Patreon campaign to fund the site so it can continue to operate.  Competitions  Jay Is Games became known for its game design competitions. As of September 2012, Jay Is Games had conducted ten competitions. Although the first competition was focused on producing simple puzzle games, recent competitions had themes such as \\"upgrade\\" or \\"replay\\" that entrants could interpret into their games. This openness garnered much creativity from developers and enthusiastic responses from visitors to the site. Cash prizes were given, and sometimes relevant gifts, such as an Adobe Flash download. The main prizes were chosen by the site reviewers, however a unique Audience Award was also given. This prize was guaranteed \\"at least $200.\\" Visitors donated at least one dollar in order to vote (to prevent multiple votes), which went to whichever developer the voter chose. Reception The website was praised by the staff of Wired magazine for the contributors' ability to find games; \\"The signal-to-noise ratio on most gaming portals makes for a frustrating lunch break. This group blog finds the cream of the crop for casual players.\\" Slate's Justin Peters called the site \\"the Internet's undisputed leader in casual gaming information\\".

Description The genus Scolopendra contains many species of centipedes found across the world's tropics and warmer temperate areas. The species vary considerably in coloration and size. Scolopendra are mostly very large centipedes. The largest species found in tropical climates can exceed and are the largest living centipedes in the world. All Scolopendra species can deliver a painful bite, injecting venom through their forcipules, which are not fangs or other mouthparts, but instead modified legs on the first body segment. Ecology Scolopendra are active predators, feeding primarily on insects and other invertebrates. Larger specimens have been observed preying on frogs, tarantulas, lizards, birds, snakes, rodents, and even bats. One southeast Asian species, S. cataracta, is amphibious, and swims and walks underwater. Venom The venom is not medically significant for most species; however, bites from several species can cause intense and long-lasting pain and swelling. Large Scolopendra species from Asian/Pacific regions, such as Scolopendra subspinipes and Scolopendra dehaani, are particularly potent, and have caused one reported fatality. In 2014, a fatality was reported for a bite from a Scolopendra gigantea. The venom of certain Scolopendra species were found to contain compounds such as serotonin, haemolytic phospholipase, a cardiotoxic protein, and a cytolysin. Taxonomic history Scolopendra was one of the genera created by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, the starting point for zoological nomenclature. Only two of the species originally assigned to the genus remain so: Scolopendra gigantea and S. morsitans; the latter was chosen to be the type species by Opinion 454 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, overruling a previous designation by Pierre André Latreille, in which he chose Linnaeus' Scolopendra forficata (now Lithobius forficatus) as the type species.

Catholic Capuchin missionaries were given permission to reside in the Kathmandu Valley in 1715. They worked in each of the valley's three city-states,Alsop 1996, p. 123. and eventually made their main base in Bhaktapur, where they settled in 1740.Alsop 1996, p. 125. The Capuchins were surprised by the warm welcome afforded to them by the king of Bhaktapur, Ranajit Malla, who, one wrote, 'embraced us all affectionately and treated us with great familiarity and confidence; he made us sit at his side and kept us for more than an hour'. The missionaries focused their activities on the royal court, and composed a treatise on monotheism for the king. Although he did not convert, the king did offer some of his subjects to be Christians in his stead.Alsop 1996, pp. 131–2. The Capuchins refused this offer, and, although they succeeded in making a small number of voluntary local converts,Alsop 1996, p. 134. their mission was put to an end in 1769 after Prithvi Narayan Shah, the ruler of Gorkha, conquered the Kathmandu Valley and expelled all Christians from his new kingdom.Landon 1928, p. 236. 1769–1951 Ganga Prasad Pradhan (1851–1932) Over the next 200 years, until 1951, Nepal was entirely closed to Christians, although small numbers of ethnically Nepali evangelists from India were able to cross the border surreptitiously.Barclay 2009, p. 190. The most famous of these is Ganga Prasad Pradhan (1851–1932), a Newar raised in Darjeeling who is known as the first ordained Nepali pastor.Perry, Cindy L. (2000) A biographical history of the Church in Nepal. 3rd ed. Kathmandu: Nepal Church History Project. pp. 29–35. Pradhan converted to Christianity while studying at a school run by Church of Scotland missionaries in Darjeeling. After forty years of ministry to the Nepali- speaking community in northern India, focused mainly on producing a Bible translation and other evangelistic materials in Nepali, he decided in 1914 to return with his family to Kathmandu to establish a Christian presence in Nepal. Travelling with a group of around forty people, Pradhan and his colleagues' presence was discovered by the authorities soon after they arrived in Kathmandu. They were firmly instructed to leave, being told: 'there is no room for Christians in Nepal'.Perry 2000, p. 34. 1951–1990 Dr James Dick and Jill Cook treating patients at the UMN dispensary at Okhaldhunga, in east Nepal, in the early 1960s. After the overthrow of the Rana regime in 1951, King Tribhuvan opened Nepal's borders and appealed to the outside world to assist in Nepal's development. A number of Christian missionary groups responded to this call. The largest such organisation was the United Mission to Nepal (UMN), founded in 1954 as a cooperative endeavor between eight Protestant denominations.Barclay 2009, p. 191. The first projects of the mission were the foundation of medical facilities in Tansen in west Nepal and in the Kathmandu Valley near to Bhaktapur; the work soon expanded to include rural development, education, engineering, and the foundation of other medical facilities and hospitals. By 1990 the UMN 'comprised 39 member missions, 420 expatriate missionaries, and over 2,000 Nepali staff'. Due to a 2002 decision to hand over most major projects to local control, the size of UMN is currently much reduced from this level.‘Our History.’ United Mission to Nepal website.

Founded in 1943 by the doctor Lily O’Halon, the NEB worked with ethnically Nepali converts in northern India during the 1940s. In 1952 O’Hanlon and her colleagues were given permission to undertake medical work in Pokhara; they established 'The Shining Hospital', which became well known for the high quality of its treatment, and in 1957 opened the Green Pastures Hospital for the treatment of leprosy.Hale, Thomas (2012) Light dawns in Nepal: the Story of the International Nepal Fellowship.

This would eventually become one of the largest churches in Nepal.Rongong, Rajendra (2012a) 'Gyaneshwor Church (Nepal Isai Mandali).’ In The Oxford Encyclopaedia of South Asian Christianity, edited by Roger E. Hedlund, Jesudas Athyal, Joshua Kalapati and Jessica Richard. Vol. 2. New Delhi: Oxford University Press. p. 294. From the 1960s, Christians encountered increasing legal problems, with prosecutions being brought for proselytism and conversion (see Political and Legal Situation). Despite legal obstacles, the Nepali Protestant church grew slowly but steadily in the period up to 1990. Norma Kehrberg, drawing on the work of the Nepal Church History Project, estimates this growth as follows:Kehrberg 2000, p. 124. {  - ! Year !! Baptized Christians -  1966  100 -  1973  500 -  1977  1,400 -  1980  7000 -  1982  10,000 -  1985  25,000 -  1990  50,000 } Members of Gyaneshwor Church (Nepal Isai Mandali) in the 1960s, celebrating a baptism. This growth resulted primarily from person-to-person evangelism by Nepali believers,Kehrberg 2000, pp. 151–155, pp. 106–12. and was often connected with prayer-based healing or exorcism.Kehrberg 2000, pp. 147–150. * Sharma, Bal Krishna. 2001. ‘A History of the Pentecostal Movement in Nepal.’ Asian Journal of Pentecostal Studies 4 (2). p. 301. During this period most churches opted, as Kehrberg has described, to 'worship in an eastern style, removing one's shoes and sitting on the floor with men and women seated on opposite sides; not using pews [...]. The music was Christian words set to Nepali folk tunes'.Kehrberg 2000, p. 100. In 1960 of the Nepal Christian Fellowship (NCF) was formed;Barclay 2009, p. 192. this group united most Nepali Protestants until 1978, when another national group – the Agape Fellowship – was established.Rongong, Rajendra (2012b) 'Agape Fellowship'. In The Oxford Encyclopaedia of South Asian Christianity, edited by Roger E. Hedlund, Jesudas Athyal, Joshua Kalapati and Jessica Richard. Vol. 2. New Delhi: Oxford University Press. p. 9. The latter group had a more charismatic orientation than the former.Rongong 2012b, p. 9. Catholics also responded to the opening of Nepal in 1951, but the numerical growth of Nepali Catholicism has been slower than that of Protestantism (see also Catholic Church in Nepal). The Jesuit Fr. Marshall Moran established St Xavier's School on the edge of the Kathmandu Valley in 1951. St Xavier's catered primarily to the middle and upper echelons of Nepali society. Fr. Moran, who was the founder of the school and the guiding spirit of the mission, became a figure in Nepali high society during the 1950s, with one Nepali intellectual recalling, 'Fr Moran was at every party in those days. If a visitor didn't see Fr Moran in Kathmandu, his trip wasn't really complete'.Messerschmidt, Donald A. (2012) Fr Moran of Kathmandu: pioneer priest, educator, and ham radio voice of the Himalayas. Bangkok: White Orchid Press. p. 227. Jesuit missionaries also made notable contributions to scholarship on Nepali history and religions.Stiller, Ludwig F.

Due to the long process of preparation that precedes Baptism, and a soteriology that does not compel them to attempt as many conversions as possible, the Nepali Catholic church has grown slowly, having 10,000 members by 2011.Parajuli 2011.

A 2013 report by Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary found that Nepal's church was the fastest growing in the world, with an annual growth rate of 10.9% since 1970.Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary 2013, p. 38. alt= The contemporary Nepali church is largely charismatic or Pentecostal in orientation, in that most Nepali churches practice healing and exorcism, and have emotive styles of worship.Tamang, Ganesh (2012).

Political and Legal Situation Throughout the period from 1768 to 1990, proselytism of or conversion to Christianity or Islam was legally prohibited in Nepal.Gaborieau 2002, p. 93. A statement of this prohibition can be found in the legal code of 1935:Quoted in Gaborieau 2002, pp. 93–4 > To him who preaches beliefs opposed to the traditional religion of the > subjects of the kingdom, to him who abandons or cause to abandon one > religion to adopt, or cause to adopt, another one, the following rules will > be applied: In the whole of the kingdom of Gorkha – Nepal, putting into > practice (calauna) and preaching (pracar garna)….

These laws were in force even after the revolution of 1951, and were reaffirmed in the legal code of 1963, which prohibited the preaching of Christianity or Islam and stipulated three years in jail for those who attempted to convert people, and six years for those who succeeded in converting others.Gaborieau 2002, p. 94. For those who 'attempt' to be converted, there was a fine of a hundred rupees, and for those who actually converted (that is, were baptized), there would be imprisonment of one year. The code stated that 'when somebody becomes converted, the conversion is nullified, and he remains in the Hindu dharma [religion]'. Bir Bahadur Rai, Pastor Prem Pradhan, and Dil Bahadur Thakuri in Tansen prison, in 1961. From the early 1960s, the state began actively to prosecute Christians where the baptism of Nepali citizens had occurred; this active governmental persecution continued up to 1990.Gaborieau 2002, p. 95. Following baptisms in Nepalgunj and Tansen between 1958 and 1960, pastors David Mukhia and Prem Pradhan, along with six baptised believers, were prosecuted by the authorities for proselytism and conversion. The pastors were sentenced to six years imprisonment; the male converts were sentenced to one year imprisonment and the female converts to six months.Barclay 2009, pp. 191–2. Prosecutions such as this continued for the whole of the Panchayat period:Kehrberg 2000, pp. 106–9. when an amnesty was proclaimed in 1990 there were 30 individuals in Nepal imprisoned for crimes of proselytism or conversion, and 200 others who were subject to legal action for the same offences. After the democracy movement of 1990, a new constitution was promulgated which decriminalized religious conversion, but retained the ban on proselytism. The interim constitution of 2007, adopted after the democracy movement of 2006, was identical to the 1990 code in these respects;The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2063 (2007) (2009). p. 74.

Between 1990 and the mid-2010s Nepal's law on proselytism remained largely unenforced, and Christians were able to operate without significant governmental interference. However, the rapid growth of Christianity and the rise of nationalist sentiment since the declaration of secularism in 2007 has led to increasing calls for tighter restrictions on Christian activity,Letizia, Chiara (2012) 'Shaping secularism in Nepal.' European Bulletin of Himalayan Research, 39. pp. 79–83. causing the authorities in recent years to enforce anti-proselytism laws more aggressively. It has been reported that local government and police officials have begun to interpret the constitutional ban on proselytism to include non-coercive evangelism,U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom 2017, p. 2. and have brought a number of legal cases against Christians on this basis.‘The Charikot Case’.

In September 2015, three Protestant churches were bombed in the Jhapa District, with Hindu nationalists again identified as responsible.

That appears to be some evidence that he died in 653, but is not conclusive. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 60 . Meanwhile, the New Book of Tang mentioned that he was 16 in 619, and therefore these dates are used here.), courtesy name Chengfan (), was an imperial prince of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. He was a cousin of Emperor Taizong, and in Emperor Taizong's reign commanded forces in campaigns against Eastern Tujue, Tuyuhun, Goguryeo, and Xueyantuo. In 653, during the reign of Emperor Taizong's son Emperor Gaozong, Li Daozong offended Emperor Gaozong's uncle, the powerful chancellor Zhangsun Wuji, and Zhangsun exiled him to Xiang Prefecture (roughly modern Laibin, Guangxi), on accusation that he associated with the treasonous Fang Yi'ai (). Li Daozong died on the way to exile.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  Li Daozong was probably born in 603, during the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui (Yang Jian). His grandfather Li Zhang () was a Northern Zhou official and a son of the Western Wei general Li Hu (), the grandfather of the major Sui Dynasty general Li Yuan, who had been executed late in Northern Zhou for plotting with the Northern Zhou prince Yuwen Zhao () to kill Yang Jian while Yang Jian was regent and on the path to take over the throne. Li Zhang's sons were not killed, however, and one of them, Li Shao (), was Li Daozong's father. Li Yuan rebelled against Emperor Yang of Sui in 617, and by 618 had established Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. He created many of his relatives with nobility titles, Li Daozong was created the Duke of Lüeyang. In 619, a major Tang enemy Liu Wuzhou the Dingyang Khan attacked and captured most of Tang's holdings in modern Shanxi and approached Hedong (, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). Li Daozong served under Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin in resisting Liu, and at his suggestion, Li Shimin did not engage Liu immediately, choosing to wear out Liu's food supplies, eventually allowing Li Shimin to defeat Liu. Further, during the campaign, Li Daozong and Yuwen Shiji were able to persuade Liu's general Yuchi Gong to surrender, and Yuchi later became an important general under Li Shimin. Li Daozong was then made the commandant at Ling Prefecture (, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). When Liang Luoren (), the brother of Liang Shidu the Emperor of Liang attacked with assistance from Eastern Tujue, and Li Daozong was able to repel him, and further expel the Eastern Tujue general Ashina Yushe () from the Wuyuan (, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi). Emperor Gaozong, comparing Li Daozong's accomplishments to those of the Cao Wei imperial prince Cao Zhang the Prince of Rencheng, created Li Daozong the Prince of Rencheng.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  In 626, Li Shimin, then in an intense rivalry with his older brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince and fearful that Li Jiancheng was about to kill him, ambushed Li Jiancheng and another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, who supported Li Jiancheng, at Xuanwu Gate and killed them. He then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince and then yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). He recalled Li Daozong from Ling Prefecture, first to serve as the director of vassal affairs, and then as the chief judge of the supreme court. Later on, when Emperor Taizong was planning to attack Eastern Tujue, he again made Li Daozong the commandant at Ling Prefecture. In 630, when the general Li Jing launched the attack on Eastern Tujue, Li Daozong served under him, and eventually participated in the capture of Eastern Tujue's Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi, with Li Daozong's assistant Zhang Baoxiang () carrying out the actual capture. Upon return, Emperor Taizong increased Li Daozong's fief by 600 households and made him the minister of justice. In 634, Li Daozong again served under Li Jing, this time in an operation against Tuyuhun's Busabo Khan Murong Fuyun. Tang forces achieved initial victories, but Tuyuhun forces then burned the grazing grass to cut the food supplies to Tang horses. Most Tang generals wanted to withdraw, but Li Daozong advocated continued advance, and Li Jing agreed, eventually allowing complete victory, as Murong Fuyun was killed by his subordinates, allowing his son Murong Shun, whom Tang supported, to become khan.This account, contained in Li Daozong's biography in the New Book of Tang, which further stated that Hou Junji was against further advancement, however, conflicted with Hou Junji's biography, which stated that Hou was the one who supported further advancement. Compare New Book of Tang, vol. 78, with New Book of Tang, vol. 94 . The Zizhi Tongjian accepted the version that had Hou being the one who advocated further advance. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 194. In 637, as part of Emperor Taizong's scheme to bestow prefectures on his relatives and great generals and officials as their permanent domains, Li Daozong's title was changed to Prince of Jiangxia, and he was given the post of prefect of E Prefecture (roughly modern Ezhou, Hubei), to be inherited by his heirs. Soon, however, with many objections to the system, the strongest of which came from Zhangsun Wuji, Emperor Taizong cancelled the scheme, although Li Daozong's title remained Prince of Jiangxia and he remained the Prefect of E Prefecture. At one point, he was accused of corruption, and Emperor Taizong, in anger, removed him from the post and reduced his fief, but permitted him to return to his mansion as a prince. Eventually, he was made the minister of ceremonies. After Hou Junji destroyed Gaochang in 640, allowing Tang to annex Gaochang, Hou was unhappy that Emperor Taizong did not reward him as much as he expected and had further investigated him for stealing from the Gaochang treasury. Li Daozong, knowing that Hou was unhappy, warned Emperor Taizong that Hou may commit treason—a warning that Emperor Taizong did not believe, but later, in 643, after Hou was implicated in a plot with the crown prince Li Chengqian and executed, reminded Li Daozong about and thanked him for. In 641, Li Daozong sent his daughter, who was adopted by Emperor Taizong and titled Princess Wencheng, to Tibet to be married to the Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo, as a part of the treaty of peace between Tang dynasty and Tibetan Empire. Li Daozong met Tibetan escorts at Xingxiuhai (near the Gyaring Lake and the source of Yellow River) and then returned to Chang'an. In 645, Li Daozong accompanied Emperor Taizong in attacking Goguryeo, and he served as assistant to the forward commander Li Shiji. In summer 645, they captured Gaemo (, in modern Fushun, Liaoning), and then defeated Goguryeo forces at Yodong/Liaodong (, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning), allowing Emperor Taizong to then capture Liaodong. However, after another victory over Goguryeo forces at Ansi (, in modern Anshan, Liaoning), Emperor Taizong became bogged down in his siege of Ansi, and Li Daozong suggested, instead, that he skip Ansi and directly attack the Goguryeo capital Pyongyang. Emperor Taizong initially agreed, but Li Shiji and Zhangsun Wuji opposed, believing that if they did not capture Ansi first, Ansi's defender (a capable general known in Korean popular legends as Yang Manchun, although whether that was his real name is unknown) would attack them from the rear. Emperor Taizong therefore continued to siege Ansi. During Ansi's siege, part of Ansi's city walls collapsed, and Tang forces had an opportunity to enter, but at that time, Fu Fu'ai (), an officer under Li Daozong, was not paying attention, and instead Goguryeo forces fought out from the breach and captured the part of the offensive earthworks that Li Daozong was responsible for, using it instead for defense. For this offense, Emperor Taizong executed Fu, and when Li Daozong, baring his feet to show remorse, requested forgiveness, Emperor Taizong rebuked him but kept him in command of his forces. Subsequently, with Ansi's defenses holding, Emperor Taizong withdrew, with Li Shiji and Li Daozong serving as the rear guard. After returning to Chang'an, Li Daozong offered to resign on account of illness, and Emperor Taizong made him the director of imperial clan affairs, a much less stressful position.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  In 649, Emperor Taizong died and was succeeded by his second crown prince, Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong). Emperor Gaozong's uncle Zhangsun Wuji and Chu Suiliang served as the lead chancellors. In 652, a plot was discovered, centered around Empress Taizong's daughter Princess Gaoyang and her husband Fang Yi'ai that, allegedly, sought to install Emperor Taizong's brother Li Yuanjing () the Prince of Jing as emperor. Zhangsun expanded the scope of the investigations and, in spring 653, the co-conspirators were killed. However, as Zhangsun and Chu both had rivalries with Li Daozong, they exiled Li Daozong, as well as the chancellor Yuwen Jie and the general Zhishi Sili (), to Xiang Prefecture. Li Daozong died on the way to his place of exile, at the age of 53, probably in 656. Later, after Zhangsun's and Chu's own downfalls (at the hands of Emperor Gaozong's wife Empress Wu and her associates), Li Daozong's posts were posthumously restored. It was said that late in his life, Li Daozong was studious and humble. The New Book of Tang praised Li Daozong and his cousin Li Xiaogong to be the most capable princes early in Tang history.

The \\"Emotional Chapter\\" consists of rock ballads, while the \\"F.T. Island Chapter\\" consists of a variety of pop rock sons produced by Japanese composers who worked with the Japanese band SMAP. Selling over 79,000 copies in 2007, it was the sixth best- selling album of the year. The album was later re-packaged on December 3, 2007, titled The Refreshment (Vol. 1.5) with three extra songs, a photo book, a stack of photo cards and a mixing program called Music 2.0, which allows one to adjust the levels of the instruments and vocals. The edition sold 25,724 copies in December 2007. F.T. Island in 2008 After debuting in Korea, FNC Entertainment (formerly FNC Music) moved F.T. Island's activities overseas. On March 31, 2008, an autograph session in Malaysia at the Damansara Cineleisure was held, which was to be followed by the group's first concert at the Sunway Lagoon Amphitheater the next day. However, the performance was canceled and subsequently held in Thailand instead, at the Royal Paragon Hall on April 14, 2008. F.T. Island's first Japanese debut album, titled Prologue of F.T. Island: Soyogi, was then released on June 7, 2008. The album consists of eight songs, two of which were newer versions of the original songs \\"F.T. Island\\" and \\"Primadonna\\". The last track, \\"Always Be Mine\\", is an English version of \\"First Kiss\\" from their debut album (though the lyrics are original). Music videos were also released for \\"Soyogi\\" and \\"Friendship\\", displaying the band's professionalism and playful sides. After their promotional activities in Japan, the band then returned to Korea, releasing their second Korean album Colorful Sensibility on August 27, 2008. A follow-up epilogue, Colorful Sensibility Part 2, was later released on October 17. Later that year, F.T. Island also released \\"The One\\", their first Japanese commercial single under indie label AI Entertainment. The single charted at ninth on the Oricon daily charts. The single was also the last official release with member Oh Won Bin before his departure. 2009–10: Lineup changes, F.T. Triple and Breakthrough in Japan On January 28, 2009, it was announced that member Oh Won Bin would be leaving the group, with FNC trainee Song Seung-hyun replacing him as a guitarist and backup vocalist.

They promoted it on SBS Inkigayo, and released their first Korean mini-album Jump Up two days later. On April 22, F.T. Island later released their second Japanese single, \\"I Believe Myself\\". For the first time, members participated in lyrics composition. For the song \\"Moonlight Angel\\", Jae-jin co-wrote the lyrics and Jong-hoon co-composed the song. \\"I Believe Myself\\" was the first Japanese single with member Seung-hyun.

While preparing for overseas promotions, the members were in the midst of recording their third album. On July 9, FNC Entertainment released jacket photos for the upcoming third album called Cross & Change. On the following day, a music video teaser for \\"I Hope\\" was released online, featuring kids watching their idols (played by the members themselves) on TV. The title song, called “I Hope/Barae”, was released on July 16. F.T. Island tried out a variety of music styles for Cross & Change; it included a total of 12 songs, ranging from moving ballads to addictive songs with a bright melody. F.T. Island adopted a new fashion style and concept for the album using a \\"retro\\" and the “Bokgo” approach, which was inspired during the “jeans jeans look” from the 80s in Korea. F.T. Island released their 3rd Japanese single, \\"Raining\\", on October 21. A music video of the single was released. Jong-hoon played the piano for the single for the first time instead of the guitar.

Jaejin enlisted as an active duty soldier on January 21, 2020, while Minhwan enlisted on February 24 as a reserve soldier. Sub-unit In 2009, Jong-hoon, Min- hwan, and Jae-jin formed a sub-group called F.T. Triple. Some of the reasons behind this lineup were to showcase more of the members' skills and to prevent main singer, Lee Hong-gi, from overstraining his voice again. Another reason was to continue promoting F.T. Island while Hong-gi was filming You're Beautiful while Seung-hyun was having a break. At first, the trio was unofficially announced at the Dream Concert in Japan as \\"A3\\". They almost named themselves A3 because they all are of blood type 'A'. They also wanted to keep the F.T. name hence adding Triple at the end of it to represent a trio. In F.T. Triple, Jae-jin originally in charge of bass for F.T. Island becomes a guitarist and the main vocalist; Jong-hoon plays the piano and Min- hwan continues to play the drums. Their first single was titled \\"Love Letter\\" and was released with F.T. Island's 2CD Repackaged Album Double Date and a second CD named Two Date that features all of F.T. Triple's songs.

It tells the true story of a boy and an elephant, and their fight to stay together across three continents. Plot summary Modoc tells the true story of Bram, a German boy, and his elephant, Modoc. Bram and Modoc are born on the same day and the same hour. Bram's father wished for a boy and girl. He felt his dream was fulfilled. Bram's father is a third generation elephant trainer and from an early age, Bram followed in his father's footsteps. Bram's family is unique in the way they trained the elephants. Instead of threat and intimidation, the elephants are treated with praise and respect. Once old enough, Modoc begins to perform in the circus. The circus owner fell ill and the circus is sold to an American, Mr. North. Bram is unwilling to be parted from his elephant, and acts as a stowaway across the Indian Ocean. The ship is wrecked, leaving Modoc, Mr. Pitt, Bram and others adrift in the ocean. The survivors stay afloat on Modoc’s back until help comes for them at the last possible second. Modoc and Bram recuperate in India where Bram [learns much about elephant training and care at the Elephantarium, as well as Indian life, becoming a favorite 'son of the Maharaja'. Afraid the circus owner will find them, the boy and elephant flee into the teak forests and [is able to] join the ranks of the mahouts and marry a village daughter because of his 'son of the maharaja' status. Rebels eventually take the town, killing Bram’s wife along with many of the population. The circus owner is inexplicably able to find them through the rebellion, and transports Modoc and Bram to America, where they become stars of the big top. Modoc survives a poisoning attempt, a fire, and a hook-wielding drunk, before the circus owner decides she is too scarred to appear in the ring any longer and sells her without Bram's knowledge; Bram is very hurt. Ten years pass in which Modoc’s life deteriorates into abuse, until she is purchased by Ralph Helfer, a Hollywood animal trainer. Helfer nurses her back to health, and is surprised to find the variety of acts she already knows. Drawn by their supernatural connection, Bram locates her some years later. They spend the rest of their lives in constant contact [at Helfer's ranch], nursing one another through old age. Bram is first of the pair to die, saying he is going to show Modoc the way. Translation The novel was translated into Chinese by Zhang Haidi, and won a national prize in China for best translated works.

The school was founded in 1971 as white families sought to avoid having their children bussed across the city with black children during the court ordered desegregation of Nashville public schools. History Nashville Christian School opened on September 20, 1971 in the West Nashville Heights Church of Christ building. The school was founded as a segregation academy by white parents seeking to avoid sending their children to racially integrated public schools. In 1976, headmaster Daryl Demonbreun recalled that the school was not \\"only formed to avoid integration\\" but that \\"bussing was only the straw that broke the camel's back.\\" Initially, 266 students, ranging from first to seventh, attended the school, supported by 19 faculty members. Nashville Christian added higher grades successively in the first five years, and after the school moved to its current location on Sawyer Brown Road in Nashville, Tennessee outside of Bellevue in September 1976, twenty-two students became the first graduates in June 1977. Kindergarten classes were also added in 1981.NCS Mission, Vision, and History In the 1970s, the school was reported to have a reputation for its fans shouting racial epithets at black athletes who play for visiting teams. Nashville Christian became accredited with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1986. The same year, the school added the Gibson Center, a fieldhouse with a gymnasium, locker rooms, and classrooms. Financial problems in 1991 caused the school to be temporarily closed, but the school quickly rebounded after. The campus continued to expand in 2004, as a new elementary and middle school building opened, allowing Nashville Christian to expand its enrollment and school-related programs. Academics Nashville Christian serves as a college preparatory school to its high school students. The curriculum features twenty-seven college credits in English, math, history, and speech. Honors, dual enrollment, and Advanced Placement classes are also offered. Extracurricular activities  Athletics Nashville Christian's athletic teams, which were added within two years of its establishment, originally bore the nickname \\"Pioneers\\", until the student body voted to change the nickname to the \\"Eagles\\" in 1972. Today Nashville Christian fields athletic teams at both the middle school and high school levels.

Fictional mob boss Tony Soprano, the protagonist of the HBO series The Sopranos, is said to be based upon Palermo.The Sopranos: A Dramatic History documentary He also owned a strip club called Wiggles, which was the inspiration behind the show's Bada Bing! strip club.Wild Tales from the Police Blotter, by C. J. Sullivan. 2008. Background Palermo was raised in a traditional Italian American family in Brooklyn, New York. He has five sisters, including Claire and Nancy, and one brother. His father was an Italian immigrant who moved to New York when he was a teenager. Palermo came from a close-knit family, and was said to have lived a harmonious lifestyle. He was an altar boy during adolescence. When Palermo was sixteen, his father died, which forced him to leave school and work two jobs to help support his family, as his mother was a bedridden asthmatic. In his earlier years, Palermo worked at a wholesale fish business in the Fulton Fish Market, where he earned the nickname \\"Vinny Ocean\\". Palermo was very protective of children; he allegedly once stopped a man from beating his son, and rescued a toddler relative who had accidentally fallen into a pool. Palermo was also reputedly a dedicated family man. He attended Sacred Heart Church in Island Park, New York, drove his daughters to Brownie meetings, and reportedly watched Annie with one of his daughters regularly. Palermo also took in a troubled teenager named Richard, becoming his godfather. Palermo would allow his godson to stay at his home every weekend for a year, enabling the boy to study the Catholic sacraments in preparation for eventual baptism, Communion and Confirmation.http://houston.siegmann.org/swingers-in-houston Palermo was divorced once and remarried. In the 1980s, he became indebted to a hospital, local doctors, and the federal government. The tax liens against his property were in his second wife's name, an Italian-American woman named Angela, totaling $68,000. At the time, he was paying a large mortgage on a waterfront mansion with a 100-foot pier located in Island Park. He had two Social Security numbers and paid alimony to his first wife. He also supports his second family, two daughters, Danielle and Tara, and a son Vincent Palermo Jr., with Michael (from his first marriage) and Renee. His son Michael is a graduate of Fordham University and a licensed New York stockbroker; he was an investment banker with Goldman Sachs up until his father's indictment, when he went into hiding. DeCavalcante's nephew-in-law In the early 1960s, Palermo met and married the niece of crime boss Sam DeCavalcante of the DeCavalcante crime family. DeCavalcante took a liking to his nephew-in-law and began inviting him to visit his social club in Kenilworth, New Jersey. He worked at the fish markets in the early morning hours and hung out with mobsters on Sunday afternoons. Palermo cultivated relationships with other crime families—a lucrative loansharking operation with one Gambino family caporegime and bookmaking with another. He was also a close associate of the Genovese family. Palermo was known to say very little, speaking to only a very few close associates, and stayed away from mob-run social clubs. Until his racketeering indictment, he had only been arrested for the misdemeanor of stealing shrimp at the Fulton Fish Market. Murder of Fred Weiss On September 11, 1989, Palermo, Anthony Capo, and James \\"Jimmy\\" Gallo murdered Staten Island resident Fred Weiss, on orders from DeCavalcante boss Giovanni \\"John the Eagle\\" Riggi through capo Anthony Rotondo. Weiss was a former newspaper reporter for the Staten Island Advance and a real estate developer who had become associated with mobsters from both the DeCavalcante and Gambino families. Weiss and two mob partners had purchased a vacant property in Staten Island and started illegally dumping large amounts of dangerous medical waste there. Local authorities uncovered the scheme and started investigating Weiss, and the two mob families became nervous. Gambino boss John Gotti worried that Weiss might become a government witness in exchange for leniency and requested that the DeCavalcante family murder Weiss to protect them. Palermo, Capo, and Gallo drove to the New York condominium of Weiss' girlfriend. As Weiss left the building and climbed into his car, Palermo and Capo shot him in the face. Family scandal Palermo was appointed capo after the Weiss murder and given his own crew of soldiers. Riggi was sent to prison in 1989, and appointed John \\"Johnny Boy\\" D'Amato as his acting boss. In January 1992, Anthony Capo participated in the murder of acting boss D'Amato. Earlier in 1991, D'Amato's girlfriend, retaliating against D'Amato over an argument, told Anthony Rotondo that D'Amato was an active bisexual. She described swinging encounters that D'Amato had in Manhattan sex clubs with both women and men. Rotondo shared this information with underboss Giacomo Amari, and consigliere Stefano Vitabile.\\"Telling Court He's Gay, Mob Informer Crosses Line\\" By ALAN FEUER New York Times October 20, 2009\\"Hit man's confessions Mob turncoat tells court of his blood-soaked life\\" by Greg B. Smith, New York Daily News, July 26, 2002 In 2003, capos Philip \\"Phil\\" Abramo, Giuseppe \\"Pino\\" Schifilliti and the reputed consigliere Stefano Vitabile were charged in organizing various crimes, including the murder of D'Amato. Reputed men involved in the murder conspiracy, Palermo, Capo and Rotondo would later testify about this murder against their former associates. Power struggle With Amari's death, there was no clear candidate to become the new acting boss. Riggi, still in prison, restructured the family and created a ruling panel to run it in order to avoid a potential power struggle. Riggi appointed longtime members of the crime family to the panel: Vincent Palermo, Girolamo \\"Jimmy\\" Palermo (no relation to Vincent), and Charles Majuri. However, Majuri, furious that he wasn't appointed acting boss, decided to murder the two Palermos and take effective control of the DeCavalcante family. He asked Gallo to murder Vincent Palermo, but Gallo alerted Palermo about the plot. To protect himself, Palermo decided to murder Majuri instead. Over the years, Majuri had made many enemies by removing fellow mobsters from a labor union that he controlled and taking their money. Palermo was able to recruit Capo, Gallo, and Joseph Masella to find and kill Majuri. However, on the one occasion when they were ready to kill Majuri, they became nervous and decided not to do it. When they reported their failure back to Palermo, he decided that Majuri didn't pose a threat after all and cancelled the murder contract. By the mid-90s, Palermo was the de facto boss of the DeCavalcante family, with Riggi reigning as boss in absentia from jail. Government witness In 1998, DeCavalcante associate Ralph Guarino was arrested for stealing $3 million from a Bank of America inside the World Trade Center. To avoid 20 years in prison, Guarino agreed to work as an informant for the FBI, giving the agency information on the actions of DeCavalcante members. The agency gave him cell phones rigged with surveillance equipment to distribute to other family members. In October 1998, Palermo's trusted lieutenant Joseph Masella was shot to death, leaving an opening in the family. Guarino's status had been rising in the family due to secret assistance from the FBI, and after Masella's murder, Palermo and the rest of the DeCavalcante leadership promoted Guarino to made man. In 1999, Palermo faced charges and possible capital offenses, so he decided to become a government witness. He confessed to killing Weiss and mobster Louis LaRasso, and to planning the murders of the two D'Amatos, Masella, Majuri, and Tom Salvata, the manager at his strip club. Palermo also implicated other DeCavalcante family members in various crimes. After testifying for the government, Palermo and his family entered the federal Witness Protection Program. However, prosecutors later discovered that he allegedly gave his son Michael $1 million in cash, possibly jeopardizing his status as a protected witness. New life in Houston, Texas On September 14, 2009, the New York Daily News exposed Palermo's new life in witness protection as a strip club operator in Houston, Texas. He has been living under the name \\"Vincent Cabella\\". Houston Police alleged that Palermo's strip clubs were a source of drug dealing and prostitution in the Houston area. Palermo claimed that many of his Houston friends already knew of his past because of an A&E; television special. He lived in a gated mansion at 9105 Memorial Drive, Houston, TX 77024. The day after the Daily News report, Houston NBC affiliate KPRC-TV aired an investigative segment on Palermo. Forty days later, Palermo put his Houston mansion up for sale, first for $4 million but then, over the following two years, he reduced the price to $2.45 million. After the mansion still would not sell, he took it off the market on June 3, 2011. Palermo put his house up for sale again in September 2015 with John Daugherty Realtors; it eventually sold for $2.85 million on 5 August 2016.https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/9105-Memorial-Dr-Houston- TX-77024/27807373_zpid/http://propertylistings.ft.com/homes/748604/houston- property-for-rent/9105-memorial-dr-houston-tx-77024 In late 2011, the Houston Chronicle reported that Palermo was sued by the former owner of one of his strip clubs, claiming that he had only paid $5,000 of the $1.3 million selling price.http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/10/03/40233.htm Bankruptcy On March 4, 2013, Palermo filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Texas. Under Chapter 11, a person's assets and debts are not liquidated, but the filer is given court protection from creditors in order to try to perform a work-out of the insolvency situation.

Eakin was also a member of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Buffalo Bills, Tennessee Valley/Alabama Vipers, Georgia Force and Alabama Hammers. Early years Eakin attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida and was a student and a letterman in football, basketball, and track. In football, he was a team captain and was named to the All-Broward County team. Kevin Eakin graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2000. Professional career New York Jets Eakin originally was signed by the New York Jets, who allocated him to the now-defunct Frankfurt Galaxy of NFL Europe, where he was the starting quarterback ahead of former heralded #3 overall draft pick Akili Smith. After being invited to Jets training camp in 2005, he appeared in 2 preseason games and was the last person cut before the season. Hamilton Tiger-Cats Eakin spent the next season in the Canadian Football League with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, and spent most of the season as backup to controversial starter Jason Maas. Buffalo Bills After the 2006 CFL season, Eakin went right across the border and signed with the NFL's Buffalo Bills, who once again allocated him to Frankfurt. With the demise of NFL Europa, Eakin returned to Buffalo, but because of depth issues (he stood fourth behind J. P.

When playing CoCa, over a 1NT opening of the opponents, both a double as well as a 2 overcall are conventional and establish spades and hearts, respectively as anchor suits. Higher overcalls (2//) can be either natural (single suiters), or conventional (as explained below). The convention was published in Bridge Magazine IMP.Johannes Koelman, Bridge Magazine IMP, September 2006. (in Dutch) CoCa overcalls dbl = A) 4-card spades plus a longer suit, or B) 6-card spades 2 = A) 4-card hearts plus a longer suit, or B) 6-card hearts 2 = 4-4 majors 2 = 5-card plus minor suit 2 = 5-card plus minor suit The canapé structure of the dbl/2 CoCa bids (with a rebid in another suit denoting a longer suit) is what lends the convention its name. Responses Following the CoCa double, the partner of the doubler responds as follows: (1NT) - dbl - (pass) - ?? :pass = hand suitable for defense (usually denies spades) :2 = pass-or-correct bid, denies 4-card spades (doubler to pass or bid longer suit) :2 = pass-or-correct bid, denies 4-card spades, hand suitable for conversion to 3 (doubler to pass or bid longer suit) :2 = pass-or-correct bid, denies 4-card spades, hand suitable for conversion to 3/ (doubler to pass or bid longer suit) :2 = spade fit Similar responses apply to a 2 overcall: (1NT) - 2 - (pass) - ?? :Pass = to play :2 = pass-or-correct bid, denies 4-card hearts (doubler to pass or bid longer suit) :2 = heart fit :2 = to play Advantages/disadvantages CoCa renders all unbalanced hands with a major suit biddable. Claimed advantage of CoCa over other conventional defenses to 1NT openings, is that the first CoCa bid establishes at least one major anchor suit. Obviously, this advantage can turn into a disadvantage in cases knowledge of this anchor suit helps the opponents with a key decision during play. Furthermore, for nine out of the twelve frequently occurring 5-4 two suiters, the structure of the CoCa- overcalls allows the partnership to sign-off in the longer suit at the two level. Moreover, for five of these 5-4 hands, also the 4-card is known to partner before the bidding goes beyond that suit at the two-level. As a result, the treatment minimises the chance of ending up in a Moysian (4-3) fit whilst a better (5-3) fit is available. Like using Brozel, Lionel and DONT, using CoCa carries the consequence of losing the penalty double over opponent's 1NT. Although this is sometimes seen as a loss, the inventor of the Lionel convention, Lionel Wright, argues that this loss turns into an advantage as it opens the possibility to defend 1NT doubled with split points between both defending partners. As a balanced holding of the majority of points is far more likely to occur than holding the majority of points in an imbalanced way, a conventional non-penalty double over 1NT holds the potential of paying-off on many hands. Also, non-penalty doubles are more difficult to deal with than traditional business doubles.Chris Ryall's page on 1NT defenses See also *Canapé *List of defenses to 1NT References Category:Bridge conventions ","title":"Comfy Canapé"},{"id":"10952156","text":"The Revere Camera Company was started in 1920 by Samuel Briskin, who also started Wollensak Recorders and Opticals. History Founded in 1920 in Chicago, Illinois, as the Excel Auto Radiator Company by Ukrainian immigrant Samuel Briskin to manufacture car radiators, but started manufacturing some coarse household products later in the decade. Built for Excel – and designed by Alfred S. Alschuler, the manufacturing facility was located at 320 E. 21st St., Chicago, Illinois. They started making budget 8 mm movie cameras in 1939 through a subsidiary run by Briskin's sons. That company was later merged into Excel Auto Radiator Co., which then changed its name to Revere Camera Co. The Revere name is taken from the Revere Copper Company, which provided financial backing for Excel during the depression. In November of 1952, Revere purchased the nearby Atwell Building – also designed by Alfred S. Alschuler – at 221 E. Cullerton St., Chicago, Illinois – and operated machinery on four of the building's eight floors. In the 1950s, the company was the second largest manufacturer of small movie cameras in the United States. In order to grow that business further the company took over their primary lens and shutter supplier, New Jersey-based Wollensak Optical Co. The Revere brand name had become synonymous with budget cameras; soon after the take-over Wollensak models appeared that were mechanically almost-identical to the standard Revere models but had better lenses, more stylish casing, and sold for a premium price. Revere started manufacturing tape recorders in the early 1950s. That side of the business never became an important part of the company's output. Revere, starting probably in the 1950s, produced a fairly high quality rotary tool similar to the Dremel tools now on the market. The Revere-O-Matic was a 0.55 ampere model that operated at 15,000 r.p.m. (Model No. RG-1). All the tools that attached to it via the chuck can be used with today's Dremel models. The standard package came with a table mount and a system for duplicating objects, adaptable to the Dremel without modification. Samuel Briskin was diagnosed with inoperable cancer in 1960 and rather than leave the company to his family he decided to sell the company to 3M for $17 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

The title refers to himself and the Zuiweng Pavilion near Chuzhou City, Anhui, China. The poem's most well-known line is: The Old Toper cares not for the wine, his interest lies in the landscape (醉翁之意不在酒，在乎山水之間也), an idiom still used in modern Chinese to describe someone with an ulterior motive. English translation Around Chu are all mountains, and as for the peaks in its southwest, their forests and valleys are especially beautiful. Looking toward Langye, one sees that it is lush and deeply flowering. Walking into the mountains six or seven li, one gradually hears the chan chan sound of water flowing, streaming out between two peaks. This is the \\"Brewer's Spring.\\" Returning to the mountain path, there is a pavilion with outstretched wings, which the spring descends toward. This is the Pavilion of the Old Drunkard. As for who built this pavilion, it was the Buddhist priest of the mountain, Zhi Xian. As for who named it, the Grand Warden named it after himself. The Grand Warden and his guests come here to drink, and drink but a little and are at once intoxicated. As he got older, the Grand Warden gave himself the name \\"Old Toper.\\" The Old Toper cares not for the wine, his interest lies in the landscape . The happiness of mountains and streams is obtained in the heart and lodged in wine. Imagine the rising sun and the parting of the forest mist, the return of clouds and the darkening of cliff-side caves. These changes between darkness and brightness are the sunrise and sunset in the mountains. The country fragrance is faintly redolent; fine trees flower and flourish in the shade; the wind is high and the frost is pure; the water level lowers and the riverbed rocks come forth: these are the four seasons amid the mountains. One goes out at sunrise and returns at sunset. The scenes of the four seasons are not the same, and their pleasures are likewise inexhaustible. Those carrying burdens sing along dirt paths, those walking rest under trees. Those in the front call out, and those at the back respond. Hunched over old folks and those leading children by the hand, coming without stopping, these are the outings of the people of Chu. Fishing just before the brook, the stream is deep and the fish are plump. Brewing the spring water into wine, the spring water is fragrant and the wine is pure. Mountain game meat and wild vegetables are laid out in an assortment for the Grand Warden's feast. The happiness of the feast and drinking has nothing to do with strings and flutes. The shooters of dice hit their mark, and players of Chinese chess are victorious. Wine cups and game tallies cross back and forth, and people sit and stand in an uproar. The multitude of guests is happy. Senile-looking and white-haired, slumped amidst them is the Grand Warden, drunk. Shortly afterwards, the setting sun is behind the mountains and the peoples' shadows scatter disorderly. The Grand Warden returns and the guests follow. The forest of trees is dark, and the sound of birds is all over: the traveling people have left and the birds are pleased. Naturally, the birds know the pleasures of the mountains and forests, and do not know the happiness of people. People know to take after the happiness of the Warden, but do not know that the happiness of the warden is their own happiness. The Grand Warden is one who can share their happiness when drunk, and can express it in literature when sober. What is the Grand Warden called? He is Ouyang Xiu of Luling.

He was manager of Kidderminster Harriers from 1983 until 1998, winning the Football League Trophy in 1987 and the Conference Premier championship in 1995. Early life Allner was born in Birmingham, England. Playing career Allner started his playing career as a schoolboy at Birmingham City before signing amateur forms at Walsall playing reserve football. After being released he drifted into non-league football, firstly at Paget Rangers, where he won the Midland Combination under the guidance of manager Rhys Davies. Allner had a trial with Aston Villa during the 1970–71 season. He then rejoined Davies at Alvechurch, winning another Midland Combination title in 1971–72. During that season Allner played in all 6 FA Cup games against Oxford City. Two years later he scored the winning goal against Exeter City in the FA Cup before eventually being knocked out by Bradford City. A trial at Hereford United followed in 1974 before signing for Stourbridge in September 1974 under Allan Grundy. He only spent a season at Stourbridge before moving to Redditch United, then quickly moving on to Bromsgrove Rovers. He joined Stafford Rangers in 1976, spending two seasons with them. He joined Worcester City in 1978; in his first season they won the Southern Football League but injury sidelined him for most of the first Alliance Premier League season. Allner then made his first entry into coaching, being appointed player assistant manager at Cheltenham Town. Managerial career Allner began his managerial career with AP Leamington. He led AP Leamington to the Southern League Premier Division in 1983. However, Leamington were denied promotion to the Football Conference, their place being taken instead by the club that had finished second that year, Kidderminster Harriers. Soon after this, Allner left Leamington and took charge at the Worcestershire club. Kidderminster quickly established themselves as a top non-league side under Allner's management, winning the FA Trophy in 1987 and reaching the final in 1991 and 1995, in addition to making the final of the Welsh Cup in 1986 and 1989. Their most successful season came in 1994–95 when they reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, knocking out second-tier side Birmingham City (Allner's first club as a player), and Preston North End. They also won the Conference title that season, but were denied promotion because their Aggborough ground was not deemed up to Football League standards. Kidderminster almost made it to the Football League in 1996–97 after leading the Conference by 15 points at Christmas, but a storming run by close contenders Macclesfield Town pushed them into second place. Allner quit in November 1998 after almost 16 years in charge, and was eventually replaced by Jan Molby. A brief tenure as Worcester City manager followed. He later worked as a coach under Steve Cotterill at Cheltenham Town and helped them win promotion to Division Two in 2002. When Cotterill moved to Stoke City a few weeks after the promotion triumph, Allner was promoted to the manager's seat but was sacked on 13 January 2003 with Cheltenham heading for relegation. His successor was Bobby Gould. He is currently working for the Scouting Network.

It was first performed in 1996; bootleg recordings were widely circulated, and it became a fan favourite. Radiohead recorded versions of \\"Lift\\" during the sessions for their third album, OK Computer (1997), but abandoned it. They worked on more versions for later albums, but discarded them. In 2017, Radiohead released a version of \\"Lift\\" recorded during the OK Computer sessions on the reissue OKNOTOK 1997 2017, followed by a music video. Critics described it as anthemic and \\"Britpop-like\\". Further versions recorded during the OK Computer period were leaked on the 2019 compilation MiniDiscs [Hacked].  History  Radiohead first performed \\"Lift\\" on March 14, 1996, at the Troubadour in West Hollywood. They performed it over 30 times that year while supporting Alanis Morissette on her Jagged Little Pill tour, alongside future OK Computer material. Journalists noted \\"Lift\\" as a highlight and possible future single. According to guitarist Ed O'Brien, the audience responded warmly to the song: \\"Suddenly you'd see them get up and start grooving. It had this infectiousness.\\" A bootleg recording was widely circulated, and \\"Lift\\" became a fan favourite. Radiohead recorded \\"Lift\\" during the sessions for their third album, OK Computer (1997), but it went unreleased. According to drummer Philip Selway, the band felt it was fey and \\"wasn't really what we wanted to say about ourselves as a band at the time\\". In 1999, O'Brien dismissed the song as \\"bogshite\\", and said the band were \\"very happy to leave [it] off the album ... There wasn't any stage where it was a key track for any of us.\\" Asked why the song could have worked in live performance but not in the studio, O'Brien said Radiohead had not worked hard on it, and that if a song did not come together in the \\"first five times\\" of playing it through, they would move onto another track. In 2017, he said that Radiohead had felt pressured by the song's commercial potential: The former Chipping Norton Recording Studios, where Radiohead recorded \\"Lift\\" in 1996 > If that song had been on that album, it would've taken us to a different > place, and probably we'd have sold a lot more records—if we'd done it right. > And everyone was saying this. And I think we subconsciously killed it. If OK > Computer had been like a Jagged Little Pill, it would've killed us. But > \\"Lift\\" had this magic about it. But when we got to the studio and did it, it > felt like having a gun to your head. There was so much pressure. Around the release of Radiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), singer Thom Yorke said: > We haven't lost the song. We played it too much in a certain way that didn't > work in my opinion. It didn't feel right. So we need to approach it in a > different way, but at the time of OK Computer it was impossible to get into > rearranging it because everyone had fixed ideas on what to play and we'd all > just got into a habit we couldn't break. In 2002, Radiohead performed \\"Lift\\" in a slower, more restrained arrangement, which Pitchfork described as \\"a somber, almost queasy affair\\". O'Brien and guitarist Jonny Greenwood later dismissed this version as inferior. Promotional interview CD sent to British music press. In 2003, O'Brien said: \\"The spirit of the song was there in '96 ... And we're not in that place at the moment.\\" Pitchfork wrote that the unreleased \\"Lift\\" came to \\"hold an important place in Radiohead lore\\", and according to Rolling Stone, \\"for decades, 'Lift' ... was Radiohead fans' great white whale.\\" In 2015, Greenwood suggested that Radiohead had worked on \\"Lift\\" again, describing it as a \\"management favourite\\". He likened the situation to \\"Nude\\", a song released on Radiohead's seventh album In Rainbows (2007) but written years earlier.  Release  In June 2017, Radiohead released \\"Lift\\" on the OK Computer reissue OKNOTOK 1997 2017, alongside two other previously unreleased tracks: \\"I Promise\\" and \\"Man of War\\". The version of \\"Lift\\" was recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in February 1996, while the band were recording demos for OK Computer. In 2019, hours of recordings made during the OK Computer sessions, including more versions of \\"Lift\\", were leaked online; in response, Radiohead released the recordings as the compilation MiniDiscs [Hacked].  Composition  Spin described \\"Lift\\" as a Britpop-like ballad, and Rolling Stone described it as \\"one of the last vestiges of [Radiohead's] anthemic, Britpop hooks before the band embarked on a darker path with OK Computer\\". According to Pitchfork, the song is \\"strummy and steadily building, with yearning vocals\\". The lyrics describe a man who has been rescued from a malfunctioning lift. Pitchfork likened its themes to the OK Computer single \\"No Surprises\\", and interpreted the lyric \\"Today is the first day of the rest of your days\\" as \\"a death sentence ... the hapless soul inside it is doomed to expire soundlessly in the intestines of some soulless corporate edifice\\".  Music video  On 12 September 2017, Radiohead released a music video for \\"Lift\\" directed by Oscar Hudson, featuring Yorke taking an unusual journey in a lift. The video features cameos from Yorke's girlfriend and his daughter, and references older Radiohead videos, with appearances from characters from the \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Karma Police\\" videos. Pitchfork named it the 14th best music video of 2017.  Reception  Jamie Atkins, reviewing OKNOTOK for Record Collector, wrote that \\"Lift\\" was \\"an undeniably brilliant alt rock song, with surprising echoes of the grandstanding, otherworldly melancholy of prime Smashing Pumpkins\\". Guardian critic Alexis Petridis said it had \\"an immense, air-punch-inducing chorus\\", and that it would have been a \\"huge\\" hit had Radiohead released it. Pitchfork critic Jayson Greene described it as \\"a lovely, weightless strummer of a song\\". Several critics felt the version released on OKNOTOK was lacking. Rolling Stone wrote that it was \\"restrained, decelerated and boasting an uncharacteristically blasé Yorke vocal take\\" and did not match the \\"magnitude\\" of the live bootlegs. Spin critic Andy Cush felt it was \\"strangely neutered, with drums that patter instead of exploding with energy\\", and that the widely circulated 1996 bootleg remained \\"canonical\\". Fellow Spin writer Winston Cook-Wilson agreed that the bootlegs were \\"a bit more staggering\\", but wrote that this was \\"a testament to the band's remarkable pop sense at the time – an inclination they, for their own neurotic reasons, quickly moved to complicate or subvert\\". Following the 2019 release of MiniDiscs [Hacked], Pitchfork critics Greene and Jeremy D Larson wrote that it had a superior version of \\"Lift\\": \\"It's not mixed very carefully, but it sounds scrappy and untamed, like the band is pushing it into the red unselfconsciously. It lives up to the myth.\\" Rolling Stone considered this version the \\"crown jewel\\" of the release and \\"well worth\\" the price of purchase. The Guardian wrote that this \\"satisfying\\" version would likely have pleased EMI had Radiohead released it as the first OK Computer single, but that it was \\"ultimately a conservative song and feels like a path the band were right to fork from\\".

Born in Alexandria, DC, he completed preparatory studies, attended Alexandria Academy, studied law and was admitted to the bar, commencing practice in Maysville, Kentucky in 1835. He was editor of the Maysville Monitor from 1835 to 1842 and served as postmaster of Maysville. He was elected a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in 1848, serving from 1849 to 1855. There, he served as chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds from 1849 to 1853 and of the Committee on Elections from 1853 to 1855. He was unsuccessful for reelection in 1854. Afterwards, Stanton served as a state's attorney from 1858 to 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War Stanton was arrested and held at Camp Chase in Columbus, Ohio for supporting secession.Lazelle, Henry Martyn and Perry, Leslie J.

Volume 8, page pgs 916-917 Stanton was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1868, whose slogan was \\"This is a White Man's Country, Let White Men Rule\\". He was a district judge from 1868 to 1874. He resumed practicing law until his retirement in 1885 and died on March 20, 1891 in Maysville, Kentucky. He was interred there in Maysville Cemetery. Stanton is credited with naming Washington Territory, later the state of Washington, during an 1853 debate over the territory's preferred name of \\"Columbia\\". He argued that the proposed name would easily be confused with the nation's capital, the District of Columbia. Congress later approved the \\"Washington\\" name change and President Millard Fillmore signed the bill into law on March 2, 1853, officially creating the Washington Territory. He was the brother of the politician Frederick Perry Stanton who served U.S. House from Tennessee and as interim Territorial Governor of Kansas.

By the 1940s, she became one of the Seven Great Singing Stars.Baidu. \\"Baidu.\\" Bai Hong. Retrieved on 28 April 2007. Biography At age 11, Bai was admitted to the Bright Moonlight Song and Dance Troupe and entered Shanghai's entertainment industry. She used the stage name (白虹), meaning \\"White Rainbow\\". She was called one of the \\"Beiping Three Whites\\" (北平三白) with Bai Guang and Bai Yang. Career Her music career began at the young age of 11. She acted in her first film (人間仙子) at 14. In the 1930s, she was a popstar icon singing songs like (長生果). By 1934 a singing competition was sponsored in Shanghai, where she won by more than 200 votes taking the crown. She was known for having a mastery of the language and a clarity in expressing lyrics, which helped her gain many fans. In 1936 she toured Southeast Asia with the Bright Moonlight Song and Dance Troupe. A year later, she then joined the Green Bird Theatre Troupe (青鳥劇團). In the 1930s, she was recognized as one of the three great mandopop singers with Zhou Xuan and Gong Qiuxia. Her career peaked in the 1940s, when her music style changed more to uptempo jazz. Some of the songs that propelled her to stardom included \\"Intoxicating Lipstick\\" (醉人的口红), \\"Love and Gold\\" (爱情与黄金), \\"Flowers Don't Bloom Without Rain\\" (雨不洒花花不红) and \\"He's Like the Spring Wind\\" (郎是春日风). In the 1930s and 1940s, she recorded more than 150 songs and had many hits. Only Zhou Xuan made more recordings than her during that time. She performed in over 30 films and had many stage performances. She was also the first pop singer from mainland China to give a solo concert, which took place on the 12 and 13 January 1945. The three songs（乘風破浪）（可憐的爸爸媽媽）（醉人的口紅）were her personal preferences. She was married to the composer Li Jinguang (黎锦光), and they later divorced in 1950. She stayed in China after 1949 and continued performing in theater. During the Cultural Revolution, because Jiang Qing and the Gang of Four did not want people to know anything about Bai's song and film history in Shanghai the 1930s and 1940s, many other people of the same generation as Bai were imprisoned. Bai, a singer and actress in the 1930s and 1940s, was also imprisoned and subjected to persecution and abuse. She officially retired in 1979. In 1992, she died at the age of 72.

Background  Auld was born in Mahopac, New York. His father, Jack Auld, was a retired dirt modified racer, and he attended his first racing event as a toddler. The Auld family were fixtures at weekly racetracks in the Northeast.  Radio  Auld began his radio career creating and hosting Short Track USA, which aired on radio stations in central Florida. The show, dubbed \\"The Fastest Hour On Radio\\", covered short-track racing, and featured a combination of national and local racers, but even the NASCAR racers that were frequent on-air guests only discussed their short- track backgrounds, and not their current NASCAR careers. Upon accepting the position of Editor of Open Wheel Magazine, Auld turned the show over to a local racetrack announcer so that it would continue to give coverage to the numerous local racetracks.  Journalist  Auld started his racing journalist career in the early '90s, writing for numerous publications, including the featured Page 2 column of Motorsports Weekly. In the late '90s he also became a stringer for the Tampa Tribune, covering racing events and profiling local racers in the Tampa Bay Florida area. In 1999, when Open Wheel Magazine - since 1980 the leading sprint car and midget racing magazine - was sold to EMAP Petersen Publishing, Auld replaced racing publishing legend and NASCAR announcer Dick Berggren as editor. Auld continued as editor until the magazine was sold to Primedia Publishing, and in the wake of 9/11 was folded. Doug Auld immediately founded Wheels-Up Publishing, Inc. and began publication of Sprint Car & Midget Magazine, which quickly took the position formerly held by Open Wheel, as the \\"bible\\" of short-track open-wheel racing. Doug Auld is one of the few national racing media that is also currently active as a racecar driver.  Television  In the late '90s, Auld created and hosted a cable television program called Short Track Racing which aired in Bradenton, Florida and Sarasota, Florida, and featured drivers and highlights from local weekly racetracks.  Awards  In 2017, Auld was inducted into the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame. In 2013, Auld was awarded the Duke Dinsmore Memorial Award by the Dayton Auto Racing Fans (DARF). In 2005, Auld was awarded the Outstanding Contribution To The Sport Award by the National Sprint Car Poll, a division of the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame. He was voted the 2000 360ci Sprint Car Media Member of the Year, the 2002 410ci Sprint Car Media Member of the Year, in 2003 both the 360 Sprint Car Media Member of the Year and the 410 Sprint Car Media Member of the Year, in 2006 the 360 Sprint Car Media Member of the Year and in 2007 the Non-Winged Sprint Car Media Member of the Year. In 2002, Auld was awarded the Gene Powlen Fan Appreciation Award by the Hoosier Auto Racing Fans (HARF) Association, one of the country's oldest auto racing fan associations.  Other  In 2006 Auld created the Sprint Car & Midget Magazine Stay In School Program, a program in which race teams bring their racing operations to schools throughout the United States and Canada for assemblies encouraging students to consider and continue their education. From 2006 to 2007 Doug Auld served as President of the Board of Directors of the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum in Knoxville, Iowa.

It was founded in 2004 and offers a very small, very personalized approach to learning. WWHS has approximately 160 students enrolled currently.  About  Wild Wood High was founded in 2004 by Ruby Edwards and Marcia Linscott. Marcia Linscott is the current principal/head of WWHS. At the time the school opened in September 2004 there were only 100 students enrolled, 25 in each grade. It has grown significantly but there is now a 40 student cut- off in each grade so that students have more one-on-one interaction with teachers. The school is a private school that charges $20,000 for tuition each year. The school is extremely liberal and private and most students enter when they are freshmen, and are typically invited to do so by their middle schools upon graduation. In fact, it is very rare each year for a student in any grade other than 9th to find an open spot. The reason WWHS does this is that it feels like a small community is beneficial to students. Information WWHS is located in central Los Angeles. It is in a rather modern building, with outside lockers and lunch tables. It is a new school and because of this only has a few sports teams: soccer, cross country, basketball, baseball, softball and tennis. All of these sports take place off of the school campus and has many clubs including Student Council, Environmental Club, Students for Peace, Jewish Students Union, Interfaith Club, Holiday Club, and over 10 others. Some of these clubs meet during the school day (typically during lunch) and others take place after school.  Academics  Students take part in a number of courses. In addition to the required courses, students are allowed to participate in one art: Drama, Art, Music or Creative Writing. There is also a community learning group that every student belongs to that serves as a sort of homeroom. Students choose an internship senior year which they attend two times a week. Common choices include working at elementary schools or daycares, art museums, radio stations, or recording studios.

S. baskini is from the small tributaries of Rio Aripuanã, Rio Madeira drainage, Amazonas State, Brazil. S. dicra has the largest distribution in the Amazon basin, originating from the Amazon and Paraguay River basins. S. distolothrix inhabits the Tocantins-Araguaia, Xingu, and Paraguay River basins. S. dolicholophia is known from the Rio Negro basin in Brazil, as well as the Lake Amanã. S. empousa lives in the Amazon and Paraguay-Paraná River basins. Description Species of Scoloplax are readily distinguishable from other catfishes by the presence of a conspicuous shield- shaped rostral plate bearing numerous large and recurved odontodes. These fish have three rows of odontode-bearing plates, two bilateral series and one midventral series. There is also a rostral plate with many recurved odootodes. The adipose fin is absent. The greatest length reached is about SL. Scoloplax species have modified stomachs that are enlarged, thin-walled, and clear. The esophagus enters the stomach along the dorsal side just posterior to the anterior margin of the stomach; the intestine exits the stomach ventrally. A small patch of muscular tissue represents the digestive portion of the stomach, located from the entrance of the esophagus to where the intestine exits. This modified stomach may be for buoyancy control or for breathing air. Ecology Scoloplax species are fairly common among leaf litter in clear and blackwater habitats, including oxbow lakes, backwater pools, and well- vegetated streams.

The game involves opening physical puzzle boxes made of precision-engineered anodized aluminum to reveal unique codes that can be redeemed for prizes or to reveal further clues. The game began in September 2006. The game manufacturer's website contains a list of names it claims to be prize winners.https://www.isisadventure.co.uk/winners/index.php There are several web sites that Isis Adventure players use to exchange clues. Because of the nature of the clues, it is extremely unlikely that a player could solve puzzles without corresponding with Sonic Games or other players.  Puzzles   Isis Adventure  Isis 1 was released 7 July 2006, and was claimed to be the world's hardest puzzle. The Adventure started 25 September 2006. The Isis I has featured on both TV (on The Jonathan Ross Show on the 29 September 2006 and Dragons Den on the 21 March 2007) and in print media (such as the Chester Chronicle) With a price of £109 per Isis, the puzzle could be regarded as extremely expensive; however Sonic Games has awarded Isis puzzles at geocaching-type events. Early puzzles were regarded as easy compared to the later ones created. There is a large user forum in which players can discuss clues, ideas and solutions. The Managing Director of Sonic Games (Andrew Reeves) also frequents the site under the name 'Puzz'.  Objectives  The aim of the Isis 1 is to open a puzzle ball to retrieve a key placed inside. This key (not included in every ISIS, some require it to be shipped to you) in turn opens the hidden pyramids, where a player can claim either a gold coin, normally worth £500, or a silver coin exchangeable for a £20 gift voucher. Players must also solve a riddle to get the correct password before being able to collect a prize. In December 2006 the gold coin was worth £1000 up to 5 January 2007 where it was reduced to £500 (Sonic Games called this the '12 Days of Christmas' competition'). The Isis 1A, aka \\"The Puzz Challenge\\"  The Clue Book  A book was provided with the Isis 1 puzzle. Within this book there were 10 encrypted hints, that would help solve the puzzle ball. All the encrypted hints were a simple substitution cipher. Criticism Reviewers including Ron Garrett (reprinted by Mark Frauenfelder in Boing Boing) have criticized not just the puzzle, but the entire business model around the puzzle. Critics have raised concerns over the constant attempts by the company to try to encourage customers to spend more money. Privacy concerns have been raised over the fact that simply opening the packing causes customers to agree to Terms of Service: only after breaking the seal on the package is it revealed that the customer is strongly encouraged to register and disclose personal information to receive the manual and more clues. Opening the package also forfeits the customer's right to a refund. Frauenfelder notes that he normally will refrain from publishing negative reviews but has made an exception for this product stating \\"what I did mind was finding out that the manufacturers try to get you to cough up more money in a cult-leader like fashion.\\" Frauenfelder goes on to say \\"My general rule about reviews for Boing Boing (and Cool Tools) is to only review stuff I like and ignore everything else. But in this case I'm making an exception, because I want people who are interested in buying this puzzle to know what they are getting themselves into.\\" Other critics have gone as far as speculating that the puzzle is just a complicated scheme to datamine the personal information of people with enough disposable income to purchase this type of expensive puzzle. http://boingboing.net/2015/07/03/isis-adventure-worst-puzzle.html Related Sonic Game Puzzles  Isis 1A  On 31 May 2007, there were 12 limited edition Isis 1As released. Each was issued with a unique certificate of authenticity. The Isis 1A is a lot more difficult to open, and there is one prize for the first person who solves the accompanying riddle. This riddle was solved by \\"lodgecrest\\" in 2008. Recently, it has come to light that a 13th Isis 1A exists, although it does not come with a certificate of authenticity. This 13th Isis 1A was made available to purchase at a secret pyramid location, for a larger sum of money. All 13 Isis 1As have now been opened by their respective owners, according to the official Sonic Games Isis Adventure forum. Although the pictured Isis 1A is green and black, this is not representative of the entire 13, as they all differed in colour, from pink, to silver, to green to black to blue, which made them all unique.  Ramisis  The second Isis Adventure, called the Ramisis, was released in 2008. Before its launch Puzz mentioned on the ISIS Forum: \\"It will be shaped like a pyramid and the key will be visible\\". At the Tutankhamen Exhibition for a few days, there was a prototype of the Isis II in a display case.  Platinum Pyramid  On 4 April 2009, Sonic Games launched the Platinum Pyramid challenge. Owners of both Isis 1 and Ramisis puzzles who have not already won prizes can compete for £10000 in prizes. Winners of earlier prizes can compete by buying and registering new puzzles.  Copernisis  In 2010 Sonic Games released the third Isis Adventure puzzle, the Copernisis. This puzzle incorporates rotating rings designed to resemble the heliocentric solar system illustrated in On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres by astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.  Tessarisis  In 2013 Sonic Games released the fourth Isis Adventure puzzle, the Tessarisis. The puzzle is a cube with several dials on it.  Pentarasus  The fifth and final release of the Isis Adventure puzzle, the Pentarasus, is due to be released in November 2019. Verification of ownership (and completion) of the previous four Isis Adventure puzzles will be a requirement for purchase.

The major subcategories of transport equipment are conveyors, cranes, and industrial trucks. Material can also be transported manually using no equipment. Difference between use of conveyors, cranes, and industrial trucks for transport with respect to their path and area of operation.  Conveyors  Conveyors are used when material is to be moved frequently between specific points over a fixed path and when there is a sufficient flow volume to justify the fixed conveyor investment.Kay, 2012, p. 25. Different types of conveyors can be characterized by the type of product being handled: unit load or bulk load; the conveyor's location: in-floor, on- floor, or overhead, and whether or not loads can accumulate on the conveyor. Accumulation allows intermittent movement of each unit of material transported along the conveyor, while all units move simultaneously on conveyors without accumulation capability.Kulweic, 1985, p. 336. For example, while both the roller and flat-belt are unit-load on-floor conveyors, the roller provides accumulation capability while the flat-belt does not; similarly, both the power-and-free and trolley are unit-load overhead conveyors, with the power- and-free designed to include an extra track in order to provide the accumulation capability lacking in the trolley conveyor. Examples of bulk- handling conveyors include the magnetic-belt, troughed-belt, bucket, and screw conveyors. A sortation conveyor system is used for merging, identifying, inducting, and separating products to be conveyed to specific destinations, and typically consists of flat-belt, roller, and chute conveyor segments together with various moveable arms and/or pop-up wheels and chains that deflect, push, or pull products to different destinations.Kay, 2012, p. 33.  Cranes  Jib crane Cranes are used to transport loads over variable (horizontal and vertical) paths within a restricted area and when there is insufficient (or intermittent) flow volume such that the use of a conveyor cannot be justified. Cranes provide more flexibility in movement than conveyors because the loads handled can be more varied with respect to their shape and weight. Cranes provide less flexibility in movement than industrial trucks because they only can operate within a restricted area, though some can operate on a portable base. Most cranes utilize trolley-and-tracks for horizontal movement and hoists for vertical movement, although manipulators can be used if precise positioning of the load is required. The most common cranes include the jib, bridge, gantry, and stacker cranes.  Industrial trucks  Pallet jack Industrial trucks are trucks that are not licensed to travel on public roads (commercial trucks are licensed to travel on public roads). Industrial trucks are used to move materials over variable paths and when there is insufficient (or intermittent) flow volume such that the use of a conveyor cannot be justified. They provide more flexibility in movement than conveyors and cranes because there are no restrictions on the area covered, and they provide vertical movement if the truck has lifting capabilities. Different types of industrial trucks can be characterized by whether or not they have forks for handling pallets, provide powered or require manual lifting and travel capabilities, allow the operator to ride on the truck or require that the operator walk with the truck during travel, provide load stacking capability, and whether or not they can operate in narrow aisles. Unit load AGV Hand trucks (including carts and dollies), the simplest type of industrial truck, cannot transport or stack pallets, is non-powered, and requires the operator to walk. A pallet jack, which cannot stack a pallet, uses front wheels mounted inside the end of forks that extend to the floor as the pallet is only lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel.Mulcahy, 1999, p. 7.21. A counterbalanced lift truck (sometimes referred to as a forklift truck, but other attachments besides forks can be used) can transport and stack pallets and allows the operator to ride on the truck. The weight of the vehicle (and operator) behind the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and weight of vehicle beyond front wheels); the front wheels act as a fulcrum or pivot point. Narrow-aisle trucks usually require that the operator stand-up while riding in order to reduce the truck's turning radius. Reach mechanisms and outrigger arms that straddle and support a load can be used in addition to the just the counterbalance of the truck. On a turret truck, the forks rotate during stacking, eliminating the need for the truck itself to turn in narrow aisles. An order picker allows the operator to be lifted with the load to allow for less-than-pallet-load picking. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are industrial trucks that can transport loads without requiring a human operator. An electric tug is a small battery powered and pedestrian operated machine capable of either pushing or pulling a significantly heavier load than itself.  Manual Handling Equipment  Commonly used to assist in moving smaller loads where larger equipment would struggle, manual handling equipment such pallet trucks, trolleys and sack trucks can be an essential part of any material handling.  Yard ramp  A yard ramp, sometimes called a mobile yard ramp, is a movable metal ramp for loading and unloading of vehicles. A yard ramp is placed at the back of a vehicle to provide access for forklifts to ascend the ramp. Using a yard ramp for vehicle loading or unloading allows the work to be carried out by a forklift.  Positioning equipment  Positioning equipment is used to handle material at a single location. It can be used at a workplace to feed, orient, load/unload, or otherwise manipulate materials so that are in the correct position for subsequent handling, machining, transport, or storage. As compared to manual handling, the use of positioning equipment can raise the productivity of each worker when the frequency of handling is high, improve product quality and limit damage to materials and equipment when the item handled is heavy or awkward to hold and damage is likely through human error or inattention, and can reduce fatigue and injuries when the environment is hazardous or inaccessible. In many cases, positioning equipment is required for and can be justified by the ergonomic requirements of a task. Examples of positioning equipment include lift/tilt/turn tables, hoists, balancers, manipulators, and industrial robots. Manipulators act as “muscle multipliers” by counterbalancing the weight of a load so that an operator lifts only a small portion (1%) of the load's weight, and they fill the gap between hoists and industrial robots: they can be used for a wider range of positioning tasks than hoists and are more flexible than industrial robots due to their use of manual control.Kay, 2012, p. 23. They can be powered manually, electrically, or pneumatically, and a manipulator's end-effector can be equipped with mechanical grippers, vacuum grippers, electromechanical grippers, or other tooling.  Unit load formation equipment  Four-way pallet Unit load formation equipment is used to restrict materials so that they maintain their integrity when handled a single load during transport and for storage. If materials are self-restraining (e.g., a single part or interlocking parts), then they can be formed into a unit load with no equipment. Examples of unit load formation equipment include pallets, skids, slipsheets, tote pans, bins/baskets, cartons, bags, and crates. A pallet is a platform made of wood (the most common), paper, plastic, rubber, or metal with enough clearance beneath its top surface (or face) to enable the insertion of forks for subsequent lifting purposes.Kulweic, 1985, pp. 123-134. A slipsheet is a thick piece of paper, corrugated fiber, or plastic upon which a load is placed and has tabs that can be grabbed by special push/pull lift truck attachments. They are used in place of a pallet to reduce weight and volume, but loading/unloading is slower.  Storage equipment  Single-deep pallet racks Vertical carousel Storage equipment is used for holding or buffering materials over a period of time. The design of each type of storage equipment, along with its use in warehouse design, represents a trade-off between minimizing handling costs, by making material easily accessible, and maximizing the utilization of space (or cube). If materials are stacked directly on the floor, then no storage equipment is required, but, on average, each different item in storage will have a stack only half full; to increase cube utilization, storage racks can be used to allow multiple stacks of different items to occupy the same floor space at different levels. The use of racks becomes preferable to floor storage as the number of units per item requiring storage decreases. Similarly, the depth at which units of an item are stored affects cube utilization in proportion to the number of units per item requiring storage. Pallets can be stored using single- and double-deep racks when the number of units per item is small, while pallet-flow and push-back racks are used when the units per item are mid-range, and floor-storage or drive-in racks are used when the number of units per item is large, with drive-in providing support for pallet loads that cannot be stacked on top of each other. Individual cartons can either be picked from pallet loads or can be stored in carton-flow racks, which are designed to allow first-in, first- out (FIFO) carton access. For individual piece storage, bin shelving, storage drawers, carousels, and A-frames can be used. An automatic storage/retrieval system (AS/RS) is an integrated computer-controlled storage system that combines storage medium, transport mechanism, and controls with various levels of automation for fast and accurate random storage of products and materials.Thompkins, 2003, pp. 261-264.

It was composed between 1910 and 1913. Like Erwartung, composed a year earlier, it was heavily influenced by Otto Weininger's book Sex and Character.Schiff, David (August 8, 1999). \\"Schoenberg's Cool Eye For the Erotic\\". New York Times Unlike Erwartung, Schoenberg wrote the libretto for Die glückliche Hand himself. The first performance took place at the Vienna Volksoper on 24 October 1924. The underlying message of the piece is the idea that man continues to repeatedly make the same mistakes, and the plot is developed from events in Schoenberg’s personal life. Composition history The subject of the drama is influenced by personal circumstances in Schoenberg’s life. Schoenberg’s music was not as well received as it had been in previous years. Also, two years before the composition of the piece, Mathilde, Schoenberg’s wife, had an affair with the painter Richard Gerstl and although she returned to Schoenberg this had a lasting effect on their relationship.Biersdorfer, J. D, ( May 22, 2009). \\"Setting the Stage With Shadows\\". New York Times  Roles  *A man: (baritone) *Two mimed characters: one woman and one man *Chorus: six women and six men in Sprechstimme Synopsis :The drama takes place in one act in which there are four scenes. It lasts about twenty minutes. :The staging of Die glückliche Hand is complex, due to the range of scenic effects that must be combined with the use of coloured lighting. The drama represents an inescapable cycle of man's plight as it starts and finishes with the male character struggling with the monster on his back. The male character sings about his love for a young woman (mime) but, despite this love, she leaves him for a well-dressed gentleman (mime). He senses that she has left him and eventually, when she returns, he forgives her and his happiness returns. Again the woman retreats. The woman is seen later with the gentleman, and the male soloist implores the woman to stay with him but she escapes and kicks a rock at him. This rock turns into the monster that was originally seen on the man's back. Thus, the drama ends where it began. Instrumentation The score calls for: piccolo, three flutes (3rd doubling on 2nd piccolo), three oboes, English horn, D clarinet, three clarinets (in B-flat and A), bass clarinet, three bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, four trombones, bass tuba, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, snare drum, tamtam, high and low bells, triangle, xylophone, glockenspiel, metal tubes, tambourine, hammer, harp, celesta, and strings.

At the time of the 2011 Census, Himley had a population of 802.It is most notable for being the location of Himley Hall, the former home of the Lords of Dudley. History Himley parish became part of Seisdon Union following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, and later the Seisdon Rural District until 1974, when it became part of the newly formed South Staffordshire district. Despite these administrative boundaries, Himley Hall is owned by Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council. Located next to Himley Hall is St. Michael's Church, the only church in the village, which was erected in 1764 and is a Grade II listed building. Most recent Earls of Dudley are interred in a private burial ground at the rear of Himley's parish church. Transport Himley is situated off the intersection of the main A449 road between Wolverhampton and Kidderminster, and the B4176 road between Dudley and Telford. Bus routes National Express West Midlands 15/15a from Wolverhampton to Merry Hill Centre serve Himley village. These services replaced the 16 (previously 256) service between Wolverhampton and Stourbridge which was rerouted via Swindon, replacing the 15 service. Between 1925 and 1932, there was a railway station known as Himley railway station on the Wombourne Branch Line. It was operated by the Great Western Railway. A picnic area now stands on the site of the station. Places of interest Regular events take place at Himley Hall such as wedding functions and exhibitions, as well as local council-organised firework displays. Himley Golf Club, located within the grounds of Himley Hall, is open to the public. The Old Rectory, built , is almost as big as the St. Michael's Church behind it. The building, which had been sold by the Church of England in the 1950s, is now a private residence and is briefly mentioned in Nikolaus Pevsner’s ‘Buildings of Staffordshire’. When the building was still a working rectory, its garden was once visited by Mary of Teck – Queen consort as the wife of George V. The rectory for the parish is now in Swindon. There are two parks in Himley: the main park located within the boundaries of Himley Hall; and a second smaller park located on School Road. The Crooked House pub is just within the boundaries of Himley parish. The grounds of Himley Cricket Club have held one Twenty20 match for Worcestershire.

RG developed as a diversification of Röhm GmbH in the 1950s. Following a 1968 US division, RG Industries was established in Miami and lasted until 1986. In 2010, the RG brand was acquired by Umarex GmbH & Co. KG.  History  Rohm RG-14 used in the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan In the early 1950s, Röhm GmbH of Sontheim/Brenz, which was traditionally focused on the production of chucking tools, diversified its product line and began to produce gas alarm guns, flare guns, starting pistols and handguns. Röhm's product line of firearms was primarily established under the brand name RG. Following, and perhaps due to, the limitations on the importation of small pistols imposed by the 1968 Gun Control Act, RG established a factory in Miami in the 1970s under the name RG Industries. The Miami factory produced revolvers, automatic pistols, and derringers in small calibres such as .22 LR, .25 ACP, .32 S&W;, and .38 Special. The Miami factory ceased operations in 1986. In 2010, the management of Röhm GmbH decided to sell the branch of manufacturing firearms to the Umarex of Arnsberg and to refocus on its core market of chucking tools.

Taxonomy Cranoglanis bouderius was first described as Bagrus bouderius in 1846 by John Richardson based on a Chinese watercolor painting. Wilhelm Peters later described Cranoglanis along with a new species, Cranoglanis sinensis. Otto Koller (1926) described a new species, Pseudotropichthys multiradiatus. George Myers (1931) synonymized Pseudotropichthys with Cranoglanis, as well as described the family Cranoglanididae. Jayaram (1955) synonymized C. multiradiatus and C. sinensis under C. bouderius. More recently, C. bouderius and C. multiradiatus have been treated as separate species. C. henrici, described by Léon Vaillant in 1893, is often overlooked, but is a valid species. In 2005, Cranoglanis had been considered a monotypic genus by some, with C. bouderius as the only valid species. The Cranoglanididae are closely related to the North American family Ictaluridae. These two families are sister taxa in the superfamily Ictaluroidea.  Species  The five currently recognized species in this genus are: * Cranoglanis bouderius (J.

Description On the 17 July 1981, the Legislative Assembly adopted the law, with consists of three articles. For the first time, the statutory equality of the Acadians as a linguistic community, and urges the provincial government to protect and promote the development of the Acadian community. Law 88, more commonly referred to as \\"Bill 88\\" in English, complemented the 1969 Official Languages of New Brunswick law, which established French and English as official languages of the legislature and of the provincial administration. The law was, however, more declaratory than practical: \\"The vagueness of the legislation made it extremely difficult to implement. Consequently, it ... remained idle until its [later] inclusion in the companion resolution to the 1987 Meech Lake Accord\\".Catherine Steele, Can Bilingualism Work?: Attitudes Toward Language Policy in New Brunswick: The 1985 Public Hearings on the Poirier-Bastarache Report. Fredericton: New Ireland Press, 1990, p. 17. The so-called \\"companion resolution\\" was enacted in 1993 as Section 16.1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Reasons for introducing the law In 1979, the Société des Acadiens du Nouveau Brunswick had voted, at a provincial conference, for the Acadian-majority areas in the north and north-east of the province to break away and form an independent Acadian province. As well, a separatist Acadian party had been formed. As Premier Richard Hatfield would later on explain, these considerations caused Michel Bastarache, a prominent Acadian lawyer, to recommend to the premier's French lieutenant that the government \\"come up with some initiative to satisfy 'les Acadiens', and Bill 88 was the result.\\"Hatfield made this observation in an interview with Catherine Steele, who reported it in her book, Can Bilingualism Work?: Attitudes Toward Language Policy in New Brunswick: The 1985 Public Hearings on the Poirier-Bastarache Report.

The station is located from Ravenglass and from Dalegarth for Boot, and trains take 20 minutes to reach their destinations in either direction from this station. At most weekends and high-season, it is manned by volunteers from the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway, who sell tickets from the booking office shelter and can give live train-running information, but are unable to carry out these when trains are due into the station, as they are carrying out safety-critical tasks. This is the only intermediate station where the crossing loop is in the station, consequently there are two platforms. It is imperative to inform the guard that you are crossing at this location, because unless it is known that there are passengers to cross from the second train arriving, to depart on the first train that arrived, the first train that arrived will depart before the second train has completely stopped, making the transfer of passengers from the later-arriving train onto the earlier-arriving train unworkable. History Originally named Hollowstones, after the adjacent farm, it opened to passengers in 1876, when the line was still in its 3' gauge form. The station building was the only one on the line to be built from stone rather than wood, and as such, is the only station building to survive from the original railway. The station served the western end of the village of Eskdale Green as well as upper Mitedale, and as such, was one of the more important stations on the line for both passengers and local goods traffic. The station closed to passengers in 1908 and the goods traffic in 1913, but was reopened in 1916 as the railway was converted to 15 inch gauge. As well as becoming the main crossing point on the line, the station also hosted the railway’s carriage and wagon workshop, with a number of coaches being built/repaired at Irton Road before the construction of newer facilities at Ravenglass in the 1920s. For many years, Irton Road was the only practical passing place for trains between Ravenglass and Dalegarth. Consequently, the loop was extended to double the required length, to enable 4 trains to be accommodated at once, a feature the station retains to this day. Today, the station remains the main train crossing point on the line. The station also retains a storage shed and several sidings which are now used by the permanent-way department. Present day Set in the heart of the Eskdale valley in Cumbria; today a host of different trains can be seen passing through the station in high season, including passenger, permanent-way and empty-carriage-stock trains. Most frequently seen are passenger trains, which run from Ravenglass to Dalegarth for Boot and vice versa. There are sidings here, which end in a two road shed, usually home to Quarryman, a paraffin-fuelled 4w engine formerly used on trains between Beckfoot Quarry and Murthwaite Stone Crushing Plant; Santa's Sleigh, used in the winter time during the Santa Specials and 627, an old coach dating from 1928, which is part of the heritage collection. A bridge over the station carries a metalled track from Irton Road to a farm named Hollowstones, which doubles as a public right of way for walkers heading south from the station. When approaching by train from either direction, point indicators showing the lie of the weighted points can be seen when the train is approaching Irton Road railway station. The point indicators consist of a light on a black, circular background. A steady white light indicates that the weighted points are set for the train to enter the left-hand line of the two railway lines, while a flashing white light (rarely seen) indicates that the weighted points are set for the train to enter the right-hand line of the two railway lines. Exceptionally, no light illuminated either indicates that the weighted points are incorrectly set for either light-hand or right-hand train movements, or that there is some power or mechanical failure with the point indicators. These point indicators are normally inactive, only becoming active (illuminating) when a train passes a detection module, located on the track further back from the station than the point indicators. Presently, only a shelter and a toilet are available for use by the public. Conversations from the radio transceiver inside the station master's office can sometimes be overheard by passengers waiting inside the shelter. The station looks out on either side to grazing farmland, where sheep and cattle are a familiar sight. The road north of the railway line leads to Eskdale Green village in an easterly direction, where a convenience store, public toilets and a travelling post office on selected days can be found. The journey to each end of the line is approximately 20 minutes in each direction, however the working timetable differs slightly in that the train takes 18 minutes to get to this station from Dalegarth, with a 2-minute stationary phase at Irton Road. Accessibility Wheelchair passengers wishing to depart or alight here are advised to pre-book a wheelchair space prior to the day of travel. Telecommunications A radio transceiver for the radio-controlled train order signalling system is located here. An analogue radio repeater is located within the booking office which is used to overhear conversations between driver and the controller (located in the signal box at Ravenglass). The railway uses a type of semi-duplex private business radio system, similar to the marine VHF system.

From 1613 the capital was at Skarszewy. The name Pomerania derives from the Slavic po more, meaning \\"by the sea\\" or \\"on the sea\\".Der Name Pommern (po more) ist slawischer Herkunft und bedeutet so viel wie „Land am Meer“. (Pommersches Landesmuseum, German) History The voivodeship comprised the eastern lands of the historic Pomerania region, which since the Teutonic takeover of Gdańsk in 1308 had been held by the State of the Teutonic Order. After the 1454 uprising of the Prussian Confederation and the Thirteen Years' War, the area fell back to the Polish Crown according to the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466. Together with the Chełmno (former Kulmerland) and Malbork (Marienburg) voivodeships and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia (Ermland) it formed the autonomous province of Royal Prussia. The autonomy of the region was later abolished as a result of the Union of Lublin in 1569 and the area was incorporated into the Polish Crown. In older English sources and generally in German language use, for this region the appellation of Pomerelia (German: Pommerellen or Pomerellen, rendered as Pomorze Gdańskie in Polish) prevails, because the name Pomerania (German: Pommern) usually refers to the western Duchy of Pomerania (Polish: Księstwo Pomorskie), ruled by the House of Griffins, who had become vassals of the Holy Roman Emperor in 1181. In turn for their support in the Thirteen Years' War, the Griffin dukes in 1455 gained the Pomerelian Lauenburg and Bütow Land as a Polish fief, which upon the extinction of the dynasty in 1637 fell back to the Polish Crown and by the 1657 Treaty of Bromberg was given to the Brandenburg margraves, who also ruled over the adjacent Imperial Pomerania Province. Pomeranian (Pomorze) Voivodeship within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1635 For the Polish Crown the fact turned out to be fatal, that after the 1525 establishment of Ducal Prussia on the remaining territory of the Teutonic Order, the Pomeranian Voivodeship separated two territories, which were both held by the rising House of Hohenzollern, since 1618 in the personal union of Brandenburg-Prussia. After the Polish crown had given up suzerainty over Ducal Prussia by the 1657 Treaty of Wehlau and the Brandenburg margraves had assumed the title of a King in Prussia in 1701, the Hohenzollerns sought to link their territories. On the eve of the Polish partitions, King Frederick II of Prussia in 1771 finally incorporated Lauenburg and Bütow into the Pomerania Province. In the course of the First Partition the next year, he furthermore annexed the Pomeranian voivodeship with Royal Prussia, then renamed as the Province of West Prussia – except for the City of Gdańsk (Danzig), which was not incorporated until the Second Partition of 1793. Today the historic administrative region roughly corresponds to the present-day Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland, which also comprises the Lands of Słupsk (Stolp), that formerly belonged to the Duchy of Pomerania, as well as the territory of the former Malbork Voivodeship.

The First Army comprised at the time the 1st Army Corps (2nd, 11th, 30th, 31st IDs, 6th Army Corps, and 7th Army Corps). (Romanian Artillery p. 117) In August 1944, the Red Army entered Romania after driving back Army Group South from the region. On August 23, Marshal Ion Antonescu was dismissed by King Michael I, and Romania declared war on Germany and Hungary some days later. The Soviets took control of the oilfields in the Ploiești area, and the Romanian Army was used to fight German forces on the Eastern Front. The First Army became one of the Romanian armies fighting for the Red Army on the Eastern Front. In its campaign from August 1944 to May 1945, the Romanian Army lost some 64,000 men killed. At the Battle of Debrecen in October 1944, where Romanian units played a key part in the overall Soviet offensive, the First Army consisted of the 4th Army Corps with the 2nd Infantry Division and the 4th Infantry Division, and the 7th Army Corps with the 9th Infantry Division and 19th Infantry Division.See Battle of Debrecen order of battle The 7th Army Corps, with the 2nd and 19th Infantry Divisions and what was reported as the 9th Cavalry Division, then took part in the Siege of Budapest as part of the Red Army's 3rd Ukrainian Front. The last offensive of World War II in which the First Army took part in was the Prague Offensive in May 1945. During this offensive, the First Army operated together with the Romanian Fourth Army as part of the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front. The offensive started on May 6, a few days before the end of the war. German resistance in the east was now limited to small pockets scattered across Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. By May 11 and 12, all remaining German pockets of resistance in the east were crushed.

Ottó Baditz, (19 March 1849 in Tótkeresztúr - 21 April 1936 in Magyarkeresztúr) was a Hungarian painter and illustrator who specialized in scenes with women and children. Biography During the 1860s, he studied law in Pozsony (now Bratislava) while taking art lessons from Károly Steinacker (1801-1873) in Sopron. Upon obtaining his law degree,Brief biography @ the Magyar Elektronikus Kõnyvtár. the bibliographer and scholar encouraged him to continue his artistic studies. In 1870, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he studied with Carl Wurzinger, followed by studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where he took lessons from Wilhelm von Diez and began producing genre scenes of folk-life. Attempts at painting landscapes en plein-air were not to his liking. For almost twenty years, he stayed in Munich, where he shared a studio with Béla Spányi and sent his paintings to exhibitions in Paris and London as well as Budapest. His works proved to be very popular and he soon became wealthy. He returned to Hungary for a few months every year and, apparently a bit homesick, decided to remain there in 1890. Soon, he became the most sought-after painter for portraits of children. He was a regular participant in the (National Salon) and briefly served as its Director. He won the Grand Prize at the Franco-British Exhibition (1908). Three years later, he settled in the small village of Magyarkeresztúr and lived there until his death. In his later years, his paintings began to show the influence of Mihály Munkácsy. His last exhibition was in 1921. He also produced numerous book illustrations for works by József Kiss, Sándor Bródy and Mór Jókai, among others.

The origin of the name Misgurnus comes from the Greek word miseo (to hate) and the Turkish gür (loud), a name given to them due to their habit of becoming very active during barometric pressure changes that occur during thunderstorms. The common names, weather loach or weatherfish, also derive from this behavior. Some species of misgurnus are eaten, mostly in Asia, and are also sold as pets in the aquarium trade.

It connected the neighbourhood of Kesklinn (city centre) with Ülejõe. The pedestrian bridge had a minor design flaw which made it gyrate noticeably at even minor impacts, like a normal- sized person jumping or running across it. The bridge was taken apart in 2007 to be replaced by Vabaduse Bridge, a 3-lane traffic bridge opened in the summer of 2009. The bridge was planned to be eventually moved upstream and re- assembled for pedestrian traffic. As of 2016, no action has been taken in this regard. The decision to dismantle Raudsild is sometimes considered being controversial because of the costs and worsening of the conditions for pedestrians in Tartu downtown while not substantially improving the traffic conditions.

History  World War I  The Fourth Army fought in the Romanian Campaign of World War I, under the command of General Prezan. Units under its command took part in the Battle of Prunaru and the Battle of Bucharest. Its commanders were: * Divisional General Constantin Prezan: 27 August 1916 – 22 November 1916 * Divisional General Constantin Cristescu: 22 November 1916 – 13 December 1916 Constantin Prezan  World War II  On 22 June 1941, the 4th Army consisted of *the 3rd Army Corps (Guards, 15th, and 35th Reserve Divisions), *the 5th Army Corps (Border Division and 21st Division), *the 11th Army Corps (two fortress brigades), and *the 4th Army Cooperation Command.Leo Niehorster, Army Group Antonescu, 22 June 1941, accessed June 2011 It was under the command of Lieutenant General Nicolae Ciupercă. In 1942, it fought on the Axis side as part of the German Army Group B. In July 1941 it took part in Operation München, the recapturing of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, which were annexed by the Soviet Union the year before. By August 1941, during the Siege of Odessa, the 4th Army had under command the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 11th Army Corps under its control, with a total of 17 infantry divisions, the 1st Armoured Division (Romania), three cavalry divisions, and a total of 38 artillery regiments. 165 Years of Existence of Romanian Artillery p. 139 On 9 November 1941, Constantin Constantinescu-Claps was appointed the commander of the Fourth Army, and became a Corps General on 24 January 1942. On 10 February 1943, he was relieved of his assignment and replaced by Constantin Sănătescu. From late 1942 to early 1943, the Fourth Army was almost entirely destroyed during the Battle of Stalingrad. The Romanian Third Army suffered a similar fate. During April-May 1944 the Romanian forces led by General Ioan Mihail Racoviță, together with elements of the German Eighth Army were responsible for defending Northern Romania during the Soviet First Jassy- Kishinev Offensive, and took part in the Battles of Târgu Frumos. In August 1944, the Red Army entered Romania after driving back Army Group South from the region. On 23 August, Marshal Ion Antonescu was dismissed by King Michael I, and Romania declared war on Germany and Hungary some days later. The Soviets took control of the oilfields in the Ploiești area, and the Romanian Army was used to fight German forces on the Eastern Front. The Fourth Army became one of the Romanian armies fighting for the Red Army on the Eastern Front. In its campaign from August 1944 to May 1945, the Romanian Army lost some 64,000 men killed. The Fourth Army took part in Soviet offensives, notably at Prague in May 1945, which happened to be the last offensive it took part in World War II. The Fourth Army was involved in the Battle of Turda which lasted from 5 September to 8 October 1944, in the area around Turda. Troops from the Hungarian 2nd Army and the German 8th Army fought a defensive action against the Fourth Army and the Red Army. The battle was one of the largest fought in Transylvania during World War II. In the Prague Offensive, the Fourth Army, together with the Romanian First Army and Polish Second Army, formed part of the Soviet 2nd Ukrainian Front. Marshal Ivan Konev, the commander of the First Ukrainian Front, was the main Soviet commander in the area. Together with Marshal Georgy Zhukov's First Byelorussian Front, Konev launched the great attack on 16 April that resulted in the fall of Berlin and Soviet victory on the Eastern Front. The offensive started on 6 May, a few days before the end of the war. German resistance in the east was now limited to small pockets scattered across Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. The remnants of Army Group Center held the remaining German-controlled areas in the east. In the attack on Prague, German resistance was defeated in the city, and the Soviet, Romanian, and Polish forces entered the city on 9 May. Czech partisans had been fighting the Germans there for a few days. By 11 and 12 May, all remaining German pockets of resistance in the east were defeated.  World War II Commanders  * General lieutenant Nicolae Ciupercă, (2 June 1940 – 9 September 1941) * General lieutenant Iosif Iacobici, (10 September 1941 – 8 November 1941) * General major Constantin Constantinescu, (9 November 1941 – 10 February 1943) * General lieutenant Constantin Sănătescu, (11 February 1943 – 24 January 1944) * General lieutenant Ioan Mihail Racoviță, (25 January 1944 – 23 August 1944) * General lieutenant Ilie Șteflea, (23 August 1944 – 3 September 1944) * General lieutenant Gheorghe Avramescu, (4 September 1944 – 11 January 1945) * General lieutenant Nicolae Dăscălescu, (12 January 1945 – 18 February 1945) * General lieutenant Gheorghe Avramescu, (19 February 1945 – 2 March 1945) * General lieutenant Nicolae Dăscălescu, (3 March 1945 – 12 May 1945)  The Post War Situation The army was active after the war until 1947. In 1945, the Fourth Army comprised two army corps: 2nd Army Corps, at Bucharest, with Divizia de Gardă and 1st \\"Tudor Vladimirescu\\" Volunteer Division, 2nd Heavy Artillery Regiment, 2nd Pioneer Regiment, 4th Călărași Regiment, and corps units; 7th Army Corps, at Sibiu, with 2nd Infantry Division, the 2nd \\"Horea, Cloșca și Crișan\\" Volunteer Division, 1st Heavy Artillery Regiment, 7th Pioneer Regiment, 1st Călărași Regiment, and corps units. From March 1945 to June 1947, the generals in command were Nicolae Dăscălescu, Gheorghe Stavrescu, Mihail Lascăr, Grigore Vasiliu Rascanu and C. Nicolau. 4th Army Command was disbanded on 5 June 1947, under the Order M. St.M. nr. no. 40.500, and all units were redeployed. By Royal Decree 1346 of 28 June 1947, the 3rd Military Region, based in Cluj, was established starting 1 July 1947.  The Cold War The 3rd Military Region, formed after the war in Cluj, changed its name to 3rd Army Command on 30 April 1960. During this time, the training of the officers and the band was made in the new concept of country defense and national military doctrine. Thousands of soldiers participated in the national economy, including the harvest. The army troops participated massively at removing the effects of the catastrophic floods of the 1970s and 1975s and the earthquake of 1977. The intervention of some Warsaw Pact states in Czechoslovakia (except Romania) and the invasion of this country in August 1968, led to profound changes in the structure of 3rd Army Command. At that time, there began the formation of the new 81st Mechanized Division (at Dej), the existing 11th and 18th Mechanized Divisions (from Oradea and Timișoara) were strengthened, as was the 6th Tank Division (from Târgu-Mureș). In the next year (1969), it was appreciated that the fighting capacity of the 3rd Army Command grew by over 75% from the point of view of the personnel, and with about 55% from the military equipment. Because of doctrinal reasons, as well as the tense political-military situation in the 1980s, resulted in the organization of the Romanian Land Forces on four army headquarters. Starting with 5 April 1980, the 3rd Army Command changed its name again to 4th Army Command. In 1989, the 4th Army Command was reported to consist of the 6th Tank Division (Targu Mureș), named as Horia, Cloșca și Crișan Division, the 11th Mechanised Division \\"Carei\\" (Oradea), and the 81st Mechanised Division \\"Someș\\" (Dej),http://www.worldwar2.ro/forum/index.php?showtopic=530&st;=45 as well as smaller units: the 1st Mountain Bde, 5th Mountain Bde, and 37th Tactical Missile Brigade. 165 Years of Existence of Romanian Artillery p. 222-223 The 11th Mechanised Division \\"Carei\\" reportedly consisted of the following units: *21st Mech.

After 1992, five motorized infantry battalions were set up in the garrisons of Satu Mare, Carei, Salonta, Marghita and Chișineu-Criș. Between 1993 and 1995, as a consequence of the reorganization of the entire army, all existing mechanized and tank divisions were disbanded, and new headquarters were established: the 5th, 6th and 7th Army Corps Commands, in Timișoara, Târgu Mureș and Dej. In May 1994, the territorial troops became subordinate to the Army Troops. On 1 August 1995, the 4th Army Command \\"Transylvania\\" had 3 Army Corps commands, 23 brigade-sized units, and a number of other formations and directly subordinate structures. The Fourth Army was redesignated as the 4th Territorial Army Corps in 2000 and subsequently as the 4th Infantry Division (Romania) in 2008.

In 2007, Gerry Murphy, John Dungworth, John Vaughan, Martyn Booty and Mitchell teamed together to coach the Huddersfield Town side in the aftermath of Peter Jackson's dismissal. A year later, when Andy Ritchie was dismissed, Gerry Murphy and Mitchell took over as caretaker manager and caretaker assistant manager respectively. At the end of the 2007–08 season, Stan Ternent was given the Town job; he was dismissed in November, when Murphy and Mitchell were placed in temporary charge once again. The team played six, won four and lost two. Mitchell took charge of the team, when Murphy was ill, against Southend United which Huddersfield won 1–0. Lee Clark took over the next day. Mitchell is coach for Huddersfield Town's under-18 youth squad. In February 2009, he took over as head of the academy following the retirement of Gerry Murphy. Huddersfield Town Centenary Matchday On Sunday 26 April 2009, a Centenary Matchday took place at The Galpharm Stadium which saw two teams, one managed by Andy Booth and the other managed by Mitchell, played each other full a full 90 minutes and have a penalty shootout.

Born in Iran and educated at Queens College, City University of New York and the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, he is now a British citizen.\\"Biographical Notes\\" in Earle, Joe (ed.) Shibata Zeshin: Masterpieces of Japanese Lacquer from the Khalili Collection. London: Kibo Foundation, 1997. p80. Khalili has assembled eight art collections — the Khalili Collections — each considered among the most important in its field. These collections total 35,000 art works and include the largest private collection of Islamic art and a collection of Japanese art rivalling that of the Japanese imperial family. He has spent tens of millions of pounds on conserving, researching, and documenting the collections, publishing more than seventy volumes of catalogues and research so far. Exhibitions drawn from the collections have appeared in institutions around the world. He first started to collect art in New York during the 1970s, later investing in property in the United Kingdom during the 1980s. Since then his wealth has grown substantially, which he stated in an interview was due to \\"dealing in art, commodities and real estate\\". Khalili is known for the purchase and renovation of a number of large properties in London. Through his philanthropic organisation, the Khalili Foundation, he supports a range of activities to promote mutual understanding and dialogue between Abrahamic religions. His donations funded the creation of a research centre in Islamic art at the University of Oxford as well as the first university chair in the subject, at the School of Oriental and African Studies. He also supports the creation and distribution of educational materials and has written and distributed a history of Islamic art and architecture. Khalili is a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador and has taken part in United Nations and UNESCO events on the theme of peace between cultures. His work for intercultural dialogue and peace has been recognised with honourary degrees from five universities and awards from the French National Assembly and the High Sheriff of Greater London. He is the recipient of the Legion of Honour, presented by French President François Hollande. He is also a trustee of the City of Jerusalem and has received knighthoods from two Popes. He received a knighthood in the 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours \\"for services to interfaith relations and charity\\". When asked about his collections, Khalili stated that he \\"found things that belonged to a great heritage that was just sitting there unnoticed. [...] They were displaced from history and deserved to be preserved and recognised\\". Early life and education Khalili was born in 1945 in the city of Isfahan, Iran, the fourth of five children, to a Jewish family of art dealers and traders of artefacts. They moved to Tehran when he was a few months old. By the age of eight, he was accompanying his father on buying trips, acquiring Persian lacquers and other Islamic art works. He studied in Tehran and, at age 14, wrote a book profiling more than two hundred geniuses. The book was prompted by an argument with one of his teachers. After the book's publication, Khalili featured on television discussing his book and also wrote columns in newspapers. Khalili completed his national service in Iran as a medic in the Iranian Army, before leaving Iran in 1967 for the United States with $750, the proceeds from his book. He studied computer science and earned a BA degree in the subject at Queens College, City University of New York, graduating in 1974. He later received a PhD degree in Islamic art in 1988 from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, with a thesis on Islamic lacquerware. via British Library EThOS Business and collecting career Khalili started his business career trading in art before moving into property development and commodities. He began collecting art in New York City in the 1970s, keeping the best pieces for his own collection. In the mid 1970s he moved to London and began to frequent its auction houses, establishing his own gallery in Mayfair between 1978 and 1980. Khalili initially traded in Persian lacquerware, later writing his doctoral thesis on the subject. In 1978, the price of Islamic art fell substantially. The Iranian Revolution brought more items onto the market as rich families sold their art and during the subsequent Iran-Iraq War there was little interest in collecting art in that region. Khalili took the opportunity to expand his collection, acquiring works that would be valued much more highly with the later growth of international interest in Islamic art. People close to Khalili stated that he invested wisely and often discreetly, buying items that later appreciated to one hundred times the price he paid. Khalili's dealership was based in Mayfair's Clifford Street in the 1980s. When asked directly how he had gathered his wealth during the 1970s and 1980s, Khalili stated it was from sugar and coffee trading, the options market, property investments and works of art. In a 2010 interview Khalili said that his collecting in the mid 1980s was funded by his dealings in venture capital, having profited from shares in a company that developed technology to treat tumours, and that he made $15 million from the sale of a company that manufactured indigestion pills in 1987. In 1992 he described his wealth as deriving from \\"dealing in art, commodities and real estate\\". In the mid-1980s, the scale of Khalili's collection greatly expanded. He sought out the rarest items and paid record prices at auction. In the early 1990s, he began to publish a catalogue of his Islamic art collection, commissioning numerous scholars of Islam. Suspicions in the art industry were that Khalili was assembling the collection on behalf of a rich investor. Eventually he revealed that he was collecting on behalf of his own family trust. During the same period, Khalili was an art advisor to Hassanal Bolkiah, the Sultan of Brunei. He wrote a catalogue of the Sultan's art works that were on display in the Brunei Museum. In 1992, Khalili offered to lend his Islamic art collection to the British government for a period of 15 years and on condition it would be publicly displayed in a \\"museum building in central London\\". He suggested that the museum would be known as the Nasser D. Khalili Museum, with the running costs of the museum and insurance to be publicly funded. The offer was made with the potential for turning the donation into a gift at the expiration of the 15-year period. The Conservative politician Lord Young of Graffham and the public relations executive Lord Bell lobbied the government to accept Khalili's offer. Many expressed an interest in the proposal, including Prince Charles. In 2007 Khalili's wealth was estimated at £5.8 billion by the Sunday Times Rich List, but he did not appear in subsequent editions of the list. Forbes listed him as a billionaire from 2005 onwards, estimating his wealth at $1.3 billion in 2007 and 2008, until dropping him from the list in 2014. In 2008 The Art Newspaper wrote that \\"a £1 billion valuation is believed more likely\\" than previously claimed higher amounts. Khalili has claimed to have spent $650 million on art. Khalili Collections Khalili has assembled eight art collections, collectively known as the Khalili Collections. They include Islamic art dating from 700 to 2000; Hajj and the Arts of Pilgrimage from 700 to 2000; Aramaic Documents from 353 BC to 324 BC; Japanese Art of the Meiji Period from 1868 to 1912; Japanese Kimono from 1700 to 2000; Swedish Textiles from 1700 to 1900; Spanish Damascened Metalwork from 1850 to 1900 and Enamels of the World from 1700 to 2000. Together, the eight collections contain 35,000 works. The Khalili Collection of Islamic Art has holdings of more than 28,000 objects documenting arts from Islamic lands over a period of 1,400 years. It was described in 1998 as \\"one of the largest and most representative collections of Quranic manuscripts in the world\\" and is the largest and most comprehensive private collection. It includes 500 manuscripts of the Qur'an, rare and illustrated manuscripts, album paintings, bookbindings, lacquer, ceramics, glass and rock crystal, metalwork, scientific instruments, arms and armour, jewellery, carpets and textiles, coins and architectural elements. Among the illustrated manuscripts is one of the earliest known exemplars of the Jami' al-tawarikh (Compendium of Chronicles), dated 1314. The collection was the basis in 2008 for the first comprehensive exhibition of Islamic art to be staged in the Middle East, at the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi. This was also the largest exhibition of Islamic art held anywhere up to that date. Due to its large number of manuscripts, the collection has been used by researchers to study Islamic calligraphy. The official catalogue now runs to 27 books with a further 20 planned. The Hajj and the Arts of Pilgrimage collection relates to Hajj and the arts associated with it. The works in the collection range from the Umayyad period to the 21st century. The collection aims to represent an overview of the subject, illustrating various religious and artistic aspects of the pilgrimages to various holy cities. The collection contains approximately 3,000 objects, including over 250 textiles and many other objects relating to Mecca and Medina. The combined collection is the second largest collection of its kind, only exceeded by that of the Topkapı Palace museum. The Khalili Collection of Aramaic documents is a collection of 48 Aramaic documents from Ancient Bactria. The majority of the collection is made up of part letters and accounts connected with the court of the Satrap (local ruler) of Bactria. Together these letters and accounts make up the first discovered correspondence of the administration of Bactria and Sogdiana. The documents are written in Official Aramaic and were likely from the historical city of Balkh. They are dated to a period of less than 30 years, from 353 BC to 324 BC. The newest of the documents was written during Alexander the Great's early reign in the region. The collection of letters and documents is significant for the linguistic study of the Official Aramaic language and of daily life in the Achaemenid empire. The Japanese Art of the Meiji period collection is comparable only to the collection of the Japanese Imperial family in terms of size and quality. It comprises over 1,400 pieces, including metalwork, enamels, lacquerwork, ceramics and textiles. The pieces are from the period of Emperor Meiji's rule from 1868 to 1912. During this period, Imperial patronage, government sponsorship, promotion to new audiences, and Western technology combined to foster an era of innovation in which Japanese artists reached new levels of technical sophistication. The collection includes works by artists of the Imperial court that were exhibited at the Great Exhibitions of the late 19th century. Rather than covering the whole range of Meiji-era decorative art, Khalili has focused on objects of the highest technical and artistic quality. Included is a trio of cloisonné enamelled vases which have become known as the Khalili Imperial Garniture. Created for exhibition in Chicago in 1893 and personally approved by the Emperor Meiji,Japan Weekly Mail, 15 April 1893, p.453, quoted in the three vases were described at the time as \\"the largest examples of cloisonné enamel ever made\\". The garniture was subsequently split, and one vase considered \\"lost\\", until Khalili reunited all three in 2019. The collection has been used in researching Japonisme: how the availability of Japanese art in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th century influenced European art, especially Vincent van Gogh and the impressionists. Khalili's second Japanese- based collection is the Khalili Collection of Kimono. This covers three hundred years of the Japanese textile industry and contains over 450 garments. The garments have been worn to demonstrate gender, age, status and wealth throughout Japan's history. The collection reveals a variety in kimono designs, illustrating how the design and use of kimono have changed over the centuries. The collection mainly represents four periods, the Edo period (1603-1868), the Meiji period (1868-1912), Taisho (1912-1926) and early Showa (1926–1989), with a few selected pieces produced later on. The Khalili Collection of Swedish Textiles comprises nearly a hundred textile panels, dating between 1700 and 1900. The majority of the works are from a one hundred-year period, and from the area of Scania, the southernmost region of Sweden. The textile collection contains art mostly made for wedding ceremonies in the region. While they played a part in the ceremonies, they were also a reflection of the artistry and skill of the weaver. Their designs often consist of symbolic illustrations of fertility and long life. In 2008 the collection was described as \\"the only extensive collection of Swedish flatweaves outside the country\\". The Spanish damascene metalwork collection is one of the largest collections of its kind, illustrating damascening in which gold or silver is pressed into an iron surface to create fine decoration. The collection contains works by Plácido Zuloaga who revived and perfected the art of damascening in Spain, as well as from artists that he trained or influenced. Zuloaga was known for elaborate artworks, each requiring the skills of eight to twelve specialist artisans over a period of years. Some of the pieces were originally acquired by the 19th-century English collector Alfred Morrison. In total there are 100 works, 22 of which are signed by Plácido Zuloaga. Victoria and Albert Museum director Alan Borg described the collection's catalogue as \\"a landmark in the study of 19th century Spanish decorative art\\". The Enamels of the World collection is the most comprehensive private collection of its kind. It consists of over 1,300 pieces and showcases the evolution of enamelling over a 300-year period. By including objects from Western Europe, Russia, Islamic countries, China, Japan, and America, it illustrates how these centres of enamel production influenced each other's styles. The best-known European enamellists are represented, including Peter Carl Fabergé, Cartier, and René Lalique, along with the Meiji-era Japanese artists who perfected the firing process. The collection illustrates the role of patronage in enamelling as many of its objects were created for royal or imperial households. The Khalili Collections will be fully represented in a series of over 100 books, including exhibition catalogues, of which over 70 have already been published. Khalili has estimated that the publication of the catalogues and associated research papers would cost him between £20-30 million. The majority of the art works are kept in storage in London and Geneva. Exhibitions Objects from the Khalili Collections have been exhibited in museums worldwide including the British Museum and Victoria & Albert Museum in London, the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, the Alhambra Palace in Granada, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Portland Art Museum and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.

Number 19 had been the Egyptian embassy and 18 was formerly part of the Russian embassy. Khalili's purchase of the property and its subsequent refurbishment cost £84 million. The refurbishment, involving 400 craftsmen, was believed to have been second in scale only to the restoration of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire. Marble for pillars was imported from the same Indian quarry that had been used to build the Taj Mahal. The building was bought by businessman Bernie Ecclestone in 2001 for £50 million, making it the most expensive private home in the country. Ecclestone later sold it to industrialist Lakshmi Mittal. Sixty London 60 Holborn Viaduct In 1997, Khalili bought Bath House, an office building on Holborn Viaduct for £7 million. In 2007 planning permission was granted for an 11-storey office building called The Wave. The building, completed in 2013, was designed by the architects Kohn Pederson Fox Associates. Since 2010 the project had been a partnership between Khalili's property company Favermead and AXA Real Estate Investment Managers. The new building was later leased by Amazon in 2013. In 2014 the building became one of the 13 winners in the Urban Land Institute’s Global Awards for Excellence, citing the blending of modern and historic architectural elements.  Philanthropy  Khalili has made many substantial donations to a number of organisations, institutions, and charities. His philanthropic activities are presently delivered through the Khalili Foundation. Donations in the field of education include a 2004 endowment of £2.25 million to the University of Oxford. The funds were used for the establishment of the Khalili Research Centre for the Art and Material Culture of the Middle East, which was opened by the Chancellor of Oxford University, Lord Patten, in July 2005. Khalili has since continued to support the centre. In 1989, Khalili donated £600,000 to establish the Khalili Chair of Islamic Art and Archaeology at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. This was the first university chair devoted to Islamic art. He also gave a further £200,000 in 2003 for the refurbishment of the lecture theatre at the school. In 1992, he gave an endowment to the University of Oxford for a Research Fellowship in Islamic Art. In 2011 he gave an endowment to Queens College, New York, where he earned his undergraduate degree, to create the Nasser D. Khalili Chair of Islamic Studies. In the early 1990s, when an advisor to the Sultan of Brunei, he persuaded the Sultan to provide £10 million to build the Brunei Gallery at the School of Oriental and African Studies. A panorama of Jerusalem from the House of Peace series One project of Khalili's Foundation is the Maimonidies Interfaith Initiative, originally founded in 1995 to promote \\"understanding, cooperation and peace between Jews, Christians and Muslims internationally through art, culture and education\\". Its activities include the Maimonides Interfaith Explorers, a UNESCO-supported online educational resource for children aged 10 to 11. The course is freely offered to schools and supported by a bank of four hundred online videos. In the 1990s, Khalili commissioned a series of five paintings by the artist Ben Johnson called the House of Peace to promote peace and harmony between Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The foundation also donated 20,000 copies of The Timeline History of Islamic Art and Architecture (Visions of Splendour), written by Khalili, to schools in the United Kingdom and Islamic countries. Faith in the Commonwealth is a global citizenship education project started jointly by the Commonwealth and the Khalili Foundation. It gives Training of Trainers workshops to people from the ages of 15 to 29 from different faith backgrounds, including those of no faith, supporting them in developing social action projects within their communities. These projects address topics such as hate speech, girls' education, and indigenous people's rights. Khalili is the chair of Global Hope Europe, one of three not-for-profit organisations that together form the Global Hope Coalition. The coalition was founded in 2016 and gives annual awards to political leaders and \\"everyday heroes\\" who combat extremism and intolerance. Irina Bokova, former Director of UNESCO, is the coalition's honorary president.  Bibliography  Khalili is the author of The Timeline History of Islamic Art and Architecture, first published by Worth Press in 2005. It has been published in six editions, including in English, Arabic, French and Dutch. He is the co-author, with Nahla Nassar, of A selection of Islamic Art at the Brunei Museum (published 1990) and co-author, with Basil William Robinson and Tim Stanley, of the two-volume Lacquer of the Islamic Lands (published 1996 and 1997). He has also overseen the publication of dozens of volumes relating to his collections, including catalogues and scholarly essays.  Recognition  He has been awarded many honours, including being the only non-Christian to have received knighthoods from two Popes. Pope John Paul II awarded him Knight of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St Sylvester (KSS) and Pope Benedict XVI further elevated him to Knight Commander in that order (KCSS) for his pursuit of peace, education and culture among nations. In 2012, he was further honoured in this field by UNESCO who appointed him a Goodwill Ambassador. In early 2016 he was awarded the rank of Officier in the Legion of Honour by President François Hollande in a ceremony at the Élysée Palace. He was knighted in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to inter-faith relations and charity.

There were 15 nations competing. In the penultimate race ever in Centennial Stadium, Olabisi Afolabi put Nigeria out in front, with Merlene Frazer very close at the handoff. Fatima Yusuf extended the Nigerian lead out to about 8 metres, Handing off in sixth place, Maicel Malone brought USA into second place, but Russian Svetlana Goncharenko, starting her leg in fifth place, followed Malone and overtook her on the final straight. With Nigeria comfortably in front, the second exchange saw the field bunch as the next six teams exchanged within a couple of steps of one another. Coming out of the scrum, Russia maintained second place followed by USA, while Cuba's Surella Morales found herself flat on her face before the end of the first turn. Down the backstretch Kim Graham ran USA past Russia's Yekaterina Kulikova, while Jamaica's Juliet Campbell ran wide to stay out of trouble, but opened the door for Germany's Anja Rücker to join the chase. Through the second turn, back from her drug suspension, Charity Opara's lead began to shrink as Graham began to separate from the pack. Under the challenge, Opara began to tie up, Graham cruised by to hand off to Jearl Miles with a 4-metre advantage. Nigeria's bronze medalist Falilat Ogunkoya chased Miles leaving Jamaica's hurdle gold medalist Deon Hemmings to battle Germany's drug cheat Grit Breuer. Campbell closed quickly to give Hemmings the edge over Breuer, but Ogunkoya made it clear she was not going to battle for bronze, putting a gap on Hemmings and Breuer quickly from the pass. Ogunkoya's focus was on Miles, gaining steadily until the final straight, reducing the gap to less than a metre. Miles was gritting her teeth, trying to hold off Ogunkoya. Coming off the turn, she looked to be struggling as Ogunkoya gained, Miles drifting into lane 2 to give Ogunkoya the direct route to victory. But Miles didn't let her by, holding the edge all the way to the finish line for American gold. Behind them, Hemmings held the advantage over Breuer until the final straight, then Breuer unleashed a sprint that left Hemmings and was nipping at Ogunkoya's heels, giving the German team the bronze.

Ratcliffe is the chairman and chief executive officer of the Ineos chemicals group, which he founded in 1998 and of which he still owns two-thirds, and which has been estimated to have a turnover of $80 billion. He does not have a high public profile, and has been described by The Sunday Times as \\"publicity shy\\". As of May 2018, he was the richest person in the UK, with a net worth of £21.05 billion. As of July 2020, Forbes estimated his net worth at $17.8 billion, 74th richest in the world and fifth in the UK. https://www.forbes.com/profile/james-ratcliffe/?list=rtb#730392475443 Retrieved July 26, 2020 Monday Early life and education Born in Failsworth, Lancashire, the son of a father who was a joiner and a mother who was an accounts office worker, Ratcliffe lived there in a council house until the age of 10. His father eventually ran a factory making laboratory furniture. Aged 10, he moved with his family to East Yorkshire, and Ratcliffe attended Beverley Grammar School and lived in Hull up to the age of 18. Ratcliffe graduated from the University of Birmingham with a degree in chemical engineering in 1974. Career His first job was with oil giant Esso, but he decided to broaden his skills into finance by studying management accounting, taking an MSc in finance at London Business School from 1978 to 1980 (he donated £25m to the school in 2016). In 1989, he joined US private equity group Advent International. Ineos Ratcliffe was a co-founder of Inspec, which leased the former BP Chemicals site in Antwerp, Belgium. In 1998 Ratcliffe formed Ineos in Hampshire to buy-out Inspec and the freehold of the Antwerp site. From this small base, using high-yield debt to finance deals, Ratcliffe started buying unwanted operations from groups such as ICI and BP, selecting targets based on their potential to double their earnings over a five-year period. In 2006 Ineos bought BP's refining and petrochemical arm Innovene, giving Ineos refineries and plants in Scotland, Italy, Germany, France, Belgium and Canada. In April 2010, Ratcliffe moved Ineos's head office from Hampshire to Rolle, Switzerland, decreasing the amount of tax the company paid by £100m a year. In 2015, Ratcliffe opened the UK headquarters of the chemicals and energy group in Knightsbridge, London, along with gas and oil trading, and other functions, saying he was \\"very cheerful about coming back to the UK”. He was pleased with UK policy, London as a business base, and untroubled by the prospect of Brexit. Full year 2015 EBITDA was €577 million compared to €253 million for 2014. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2018 he was named as the richest man in the UK, with a net worth of £21.05 billion. In February 2019 it was announced that Ineos would invest £1bn in the UK oil and chemical industries, to include an overhaul of the Forties pipeline system that is responsible for transporting a significant percentage of the UK's North Sea oil and gas. On 1 May 2019, Ratcliffe criticised the current government rules which say fracking in Britain must be suspended every time a 0.5 magnitude tremor is detected, which has led to a de facto ban on fracking. He said: \\"I think the government has been pathetic on the subject\\". Sports ownership and sponsorship On 13 November 2017, Ratcliffe became the owner of FC Lausanne-Sport, a Swiss Super League football club. In 2018, Ratcliffe partnered with Ben Ainslie to form Ineos Team UK to compete for the 36th America's Cup in 2021. Ratcliffe is reportedly investing over £110 million in the project. On 19 March 2019, Ratcliffe purchased the Team Sky cycling franchise, subsequently rebranded Team Ineos. Their first competitive race under the new Ineos sponsorship, was the 2019 Tour de Yorkshire. They subsequently won the 2019 Tour de France with the Colombian rider Egan Bernal. On 22 August 2019, the French competition authority permitted the €100 million takeover of Ligue 1 club OGC Nice from Chinese-American entrepreneur Chien Lee by Ineos. Ratcliffe supported the October 2019 Ineos 1:59 Challenge, a successful effort by Eliud Kipchoge to run the classic marathon distance (42.195 kilometres or 26 miles 385 yards) under 2 hours. In February 2020, Ineos became principal partners of Mercedes AMG F1, signing a five-year agreement with the team. In the same month, Ratcliffe rejected claims that he would buy a Premier League club, having previously been linked to Chelsea.  Environmental pollution  In March 2019 Ineos said it would close its Middlesbrough manufacturing plant unless it is allowed to ‘defer compliance’ with EU rules designed to prevent air and water pollution. An analysis of data from the Environment Agency (EA) also reveals the plant clocked up 176 permit violations between 2014 and 2017. An EA spokesperson said: “air emissions are well over legal limits and this poses a risk to the environment”. INEOS director Tom Crotty said the firm “cannot justify” the investment required to comply with EU air and water pollution rules due to come into force in the coming years. Ineos has carried out small projects in bio ethanol production using Clostridium bacteria, but it has had problems because the syngas has levels of hydrogen cyanide too high for the bacteria to survive. Ineos sold the Florida plant to Alliance Bio-Products Inc. in 2017. Honours and awards In May 2009, Ratcliffe was granted an honorary fellowship by the Institution of Chemical Engineers citing “his sustained leadership in building the Ineos Group.” In 2013 he received the Petrochemical Heritage Award. Ratcliffe was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to business and to investment. Personal life In 1985, Ratcliffe married Amanda Townson; they have two sons, George and Samuel. They divorced in 1995. He has one daughter with his current partner, Maria Alessia Maresca, an Italian tax lawyer. Ratcliffe lives in Monaco and Hampshire, England. In May 2017, he submitted his fifth plan, less ambitious than the first four, to build a \\"luxury home\\" at Thorns Beach, near Beaulieu, on the Hampshire coast, which would replace an existing two-bedroom bungalow. In September 2020, Ratcliffe officially changed his tax residence from Hampshire to Monaco, a move that it is estimated will save him £4 billion in tax. Ratcliffe enjoys physical adventure and has made expeditions to the North and South Poles, as well as a three-month-long motorbike trek in South Africa, and has founded a charity \\"Go Run for Fun\\", encouraging thousands of children aged between five and ten to get active by creating celebrity-driven events. Ratcliffe is reported to have completed the 2007 London Marathon.The alchemist\\" University of Birmingham, Innes Lecture of Chemical Engineering 2007 Nov. Ratcliffe is a eurosceptic and has stated that, \\"As a business, Ineos supported the common market, but not a United States of Europe.\\" He is opposed to the \\"layers and layers\\" of European legislation which he feels is making European economies increasingly cumbersome and inefficient. He has publicly expressed his disdain for politicians, criticising them for the way they negotiated the Brexit withdrawal agreement and are often happy to \\"lunch around with bankers\\", but less keen to discuss economic issues with industrialists and business owners. Ratcliffe has owned two super yachts, Hampshire and Hampshire II. His first yacht was built as Barbara Jean by Feadship. In 2012 he took delivery of the Feadship Hampshire II, built by Royal van Lent, which he still owns.

TELC derives its legal authority from the Tennessee Education Lottery Implementation Law, which the General Assembly passed in accordance with a November 2002 amendment to the state constitution establishing the lottery and approved by 58 percent of the voters. The TELC is responsible for the operation of a lottery, and is deemed to be acting in all respects for the benefit of the people of Tennessee. It is a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL); it participates in the Mega Millions and Powerball games. The TELC sold its first ticket on January 20, 2004.Chronology, Tennessee Lottery website On July 28, 2007, Tennessee switched from ball drawings to those using a random number generator (RNG). However, Powerball (which moved its drawings from MUSL's Iowa headquarters to Florida in 2009) continues to be ball-drawn; likewise, Mega Millions is ball- drawn in Atlanta, with the Megaplier RNG selection conducted in Texas, as California does not have the Megaplier option. Tennessee began its third multi-jurisdictional jackpot game, Hot Lotto, on May 12, 2013; it is the game's 16th member. On that date, Hot Lotto changed its double matrix and how the jackpot is to be advertised. Tennessee also has an in-state jackpot game, Tennessee Cash, which replaced Pick 5 in October 2010. People must be at least 18 years of age to purchase or redeem TELC tickets; only cash can be used to purchase lottery tickets. Current games In-house draw games Cash 3 Cash 3 is drawn thrice daily, except once on Sundays. It draws 3 digits, each 0 through 9. Prices, prizes, and options vary. Cash 4 Cash 4 also is drawn 19 times weekly; it draws a four-digit number in the same fashion as Cash 3. Tennessee Cash Tennessee Cash is drawn Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. It draws six numbers in the style of Mega Millions and Powerball. The top prize increases (e.g., a jackpot) if there is no top prize winner. Multi-jurisdictional games Cash4Life The Tennessee lottery joined Cash4Life on November 1, 2015; it is also offered in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Players choose 5 of 60 numbers in one field, and 1 of 4 green \\"Cash Ball\\" numbers in the second field. Live drawings are held on Monday and Thursday evenings at 9pm Eastern Time on Livestream.

It is the only blue species of the genus Poecilotheria. Like others in its genus it exhibits an intricate fractal-like pattern on the abdomen. The species' natural habitat is deciduous forest in Andhra Pradesh, in central southern India. It has been classified as Critically endangered by the IUCN. Description Poecilotheria metallica has similar intricate geometric body coloration as other Poecilotheria species, but it is the only species in the genus to be covered in blue hair. While it is young, P. metallica is less chromatic, the coloring turns to blue as it matures. This blue is much less significant in the mature males. Males also have more slender bodies, and their legs are longer. The definitive trait of a mature male are the revelation of emboli at the end of their pedipalps following their \\"mature molt.\\" Females can be determined through molt confirmations before maturity. When full size, the leg span of P. metallica is . Distribution Poecilotheria metallica is found only in a small area of less than , a reserve forest that is nonetheless highly disturbed. Surveys of adjacent forest have failed to observe this species. The type specimen was discovered in a railway timber yard in Gooty about 100 km southwest of its known range, but it is believed to have been transported there by train. Behavior Poecilotheria metallica's behavior parallels that of many arboreal spiders. In the wild, P. metallica lives in holes of tall trees where it makes asymmetric funnel webs. The primary prey consists of various flying insects. Spiders of this genus may live communally when territory, i.e. the number of holes per tree, is limited. The species is skittish and will try to flee first, and will also flee when light shines upon it, as it is a photosensitive species. Under provocation, however, members of the species may bite. Longevity Females typically live for 11 to 12 years, or, in rare instances, for up to 15 years. Males live for 3 to 4 years. Venom There has never been a recorded human death from its bite. However, P. metallica's bite is considered medically significant, with venom that may cause intense pain, judging from the experience of keepers bitten by other spiders in the genus. The vast majority are \\"dry bites,\\" where no venom is injected into the handler. The mechanical effects of the bite can still be worrisome, as an adult's fangs can reach nearly 3/4 of an inch in length. P. metallica can move rapidly and may defend itself when cornered. Venom may produce a heart-rate increase followed by sweating, headache, stinging, cramping, or swelling. Effects can last for up to a week. However in extreme bites from the genus Poecilotheria, effects may still be felt months later. Coloration As with other tarantulas with blue hair, the vivid colors of P. metallica are produced by quasi-periodic perforated multilayer nanostructures. Structural colours are usually highly iridescent, changing color when viewed from different angles. Some species of blue tarantulas have hairs with a \\"special flower-like\\" structure which may reduce iridescence. Given that many tarantulas express nearly a full suite of opsins found in other colourful spiders with colour vision, blue colors could potentially function in mate-choice or contests for mates. Common names P. metallica is also known as the Gooty sapphire ornamental tree spider, Gooty sapphire, and Gooty tarantula. Other common names are metallic tarantula, peacock parachute spider, or peacock tarantula. As pets P. metallica has been bred in captivity for ten years and is popular with tarantula enthusiasts. It sometimes priced above $500 in the United States, but as a spiderling is typically between $100 and $200. As with most tarantulas, the spider's sex can influence price - females generally being more expensive because of their longer life. Members of the species are hardy, relatively fast-growing spiders that are generally fed crickets, but may also eat moths, grasshoppers and cockroaches. P. metallica measures between in legspan when fully grown. In captivity, humid environments with temperatures between and a humidity level of 75 to 85% are preferred. Poecilotheria metallica juvenile This is a very fast, sometimes defensive tarantula that has the potential for medically significant venom. Conservation P. metallica is classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its occurrence in a single, small area in which habitat is rapidly degrading due to logging and firewood harvesting. Another threat identified by IUCN assessors is specimen collection for the pet trade. Population size is unknown, but the combination of its small natural range and the habitat threats indicate a declining population trend.

Description The fera is a species of freshwater whitefish that reached a length between 35 and 40 centimetres. It is a member of the common whitefish complex (Coregonus lavaretus sensu lato). The identity of the fera is disputed. In 1950 Emile Dottrens described Coregonus fera as native to both Lake Geneva and Lake Constance. The coregonines from Lake Constance were named Sandfelchen. In 1997 Maurice Kottelat made a revision and used the name Coregonus fera for the Geneva fera and Coregonus arenicolus for theSandfelchen. The common name fera is still also used for fish that continue to live in Lake Geneva, but it now refers to the introduced Coregonus palaea.Maurice Kottelat & Jörg Freyhof (2008) Coregonus fera. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species v. 2015-4 Biology The true fera was a benthopelagic freshwater fish that swam in the water column near the lake bottom, feeding upon zooplankton. Spawning occurred from February to mid-March. Extinction Together with the similarly extinct gravenche (Coregonus hiemalis), the fera was one of the most caught freshwater fishes in Lake Geneva. In 1890 these two fishes constituted 68% of the total captures in the lake. Due to a combination of overexploitation and heavy hybridisation with introduced Coregonus species, it became extremely scarce and was last seen in Lake Geneva in 1920.Christian Trépey: Corégone (Féra - Palée) www.plongee-passion.ch References * Maurice Kottelat: European Freshwater Fishes.

History Early history (1895–1955) Mississippi State (then known as the Mississippi A&M; Aggies) first fielded a football team in 1895. The team was coached by W. M. Matthews. During his one-season tenure, Matthews posted an overall record of zero wins and two losses (0–2). He is also credited with the selection of what became the official school colors, maroon and white, prior to the Aggies first game ever played at Union University. Dan Martin, coach 1903–06 Daniel S. Martin left rival Ole Miss and served as the Aggies' head football coach from 1903–1906. His final record in Starkville was 10–11–3. W. D. Chadwick led the Aggies from 1909–1913. His final record was 29–12–2. During his five-season tenure, Mississippi A&M; appeared in and won its first bowl game, the 1911 Bacardi Bowl in Havana, Cuba. Fullback Dutch Reule was selected All-Southern. The 1911 team was also referred to as 'The Bull Dogs'. Earl C. Hayes replaced Chadwick and led Mississippi A&M; to 15–8–2 record from 1914–1916. Hunter Kimball received the most votes of any All-Southern halfback in 1914. The Mississippi Legislature renamed Mississippi A&M; as \\"Mississippi State College\\" in 1925 and the mascot was changed from Aggies to Maroons in 1932. Ralph Sasse enjoyed success as Mississippi State's head football coach. After leading Mississippi State to a 20–10–2 record in three years and an appearance in the 1937 Orange Bowl, a loss, Sasse stunned the students and players by resigning from his head coach's duties, following a doctor's orders after a sudden nervous breakdown. Allyn McKeen left Memphis to become head football coach at Mississippi State, where he compiled a 65–19–3 record in ten seasons. In 1940, he was named Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year after leading Mississippi State to its only undefeated season in school history and its second Orange Bowl appearance, a victory. The following year, 1941, his Maroons squad captured the first and only Southeastern Conference championship in program history. McKeen retired from coaching in 1948 after being fired by Athletic Director Dudy Noble because of a 4–4–1 season. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1991. Mississippi State did not field a football team in 1943. Arthur Morton left VMI to become MSU's head football coach after McKeen's retirement. Morton's Maroons posted struggling records of 0–8–1, 4–5 and 4–5 for a cumulative record of 8–18–1 before Morton's firing. Murray Warmath came to Mississippi State from his post as line coach at Army and posted records of 5–4 and 5–2–3 for a cumulative two-season record of 10–6–3. Having coached only two seasons in Starkville, Warmath resigned after the 1953 season to take the job of University of Minnesota head coach. Darrell Royal came to Mississippi State from the CFL's Edmonton Eskimos and put up back-to-back 6–4 records in his two seasons as the Maroons head football coach. Royal resigned after the 1955 season to accept the head football coach position at Washington. Wade Walker era (1956–1961) Wade Walker was promoted from line coach to head coach following Royal's departure. Walker compiled a 22–32–2 record over his 6-season tenure.Charles \\"Bud\\" Wilkinson (PDF), College Football Historical Society Newsletter, Vol. VII, No. II, August 1994.Wade Walker Records by Year , College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved June 17, 2009. In 1958 the Legislature renamed the university as Mississippi State University. The Mississippi State Maroons posted a lackluster 2–7–1 record in 1959. The following year, Walker's Maroons improved to 5–5, but students, fans and alumni demanded his ouster. University president Dean W. Colvard relented and fired Walker as football coach, but kept him on as athletic director, a post he kept until 1966.Michael B.

In 1972, having compiled a record of 16–45–2, Shira resigned as head coach to focus on his duties as athletic director.Burial to be in Starkville; Shira Funeral Services Today, Florence Times-Tri Cities Daily, January 3, 1976. Bob Tyler era (1973–1978) Bob Tyler was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach of the Bulldogs football team after Shira's resignation. Tyler led Mississippi State to a 9–3 season and a victory in the 1974 Sun Bowl over North Carolina. During that season, his team beat perennial powerhouses, Georgia and LSU. The Bulldogs' record was 6–4–1 in 1975, and it was an impressive 9–2 in 1976, ending the season ranked #20 in the AP Poll. His team compiled a 5–6 record in 1977, and he went 6–5 in his final season with the Bulldogs. Mississippi State was placed on probation by the NCAA prior to the 1975 season due to alleged improper benefits to student athletes. The school sought and won court approval to play in an adverse legal opinion to the NCAA. Although the alleged infraction was trivial, the NCAA forced the school to forfeit most games it won in 1975, 1976, and 1977. Emory Bellard era (1979–1985) Emory Bellard, who had resigned as head coach of Texas A&M; during the 1978 season after only six games, was hired to serve as head football coach at Mississippi State beginning with the next (1979) season. He was head coach from 1979 until 1985. He was considered to have had one of the most innovative offensive minds in football and is credited for inventing the wishbone formation. Bellard spent seven seasons as head coach at MSU. His best years as the Bulldogs head coach were in 1980 and 1981, when his team finished 9–3 and 8–4, respectively. Also, Bellard was the coach when Mississippi State defeated number 1, undefeated Alabama 6–3 in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1980. However, the Bulldogs significantly regressed after 1981. In the next five seasons, he only won a total of five games in SEC play. Before the 1985 season, Bellard boldly predicted that the Bulldogs would rebound and win their first SEC title since 1941. They not only failed to do so, but went winless in SEC play. Bellard was fired after the season. He would, however, return in 1988 to coach at the high school level in Texas. Rockey Felker era (1986–1990) Rockey Felker returned to his alma mater, which was coming off four consecutive losing seasons, from his post as wide receivers coach at Alabama. At 33, Felker was the youngest coach in the country and the first Mississippi State coach in 30 years to start his career as MSU head football coach with a winning record (6–5). However, the Bulldogs never recovered from four consecutive blowout losses at the end of the 1986 season, during which they scored a total of nine points, including a 24-3 loss to Ole Miss. Felker suffered through four losing seasons (4–7, 1–10, 5–6, 5–6) between 1987 and 1990, and only won a total of five games in SEC play. He was only 1-4 vs. Ole Miss. He resigned under pressure at the end of the 1990 season, but would be brought back by his successor, Jackie Sherrill, as running backs coach for two seasons and in a non-coaching position in the football program, where he serves to this day. Jackie Sherrill era (1991–2003) After three years away from the game, former Washington State, Pittsburgh and Texas A&M; head football coach Jackie Sherrill was hired as head football coach at Mississippi State in 1991. He took over a program that hadn't had a winning season since 1986 (and had won a total of 14 games in that stretch) and hadn't had a winning record in Southeastern Conference play since 1981. Sherrill began his Mississippi State career with an upset victory over a familiar foe from his A&M; days, the Texas Longhorns (who were the defending Southwest Conference champions). In thirteen seasons in Starkville, Sherrill coached the Bulldogs to a record of 75–75–2. His 75 wins are the most in school history. He led the team to an SEC West title in 1998, and a berth in the Cotton Bowl Classic. A year later, he notched a 10–2 record and #12 final ranking. That #12 ranking was the highest final ranking achieved by any NCAA Division I-A school in Mississippi in over 30 years. Sherrill, along with Bill Snyder of Kansas State, were among the first to use the rich JUCO systems of their respective states to help their programs progress. Although Sherrill won only eight games in his last three seasons, he built Mississippi State into a consistent winner despite playing in the same division as powerhouses like Alabama, Auburn and LSU. He also finished with a winning record against in-state rival Ole Miss (7–6). Under Sherrill, the Bulldogs went to six bowl games; before his arrival they'd only been to seven bowls in 96 years of play. Sherrill also achieved notoriety by having his team observe the castration of a bull as a motivational technique prior to a game versus Texas. Unranked Mississippi State subsequently beat the #13 ranked Longhorns. Sherrill retired after the 2003 season, which was followed by the NCAA levying probation for four years on the program.Mississippi State penalized for violations in football Despite a prolonged 3-year investigation by the NCAA, Mississippi State was not found guilty of any major violations, and Sherrill was never personally found guilty of any NCAA rules violations at either Mississippi State or Texas A&M.; Sylvester Croom era (2004–2008) Coach Croom Sylvester Croom, a longtime assistant in the NFL, was hired to replace Sherrill. Croom is a significant figure, because he is not only the first African American head football coach in Mississippi State history, but also in SEC football history. When Croom was hired at Mississippi State, he inherited a program that was riddled with NCAA sanctions and had not won consistently since the 1990s. Croom led the Bulldogs to a 3–8 (2–6 SEC) record in 2004. State began the season with a victory over Tulane, then lost five straight, to No. 18 Auburn, Maine, No. 13 LSU, Vanderbilt and UAB. The next week, State upset No. 20 Florida in what turned out to be the game that got Florida head coach Ron Zook fired. The next game saw State beat Kentucky. State then lost their final three games of the season to Alabama, Arkansas and Ole Miss. In 2005, State again finished 3–8. After defeating Murray State in the season opener, State lost to Auburn then beat Tulane in Shreveport, Louisiana. State then lost seven consecutive games, starting with No. 7 Georgia, then No. 4 LSU, No. 13 Florida, Houston, Kentucky, No. 4 Alabama and Arkansas. State defeated Ole Miss in the Egg Bowl to finish the season. Mississippi State struggled to a 3–9 record in 2006. State lost its first three games of the season to South Carolina, No. 4 Auburn, Tulane, State beat UAB to get its first win of the year in the fourth game. Losses to No 9 LSU and No. 4 West Virginia followed, then State defeated Jacksonville State to snap the two-game skid. State then lost to Georgia and Kentucky. MSST then upset Alabama in Alabama before losing to No. 5 Arkansas and Ole Miss. During the 2007 season, during which his team won eight games, including the Liberty Bowl, Croom garnered Coach of the Year awards from three organizations. On December 4, 2007, Croom was named coach of the year by the American Football Coaches Association for region two. The AFCA has five regional coaches of the year and announces a national coach of the year each January. That same year, on December 5, Croom was named SEC Coach of the Year twice, once as voted by the other SEC coaches and once as voted by The Associated Press. It was the first time a Mississippi State coach received the AP honor since Charley Shira in 1970 and the first time a Mississippi State coach received the coaches award since Wade Walker in 1957. After a 4–8 record in 2008, culminating with a 45–0 loss to rival #25 Ole Miss, Croom was asked by school officials to resign as head coach of the Bulldogs. Dan Mullen era (2009–2017) Florida offensive coordinator Dan Mullen was hired as Mississippi State's head coach in late 2008. Mullen arrived in Starkville with an explosive offensive background and a reputation as a quarterback guru, having tutored Alex Smith, Chris Leak and Tim Tebow during his career as an assistant coach. Serving under head coach Urban Meyer, Mullen oversaw an offense at Florida that was one of the most explosive in the country, helped the Gators capture the 2006 and 2008 national championships and sent many players into the National Football League. In Mullen's first season, the Bulldogs finished 5–7, ending upbeat with a 41–27 victory over #20 Ole Miss in the Egg Bowl. In 2010, they started 1–2, and then they had a 6-game winning streak to make their record 7–2 before losing to Alabama and Arkansas, but defeated Ole Miss. The team participated in a bowl game for the first time since 2007, soundly defeating Michigan in the Gator Bowl 52–14. In 2011, the Bulldogs entered the season ranked #19 in the country, and they started 1–0, before losing to the defending national champion Auburn 41–34. Mississippi State entered the Ole Miss game in Starkville needing a win to qualify for a bowl bid for a second straight season. The Bulldogs won 31–3, earning Mullen the distinction as the first coach to beat Ole Miss in his first three tries since Allyn McKeen in 1941. The Bulldogs capped off the season with a Music City Bowl win over Wake Forest in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2012, Mississippi State defeated Tennessee 41–31 in their sixth game of the season to become bowl eligible. After a 7–0 start the team won only one of its remaining five games to finish 8–5, including a 41-24 loss at Ole Miss and a 34-20 loss to the #21 Northwestern in the Gator Bowl. This was the first time Mississippi State appeared in a bowl three straight years since 2000. In 2013, MSST under Mullen became bowl eligible for the fourth consecutive year following a 17-10 overtime win over Ole Miss. MSST defeated Rice in the Liberty Bowl December 31, 2013 in Memphis, Tennessee, by a score of 44–7. It was MSST's third bowl win in the last four years. 2014 turned out to be the most historic run for the team. Led by quarterback Dak Prescott, the Bulldogs reached a #1 national ranking for the first time ever, doing so in both the Amway Coaches Poll and the AP Poll, after beating 3 consecutive top-10 teams (#7 LSU Tigers, #6 Texas A&M; Aggies, and #2 Auburn Tigers). As a result, the Bulldogs became the fastest team in AP Poll's history to reach the #1 ranking, from being unranked, in only 5 weeks. They also became the first team to be ranked #1 in the new FBS Playoff Football Poll and held the top ranking for the first three weeks of the poll before losing to Alabama. However, at the end of the season, only one of the three teams remained ranked. Auburn finished 8–5 (4–4 SEC) and ranked #22, and lost to Wisconsin in the Outback Bowl, Texas A&M; finished 7-5 (3-5 SEC) and beat West Virginia in the Liberty Bowl, and LSU, finished 8-4 (4-4 SEC) and lost to Notre Dame in the Music City Bowl. The Bulldogs couldn't sustain that momentum, and lost two of their last three regular season games, first to #5 Alabama 25–20 and then two weeks later to #18 Ole Miss 31–17. That loss knocked the Bulldogs out of playoff contention, leaving them 10–2 and ranked #7 by the College Football Playoff Committee in their final rankings. As a result, they were awarded a trip to the Orange Bowl against #10 Georgia Tech on December 31, 2014. Thanks to the Bulldogs’ inability to stop Georgia Tech’s heavy use of the triple option, State lost that contest 49-34. Mississippi State finished the season 10–3 and were ranked #11 in the final AP Poll. In 2015, the Bulldogs went 4–4 in the SEC and finished the regular season with an 8–4 record and went on to play in the 2015 Belk Bowl against the NC State Wolfpack, winning 51-28. Dak Prescott was named the game MVP after throwing 4 touchdowns. 2016 saw the Bulldogs stumble to a 5–7 regular season record. The season included 3 losses on the final play of games against South Alabama, BYU, and Kentucky. The Bulldogs were able to finish the season on a high note defeating in-state rival Ole Miss 55-20 in the 2016 Egg Bowl. Due to a shortage of 6-win teams and MSU's Academic Progress Rate, they made their seventh consecutive bowl appearance in the St. Petersburg Bowl against Miami (OH) on December 26. The Bulldogs won the game thanks to a blocked extra point and a blocked field goal, edging Miami (Ohio) 17-16. On February 27, 2017, Mississippi State athletic director John Cohen announced a four-year contract extension for Coach Mullen through February 2021. In November 2017, after an 8-4 season, Dan Mullen left Mississippi State University to become the head coach at the University of Florida. Joe Moorhead era (2018–2019) After Dan Mullen’s departure, Mississippi State hired Penn State offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead as the program's 33rd head coach. Moorhead arrived in Starkville with a reputation as an outstanding offensive mind, turning around a struggling FCS program in Fordham as the head coach before moving to Penn State as offensive coordinator where his offenses set school records. The Mississippi State University administration signed Moorhead to a four-year contract worth a total of $11 million in base salary. On January 3, 2020, after failing to energize the offense, and several off field issues, Mississippi State announced Moorhead's firing. Mike Leach era (2020–) On January 9, 2020, Mississippi State athletic director John Cohen announced the hiring of then-Washington State and former-Texas Tech head coach Mike Leach to the vacant head coaching position.

At the end of the regular season, both MSU and Arkansas finished with 6–2 conference records, but by virtue of MSU's head-to-head win over Arkansas, MSU earned the right to represent the SEC West in the SEC Championship Game. In that game, MSU led eventual national champion Tennessee in the fourth quarter before falling 14–24 in the Georgia Dome. They continued on to play in the Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas, Texas, against the 20th-ranked Texas Longhorns. The Bulldogs lost the game 11–38 on 24 unanswered Longhorn points in the 3rd quarter. { - -  1998†  SEC West  Jackie Sherrill  Tennessee  L 14–24 - } † Co- champions Bowl games Mississippi State has played in 23 bowl games, compiling a record of 13–10, highlighted by wins in the 1941 Orange Bowl, the 1963 Liberty Bowl, the 1999 Peach Bowl, and the 2011 Gator Bowl.2014 Mississippi State Football Orange Bowl Media Guide Mississippi State's first bowl game was against the Havana Athletic Club in the Bacardi Bowl on January 1, 1912 in Havana, Cuba.

It was first played in 1901 and has been played every year since 1915 (with the exception of the 1943 season when neither school fielded teams due to World War II) making it the tenth longest uninterrupted series in the United States. The game became \\"The Battle for the Golden Egg\\" in 1927 when a traveling trophy was added. Although through the years the game has been played primarily in 3 locations Starkville (38 times), Oxford (36 times), and Jackson (29 times); there have been a few meetings in other locations including Tupelo 3 times, Greenwood twice, Clarksdale once, and Columbus once. Through 2019, in total the two squads have met on the gridiron 116 times with Ole Miss holding a 62–46–6 lead in the series. LSU The LSU–Mississippi State rivalry is an annual football game between the Louisiana State Tigers and Mississippi State University Bulldogs. Both universities are founding members of the Southeastern Conference, as well as the Western Division. This rivalry is LSU's longest rivalry with 108 meetings. Mississippi State's 34–29 victory on September 20, 2014 was the Bulldogs' first over LSU since 1999, their first in Baton Rouge since 1991, and just their fourth overall since 1985. The 1976 game was won on the field by Mississippi State but later deemed by the NCAA to have been forfeited, therefore lost, by the bulldogs. Alabama The Alabama–Mississippi State rivalry, sometimes referred to as the 90 Mile Drive or the Battle for Highway 82, is an annual football game between the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and Mississippi State University Bulldogs. Both universities are founding members of the Southeastern Conference, as well as the Western Division. The two campuses are located approximately 90 miles apart, and are the closest SEC schools in terms of distance. Entering its 97th meeting as of the 2012 football season, Alabama-Mississippi State is one of the SEC's longest-running series, dating back to 1896.

Despite decades of attempts by opponents and authorities to banish it from scenes of competition,Shug Jordan: 'The cowbells have no place in football': The War Eagle Reader diehard State fans still celebrate Bulldog victories loudly and proudly with the distinctive sound of ringing cowbells. The precise origin of the cowbell as a fixture of Mississippi State sports tradition remains unclear to this day. The best records have cowbells gradually introduced to the MSU sports scene in the late 1930s and early 1940s, coinciding with the 'golden age' of Mississippi State football success prior to World War II. The most popular legend is that during a home football game between State and arch-rival Ole Miss, a jersey cow wandered onto the playing field. Mississippi State soundly whipped the Rebels that Saturday, and State College students immediately adopted the cow as a good luck charm. Students are said to have continued bringing a cow to football games for a while, until the practice was eventually discontinued in favor of bringing just the cow's bell. Whatever the origin, it is certain that by the 1950s cowbells were common at Mississippi State games, and by the 1960s were established as the special symbol of Mississippi State. Ironically, the cowbell's popularity grew most rapidly during the long years when State football teams were rarely successful. Flaunting this anachronism from the 'aggie' days was a proud response by students and alumni to outsider scorn of the university's 'cow college' history. In the 1960s two MSU professors, Earl W. Terrell and Ralph L. Reeves obliged some students by welding handles on the bells to they could be rung with much more convenience and authority. By 1963 the demand for these long-handled cowbells could not be filled by home workshops alone, so at the suggestion of Reeves the Student Association bought bells in bulk and the Industrial Education Club agreed to weld on handles. In 1964 the MSU Bookstore began marketing these cowbells with a portion of the profits returning to these student organizations. Today many styles of cowbells are available on campus and around Starkville, with the top-of-the-line a heavy chrome-plated model with a full Bulldog figurine handle. But experts insist the best and loudest results are produced by a classic long-handled, bicycle-grip bell made of thinner and tightly-welded shells. Cowbells decorate offices and homes of Mississippi State alumni, and are passed down through generations of Bulldog fans. In early 1975, the SEC adopted a rule against artificial noisemakers that made it illegal to ring a cowbell during games; an official complaint by Auburn coach Shug Jordan, whose disapproval of the tradition went back several years, after the Tigers narrow 1974 win over the Bulldogs was largely responsible for the decision.Shug Jordan: ‘The cowbells have no place in football’: The War Eagle Reader At one point during the game, Jordan instructed his quarterback not to run a play in protest of officials refusing to quiet the crowd. Jordan's dislike for the cowbells inspired Alabama to attempt to purchase 1,000 cowbells from Mississippi State for Alabama fans to take to the Iron Bowl; MSU declined the offer. University of Texas fans also attempted to annoy Jordan with cowbells during the 1974 Gator Bowl. Shortly after the ban was enacted, Mississippi State officials considered other items and devices to replace the cowbells. In 1981, a Mississippi State faculty member filed a suit against Auburn University and the Southeastern Conference that sought to have the rule declared unconstitutional after his cowbell was confiscated at the 1981 AU-MSU game at Jordan–Hare Stadium.Mississippi State fan sues Auburn, SEC over confiscated cowbell; calls rule ‘unconstitutional’: The War Eagle Reader Despite creative efforts by MSU fans to circumvent the ruling and continue the tradition, the ban was in effect until 2010. That spring, the 12 schools of the SEC agreed to a compromise on artificial noisemakers, acknowledging the role cowbells play in the history of Mississippi State University by amending the conference by-law. In the fall of 2010, on a one-year trial with specified restrictions, cowbells were permitted in Davis Wade Stadium for the first time in 36 years. And due to MSU fans' notable adherence to the rules outlined by the league, cowbells will continue to be allowed with similar restrictions in place. In 2012, the rule was made permanent by the SEC. Maroon and white Maroon and White are the distinctive colors of Mississippi State University athletic teams, dating back over a century to the very first football game ever played by the school's student-athletes. On November 15, 1895, the first Mississippi A&M; football team was preparing for a road trip to Jackson, Tennessee., to play Southern Baptist University (now called Union University) the following day. Since every college was supposed to have its own uniform colors, the A&M; student body requested that the school's team select a suitable combination. Considering making this choice an honor, the inaugural State team gave the privilege to team captain W.M. Matthews. Accounts report that without hesitation Matthews chose Maroon and White.

It was originally known as King of Prussia after the nearby public house, and later as Eskdale Green. The Eskdale Green name has continued in popular use, and was still in official use in 2017 (as it was in previous years) in the railway's \\"full\\" timetable of intermediate stopping places Available on request from the railway. The station is located about from Ravenglass and just over from Dalegarth. The station is manned during the summer months, when volunteers are available. There is a booking office inside the shelter building. There is no passing loop, and only simple one-train operations are possible. History Originally the site of a siding used as a passing place for trains, in 1876 the first station was built, consisting of a small waiting shelter. This survived the re-gauging of 1915, and continued until the 1930s. In the early 1960s, the siding was removed and in 1965 construction of a new station building and platform commenced. The work was carried out by the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway Preservation Society West Yorkshire Group, and was completed by 1968. The station remains largely in its 1968 condition, although a toilet was added around 1990, in order to improve facilities for volunteer staff and passengers.See reference at RERPS website. Present Day In high season, when the station is most-likely to be manned, trains pass at 40-minute intervals in each direction. Trains generally take 25 minutes to reach Ravenglass, and 15 minutes to reach Dalegarth. The station has an internal telephone link to other stations, and the railway control centre, and is connected to mains electricity. Buildings in use include a waiting shelter, booking office, and toilet. There is a very limited amount of car parking available. No real-time running information is provided. The station is linked by various public footpaths and bridleways to Irton Road, Ravenglass, , Eskdale Green, and Muncaster Fell.Walks to and around the station described at Walking Britain. The King George IV pub and Giggle Alley Japanese Gardens are within easy walking distance along a public road.Details at Visit Cumbria website. Future Developments The preservation society is considering a project to redevelop the current station building, providing better facilities for the station master and for passengers. The proposal would incorporate a partially under cover picnic area. Funding for the proposed development would be taken from a large legacy left to the preservation society by one of its former members. Accessibility Wheelchair users are able to join trains here, but prior notice must be given to the railway before the day of travel. Wheelchair users may alight at this station, if they have informed the guard in advance.

It is operated by the Texas Lottery Commission, headquartered in downtown Austin, Texas. History House Bill 54 was introduced for a state lottery on July 11, 1991. The voters of Texas approved an amendment to the Texas Constitution November 5, 1991 authorizing lottery sales in Texas. The Texas Lottery Commission created an unusual contest for the Lottery logo: designs from a contracted advertising agency were pitted against designs from the general public. One logo from each source was placed in head to head competition, and the winning logo, a cowboy hat thrown high in celebration (still in current use) was the public design. The winner was Susan Holten, from Carrollton. The lottery's first game was the scratch game Lone Star Millions, with the first ticket sold to then Gov. Ann Richards \\"at Polk's Feed Store in Oak Hill\\" on May 29, 1992. First-day sales of 23.2 million tickets sets a then-world record. First-week sales ending June 5 set another world record, with over 102 million tickets. Lotto Texas began sales on November 7, 1992, with the first drawing on November 14 and the first jackpot won by a resident of Schulenburg on November 28. The Texas Lottery Commission was formed via legislation in 1993 to take over management of the Lottery from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts; the legislation also gives the Commission oversight of charitable bingo games (moving that duty from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission). By November 1993, Texas Lottery sales would exceed $1 billion, breaking a record set by the Florida Lottery in 1989. Texas joined the Mega Millions consortium in 2003, with sales beginning December 3 and the first drawing to include Texas on December 5. Though no Texas ticket won the jackpot, one Texas-bought ticket matched the first five numbers for $175,000. The first Texas jackpot winner of Mega Millions was not until the drawing of October 4, 2004; a Carrollton player took home the $101 million (annuity value) prize. As part of the cross-selling arrangement between the operators of Mega Millions and Powerball, the Texas Lottery Commission agreed to begin selling Powerball tickets on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was three days later. On April 23, 2013, the House voted not to recommission the Texas Lottery Commission, which would have potentially brought an end to the lottery in Texas. Later in the day, the House reversed course with a new vote on the bill. Joan R. Ginther became a four-time winner of prizes over $1 million from 1993 to 2010, first from Lotto Texas and subsequently three times from scratch tickets. All of her winning tickets were purchased in Texas, and two of them were bought from the same convenience store in Bishop. Revenue allocation In the 2018 fiscal year, lottery revenue was allocated as follows. * 65.1 percent is paid out in prizes. * 25.5 percent is paid to the Foundation School Fund, which is administered by the Texas Education Agency to support public education in Texas. * 5.4 percent is paid to retailers as commissions. * 3.7 percent is retained to cover administration costs. * 0.3 percent is transferred to the Texas Legislature for allocation. Since 2009 this money has gone to the Texas Fund for Veterans Assistance and other state programs. This revenue includes that from unclaimed prizes and from sales of scratch ticket games such as Veterans Cash. Prior to the 2018 fiscal year, the Texas Lottery Commission paid retailers a bonus for selling top-prize tickets for in-house draw games and for scratch tickets winning $1 million or higher. This program has been discontinued as of September 1, 2018. General rules As with most US lotteries, players must be at least 18 years of age. Winning tickets must be claimed within 180 days or the prize is forfeited. For scratch tickets, the time limit begins when a game is closed by the Commission; for drawings the time limit begins the date of the drawing. Within Texas, players must choose the cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when purchasing Powerball, Mega Millions, and/or Lotto Texas tickets when playing, instead of after winning (see below). Current games Scratch tickets The Texas Lottery began operations on May 29, 1992 with sales of Lone Star Millions. By the game's end on February 1, 2004, it set a world record for first-day sales (23.2 million tickets) and first-week sales (102.4 million tickets), There were 6 prizes of $1 million (annuity-only) and 479 of $10,000 each. Scratch tickets, most changing frequently, cost $1 to $50 each. The Texas Lottery is the only U.S. lottery to offer $50 scratch-off tickets. Prizes have included not only cash (from $1 to the millions), and free tickets (which can be used to purchase any Texas drawing game), but also trucks, tickets to sports events, and tours of Cowboys Stadium. In-house drawings Lotto Texas Lotto Texas was the first Texas in-house drawing game offered, with sales beginning on November 7, 1992; its first drawing on November 14, 1992, and the first jackpot won on November 28, 1992. By its first anniversary, the Texas Lottery sold over $1 billion in tickets. Initially sold as an annuity-only game (no cash option), the purchaser having to pick numbers, and the drawings held only on Saturdays, Lotto Texas later added the \\"Quick Pick\\" option (random selection of numbers, added on May 29, 1993, the Lottery's first anniversary), the \\"Cash Value\\" option (CVO), and changed the drawings to twice weekly, adding Wednesdays. Among notable winners was Thomas \\"Hollywood\\" Henderson, the former Dallas Cowboys linebacker, who claimed a winning jackpot in excess of $14 million in 2000. The current format utilizes 54 balls drawn from a machine; players choose 6 numbers. The jackpot is paid either in 30 annual payments, or in lump sum (discussed further below). Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1, the minimum jackpot is $5 million, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Lotto Texas made the Extra! option available to players on April 14, 2013, with the first drawing to include Extra! winnings being held on April 17, 2013. The Extra! option costs $1 more per play. This gives players the chance to win $2 for matching 2 of 6 numbers. The Extra! option also adds $10 to the base prize amount for matching 3 of 6 numbers, $100 to the base prize for matching 4 of 6 numbers, and $10,000 to the base prize for matching 5 of 6 numbers. No change is made to the jackpot prize amount. {  - !Matches !Prize !Current probability of winning - 3 of 6 numbers $3 (guaranteed) 1:75 - 4 of 6 numbers $50 (estimated) 1:1,526 - 5 of 6 numbers $2,000 (estimated) 1:89,678 - All 6 numbers Jackpot 1:25,827,165 } Overall odds of winning are 1:71. Overall odds of winning are 1:7.9 with the Extra! option. Texas Two Step Texas Two Step is the other twice-weekly in-house game in Texas. Sales for Texas Two Step began on May 13, 2001. The current format utilizes a 4+1 matrix using two sets of numbers 1 through 35). Players choose five numbers; four from the first set of 35 white balls, and the fifth, Bonus Ball, from a set of 35 red balls. All payments, including the jackpot, are in lump sum. Each game is $1, the minimum jackpot is $200,000, and drawings are held at 10:12 PM on Mondays and Thursdays. {  - !Matches !Prize !Current probability of winning - Zero numbers, plus Bonus Ball $5 (guaranteed) 1:58 - 1 number, plus Bonus Ball $7 (guaranteed) 1:102 - 2 numbers, plus Bonus Ball $20 (estimated) 1:657 - 3 numbers, no Bonus Ball $20 (estimated) 1:435 - 3 numbers, plus Bonus Ball $50 1:14,779 - 4 numbers, no Bonus Ball $1,501 1:53,900 - All 4 numbers, plus Bonus Ball Jackpot 1:1,832,600 } Overall odds of winning are 1:32.4. Texas Two-Step's jackpot always is paid in lump sum; as such, it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game not to require players to choose cash or annuity when playing (see below.) All or Nothing Introduced in 2012, All or Nothing is drawn 24 times weekly, at 10:00 am, 12:27 pm, 6:00 pm, and 10:12 pm Central Time Mondays through Saturdays. Players choose (or let the lottery terminal select) 12 numbers from a field of 24. A player wins $250,000 cash if either all 12 numbers match those drawn or if none match the numbers drawn. The odds of either way of winning the top prize are the same; the first ball drawn determines whether a player must match all the numbers, or none, to win the top prize. Other prizes are $500, $50, $10, and $2; players win either by matching at least eight numbers or no more than four. Each play is $2. Each number set on an All or Nothing playslip has boxes for quick pick and for multi-draw, where a player may select to use the same numbers for up to 24 consecutive drawings. The All or Nothing concept and format has subsequently been adopted by other state lotteries. Cash Five Cash Five is a daily- draw game. Sales for this game (which replaced a similarly named game, Cash 5) began on July 29, 2002. On Sept. 23, 2018, Cash Five relaunched with a new matrix, better overall odds of winning and guaranteed prizes, including a $25,000 top prize. The first drawing with the new rules in place was on Sept. 24, 2018. The current format utilizes one set of 35 balls; players choose five numbers. All payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $1; and drawings are held at 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays. {  - !Matches !Prize Category !Prize !Current probability of winning - 2 of 5 numbers Fourth Prize Free Cash Five Quick Pick Ticket ($1 value) 1:8 - 3 of 5 numbers Third Prize $15 1:75 - 4 of 5 numbers Second Prize $350 1:2,164 - All 5 numbers First (Top) Prize $25,000* 1:324,632 } Overall odds of winning are 1:7.2 Pick 3 Pick 3 is a four times daily draw game. It began on October 25, 1993. The current format utilizes three sets of digits 0 through 9.

The prizes are guaranteed amounts, and drawings are held at 10:00 AM, 12:27 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:12 PM Central time Mondays through Saturdays. Multi- jurisdictional drawings Mega Millions In 2003, the Texas Lottery joined the Mega Millions consortium. The current format utilizes one set of 70 white balls, and a second set, of 25 yellow balls (the \\"Mega Ball\\".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the \\"Mega Ball\\" from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Tuesdays and Fridays. Texas, as in all Mega Millions jurisdictions except for California, offers an option, called Megaplier (similar to Powerball's Power Play) which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Second prize (5+0), normally $1 million, can be quintupled, to $5 million cash, if Megaplier was chosen. Powerball On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL (the operator of Powerball, the other major US lottery game) reached an agreement in principle for lotteries, at their option, to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball; the earliest date agreed on was January 31, 2010. The Texas Lottery Commission elected to participate in the agreement; on November 17, 2009 voted to publish Powerball rules for public comment. On December 14, 2009 the Commission held a public hearing, receiving comments on the proposal to join Powerball. On January 6, 2010, the Commission voted 3-0 to join Powerball. Texas sales for the game began on January 31, 2010; the first drawing including Texas was conducted three days later. The current format utilizes one set of 69 white balls, and a second set, of 26 red balls (the \\"Powerball\\".) Players choose six numbers; five white ball numbers, and the \\"Powerball” from the second set. Jackpots are paid in either 30 graduated annual payments, or in cash; see below on jackpot choices. Non-jackpot payments are in lump sum. Each game costs $2, the minimum jackpot is $40 million, and drawings are held at 10:00 PM Central time on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Former drawings Texas Triple Chance Play began on September 28, 2015. Texas Triple Chance was a $2 game. Players would select 7 numbers from 1-55 (or quick pick). In addition to that set, a player got two extra sets, both quick picks. Ten numbers were drawn. To win, a player had to match by a horizontal set. Texas Triple Chance was played Monday-Saturday at 10:12 Central time. The game was closed after the drawing on July 28, 2018. Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club (MMC) began sales on October 19, 2014; it was drawn Fridays. Plays were $5 each. Players chose 5 of 52 numbers; a sixth number, from a field of 28 (automatically quick-picked), also represented one of the properties on a U.S. Monopoly game board. Texas suspended sales of MMC following the December 12, 2014 drawing and the remaining 22 participants voted to suspend Monopoly Millionaires' Club after the December 26 draw. MMC was tied to a television game show, which continued airing until April 2016.  Jackpot choice  Texas Lottery regulations require players to make a binding choice of either cash value option (CVO) or annual pay (AP) when playing Lotto Texas, Mega Millions, and Powerball. This is unlike other lotteries, which generally allow players, including winners of annuitized scratch-game prizes, to make this choice after winning. All three games indicated (including Mega Millions and Powerball within Texas) initially had annual pay as the default option. As of 2014, if a playslip is not marked with either choice, the playslip is rejected. The Texas Lottery is the only one offering Powerball that does not allow the cash value option to be chosen after winning Powerball. Players of Texas Two Step do not face this choice; it is the only Texas Lottery jackpot game that is all-cash. All other Texas Lottery draw games have all-cash prizes. Texas' scratch games that are annuitized do not allow winners to choose a lump sum in lieu of the annuity.

Known in particular for his rural genre scenes, his range of subjects was very wide and included portraits, farmhouse interiors, rural and beach scenes, landscapes with cattle, history paintings, scenes of Hell, allegories, satires and illustrations of proverbs.Wolfgang Schulz. \\"Saftleven.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 23 Dec. 2016 Life Cornelis Saftleven was born into a family of artists. He learned to paint possibly from his father Herman, along with his brothers Abraham and Herman Saftleven the Younger. He lived for a time in Utrecht with his brother. Temptation of St Anthony After training in Rotterdam, Cornelis likely traveled to Antwerp around 1632. Peter Paul Rubens is known to have added figures in paintings of Saftleven before 1637. When Rubens died in 1640 there were eight Saftlevens in his collection, four of which with figures added by Rubens.Cornelis Saftleven at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Among his earliest works are portraits and peasant interiors influenced by Adriaen Brouwer. By 1634 Cornelis was in Utrecht, where his brother Herman Saftleven the Younger was living. The brothers began painting stable interiors, a new subject in peasant genre painting.Cornelis Saftleven at the J. Paul Getty Museum He also made a double-portrait of himself and his brother in the Two Musicians (c. 1633; Academy of Fine Arts Vienna). By 1637 Cornelis had returned to Rotterdam. In 1648 he married Catharina van der Heyden, who died in 1654. The year after her death, he married Elisabeth van der Avondt. He became dean of the guild of Saint Luke of Rotterdam in 1667. His pupils included Abraham Hondius, Ludolf de Jongh and Egbert Lievensz. van der Poel. Work College of Animals Approximately two hundred of Saftleven's oil paintings and five hundred of his drawings still survive. His subject matter covered various subjects, including genre works, portraits, beach scenes, and biblical and mythological themes. His images of hell as well as his satires and allegories are considered to be his most important contributions to Dutch painting. Related in motif to these hell scenes are the numerous versions of the Temptation of St Anthony. Saftleven excelled at painting animals and often portrayed animals as active characters, occasionally with a hidden allegorical role. As a draftsman, Saftleven is best known for his black chalk drawings of single figures, usually young men, and his studies of animals, which show Roelandt Savery's influence.

It also saw their most significant contribution to the game across the globe, with William McGregor creating the world's first Football League. 1879–80 Villa collected their first ever piece of silverware, the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1880. They defeated Saltley College 3-2 in the Final with goals from Eli Davis, William Mason and George Ramsay in front of 6,000 at Aston Lower Grounds (modern-day Villa Park). Villa's first attempt to win the FA Cup came in the same year, but ended in controversy and confusion. Having defeated Stafford Road 3-2 in the First Round replay, Villa were drawn to play the then-successful Oxford University in the Second Round. Perhaps feeling that it was a waste of time spending good money on travel expenses for a match they felt they would lose, the Villa board took the decision to 'scratch' (forfeit) the game. FA Cup details *1st Round v Stafford Road (A) 1-1 *(Replay) v Stafford Road (H) 3-2 *2nd Round v Oxford University (A) -- (Villa 'scratched') 1880–81 In 1881 Villa departed the FA Cup at the Third Round stage. Their first ever official defeat coming against the same team against whom they had achieved their first victory in the competition, Stafford Road. They also defeated Hearts 4-1 in a \\"glamour\\" friendly at Wellington Road. FA Cup details *1st Round v Wednesbury Strollers (H) 5–3 *2nd Round v Nottingham Forest (A) 2–1 *3rd Round v Notts County (A) 3–1 *4th Round v Stafford Road (H) 2–3 1881–82 This year saw several Club records being set. Howard Vaughton and Albert Brown became the first Villa players to gain international caps. They represented England against Ireland at Belfast. It was not a bad start for the 'Perry Barr Pets' either as Brown scored four, while Vaughton scored five in a 13-0 victory. Vaughton was a dangerous inside- left for Villa throughout the decade, picking up a Cup Winner's medal before his retirement through injury in 1888. He also owned a silversmith's which still exists today in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter, and was commissioned to make a new FA Cup trophy when the original was stolen while in holders Villa's care in 1895. No England player has ever bettered his record of five goals in one international. It also saw a significant friendly defeat against the famous Queen's Park club of Glasgow. While Villa were beaten 4-1, they learned from the Scottish club's innovative passing style. It was about this year that Villa began to wear what were described as 'maroon' shirts emblazoned with a large 'Lion Rampant' that now forms the central feature of the club's badge. The Lion Rampant was chosen by William McGregor as the club's emblem in tribute to his native Scotland, and also in recognition of the club's Scottish stars Ramsay and Archie Hunter. This was the first time the Villa kit had come to resemble anything like that worn by the team today. Throughout the 1870s they had worn a variety of kits, including all white, blue and black and all green. FA Cup details 1882 also saw a creditable Cup performance as Villa dispatched Nottingham Forest and Notts County (after a replay) before succumbing to Wednesbury Old Athletic in the Fourth Round (Villa received a 'bye' in the Second Round). *1st Round v Nottingham Forest (H) 4-1 *2nd Round - Villa received a 'bye' *3rd Round v Notts County (H) 2-2 *(Replay) v Notts County (A) 4-1 *4th Round v Wednesbury Old Athletic (A) 2-4 1882–83 1883 saw an increased takeover by professionals in the English game with Preston North End, in particular, attracting and paying a number of stars (mostly from Scotland). This move away from amateurism was to prove an advantage for Villa, whose industrial Birmingham home gave them access to large numbers of potential supporters. This is turn meant they could afford to pay decent wages to players with the ticket revenue accrued. The year also saw Villa's longest run in the FA Cup. They beat Walsall Swifts, Wednesbury Old Athletic, Aston Unity and Walsall Town before a controversial 4-3 loss to Notts County. A County player appeared to punch the ball off the line in the dying stages, but the referee was unmoved. The beaten Walsall Swifts and Walsall Town would later merge to make the present-day Walsall FC.

They travelled to Glasgow to play Queen's Park. At the time, Scottish clubs regularly entered the 'English' FA Cup. After another large defeat 6-1, the Villa committee decided to change the playing style. At this time, before managers or coaches, committees picked the team. For the first time, Villa would now use two backs rather than one. FA Cup details *1st Round v Walsall Swifts (A) 1-0 *2nd Round v Stafford Road (A) 5-1 *3rd Round v Wednesbury Old Athletic (A) 7-4 *4th Round v Queen's Park (A) 1-6 1884–85 The 1885 FA Cup saw Villa's first encounter with the West Bromwich Albion.

Villa were beaten in the Second Round by Derby County. FA Cup details *st Round v Walsall Town (A) 5-0 *2nd Round v Derby County (A) 0-2 1886–87 Aston Villa players posing with the 1887 FA Cup trophy Villa started their road to The Oval (then the home of FA Cup finals) with a club record 13-0 victory over Wednesbury Old Athletic that still stands today. After Derby Midland were beaten (6-1) Villa needed four matches (three replays) to defeat Wolverhampton Wanderers. A bye in the Fourth Round added to victories over Horncastle and Darwen meant that Villa were set for their first Semi-Final, against Scottish giants Rangers, to be played at Crewe. In a bid to win the trophy, the Scottish FA allowed Rangers to borrow players from other clubs. Consequently, stars from Queen's Park and Hibernian were amongst the eleven that lined up to face Villa. However Villa won 3-1 to reach their first FA Cup final. The Final pitted Villa against local rivals West Bromwich Albion. With Albion installed as favourites, thousands travelled from Birmingham and the Black Country to watch the game. Winger Dennis Hodgetts opened the scoring for Villa in bizarre circumstances. The Albion keeper didn't bother to prevent the ball going into the net, as he believed, wrongly, that Hodgetts was offside. The legendary Archie Hunter added Villa's second. He prodded the ball over the goal-line while lying on the floor following a deliberate collision with the West Brom goalkeeper. Such 'attacks' on goalies were legal and commonplace back then. After a goalless second half, Hunter received the trophy, and with it the distinction of being Villa's first FA Cup winning captain. Villa's team in their first FA Cup Final was as follows- Jimmy Warner (goalkeeper); Frank Coulton, Joseph Simmonds (backs), John Burton, Frankie Dawson, Harry Yates (centre/wing-halves), Richmond Davis, Albert Brown, Archie Hunter (c), Howard Vaughton, Dennis Hodgetts (forwards). To add gloss to their victory Villa took on, and defeated, Scottish Cup winners Hibs the following Saturday. They could now make a legitimate claim to being 'best club in the World'.

With competitive football at a premium, William McGregor (Villa's President) sought to create a competition involving regular matches and wrote to the leading clubs of the time (all based in the North of England and the Midlands). After some discussion the clubs agreed to set up a twelve team league. Each club would play the other home and away, for a total of twenty-two matches each. Villa were to be joined in the inaugural competition by Stoke, Wolves, West Brom, Notts County, Burnley, Blackburn Rovers, Derby County, Bolton Wanderers, Everton, Accrington (no relation to the present-day Accrington Stanley) and Preston North End. The league was never styled 'the English League' as McGregor envisioned that Scottish clubs would one day wish to join. Meanwhile, in Villa's last pre-league FA Cup campaign, they reached the Fifth Round, beating Small Heath 4–0 on the way. This was their first meeting with modern rivals Birmingham City. Preston were a fine side and the match was billed as a clash between England's best teams. This prompted a then-record crowd of 27,000, which the police had some difficulty keeping off the pitch. With Preston leading 3-1 and chaos in the stadium, the clubs tried to calm things down by declaring the match a 'friendly'. However, the FA overruled the decision and decided that the result would stand. Villa, the holders, were out.

Leticia Calderón, Fernando Colunga and Juan Pablo Gamboa starred as protagonists, while Laura Zapata, Ana Patricia Rojo and Salvador Pineda starred as antagonists. Nora Salinas, Alejandro Ruiz and the leading actor Enrique Lizalde starred as stellar performances. In 1998 it was named \\"The Best Telenovela of the Year\\" by Premios TVyNovelas. Plot Rodolfo Peñareal is obsessed with having a male child. After many miscarriages, his wife Blanca is pregnant again. One night, a girl is born, but they believe that she was born dead. In the same town, in another, more humble house, a boy is born, but his mother dies during labor. The midwife and the nanny of Blanca, with their best intention and with the aim to calm down Rodolfo, decide to exchange the children. Blanca puts a pair of emerald earrings on her supposedly dead baby so that she is buried with them. Once the exchange is done, the midwife Dominga, discovers that the girl is not dead, but now it is too late to right the wrong. In this way, the boy that was born in a miserable hut sees his first light in the opulence of a big house, while the sweet little girl who was entitled to a golden crib, gives her first steps among ramshackle walls and misery. Esmeralda, the Peñareal's baby girl, was born blind, but the kindness of her heart provides her the light to be happy and the illusion to believe that someday she will meet love. Her eyes are the \\"eyes of love\\". Time passes and the destiny of both of the children, Esmeralda and José Armando, comes across as they instantly fall in love. However, the obsession, the wish, the family interests, the false love of a woman and the Peñareal's pride to make their lineage prevail, destroy any noble feeling.

The MG-Lola EX257 (sometimes referred to as simply MG EX257) is a Le Mans Prototype built by Lola for the MG car company for their attempt to compete again at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in . The car has had many years of mixed success since its introduction, even in privateer hands. It was Lola's only car built specifically to LMP675 regulations, and was known by their designation as the Lola B01/60. The last EX257 in original specification was retired from racing in 2007. Development Following a resurgence for the MG brand in the beginnings of the 21st century, the decision was made to expand the brand into motorsports such as touring car racing as well as sports car racing. MG had previously had success at the 24 Hours of Le Mans many decades ago, yet had never scored an overall win. At approximately the same time, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) had changed the Le Mans Prototype regulations for Le Mans, making it possible for two different classes of prototype to be capable of taking an overall win. This class, known as LMP675, would use smaller turbocharged engines yet would be lighter and more nimble, making it possible for them to compete with the larger, more powerful LMP900 class. Seeing an opportunity to use a production-based engine in an LMP675 instead of a custom built engine that would be larger than anything MG had in their production cars at the time, MG decided to enter into this new class in agreement with Lola Cars International. Lola had previously built cars in 2000, known as the B2K/10 and B2K/40, but they were not designed with the LMP675 regulations in mind. Lola would therefore have to build an all new prototype design that would center on the light weight and small engines of LMP675. Since the B2K/40 was more similar to the LMP675 regulations, many design elements of it were brought over for the new car, which Lola designated B01/60. The front fender design of the B01/60 was nearly identical to that of the B2K/40, yet the nose of the car would be radically different, incorporating a large square airbox (shaped like an MG grill) in the raised nose. The sidepods would also be radically different, using sweeping lines to better manage airflow both in and out of the car. A large single air inlet was placed on the top of the car, slightly off to the side of the cockpit in order to house the turbo inlet. Using a design element borrowed from the Audi R8, a single rollbar was used behind the driver, instead of a long rollbar that covered the entire width of the cockpit. In the rear, the wing was mounted low on the chassis in order to increase overall top speed. In the end, the EX257 would be very light, coming to approximately 690 kg at its launch (675 kg being the minimum allowed by the rules). For an engine, MG would turn to Advanced Engine Research (AER) for construction of their engine and Garrett for turbocharging it. Using some elements of MG's production engines, the new 2.0 Litre turbocharged Inline-4 known as the MG XP20 (AER designation P07) would come to approximately 500 hp, limited by air restrictors put in place by the ACO to equalize cars. Modifications In 2003, the Intersport Racing team would feel that the MG engine was lacking the power necessary for tracks used in the American Le Mans Series. The team would transplant a Judd KV675 naturally aspirated V8 engine in place of the MG XP20. This would necessitate the removal of the large turbo inlet, replacing it with an air inlet mounted behind the cockpit. This car (referred to by its Lola designation only due to the loss of the MG engine) would have a short career with some success. Racing history The new MG- Lola EX257 made its competition debut at the 2001 24 Hours of Le Mans, with two cars being run by MG Sport & Racing Ltd. The new cars showed their pace, qualifying 14th and 17th overall, the fastest two times amongst LMP675. Unfortunately for the race, the problems with the LMP675 formula showed their signs early in the race. Although quick even with their small engines, these engines were highly stressed and lacked the capabilities to survive long distances. Following a mere 30 laps, one MG was forced to retire due to exhaust failure. A few hours later, the second MG succumb to an oil leak, leaving MG retired from the event at a very early stage. For 2002, the EX257s were offered to customers for the first time. Two American teams, KnightHawk Racing and Intersport Racing, would seize the opportunity and purchase one chassis each, for competition throughout the American Le Mans Series season. Improvements to the EX257 allowed for greater durability, and it was shown at Sebring with Intersport taking the LMP675 win and seventh overall, while KnightHawk took third in LMP675. Over the rest of the season, the pair of EX257s dominated the series, taking four more wins total. KnightHawk took the LMP675 championship by a single point over Intersport. Also, for the final four races of the season, a third EX257 would join the series, in the hands of Dyson Racing, who managed fifth in the championship, even with running a handful of races. Back at Le Mans, the factory MG team again returned with their two EX257s. Their reliability was improved as well, as both cars survived farther than they had the previous year. Unfortunately gearbox problems eliminated one car after 129 laps. The second car was running strong until the final few hours of the race, when the engine let go. The American KnightHawk team also participated, but their car succumbed to fire during the night. After two years of being unable to finish at Le Mans, as well as financial strain on the MG Rover Group lead to the sportscar project being cancelled. However Lola would continue on selling the cars to customers, offering continued technical support along with Advanced Engine Research. In the American Le Mans Series, KnightHawk Racing would leave, yet its place would be taken by a second Dyson Racing EX257. Both Dyson and Intersport would trade wins off during the entire season, with the EX257 winning every race that year to give Dyson the championship. Notably, the #16 Dyson entry, piloted by James Weaver and Butch Leitzinger, took an overall victory at the Infineon Raceway round, the first time an LMP675 car had pulled off the upset. However, Intersport made an unusual decision for the final round at Petit Le Mans, deciding to replace the turbocharged MG engine with a new naturally aspirated Judd KV675 V8. This move forced the team to make some mechanical changes to their car (now referred to as B01/60), but it was successful as the team managed to take the LMP675 win. Even with this perfect season for the EX257, Le Mans still saw problems. A single entry from Intersport failed to finish yet again, due to an engine failure after a mere 102 laps. Unfortunately for 2004, the ACO decided to alter the Le Mans Prototype rules due to the inherent problems of the LMP675 class. The classes were restructured into LMP1 and LMP2, and the MG's found themselves moved into the top LMP1 class. Over in Europe, Ray Mallock Ltd. would carry on the MG name in the new Le Mans Endurance Series. The car performed well over the short season, finishing all races and achieved a best finish of fifth, earning them fifth in the teams championship. In America, Dyson would continue with their two-car squad, while Intersport would continue with their Judd-powered entry. Unfortunately the success of the previous year could not be repeated, as Dyson was now in the same class as the dominant Audi R8. Although Dyson was able to score an overall victory against the R8s at Mosport, the team had to settle for second in the championship. Intersport's hybrid car failed to perform, managing to score points in only two races. For Le Mans, both Ray Mallock, Ltd. and Intersport would participate, yet once again neither car finished. Intersport's car was taken out in an accident, while RML's entry blew an engine in the closing hours of the race. Autocon Motorsport's EX257 in 2006. Following the dismal performance of Intersport's hybrid B01/60, the car was retired for 2005. This left only the two-car Dyson team in the American Le Mans Series, and RML in the Le Mans Endurance Series. However, RML had performance extensive modifications to their car during the off-season including the addition of a Judd XV675 V8 similar to Intersport's modification, leading to the new car being renamed the MG-Lola EX264. The car was now transferred to the LMP2 class, while Dyson's unmodified cars remained in LMP1. Unfortunately Dyson once again suffered against the R8s, although it did manage to take two wins over the season. The team had to once again settle for second in the LMP1 championship. In Europe, RML saw better performance against their LMP2 competition, including their first class victory at Istanbul Park. RML managed to finish second in the LMP2 championship behind Chamberlain-Synergy Motorsport. However the MG's greatest success came at Le Mans, with RML managing to not only score the car's first finish in the race, but also taking the LMP2 class victory by a mere four laps over a pair of Paul Belmondo Racing Courages. For 2006, Dyson Racing decided that the old EX257 was no longer competitive, and purchased newer Lola B06/10s. The two former Dyson EX257s were sold to two teams, Highcroft Racing and Autocon Motorsports, who would compete in limited schedules in the American Le Mans Series. Highcroft would score the best result of the season, taking third place overall at Petit Le Mans. Meanwhile, Ray Mallock, Ltd. would continue to campaign their EX264, now using the old MG/AER turbocharged engine once again. Another single victory was achieved by the team at Donington Park, yet again leaving them with second place in the LMP2 championship. At Le Mans however, RML would repeat their success. Again taking the LMP2 class victory, this year they actually finished in eighth place overall, a mere 37 laps behind the overall winning Audi R10. 2007 would begin to see the end of the EX257. The final original car still in competition, Autocon Motorsport's entry, began the 2007 American Le Mans Series season. However following three rounds of racing, the team decided to buy a newer Creation CA06/H after the Grand Prix of Long Beach.

Large areas of Ireland remained in the control of resisting Irish clans who found Roman Catholic priests to be useful conduits for clandestinely obtaining supplies, information, and gold from outside, thereby maintaining their independence from central, and especially Protestant, authorities. England As the Catholic bishops during the reign of Queen Mary were dead, imprisoned or in exile, and those priests they had ordained were dying out or converting to Protestantism, William Allen conceived the idea for a seminary for English Catholic priests at Douai, where several of the chief posts were held by professors who had fled Oxford upon the reimposition of Protestantism in England. The English College at Douai was founded as a Catholic seminary in 1569. Similar colleges also came about at Douai for Scottish and Irish Catholic clergy, and also Benedictine, Franciscan and Jesuit houses. Other English seminaries for the training of priests from and for England and Wales included ones in Rome (1579), Valladolid (1589), Seville (1592) and Lisbon (1628). Elizabeth I reinstated the Protestant bible and English Mass, yet for a number of years she refrained from persecuting Catholics. After the Rising of the North of 1569 and the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis (1570), plus the threat of invasion by Catholic France or Spain assisted by English Catholics led the Crown to adopt ever increasing repressive measures.Chapman, John H. \\"The Persecution under Elizabeth\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Old Series Vol. 9 (1881), pp. 21-43. Retrieved 2012-02-19. An act of 1571 (13 Eliz. c. 2) not only forbade the publishing of any documents from the Pope, but also the importation and distribution of crosses, beads, pictures, and tokens called \\"Agnus Dei\\" (a Lamb of God sealed upon a piece of wax from the Paschal candle blessed by the Pope).\\"St Cuthbert Mayne Priest and Martyr 29th November\\", Friends of Lanherne From the 1570s missionary priests from continental seminaries came to England secretly. In the autumn of 1577, Queen Elizabeth's Principal Secretary, Francis Walsingham canvassed the Anglican bishops for a list of recusants in their dioceses and how much each was worth.Lake, Peter. \\"A Tale of Two Episcopal Surveys\\", Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Vol. 18, (Ian W. Archer, ed.), Cambridge University Press, 2009 Cuthbert Mayne (1544–1577) was the first English Roman Catholic \\"seminary priest\\" to be executed under the laws of Elizabeth I. The Religion Act 1580 (23 Eliz.1 c. 1) fined and imprisoned those who celebrated the Mass or attended a Mass.Dudley Julius Medley, A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History. Sixth Edition (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1925), p. 638. The Jesuits, etc. Act 1584 (27 Eliz.1, c. 2) commanded all Roman Catholic priests to leave the country in forty days or be punished for high treason unless, within the 40 days, they swore an oath to obey the Queen. Those who harboured them, and all those who knew of their presence and failed to inform the authorities would be fined and imprisoned for felony. It also provided an incentive to informers by according them one-third of any forfeitures. This was followed by another in 1585 (27 Eliz. c. 2) that declared that anyone ordained a priest outside the Queen's dominions who then came into the country was deemed a traitor, and anyone harboring them, a felon. Nicholas Woodfen (Devereux) and Edward Stransham, who had both studied at the English College, Douai were executed at Tyburn on 21 January 1586. One of the most infamous priesthunters of Elizabeth's reign was Sir Richard Topcliffe, who delighted in personally torturing and playing mind games with the priests whom he apprehended. Described by Father John Gerard as \\"old and hoary and a veteran in evil,\\" Topcliffe ultimately fell from favor with the Queen and was imprisoned very soon after his role in the arrest, trial, and execution of the underground priest and secret poet, Fr. Robert Southwell, S.J. Methods Walsingham tracked down Catholic priests in England and supposed conspirators by employing informers, and intercepting correspondence.Hutchinson, Robert (2007) Elizabeth's Spy Master: Francis Walsingham and the Secret War that Saved England. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. Shortly before setting off for England, Edmund Campion learned that a letter detailing their party and mission had been intercepted and that they were expected in England.Waugh, Evelyn, Edmund Campion London: Williams and Norgate (1935). Sophia Institute Press (1996) It was a common practice for a spy to pose as a Catholic and engage a suspect in conversation in the hope of eliciting an incriminating statement. This technique led to the arrest and execution of Richard Simpson in 1588.Sweeney, Garrett. A Pilgrim's Guide to Padley. Diocese of Nottingham, 1978, p. 9. Apostate Catholics and former priests and seminarians were particularly helpful in this regard. A London priest hunter named Sledd had been a servant to Dr. Nicholas Morton at the English College in Rome. After George Haydock had been betrayed to Sledd by one of Haydock's old acquaintances, Sledd went to the house where Haydock took his meals, and recognized the priest Arthur Pitts and law-student William Jenneson.Wainewright, John Bannerman. \\"Venerable George Haydock\\", Lives of the English Martyrs, (Edwin H. Burton and J. H. Pollen eds.), London. Longmans, Green and Co., 1914 George Eliot In early July 1581, John Payne, while staying on the estate of Lady Petre in Warwickshire, was denounced by informer George Eliot, a spy in the employ of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. Eliot became a spy, agreeing to seek out recusant Catholics, in order to avoid a pending murder charge. He had insinuated himself into a position in the Petre household where he then proceeded to embezzle sums of money.Camm OSB, Bede, Lives of the English Martyrs, p.429, Longmans, Green & Co., London, 1914 Eliot followed that success shortly thereafter with the capture of Campion, who had arrived in London on 24 June 1580 disguised as a jewel merchant. Eliot used his past experience working in a Catholic household to gain admittance to a Mass Campion was saying at Lyford Grange in Oxfordshire. Elliot then returned with an armed company and searched the house until they discovered the priest hole where Campion and two associates were hiding. Wadsworth et al Priest hunters were effectively bounty hunters. Some were volunteers, experienced soldiers or former spies. They used a number of informants within Catholic communities. Starting in the 1640s, James Wadsworth, Francis Newton, Thomas Mayo, and Robert de Luke formed a partnership to hunt down Roman Catholics in the London area and handed them over to the authorities for a reward.Lingard, John. The history of England:From the first invasion of the Romans to the accession of William and Mary in 1688. vol 8. John Grant. 1902 Between November 1640 and summer 1651 over fifty individuals were turned over to the government. Some were executed, some banished, and some reprieved. Ireland A 1709 Penal Act demanded that Catholic priests take the Oath of Abjuration, and recognise the Protestant Queen Anne as Queen of Great Britain and, by implication, of Ireland. Priests that did not conform were arrested and executed. This activity, along with the deportation of priests who did conform, was a documented attempt to cause the Catholic clergy to die out in Ireland within a generation. Priests had to register with the local magistrates to be allowed to preach, and most did so. Bishops were not able to register. The reward rates for capture varied from £50–100 for a bishop, to £10–20 for the capture of an unregistered priest; substantial amounts of money at the time. The work was dangerous, and some priests fought in self-defence. The hunters were outcasts in their communities, and were viewed as the most despised class. Often when a gentleman informed on a priest, locals would seek revenge by burning his house and farmyard. The risks were the same for known informants. The Penal law made fugitives of the remaining clerics, and they were forced to conduct ceremonies in secret, and in remote locations. Nighttime worship at Mass rocks became common. The attending priest would usually wear a veil, so that if an attendee was questioned, they were able to say truthfully that they did not know who had said the Mass. The distribution of Priest hunters was uneven; some local police forces chose to overlook both the presence of priests and their activity around Mass rocks. John O'Mullowny Perhaps the most notorious was John O'Mullowny from Ballyheane, County Mayo, an alcoholic horse thief who took up the profession in return for a pardon from the hangman's noose, c. 1715. He was eventually killed by a priest he was pursuing, and his body was thrown in a lake, before later being recovered and buried. Tony Nugent (2013), Were You at the Rock? The History of Mass Rocks in Ireland, pages 40-47. Messr. Turner As persecution of Catholics heated up in reaction to the Titus Oates' claims of a non-existent Catholic conspiracy aimed at assassinating King Charles II of England and massacring the Protestants of the British Isles, a priest named Father Mac Aidghalle was murdered while saying Mass at a Mass rock that still stands atop Slieve Gullion, in County Armagh. The perpetrators were a company of Redcoats under the command of a priest hunter named Turner. Redmond O'Hanlon, the Chief of the Name of O'Hanlon and leading rapparee, is said in local tradition to have avenged the murdered priest and in so doing to have sealed his own fate.

The station is located from Ravenglass and from Dalegarth, at the point where the A595 coast road crosses the line. It is situated on the bank of the River Mite and adjacent to Muncaster Mill, formerly a watermill but now a private house, from which it takes its name. There is a shelter and disabled toilet at Muncaster station. There was previously a siding built into the platform surface, for storage of Permanent Way rolling stock and for use by shuttle trains on Gala events. However, the siding has since been disconnected from the main line, although the rails remain embedded in the platform surface. Currently, the company have taken the decision to permanently unstaff the station, as the previous station master retired and was not replaced. Accessibility The platform is not long enough to accommodate step-free access to the disabled carriage, which is normally situated towards the Eastern end of the carriage set, on both the Eastbound and Westbound journeys. The railway has taken the decision to permanently unman the railway station, and so tickets must be purchased from the guard on the train for this railway station.

It is situated to the east of main line railway station, which is itself a station on the Cumbrian Coast Line. The facilities at the railway station include toilets, under-cover platforms, booking office and café. The railway station complex incorporates 2 locomotive sheds, a carriage shed, a signal box, managerial offices and 2 camping coaches; along with the railway station itself. History The narrow gauge railway station at Ravenglass was originally built in 1876 when the original 3'gauge railway opened to passenger traffic to Boot. The original station consisted of a large wooden built train shed covering one track and the platform. Additional sidings were used for goods traffic. In the days of the 3ft gauge railway, there was no run-round loop or turntable. Running round was achieved by gravity shunting. The 3ft gauge structure was used by the Narrow Gauge Railways 15\\" conversion in 1915, with additional lines and a turntable being added over the next ten years. The train shed was eventually demolished in 1927 and a new platform, waiting shelter, and 4 lines leading to the turntable was built. This new layout originally had an island platform which was removed and a fifth track added in the late 1930s. At this stage the tracks were packed with granite dust so only the rail head showed. The layout remained largely unchanged until the present company took over the railway in 1960. When the new company took over in 1960, the waiting shelter was converted into a cafe for visitors. In 1966 the footbridge from Coniston was installed just before the turntable. The 1930s layout lasted until 1967 when the present two platform layout was adopted. The lever frame from Birgham signal box was installed in a box opposite the workshops and general manager's office (the 1927 bungalow) in 1968/9. In 1972, awnings were erected over platforms 2 and 3, recovered from Millom station. In 1978 a two storey toilet and office building was built next to the old waiting shelter on platform 1 RERPS magazines and other RER publications. Shortly afterwards, a second canopy was erected over platform 1, using fittings recovered from Whitehaven Station. A new ticket office and shop was built in 1983 next to the car park. The 1920s waiting shelter lasted until 2011, when it was replaced by a 2-storey cafe similar in style to the building built at Dalegarth in 2005. Present day Today, Ravenglass station is a very busy station, with all of the passengers departing and alighting at this station. Consequently, there is always a minimum of one booking office clerk at Ravenglass station, when trains are in operation. The shop and booking office are adjacent to the car park. Memorabilia of the railway can be purchased also at the booking office complex. There is a café and toilets on platform 1, adjacent to each other. Both platforms are under-cover and are decorated with various hanging plants, which are watered when the time permits of the volunteers. If you arrive early before the first train of the day, volunteers can be seen cleaning the rolling stock and checking the Daily Report Form sheets associated with each carriage set. Each train set is equipped with a variety of safety-critical appliances and material, including brakes on nearly all carriages and in the guards' compartment a first-aid kit, sanding equipment, fire-beaters and a rander board. The driver must have a separate rander board in order to proceed out of the station, on to the main line. Rander boards will only be given to the driver by the Controller, once the single-line section from Ravenglass to Miteside loop is considered to be occupied by that particular train, so as to meet the legal requirements of fixed absolute block railway signalling systems. The signal box has an antenna protruding out of the signal box, which transmits and receives signals to and from locomotives on the line, via a booster and descrambler at station. Accessibility Wheelchair users who wish to board the train here must pre-book a wheelchair space prior to the day of travel.

João Duarte de Sousa served as a secretary in the Velas municipal hall from 1886, a post he held for 24 years. Around this time he married Maria Carlota Rebelo in Terceira, and permanently moved to Velas. He was a political supporter of the Partido Regeneredor (Regenerator Party), and movements on the political left, eventually resulting in his dismissal in 1895. He and his wife moved to Angra do Heroísmo, before settling in Praia da Vitória where he became administrator for the municipal council. Later, he would become the Secretary of the Polícia Repressiva da Emigração Clandestina (Repressive Police for Clandestine Emigration), a post in which he was very unpopular for his political conflicts and the way in which he exercised his position of authority. Interested in local history, he completed several investigations within the municipal archives, resulting in his published work Apontamentos Históricos e Descrição Topográfica, of which many were republished in the newspapers of São Jorge and Terceira.

Conival (Scottish Gaelic: Cona Mheall) is a Scottish mountain situated in Assynt in the Sutherland area of the Highland Council Area, north-northeast of the town of Ullapool.  Overview  Conival is a distinct landmark when viewed from the A837 road to the west from where its conspicuous high western face is well seen, this flank is made up of light coloured and distinctive Cambrian quartzite rock thickened by geological thrusting.University of Leeds Geology Site. Describes western face. The mountain reaches a height of 987 metres (3,238 feet) and is classified as a Munro. It is connected to the adjoining and better known Munro of Ben More Assynt which lies to the east by a high, rough quartzite ridge. Conival has a rich diversity of attractions on its slopes making it popular not just with walkers but also geologists, biologists and speleologists. The mountain's name is slightly enigmatic in its meaning. The name does not originate from the Norse language like many of the hills in the Assynt area; it does in fact derive from Gaelic. It was called Conamheall in the original 1891 publication of Munro's Tables,The Munros and Tops 1891-1997 Gives changes in successive editions of Munro's Tables. which translates as “adjoining hill”\\"100 Best Routes on Scottish Mountains\\" Page 168 (Gives translation as “Adjoining Hill“). or “hill of meeting”\\"The Munros\\" Page 216 (Gives translation as “Hill of Meeting“). (a reduced form of Gaelic coinneamh \\"meeting\\", and in prepositional constructions \\"opposite, facing\\", plus meall \\"round hill\\") which is probably the correct translation as it describes its close connection to Ben More Assynt. Between 1921 and 1969 the mountain was called Cona-mheall which translates as “enchanted hill”.\\"The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland\\" Page 319 (Gives translation as “The Enchanted Hill“). Since 1974 it has been called by its anglicised name of Conival.  Geography and Geology  Conival is part of the Ben More Assynt Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its outstanding geological features, it displays the Moine Thrust Belt clearly on its slopes, this is an upthrust of rocks caused by tectonic plate collision during the Silurian period. There are good examples of limestone pavement on the lower western flank of the mountain in the valley of the River Traligill. Conival also lies within the UNESCO endorsed North West Highlands Geopark and the Inchnadamph National Nature Reserve.www.lochinver.bordernet.co.uk. Some info on Nature Reserve. The underlying limestone within the reserve creates ideal conditions for rare plants like mountain avens, frog orchid and holly fern.www.thewildflowersociety.com. Gives info on flora. Conival consists of a main ridge which runs on an axis from north west to south east. The NW ridge connects to the subsidiary summit of Beinn an Fhurain with its highest point known as Na Tuadhan (852 metres). Na Tuadhan is an important geological area displaying spectacular folds of Cambrian quartzites exposed by the Moine Thrust on its southern cliffs above Coire a' Mhadaidh.University of Leeds Geology site. Gives details of Na Tuadhan and quotes \\"Fantastic Geology\\" for SSE ridge. The SSE ridge descends to Glen Oykel and this also displays “fantastic geology”. A spur runs south west off the SSE ridge to cross a col (Bealach Traligill) that connect to the neighbouring Corbett of Breabag. A third ridge goes east to connect to Ben More Assynt, this ridge is rough underfoot with quartzite boulders and the traverse between the two Munros takes more time than expected even though there is a drop and re-ascent of only . Conival lies on the main east-west watershed of Scotland with drainage from its slopes reaching both coasts. The southern slopes are drained by the River Oykel which flows to the Dornoch Firth on the eastern coast. Streams on the northern flanks also go east to the Dornoch Firth via Loch Shin while the western slopes are drained by the River Traligill which flows west through Loch Assynt to find the sea at Lochinver.  Ascents and the Summit  The usual route of ascent for Conival starts at Inchnadamph\\"The Munros\\" Page 216 (Gives route of ascent). at grid reference where there is parking space near the Inchnadamph hotel. The route follows the valley of the River Traligill passing the Cnoc nan Uamh cave system located within a band of Cambrian limestone. These caves have a length of www.ukcaves.co.uk. Gives length of cave. and show the earliest traces of human habitation in Scotland from about 6000 BC. The route continues to the source of the river at the col between Beinn an Fhurain and Conival from where it is a rough climb up quartzite scree to the summit. Most walkers will continue on to Ben More Assynt, to the east. An alternative ascent for strong walkers is to tackle the entire ridge from north to south including the two Munros plus the Corbetts of Glas Bheinn in the north and Breabag to the south. The summit of Conival is a mass of disintegrating quartzite marked by a large circular wind shelter which has been built around the remains of an OS trig point (all that remains is the base). The view from the top gives an impressive panorama to the west taking in the hills of Quinag, Canisp and Cul Mor as well as an end on view of Loch Assynt (see photo).

Inspired by the director's own family, the film tells the coming of age story of a Chinese American family. Red Doors is Lee's first feature film. Early drafts won the Jerome Foundation New York Media Arts Grant Award, and later won the best narrative feature prize at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival. Georgia Lee produced the movie alongside Jane Chen and Mia Riverton and co- producor John Fiorelli. Plot Red Doors tells the story of the Wongs, a Chinese-American family in the New York City suburbs. While the title of the film refers to the red door of the Wong's house in New York, red doors are said to bring good luck. Throughout the film, the red door is a sign for luck for the many struggles the Wongs must face. After retiring, Ed Wong (Tzi Ma) plans to escape from his life in the suburbs, yet his daughters have other plans. Samantha (Jacqueline Kim) is the eldest daughter of the Wongs. She is a businesswoman in New York and engaged to Mark (Jayce Bartok). When facing her thirtieth birthday, Samantha runs into Alex (Rossif Sutherland) which forces her to reevaluate her career and love life. Julie (Elaine Kao) is the shy middle sister of the Wongs. She is a fourth-year medical student who enjoys ballroom classes. Always quiet and center of the family, Julies begins to question her life choices as she meets Mia Scarlett (Mia Riverton). Katie (Kathy Shao-Lin Lee) is the youngest Wong sister. In her senior year of High School Katie is involved in a prank war with Simon (Sebastian Stan). As the movie continues the pranks escalate between the neighbors and longtime nemesis. Before disappearing, Ed decides to relive his family's history through VHS footage. Between the happier past and cold reality, Ed feels it is best to leave home. While the Wongs each face their own struggles, the family learns to communicate again through the stories and images of the past. Cast * Jacqueline Kim as Samantha Wong. The oldest daughter engaged to Mark. * Elaine Kao as Julie Wong, the middle daughter and medical student. * Kathy Shao-Lin Lee as Katie Wong, the youngest daughter and senior in high school. * Tzi Ma as Ed Wong, the suicidal father. * Sebastian Stan as Simon, involved in a prank war with Katie. * Freda Foh Shen as May-Li Wong, the mother. * Jayce Bartok as Mark, Samantha's fiancé. * Rossif Sutherland as Alex, a musician and ex-boyfriend of Samantha. * Mia Riverton as Mia Scarlett, a TV and film actress dating Julie. Production Lee, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania native and oldest of three sisters, wrote and produced her first full-length film in 2005. Although Red Doors was Lee's first full length feature film, her first short film was called The Big Dish which was produced while taking film classes at NYU. Lee states that the film Red Doors benefits from different aspects shown in all of the short films she has produced. The film was produced independently by Georgia Lee because Hollywood producers wanted to make the Wongs a Caucasian family for commercial purposes. In order to produce the film independent of ordinary Hollywood productions, Lee formed Blanc de Chine, a production company that she would further run herself and with the help of college friends. When asked why the film is important to her, Lee states that the story started as her own, yet while creating the script she was more interested in the backstory and how to capture a unique period of time in a family's dynamic. Lee further states that she was interested in correcting some of the typical stereotypes of Asian Americans usually portrayed in film. Also, in order to incorporate a mix of fact vs. fiction, the homevideos that can be seen in the film are actual homevideos shot by Lee's father as she was growing up. The videos were inserted due to the minimal budget the film had to work with, and the lack of funds needed to re- film such scenes. Reviews * In 2006, Thelma Adams of Us Weekly stated that \\"Lee paints a rich and insightful family portrait that is both funny and tender.\\" She goes on to state that although the film painted a truthful image, the performances made by the men of the film were no match compared to the performances played by the film's actresses of the \\"winning sister story.\\" *In 2005, Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter stated that \\"Lee's comedy-drama is big on heart but never sappy, without overdoing the quirk factor or the melodrama, Lee shows a sure feel for family dynamics.\\" * Elizabeth Weitzman, of New York Daily News, states that \\"There's enough affection and insight to make Lee's next movie worth watching for.\\" *Ty Burr, of The Boston Globe, states \\"Think of Red Doors as a promise, and hope that Georgia Lee keeps it.\\" *Janet Hanson, of The Wall Street Journal, states \\"This is a hilariously funny and unbelievably revealing film about an Asian family living in the U.S. and dealing with the colliding worlds of their traditional heritage and their current reality.

Minimum play is 50 cents. Typically, the straight payout is over $250, and the box payout (where the three digits are different) averages $38. Unlike most lotteries, New Jersey pays winners of Pick-3 and Pick-4 on a parimutuel basis. Multiple wagers of the same number increase winnings. The most common Pick-3 wager is Straight and Box combined for $1.00 (sometimes known as a \\"50-50\\" bet.) Pick-4 Pick-4 is a four-digit draw game also drawn twice daily.New Jersey Lottery's Pick-4 page It was introduced as a weekly game on July 9, 1977, became a daily game, and has been a twice-daily game since November 2001. The ways to win, in the order of payouts from highest to lowest, are: *Straight - Matching all four digits exactly. Minimum play is 50 cents. *Box - Matching all four digits in any order. Minimum play is 50 cents. As in Pick-3, the most common Pick-4 wager is Straight and Box combined for $1.00 (some players will make separate \\"straight\\" and \\"box\\" wagers for the same Pick-4 number, so that the \\"box\\" wager, if won, can be collected without filling out a tax form.) Typically, the straight payout is over $2,000. Multiple wagers of the same number increase winnings. = Fireball = On February 27, 2017, the Fireball feature was added to Pick-3 and Pick-4. This feature gives players an additional opportunity to create winning combinations. With Fireball, players can replace one of the Lottery drawn Pick-3 or Pick-4 winning numbers with the Fireball number drawn for more ways to win. Fireball doubles the cost of a wager. Jersey Cash 5 Xtra Jersey Cash 5 is a daily game that draws five balls numbered from 1 through 45. Drawings are held nightly, and the cost is $1 per game. The top prize (matching all 5 numbers drawn) is a progressive jackpot that starts at an estimated $100,000. The jackpot increases each day until a wager matches all 5 numbers drawn. The jackpot amount is shared between each winning ticket if there's more than one.https://1drv.ms/b/s!AptgyLLNTnZ9hK9mQEyyZot2lA2IdA?e=62qZ9U Jersey Cash 5 began on September 20, 1992 as a pick-5-of-38 game. Players won a parimutuel prize by matching at least three numbers. The original version of Jersey Cash 5 did not have a rolling jackpot; instead, if no set of five numbers was a perfect match, the first-prize pool was added to second prize winners (those who matched four of five numbers.) In September 2003, two numbers were added to make Jersey Cash 5 a 5/40 game, and the top prize level was changed to a progressive jackpot. On September 14, 2014, Jersey Cash 5 increased its field of numbers from 40 to 43 and became a 5/43 game. It's estimated starting jackpot prize was also increased - from $50,000 to $75,000.New Jersey Lottery's Jersey Cash 5 page On June 29, 2020, the starting jackpot was increased from $75,000 to $100,000 and increased its field of numbers from 43 to 45.https://1drv.ms/b/s!AptgyLLNTnZ9hK54MeacguFoStgD1w?e=pGPlU9 On October 3, 2016, the \\"Xtra\\" feature was added to Jersey Cash 5. This feature gives players the opportunity to multiply their non-jackpot winnings up to 5 times by matching 3 or 4 out of 5 numbers. If a player matches 2 out of 5 numbers with the \\"Xtra\\" feature, they win $2.https://w.njlottery.com/content/dam/portal/pdfs/drawgames/JerseyCash5XTRA- Addendum-Rules.pdf Pick-6 Xtra Pick-6 Xtra is drawn on Monday and Thursday evenings. It draws six balls from 1 through 49. Games cost $1 each. The jackpot begins at $2 million (annuitized with a cash option) and increases by at least $200,000 per rollover until there is a 6-of-6 winner.New Jersey Lottery's Pick-6 Lotto page Pick-6 began on May 9, 1980 as one of the first games of its kind in the US. It originally was a pick-6 (hence the name) of 39 numbers. Players paid $1 for each game; a winning ticket needed at least four correct numbers in a game. It later went to a 6/42 matrix, followed by an additional change to 6/46; making even higher jackpots possible. Pick-6, until 2000, also drew a five-digit \\"bonus\\" number; an exact match entered the player into a special drawing where the top prize was $50,000 yearly in 20 installments, with no cash option. (Although the Pick-6 cash option began in 1997, it applied only to the \\"regular\\" game; choosing \\"cash\\" on a betslip, then winning the top prize in the \\"bonus\\" drawing, still meant receiving mandatory annuity payments.) In September 2000, Pick-6 adopted its current 6/49 format, adding a $3 prize for matching three numbers. Matching at least four numbers has always won a parimutuel prize. On January 15, 2015, Pick-6 added its \\"XTRA\\" option (an additional $1 per play per drawing.) Matching five, four, or three of the six numbers means the basic parimutuel prize is multiplied by the \\"XTRA\\" number. Matching two numbers wins back the $2 wager. Quick Draw Quick Draw is a keno-style draw game which was launched on July 17, 2017. The game is drawn every four minutes from 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. Players choose 1 to 10 numbers (spots) per play. It is drawn using a random number generator (RNG). The RNG draws 20 numbers from 1 through 80. Minimum play is $1. The 10-spot option has a top prize of $100,000 ($1 million on a $10 play). Players also have the option of how many consecutive drawings (up to 20) they wish to play. Up until September 30, 2018, Quick Draw was only offered at a limited number of lottery retailers (who have an HDTV monitor) showing each drawing.https://www.njlottery.com/en- us/drawgames/quickDraw.html#tab-howToPlayhttps://njs- cdn.lotteryservices.com/content/dam/portal/pdfs/drawgames/Quick_Draw_Rules.pdfhttps://1drv.ms/v/s!AptgyLLNTnZ9g4UYvv_40YMRhfSNhQhttps://www.njlottery.com/en- us/newsandevents/newsinput/2017/press-releases/NJL_QuickDraw_071717.html On October 1, 2018, Quick Draw’s Bullseye feature was launched giving lottery players higher chances of winning. During each drawing, one of the 20 drawn numbers is randomly selected as the Bullseye number. If a player matches the Bullseye number, bigger prizes are won. Players can add Bullseye to each play for double the amount of the bet per draw. On the same day, the Quick Draw ePlayslip was also launched where players can generate a bet slip by selecting their own numbers and bets through the NJ Lottery app. Quick Draw is available through all New Jersey Lottery retailers, with the live drawings displayed on each lottery terminal, HDTV monitors, the NJ Lottery app and website.https://1drv.ms/v/s!AptgyLLNTnZ9g9Vy0jvYtMgM29TSwAhttps://www.njlottery.com/en- us/playertools/mobileapp.htmlhttps://1drv.ms/b/s!AptgyLLNTnZ9g9YBraSQiZkhMmnBfA Cash Pop Players select how much to wager; $1, $2, $5, or $10. Players choose from 1 to 15 numbers; the latter, the \\"cover all\\" option, guarantees a win. One number from 1 through 15 is drawn by an RNG. Players can win up to five times in one play, and up to 2500 times their wager, with prizes ranging from $5 to $2.500. The live drawing is held at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes after each hour and at the top of the hour. Winning numbers are shown on each lottery terminal, HDTV monitors, the New Jersey Lottery app, and website. The game launched on September 30, 2019.https://1drv.ms/u/s!AptgyLLNTnZ9g_RvuesSCeE9krNd8g?e=aFOpFI Multi- jurisdictional games Cash4Life On June 13, 2014, New York and New Jersey began sales of Cash4Life, which replaced Sweet Million in New York. Games are $2 each. The first drawing took place on June 16. Players choose 5 of 60 numbers in one field, and 1 of 4 green \\"Cash Ball\\" numbers in the second field. Drawings are held live from New Jersey every evening at 9pm Eastern Time on Livestream. The top prize is $1,000 per day for life, while second prize is $1,000 per week; both annuity tiers have a cash option.https://www.njlottery.com/en-us/drawgames/cash4life.html#tab- howToPlayhttps://livestream.com/Cash4Life/events/5051567 Unusually, New Jersey requires players to choose cash or annuity when playing Cash4Life, instead of after winning. The cash option (if chosen) is binding, while an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning. On May 15, 2017, Doubler NJ (available only in New Jersey, hence, the name of the feature) can be added to each Cash4Life play for $1 extra. All non-\\"for Life\\" prizes double winnings. Doubler NJ applies to each $3 play on a ticket. As of July 1, 2019, it is offered by nine state lotteries and is drawn nightly. Mega Millions On September 6, 1996, six lotteries began a multi-jurisdictional game, then known as The Big Game. In May 1999, the New Jersey Lottery became its first additional member. The game became known as The Big Game Mega Millions in May 2002; a short time later, The Big Game was dropped from the name. Mega Millions' starting jackpots is $15 million; a cash option is available. On January 31, 2010, many MUSL members (until then offering only Powerball) joined Mega Millions; likewise, most Mega Millions members added Powerball; New Jersey offered both games as of the cross-sell expansion date. The Megaplier option, initially available only in Texas, became available to Mega Millions players in New Jersey during January 2011, the deadline for the then 43 Mega Millions members to offer the Megaplier. Mega Millions currently is played in 44 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mega Millions is drawn live, usually from Atlanta. Powerball Powerball is a multi-lottery game which began in 1992. On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball in U.S. lottery jurisdictions. On January 7, 2010, the New Jersey Lottery announced that it would join Powerball, effective January 31, 2010; on that date, the 33 MUSL members were joined by 12 lotteries, including New Jersey's, that offered Mega Millions, although some of the 45 lotteries did not add the \\"other\\" game on that date. On March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previously Mega Millions-only jurisdiction to produce a jackpot ticket for Powerball after the cross-sell expansion. The annuity value of the jackpot was over $211 million; the ticket was sold in Morris Plains. Powerball's basic game has always had a $1 price; a game with the Power Play option (introduced in 2001) costs $2. On January 15, 2012, the most recent format change for Powerball included a price increase; games are $2 each, or $3 with Power Play. The minimum jackpot was doubled, to $40 million; a second-prize game (matching all five white balls, but not also the Powerball) wins $1 million, or $2 million if Power Play was selected. Powerball is drawn live, usually from Florida; its home base was Iowa until 2008. Cash/annuity jackpot choice Unusually, for Pick-6 (as well as for Cash4Life, Mega Millions, and Powerball within New Jersey), players must choose cash or annuity when playing, instead of after winning. The cash option, if chosen, is legally binding; however, a New Jersey- generated annuity ticket that wins an annuity prize in any of these four games can be changed to cash. Such winners are given a 60-day period upon claiming in which to make the choice. There is no annuity option in Jersey Cash 5, as its jackpot shares are paid in lump sum. Instant Games Since July 17, 1975, the New Jersey has offered numerous scratchcard games, called \\"Instant Games\\", with various price points, prizes, formats and themes.New Jersey Lottery's Instant Games page Fast Play The Lottery offered a form of instant win game known as Instant Match.New Jersey Lottery's Instant Match page Available as a $1 add-on to Pick-3, Pick-4 and Jersey Cash 5 tickets, the lottery terminal's random number generator produced a same-sized set of numbers to the main game. If any of the randomly generated numbers match the ticket's chosen numbers, the player wins the indicated prize amount. In 2015, this was replaced by a series of games known as Fast Play, which are instant games similar to a scratchcard, but generated by the lottery terminal. Cost and prize values vary between games. One game, Jersey Jackpot features a progressive jackpot.Jersey Jackpot at njlottery.com Retired draw games  5 Card Lotto/Cash  The original version of the game was called 5 Card Lotto, and was offered from January 11, 1988 to September 18, 1990. It was New Jersey Lottery's response to the initial wave of terminal-based, all-cash, lottery games with a higher prize potential than those offered in Pick-3 and Pick-4 games. Rather than an all-number field, the game used 52 cards from a standard deck of playing cards. The game was drawn twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. The winning combination was the five \\"cards\\" (actually marked balls) drawn. Although a \\"poker-themed\\" game, poker hands (four of a kind, full house, flush etc.) were not used to determine winning tickets. Instead, any game matching at least three of the five cards won a parimutuel prize. A ticket with any game matching all five cards won (or shared) the cash jackpot, which started at $200,000 and remained there until sales supported a higher top prize. Unusual at the time, 5 Card Lotto drawings were originally broadcast during the early afternoon, before being shifted to evenings. The game was revived as 5 Card Cash and was offered from May 16, 2016 to May 3, 2020. Each play cost $2 per quick pick and offered two plays with the same set of terminal-generated playing cards. The first play was called \\"Win Now\\" which was an instant match game similar to the Fast Play games by matching the cards to a poker hand. Cash prizes ranged from $2 (for a pair of jacks or better) to $5000 (for a royal flush). The second play was called \\"Win Tonight\\", where a nightly jackpot drawing similar to the prior version of the game by matching at least two of the five cards drawn via RNG would win a cash prize. Matching all five drawn cards won $100,000. An additional $1 bet called \\"All In\\" added to the prizes for the \\"Win Now\\" play, with a royal flush winning an additional progressive jackpot which started at $10,000, while a straight flush added 10% of the jackpot value to the prize.5 Card Cash at njlottery.com NJ Lottery officially ended 5 Card Cash on October 5, 2020. The game had been temporarily suspended on May 4, 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it never resumed play due to limited interest. On October 16, 2020, a new poker-themed game of the same name was launched as a Fast Play Progressive game.https://1drv.ms/u/s!AptgyLLNTnZ9hL1M2Ehl2QUrqXsXew?e=Nr5Oc1 In addition, any remaining amount for the “All In” prize pool will carry forward into the Fast Play progressive Jackpot. https://www.njlottery.com/en- us/newsandevents/newsinput/2020/press-releases/FiveCC_GameEnding_100220.html  Lotzee  Lotzee (stylized LOTZEE) was a game offered from June 14, 1998 to September 13, 2003.New Jersey Lottery history Originally drawn once a week on Saturdays, it expanded with a Wednesday drawing before being discontinued. It was unpopular with players, who felt the rules, which featured a combination of player- and machine-selected numbers, were too complex and confusing. The top prize was $500,000 cash; although not a progressive jackpot, the prize was split if there were multiple winners. A Player Could choose 4 out 77 numbers numbered between 0 and 76.  Monopoly Millionaires' Club  Monopoly Millionaires' Club began on October 19, 2014. Its only jackpot winner was purchased in New Jersey. In December 2014, it was announced that due to low sales among the 23 members, sales of the game were to be suspended. Drawings The New Jersey Network (NJN) aired live televised drawings twice a day, seven days a week; midday at 12:57 p.m. ET, and nightly at 7:56 p.m. ET. Also, NJN aired the twice-weekly Mega Millions drawings at 10:59 p.m. every Tuesday and Friday night, as well as the Wednesday and Saturday Powerball drawings at the equivalent time. On July 1, 2011, the New Jersey Lottery became the first lottery in the nation to stream their drawings, live, from the New Jersey Lottery's headquarters on either the New Jersey Lottery's website or the New Jersey Lottery's Ustream channel. On September 6, 2011, drawings returned to broadcast on television on NJTV on a one-hour tape delay; the live drawings continue to be held at the Lottery's headquarters and broadcast online. On June 4, 2012, the live drawings from the New Jersey Lottery's Ustream channel moved to Livestream. On January 1, 2013; the New Jersey Lottery drawings returned to broadcast television.

It was the seventh American bank to begin business in the United States and the second bank in Maryland. History Charter The Bank of Baltimore was chartered on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1795, with $1,200,000 capital in the city of Baltimore, Maryland. The bank was the seventh American bank to begin business in the United States and the second bank in Baltimore, and in Maryland.Mayer, \\"Baltimore: Past and Present: With Biographical Sketches of Its Representative Men\\", Richardson & Bennett, 1871, page 126. The Charter provided that subscriptions would be opened the first Monday of the following June 1796 for 1,240 shares under the superintendence of the leading business men and civic leaders of Baltimore, including: *David Stewart *William Winchester *Thorowgood Smith (future mayor) *William Wilson *Archibald Stewart *George Salmon *James West *Thomas Usher, Jr. *Henry Payson (Unitarian Church founder) *Thomas Hollingsworth *Nicholas Rogers (of \\"Druid Hill\\") *Elias Ellicott *Joseph Swann *Andrew Buchanan *Solomon Etting *Charles Ghequiere *Hugh McGurdy *Christopher Johnston Subscriptions for stock were also received from other parts of the state. On October 14, 1796, the bank's share-holding members elected directors: *David Stewart *William Wilson *William Winchester *George Salmon *James West *William Lorman *Elias Ellicott *John Stump *John Stricker (future militia general in War of 1812) *Charles Gehquiere *Christopher Johnston *Solomon Etting *Lewis Pascault *Charles Ridgely *Thorowgood Smith (future mayor) Smith, Hollingsworth, Winchester and Etting were authorized to receive proposals for offices or a house or securing a lot on which to erect a bank building. 1790s During the years 1790 to 1800 the Bank of Maryland, first financial institution in the newly emergent Town and City of Baltimore (town incorporated as a city, 1796-1797) and the state of Maryland and was in need of increased capital to meet demand. The Bank unsuccessfully attempted to double its capital in 1795. As a substitute, the B. of M. proposed to the General Assembly of Maryland, (the Maryland State Legislature) to grant a charter to establish another bank which might later consolidate with the Bank of Maryland, upon consent of both parties. this clause was later stricken and so this \\"Bank of Baltimore\\" was chartered as an entirely separate institution, receiving its charter in 1795. However, the Bank of Maryland might later become a holder of the Bank of Baltimore stock.Alfred, Cookman Bryan, History of State Banking in Maryland, Johns Hopkins Press, 1899, page 16. The charter of this bank was for 20 years and the state reserved the right to subscribe for 6000 shares at $300 each, and appoint two of seventeen directors annually. The first president of the bank was George Salman, elected in 1796 and served until 1807. Additional presidents during the B. of B.'s first century were as follows: William Wilson, 1807 and succeeded in 1824 by Brig. Gen. John Stricker (of 1814's Battles of North Point and Baltimore fame in the War of 1812) until his death June 23, 1825, and William Lorman was elected in his place. Mr. Lorman was succeeded by Joseph H. McCulloh in 1841 who was followed in December 1853 by C.C. Jamison, the former chief cashier, who died a decade later Sept. 9, 1863. On Oct. 1, 1863, Gen. Henry A. Thompson was elected as the seventh president, serving until his death on March 12, 1880. He in turn was followed by Christian Devries. Cashiers The bank had only four chief cashiers during its existence: *James Cox, served 1796-1841 *C.C. Jamison, 1841-1853 *Patrick Gibson, 1853-1868 *J. Thomas Smith, 1868-1881 Location The bank was in one location for its place of business from its organization to its first century, but the building of that time was not completed until 1856-1857. Reorganization The institution was reorganized as the \\"National Bank of Baltimore\\" in July 1865. During its first century, it had not missed any payments of dividends or made any reduction in the amount of its capital. However, in November 1864, along with several other city banks, it suffered from a gang of forgers and in December later that year a temporary loss of $23,000 from a falsification by one of its clerks, however later made good. On September 17, 1878, $27,850 in bonds and $35,000 in cash were stolen from the vaults in broad daylight. The capital stock of the bank in 1880 was $1,210,700 and its surplus fund was $365,000.Col. J. Thomas Scharf, The Chronicles of Baltimore, Oxford University, 1874, page 260. The capital of the bank was fixed by the General Assembly of Maryland, the state legislature at $1,200,000, though the petitioners wanted the limit placed at $3,000,000, with provision for increasing it ultimately to $9,000,000, as growth demanded. In 1795, the two banks (\\"Maryland\\" and \\"Baltimore\\") had an aggregate capital of $1,500,000 which was actively employed in the city of Baltimore whose export in trade was valued at more than $9,000,000 and which was rapidly growing in the area of manufacturing. Maryland's total exports for 1799 were $16,300,000. In 1802, the third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson from 1801 until 1809, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin expressing concerns that the Government was granting too many demands to the First Bank of the United States political lobby. This concerned President Jefferson because this would grant the United States Bank the ability to \\"shallow up the other\\" smaller banks such at the Bank of Baltimore whose stock was owned by U.S. citizens and create a monopoly over the entire beginning American banking industry that would be controlled by foreign powers since the majority of stock of the United States Bank was held by citizens and subjects of other countries. Jefferson was concerned that this situation would cause problems for the United States in the even of future conflict with a foreign power and as such he supported the Bank of Baltimore's application for a deposit of government funds.Thomas Jefferson, \\"The Writings of Thomas Jefferson\\", G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1897, page 172. Both the Bank of Maryland contributed to the infamous \\"Baltimore bank riot\\" in August 1835, after the bank encountered financial problems the year before in 1834. Along with a series of other civil strife in the crowded and dirty city which spread to several other city financial and public institutions with extensive downtown fights, burnings and civil unrest, along with mobs of disgruntled citizens torching of several prominent citizens' and civic leaders' townhouses such as Reverdy Johnson, William Glenn, and mansions, predating the worse and far deeper and longer of the first major national financial recession of the so-called \\"Panic of 1837\\" two years later which marred the reputation and the end of the Andrew Jackson presidential administration and his unregulated free-wheeling financial policies. Bank failure The Bank of Baltimore failed during the financial recession known as the \\"Panic of 1857\\".David Morier Evans, \\"History of the Commercial Crises 1857-58 and the Stock Exchange Panic of 1859\\", Ayer Publishing, 1969, page 186. Other banks An additional financial institution of a similar name entitled the \\"Savings Bank of Baltimore\\" was chartered in 1818 with a general meeting held on \\"New Year's Day\\", January 1, 1818, at Gadsly's Hotel (or Gadsby's?) with the Right Rev. James Kemp presiding, the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland with Isaac Burneston as secretary. After examing the plans and situations of several similar other thrift institutions in other cities, it was resolved that it was expedient to establish a Savings or Provident Bank in Baltimore. David Winchester, Henry Brice and Charles G. Appleton were accordingly appointed a committee to draft a constitution which was later reported on and adopted at the following meeting on January 15, when the same committee and the addition of Abner Neal and Isaac McPherson were authorized to call upon the citizens of Baltimore with appropriate publicity to become members of the association. An election was then held on February 2, 1818, at the Gadsby's Hotel (near the wharves) and the following were elected as directors for the following twelve months: *Daniel Howland (also as President) *Samuel J. Donaldson *Fred W. Brune *John Hoffman *W.R. Swift *Roswell L. Colt *John Sinclair *Alexander Irvine *Charles Warfield *Isaac Tyson *William Krebs *John McKean *Thomas W. Griffith, (author/historian) *William Childs *Joseph Cushing *Henry Brice *Henry Lorman *Evan T. Ellicott *William Hopkins *William Stewart *Thomas Sheppard *George S. Baker *John C. Richards On March 16, 1818, the bank opened for the reception of deposits at No. 100 Market Street (now Baltimore Street). The first report of January 15, 1819 reported that: Deposits $15,957.00 (138 depositers) Withdrawals $3,308.44 (41 depositers) Leaving to the credit of depositers: $12,648.62 Interest that has accrued: $342.37 Disbursements: Interest paid depositers: $89.82 Amount paid for stationery: $74.92 Salary paid for secretary (1 year): $150.00 Sub-total, disbursements: $314.74, Interest in U.S. Bonds, at 6%: $6,000 Amount placed in local bank with interest at 6%: $6,676.25 TOTAL disbursements: $12,990.99. The Bank was further chartered by the State on January 30, 1819. In March 1819, the list and occupations of depositers were as follows: *9 widows *9 spinsters *7 married women *16 female servants *2 clergymen *5 schoolmasters *2 merchants *2 farmers *5 charitable societies *9 minors *4 clerks *40 mechanics *5 tavern-keepers *5 draymen *6 laborer *10 tailors *3 barbers *3 bootblacks *2 sailors *13 male servants Which totaled 157 depositers. In 1834, the Bank was situated in the basement level of the landmark Merchants' Exchange (designed by famous architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe, built 1815-1820), with the entrance at South Gay Street, between Water and East Lombard Streets. In 1846, the dwelling of Col. Thomas Tenant at the northwest corner of South Gay and Second Streets was purchased for $10,000 and the S.B. of B. moved there in September. At one time the Bank was only open one day out of the week and its business conducted by the directors in person who were divided into committees and performed a large portion of the clerical labor. Comparing the financial statistics in 1880 below with those of the first year of 1818-1819, above: Amount of funds, Dec. 31, 1879: $13,667,002.01 Received from depositers in 1880: $2,647,222.03 Interest on loans, dividends on stocks, etc. in 1880: $796,695.43 Less premiums paid on stocks purchased: ($176,771.50) Total funds: $16,934,148.87. Amount paid depositers during 1880, including principal and interest: $2,185,965.64 Amount paid to expenses: $30,894.50 Amount paid to taxes: $20,730.88 Total Expenses: $2,237,591.02 TOTAL amount of funds on hand, Dec. 31, 1880: $14,696,557.85. Eventually the Savings Bank of Baltimore grew with both the small and large savings of many of the city's citizens, rich and poor, great and minor. In 1907 after the Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904, which devastated the downtown business district, the Bank built a \\"Temple of Thrift\\", a beautiful landmark Greco-Roman pillared marble headquarters building at the geographic center of the city at the southeast corner of South Charles Street and East Baltimore Street. In the 1980s, the S.B.B. expanded its offices into a narrow office building to its east and re- cladding the front façade to resemble the older Classical style of its 1907 headquarters. Later years Later by the 1990s, it relocated its headquarters two blocks further east to a new skyscraper at the northwest corner of East Baltimore Street and North Calvert Street (on the former site of the famous artist Rembrandt Peale's second site for his \\"Baltimore Museum and Gallery of Fine Arts\\" of the 1830s, later operated by the infamous P.T. Barnum, and later the 1884 Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Central Headquarters building [perished in the Great Fire of 1904], replaced by the also landmark Emerson Hotel, constructed by Capt. Isaac Edward Emerson of the Emerson Drug Company and \\"Bromo-Seltzer\\" fame) and next to the also newly constructed Union Trust Company of Maryland (later the Wells Fargo Tower) skyscraper to the west in the block facing St. Paul Street changing to Light Street going south - went through several quick mergers and bank name changes, now owned by Wells Fargo Bank originally of the Far West in California and an icon of \\"Old West\\" history with its stagecoach heritage). Finally supposedly to simplify its name after 170 years of history, tradition and reputation, dropping the word \\"Savings\\" from its title, becoming briefly known as the \\"Bank of Baltimore Building\\". This later \\"Bank of Baltimore\\" is one of the several predecessor banks that were eventually consolidated two decades later into an out-of-town financial institution SunTrust with headquarters in another prime city, making Baltimore a \\"branch town\\".

Professional career The tall 6'3 South African boxer began his career in 1985 with 17 straight wins. He then lost to ex-champ Mike Weaver by 7th round KO. He later avenged this defeat by knocking out Mike Weaver in two rounds and in 1989 challenged Francesco Damiani for the vacant WBO heavyweight title. Du Plooy was knocked out in the third round in the World Boxing Organization's inaugural heavyweight world title bout. After this, he fought 15 more fights, compiling an overall record of 27 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. All of du Plooy's losses were stoppages to known opponents such as Renaldo Snipes, Francesco Damiani, Pierre Coetzer, and Corrie Sanders.

It broadcasts documentaries, news, special events coverage and discussion programmes. Phoenix's headquarters are in Bonn, the former West German capital. Programming Phoenix broadcasts a deaf-subtitled version of the Tagesschau, ARD's flagship news broadcast, and ZDF's premier news broadcast Heute-Journal, in German Sign Language. The channel's flagship news broadcast is Der Tag (\\"The Day\\"), which airs from 11:00 pm to midnight. Its length enables extended reports and interviews to be included. The show Vor Ort (\\"On Scene\\") includes live coverage of political events, public lectures by important personalities, press conferences and assemblies of the Bundestag and Bundesrat. Daily talk shows like Phoenix Runde (Phoenix Roundtable) with Pinar Atalay or Alexander Kähler, Unter den Linden with Michaela Kolster or Michael Hirz, discuss current topics with experts or politicians. As a benchmark in coverage, a \\"Meet the Press\\"-like show, Internationaler Frühschoppen is broadcast Sunday at 12 noon when the ARD's Presseclub is not broadcast. The series \\"Historische Debatten\\" (\\"Historical Debates\\") and \\"Historische Ereignisse\\" (\\"Historical Events\\"), with journalist Helmut Illert, examine important topics relating to the development of the Federal Republic of Germany. Phoenix is comparable to the American channel C-SPAN or the British BBC Parliament, because they also cover government and national politics. Creation The creation of Phoenix is credited to the former chancellor Helmut Kohl, who wanted to create a \\"European Parliamentary Channel\\". However, the idea was rejected due to criticism by the public channels (ARD and ZDF) and suspicion that political pressure from Kohl could lead to a \\"Helmut-Kohl-Channel\\". The real idea for \\"Phoenix - Der Ereignis- und Dokumentationskanal\\" (\\"Phoenix - the current affairs and documentary channel\\") came from viewers of ARD and ZDF, who wanted a \\"media-political correction of faults in the system of information transfer\\". This created the opportunity to create a \\"Parliamentary Channel\\", with the aim of increasing credibility and satisfying consumer demand. Private channels (RTL and Sat. 1) criticized the creation of Phoenix because they were at the time creating their own news channels (n-tv and N24 respectively). The headquarters of Phoenix were provisionally situated in Cologne. However, in 2000, the headquarters were relocated to studios in Bonn. Phoenix's highest ratings to date were in August 2006, when it had 1.0% viewer share. With about 4.5 million viewers, it had more viewers than N-TV and N24.  Alignment of programming  Phoenix's stated aim is it to create \\"balance of the shortening of information, which are seen in news and magazines on television\\". The programming should be a \\"truthful illustration of the reality in correspondence with the constitutional order of the funded broadcast and television stations in Germany\\". The target is fulfilled with current reportages and documentaries from the vast archive of ARD and ZDF, as well as international productions from Discovery Channel and the BBC, dubbed into German.

His name, meaning \\"skilled advisor,\\" is spelled in a variety of ways in colonial records. Depending on the language of the recorder, it was transliterated as Netawatwees, Netahutquemaled, Netodwehement, and Netautwhalemund. In English, he was known as the Newcomer. During the French and Indian War, he led his tribe to present-day Ohio and the confluence of the Tuscarawas River with the Muskingum River, where he was chief of the village Gekelukpechink. Later he moved with his Lenape tribe to the village of Coshocton, a center of their settlement on the Tuscarawas. He signed the Fort Pitt treaty with Continental/United States forces, allying with the rebels and hoping to gain a Native American state in the new nation. Biography Netawatwees was probably born in the lower Delaware River Valley around 1686. He was part of the Unami-speaking Lenape, the southern part of this coastal people whose territory extended to the lower Hudson River, western Long Island, and Connecticut. When he was young, he moved west with his family and tribe to escape encroachment from European-American colonists. In July 1758, he was living in a Delaware Indian settlement at the mouth of Beaver Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River below Pittsburgh. Records identify him as \\"ye great man of the Unami nation.\\" Netawatwees moved to Ohio with other migrant Delaware during the French and Indian War (1754–63). He favored alliances with the English in that conflict, which was part of the Seven Years' War between England and France in Europe. He established a village near present-day Cuyahoga Falls. From there, he moved to the Tuscarawas, a tributary of the Muskingum, where he became chieftain of the Delaware town called Gekelukpechink, meaning \\"still water.\\" This town, which became known as Newcomer's Town, was on the north bank of the Tuscarawas on the eastern outskirts of present-day Newcomerstown. One war captive who was a member of this communuty was Mary Harris who had been about 10 years old in the 1704 raid on Deerfield Massachusetts; in 1751 she was living in the Delaware town Gekelukpechink aka Newcomer's Town bear the site of Newcomerstown, Ohio Tuscarawas County Ohio. See Christopher Gist Journal January 14, 1751 Gist Journal .p.41 in 1756 she was reported living near an Indian village near Montreal Canada .pp.114-115. An oft repeated legend that Mary Harris was involved in the naming of Newcomerstown because of another white captive woman who killed Harris Indian husband see but see Gist's own Journal entries .p.39 and pp.114-115 The Great Council met here until the Delaware population was consolidated at nearby Coshocton. Although Netawatwees never converted to Christianity, he was influenced by the Moravian missionaries. Infirm in his old age, he was succeeded by White Eyes in 1776. His dying word on October 31, 1776, implored the Delaware to give up their native practices and follow the teachings of the Moravian pastors. Family Netawatwees married and he and his wife had a family together. Their son Bemino (John Killbuck Sr.) became a renowned war leader allied with the French during the French and Indian War. His grandson was Gelelemend (1737–1811), or John Killbuck Jr., a Delaware chief active during the American Revolutionary War.

It is situated within a walk of the eastern terminus of the line, at Dalegarth station. The station opened to passengers in 1876. In the days of the 3ft gauge railway, this was the last place where the railway met the main valley road, and as such had a greater number of facilities than other stations, including a goods yard and shed, and a chocolate vending machine in the waiting shelter. Between 1918 and 1922, Beckfoot was the upper terminus of the railway prior to the extension of the line to the present terminus at Dalegarth. The original station building survived for some time into the 15 inch gauge era, but had been demolished by the time the preservationists took over in 1960. The station is unstaffed at all times, and is only long. It can be accessed either by steps or from, the road which crosses the line, east of the station. It differs from the other stations in that passengers will only be picked up here on down journeys (Dalegarth-Ravenglass) and will only be set down here on up journeys (Ravenglass-Dalegarth). This is because the station is close to Dalegarth, and to save stopping for passengers completing very short journeys. There is a level crossing at the eastern end of the platform, marking the beginning of the private road from Beckfoot to Dalegarth cottages which runs for half a mile eastwards. This road is known as Beckfoot Lonnin and walkers can continue behind the Cottages at the end of the Lonnin up to the original 3' gauge railway station at Boot village. The station is from Ravenglass and from Dalegarth. Accessibility Due to the length of the platform, the railway are unable to accommodate wheelchair passengers, for health & safety reasons.

He released his debut album, Scallywag Jaz in 1987. His last album release (to date) was The German Alphabet released in September 2016. Lang toured with his band throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, and built up a loyal following, as well as appearing with Jools Holland's band on the TV show The Happening in 1990, and several residencies at the world-famous London jazz venue, Ronnie Scott's. Lang still plays live in the UK and occasionally further afield. He was one of the consortium who successfully battled to save Liverpool's Parr Street Recording Studios (a studio known for its work with Coldplay, Doves, Embrace, Elbow and Badly Drawn Boy). On 25 August 2006, Lang duetted with fellow Liverpool singer Jennifer John on the anthemic \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" at Liverpool's Matthew Street Music Festival. He returned to the recording studio in Liverpool at the end of October 2006 and started recording new songs. The first tracks to be recorded were \\"Scared\\" and \\"I Believe\\". In March 2014, Lang released the live album Torch, which was recorded on 16 April 2011 at the Rodewald Suite, in Liverpool Philharmonic Hall.

It has a café and shop for passengers, along with a run-round loop, turntable and siding for trains. It is located next to the Whillan Beck, a tributary of the River Esk flowing from the isolated Burnmoor Tarn. History The station has stood on this site since the mid-1920s, when it was moved from in front of the nearby miners' cottages (now home to employees of the railway). In the days of the 3' gauge line, the station was at Boot, but soon after the conversion of the final stretch to 15\\" gauge, it became apparent that the miniature locomotives could not cope with the gradient, and the line was diverted to the current station, which is on the route of a late-Victorian mine branch from the cottages to Gill Force, across the River Esk. The former route to Boot can still be seen and walked. For about 80 years, the station building was a converted second-hand hut from the weapons testing establishment at Eskmeals near Ravenglass. The current building, utilising its railway embankment site to create a split-level layout with an education/meeting suite below the main café and shop area, was opened on 21 April 2007 by music producer and railway enthusiast Pete Waterman. At the climax of the Cumbria shootings in 2010, passengers had to remain within the station building under armed guard. Present Day Today, the station houses the Fellbites Eatery and Scafell Gift Shop (which also acts as a booking office) that are open when the railway are running scheduled passenger trains, where locomotives can be seen detaching from the rolling stock and coupling onto the other end for the return journey to Ravenglass. Scafell Gift Shop has a range of products similar to that of Ravenglass. The station has two platforms with a turntable at the Eastern extremity of the line and a water tank at the Western end of platform 1. The station grounds also have amenities such as toilets and paid car parking on site, with 2 free electric car charge points.https://ravenglass-railway.co.uk/plan- visit/accessibility/dalegarth-station/arrival-parking/ Boot village is a 5-minute walk from the station, and has a restored water mill together with the Boot Inn and Brook House Inn. Accessibility Wheelchair passengers should reserve a wheelchair space prior to the day of travel, so that the railway can accommodate such passengers.

Set in the early 1980s, it follows the adventures of fictional video game company GameaVision. The show ran for two seasons, from 2007 to 2008, on G4 and G4 Canada. Plot The plot of Code Monkeys revolves around the fictitious video game company GameaVision (a play on companies like Activision and Intellivision) and its eccentric employees, mainly the slacker Dave and his high-strung friend Jerry. The entire series takes place in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale, California during the 1980s. Code Monkeys relies on crude humor and stoner comedy to convey the numerous references to video games, past and present, but mostly games from the 8-bit era. This also extends to cameos from well known video game developers, who appear in the show pitching their ideas to GameaVision for the games that would later make them famous, usually to be rejected, insulted, and sometimes injured or killed off. Episode structure A screenshot from \\"Code Monkeys\\", showcasing elements of the show: the health meter (upper-right), score (upper-left) and text box (bottom). Code Monkeys is presented as though it were an 8-bit video game. In keeping with this format, characters, backgrounds and other objects are rendered with an 8-bit color palette, occasionally leading to trouble animating specific objects. Most episodes begin with a screen flashing \\"PLAYER 1 START!\\";In \\"Psychological Problems\\", the usual start of the episode—a screen flashing \\"PLAYER 1 START!\\"—was preceded by a screen that was similar to the multicart loading of a game, resembling the 3-in-1 Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt/World Class Track Meet multigame. episodes end with a black \\"Game Over\\" screen, with a \\"kill screen\\" appearing after the production company logo in the first season. Before each commercial break, a small pause box typically appears in the middle of the screen which freezes the scene. On the two occasions when Jerry \\"dies\\", a \\"Game Over/Continue?\\" box appears, with the \\"player\\" contemplating selecting \\"No\\", but then choosing \\"Yes\\" to continue the episode. Near the end of \\"Todd Loses His Mind\\", the episode \\"crashes\\" abruptly, forcing the \\"player\\" to eject the \\"game cartridge\\" to blow dust off its connectors, and the episode is reset to its beginning, thus negating everything that happened in the episode. The show also features status bars at the top and bottom of the frame, which display a running counter of points earned by the characters doing video game-like actions in each episode, a health meter for the current characters, narrative asides based on certain characters' actions or dialogue, and other humorous sayings or pictures based on an episode's story line. Characters also use similar methods to show emotions, such as air humping (usually to exaggerate sexuality or awesomeness), or throwing up the sign of the horns. The show is entirely computer animated, with the exception of the \\"game crash\\" scene in \\"Todd Loses His Mind\\", and is done in-house at the G4 studios in Los Angeles. The original music for the show, video game-styled underscore, is composed by Jon and Al Kaplan. Other music prominently featured in the series includes music by Los Angeles heavy metal group Tinhorn. Jonathan Coulton's song \\"Code Monkey\\" serves as the theme song of the show. Characters *Dave (voiced by Adam de la Peña) — Dave is the lead character of the show and the de facto lead programmer at GameaVision. A constant slacker, he focuses his attention more on playing games than actually making them. Dave is also a frequent cannabis user; he claimed that most of his game ideas were conceived while he was high. Dave often grosses out his co-workers by either throwing up in front of them, having his pants down at inopportune moments, humping random people or objects, or performing other lewd acts. A rampant hedonist, the only things that seem to motivate Dave are money, drugs, and sex. Most of the show's and characters' predicaments are caused by Dave's erratic and impulsive actions. While he considers Jerry to be his best friend, Dave often insults him and manipulates his emotions. Despite his quirks, Dave has a flair to all of his actions and is a competent game programmer. *Jerry (voiced by Matt Mariska) — Jerry is the show's other main character and Dave's best friend, fellow programmer, and office-mate. Unlike Dave, Jerry is hard-working, responsible, and tidy. However, usually under Dave's negative influence, Jerry will succumb to sinful pleasures, often with disastrous outcomes. Jerry's running gags throughout the series deal with his unrequited crush on fellow programmer Mary (who constantly rejects him), fixing the damage Dave causes, wetting himself when nervous or threatened, and his insecurities and weak will. *Bob \\"Big\\" T. Larrity (voiced by Andy Sipes) — Mr. Larrity is the current head of GameaVision, a Texan billionaire who bought the company from Steve Wozniak, despite the fact that he knows nothing about video games, only that they're sure to make him rich. Larrity often employs various illegal methods to make his fortune. In addition to being ignorant, Larrity is violent, manic, bigoted, and misogynistic. Despite his apparent stupidity, Larrity can be quite cunning and manipulative. He treats his employees with no respect, but still cares about them to some degree, particularly for Dave, Jerry, and Benny who he sees as his surrogate sons. Larrity and Black Steve also share a begrudging respect for each other over their shooting prowess. *Dean Larrity (voiced by Andy Sipes) — Dean is Mr. Larrity's extremely muscular son. He is appointed by his father as GameaVision's Head Supervisor. Dean has limited interaction with the other employees, doesn't participate in any of the programming, and doesn't even seem to do any actual work, aside from helping his dad cover up his illegal activities. He often uses violence to solve problems. *Todd (voiced by Dana Snyder) — Todd is GameaVision's resident fantasy game designer, an obese 33-year-old geek who is always seen wearing a horned helmet. Todd's narcissism, use of pretentious language, and eccentricity, often blurring the lines between his Dungeon and Dragons- inspired fantasy and reality, makes him the most despised employee at the company; other characters often refer to him as \\"creepy\\" and \\"douche\\". Todd also lives with his mother, with whom he has a (very) near-incestuous relationship. *Black Steve (voiced by Tony Strickland) — Black Steve is GameaVision's accountant and, as his nickname would imply, he is the only black person working at the company. He is foul-mouthed, ill-tempered and racist against white people. Despite his position, Black Steve has contributed games to the company, mostly themed to his prejudice towards white people. He is apparently fluent in Japanese and conversational Arabic. He is also a former pro wrestler known as \\"The Black Shadow\\" as well as graduate of Dartmouth. Though bigoted towards whites, Black Steve does coexist with his co-workers and even has garnered Larrity's respect due to his violent temper and love of guns. *Mary (voiced by Gretchen McNeil) — Mary is GameaVision's sole female programmer, and consequently isn't taken seriously by any of the other sexist employees, with the exception of Jerry, who has a major crush on her but is rebuffed due to his friendship with Dave and overall spinelessness. Compared to her boss and co-workers, Mary is considered to be the most level- headed employee at GameaVision. She is often accused of being a lesbian because of her strong beliefs in feminism; a majority of the games she designs are targeted at girls or revolve around women's issues in some way. *Clare (voiced by Suzanne Keilly) — Clare is GameaVision's receptionist. The antithesis to Mary, Clare is airheaded, self-centered, self-conscious, and sexually promiscuous, even going as far as partaking in BDSM-related activities. However, like Mary, Clare is often treated with little to no respect by her co-workers. *Benny (voiced by Dana Snyder) — Benny is a Korean child, illegally adopted by Larrity to test the company's games. He is fed a diet of cigarettes, Pixy Stix, bags of pure sugar, and amphetamines to stunt his growth and keep him game-testing nonstop. As a result, Benny is constantly hyper and usually spends his time roaming through the building's ventilation and plumbing systems, making a side living selling things to employees. No game can be shipped without Benny's approval, which causes the programmers, namely Dave and Jerry, to repeatedly bribe him with (often illegal) treats and toys. He is often accompanied by a taciturn, muscular bodyguard. *Clarence (voiced by Lionel Tubbins) — Clarence is GameaVision's audio designer. Flamboyantly gay, he wears sparkly jumpsuits, sings effectively all of his dialogue, and constantly makes blatant references to gay sex. He has also demonstrated the abilities to levitate and pass through walls, using \\"gay magic\\" which can be toggled on and off, possibly a play on the \\"fairy\\" pejorative of homosexuality. Occasionally, Clarence pitches homosexually- themed games to the company. History While working on the pilot for Minoriteam, Adam de la Peña began writing a script for what would become Code Monkeys. The original title for the show was Dave And Jerry VS The World, but the name was changed to Code Monkeys after receiving the rights to use the Jonathan Coulton song of the same name. After making a seven-minute animation test, he began shopping for a network to broadcast the show. He settled with G4 because he thought they understood the premise of the show the most. G4 allowed him to make a full-length pilot and subsequently picked up the show for 13 episodes and after a successful first season ratings-wise, the show was picked up for a second season. Several months before Code Monkeys began airing, G4 launched an advertising campaign for the show in which GameaVision was presented as a real game company. There were two commercial advertisements for the fictitious games \\"Crosswalk\\" and \\"Barfight\\", the games \\"Sir Eats-A- Lot\\" and \\"Floating Space Rocks\\" were featured in a \\"Cheat! G-Spot\\" segment, and \\"Barfight\\" was featured in an episode of Attack of the Show. G4 created a website for GameaVision's, featuring two playable games: \\"2 Card Monte\\", which cannot be won; and \\"Hangman\\", which contains fewer than 10 words, all of which are meant to insult the player. On February 27, 2017, Adam De La Pena tweeted \\"And then there's this....gameavision.com\\", hinting at the show's return. As of 2020, nothing has come to materialize. Episodes Season 1 (2007)  Season 2 (2008) Reception According to the president of G4, the first season was a huge success for the network. During its first season the show was watched by more than 20 million people. Since its inception, Code Monkeys has received mixed reviews. Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times called the show a \\"promising idea [with] gags [told in a South Park deadpan dialect that] has a fast free-for-all quality, as if they were produced by a zealous Galaga player with his palm down flat on the \\"fire\\" button.\\" Scott Jon Siegel of Joystiq agreed, saying that \\"Code Monkeys has potential, [but] squanders it.\\" He went on to say that \\"there was hope that G4 could deliver something actually watchable. [Code Monkeys] isn't.\\" Jake Swearingen of Wired magazine stated that the show would appeal to \\"anyone who spent their youth blowing dust out of Nintendo cartridges and developing Contra-induced carpal tunnel syndrome.\\" Furthermore, he compared Code Monkeys to arcade games of the 1980s, stating \\"[m]uch like the classics it riffs on, Code quickly veers into the wildly surreal.\\" Andy Grieser of Zap2it called the show \\"the funniest ... animation this side of South Park.\\" He called the graphics \\"instant nostalgia for thirty-somethings.\\" Will Harris of Bullz-Eye.com gave the show a 3.5/5 and commented that Code Monkeys is a \\"twisted little show\\", but that it's \\"not for all tastes.\\" Streaming The series is available for streaming on Peacock. Home release Shout! Factory, partnering with G4, released a two-disc DVD set of the first season of Code Monkeys on August 5, 2008 in Region 1. {  - A62626\\"  colspan=\\"6\\"  Code Monkeys: Season One -valign=\\"top\\"  align=\\"center\\" width=\\"400\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Set Details  width=\\"400\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"3\\"Special Features -valign=\\"top\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\" * 13 Episodes * 2-Disc Set * 1.33:1 aspect ratio * Subtitles: None * English (Stereo 2.0)  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\" width=\\"400\\" * \\"Adam de la Peña Interview\\" * \\"A Look Behind the Scenes of Code Monkeys\\" * \\"Daily Pranks\\" * \\"GameaVision's 'Hangman'\\" * \\"Original Commercials\\" * \\"Gaming Tips from Kristin Holt\\" * \\"GameaVision's '2 Card Monty'\\" * Downloadable Wallpapers and Posters - } References External links * * Category:American flash adult animated television series Category:2000s American adult animated television series Category:2000s American black comedy television series Category:2007 American television series debuts Category:2008 American television series endings Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:English- language television shows Category:G4 (American TV network) original programming Category:Cartoons animated with Adobe After Effects Category:Television shows about video games Category:Television series set in the 1980s ","title":"Code Monkeys"},{"id":"10953151","text":"Porsche 918 Spyder development mule in Monaco camouflaged pre-production BMW X5 mule near Munich in October 2013 Honda Civic mules at Badwater Basin A development mule (test mule, or simply mule) in the automotive industry is a testbed vehicle equipped with prototype components requiring evaluation.

Mules may also have advanced chassis and powertrain designs from a prospective vehicle that need testing, which can be effectively concealed in the body and interior of a similarly sized production model. If no comparable vehicle is available in-house or an external benchmark is being used mules may be based on another manufacturer's model. For example, in the 1970s the new powertrain package of first-generation Ford Fiesta was developed using mules based on the then class-leading Fiat 127, as Ford had no comparable compact model of similar size to utilize. Mules are also used to conceal styling changes and visible telltales of performance alterations in near-production vehicles, receiving varying degrees of camouflage to deceive rival makers and thwart a curious automotive press. Such alterations can span from distracting shrinkwrap designs, somewhat reminiscent of dazzle camouflage, to substituting crude cylindric shapes for taillights, non- standard wheels, or assemblages of plastic and tape to hide a vehicle's shape and design elements. Development mules are often used very heavily during testingFor example, \\"...pushed the development mule to ...\\" and scrapped. Occasionally they are acquired by members of the automaker's engineering team or executives overseeing the design process.

Its full title is Corographia Açorica, ou Descripção Phísica, Política e Histórica dos Açores, por um cidadão açorense, M. da Sociedade Patriótica Phylantropya n'os Açores (literally, Azorean Corography or Physical, Political and Historic Descriptions of the Azores for the Azorean Citizen by the Patriotic Philanthropic Society in the Azores). It was written in 1822 by Azorean politician João Soares de Albergaria de Sousa and is considered the first political manifestation of Azorean sovereignty or autonomy relative to the Kingdom of Portugal. The 133-page manifesto first appeared in Lisbon in 1822–João Soares de Albergaria de Sousa lived there at the time—where it was published by João Nunes Esteves. In 1975, Rainer Daehnhardt of the separatist Frente de Libertação dos Açores created 500 copies of the document. A more recent 1995 edition released by the publisher Jornal de Cultura in Ponta Delgada has a preface by José Guilherme Reis Leite. Themes Apart from its descriptions of history and geographical contexts, the document is a political manifesto. Generally, it proposes solutions for social and class issues in Azorean society and traces the origins of the pro-regional autonomy position that emerged in the 19th century. The author demonstrated a liberal conviction that was politically radical for the time. He proposed a political ideology \\"against absolutism and despotism\\". The social groups most referenced by the author were the \\"traditionally dominant classes\\": :...the stupid, tepid, and above all incapable, the noble class and especially the military class. He extended his \\"criticisms to the intellectual class\\", in particular to lawyers, public magistrates, and businessmen, but spared the working class. :The middle class is the depository of principal virtues: moderate by habit, very laborious, the propensity for all professional arts, in particular as seamen. The \\"farmer or rural class\\" is eulogized for its \\"excellent qualities\\". According to the author, these people also had deficiencies: :[they´re] little patriotic, and very superstitious, because they still live in ignorance. Portuguese historian Maria Isabel João suggests Albergaria de Sousa believed this ignorance was caused by despotism and lack of education. Public education in the form practiced in the Azores of the time was miserable: there were no secondary schools and educational institutions provided few social services. The idea of the \\"Fatherland\\" in Albergaria de Sousa's Corographia Açorica reflects the conception most common during that era: a person's birthplace, and in the context of the Azores, the island where they were born. The patriot, therefore, is a person who demonstrates the capacity to defend their territory. The text refers various times to the \\"general interest of the Fatherland\\" when talking about the Azores, and uses the term \\"Government of the Fatherland\\" to designate local Azorean governments. Maria Isabel João writes that the notion of the Azores and Azoreans as a separate nation and nationality permeates the Corographia Açorica. The idea of integrating the Azores into the larger Portuguese nation is not present in the document. The author refers to \\"colonies and metropoles\\" to express the idea of slavery or servitude of Azoreans to the Kingdom of Portugal. He believes a lack of patriotism renders Azoreans passive. It is clear that the Corographia articulates three basic concepts: Fatherland, colony, and metropole. However, it does not contain the modern concepts of a separatist manifesto. First, the concept of Fatherland is limited to tradition, and does not connote opposition to Portuguese nationalism. Second, the terms metropole and colony, although common during the era, had different meanings. On 26 February 1771, the Azores were designated a province of Portugal, but the administration continued to be exercised by the State, as was the case for other colonial possessions.

Function Fatty acyl–carnitine can diffuse from the cytosol across the porous outer mitochondrial membrane to the intermembrane space, but must utilize CACT to cross the nonporous inner mitochondrial membrane and reach the mitochondrial matrix. CACT is a cotransporter, returning one molecule of carnitine from the matrix to the intermembrane space as one molecule of fatty acyl–carnitine moves into the matrix. Clinical significance A disorder is associated with carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency. This disorder disrupts the carnitine shuttle system from moving fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane, leading to a decrease in fatty acid catabolism. The result is an accumulation of fatty acid within muscles and liver, decreased tolerance to long term exercise, inability to fast for more than a few hours, muscle weakness and wasting, and a strong acidic smell on the breath (due to protein catabolism).

He served as Archbishop of Bourges from 1943 to 1969, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1960. He was a cousin of the traditionalist Catholic cleric Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. Biography Joseph-Charles Lefèbvre was born in Tourcoing, and studied at the Catholic University of Lille, and the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical French Seminary in Rome. At the Gregorian, he received a gold medal from the Pope for his exceptional grades.TIME Magazine. Seven New Hats March 14, 1960 During his service in the French Army during World War I, Lefèbvre was wounded and captured by German forces in 1914, being later released in a prisoner exchange in 1918. Lefèbvre was ordained to the priesthood on December 17, 1921. In 1924 he began pastoral work in Poitiers, where he would also be made Director of Works, honorary canon, and vicar general. He was raised to the rank of Monsignor on December 28, 1936. On July 27, 1938, Lefèbvre was appointed Bishop of Troyes by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 11 from Bishop Edouard-Gabriel Mesguen, with Bishops Joseph-Jean Heintz and Louis Liagre serving as co-consecrators. Lefebvre was later promoted to Archbishop of Bourges on June 17, 1943. In order to stop the growing French rebellion against papal authority, Lefèbvre suggested to \\"throw light on the essential teachings of the Church in contemporary affairs--political, social and economic\\".TIME Magazine. Rebellious Eldest Daughter May 13, 1957 Pope John XXIII, whom Lefèbvre had befriended while the former served as Nuncio to France, created him Cardinal Priest of S. Giovanni Battista dei Fiorentini in the consistory of March 28, 1960. Lefèbvre attended the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), and was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Pope Paul VI. From 1965 to 1969, he was Representative of Cardinals at the French Episcopal Conference. Lefèbvre resigned as Bourges' archbishop on October 10, 1969, and died in that same city at age 81.

These enzymes catalyze the movement of ions or molecules across membranes or their separation within membranes. The reaction is designated as a transfer from “side 1” to “side 2” because the designations “in” and “out”, which had previously been used, can be ambiguous. Translocases are the most common secretion system in Gram positive bacteria. It is also a historical term for the protein now called elongation factor G, due to its function in moving the transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) through the ribosome. History The enzyme classification and nomenclature list was first approved by the International Union of Biochemistry in 1961. Six enzyme classes had been recognized based on the type of chemical reaction catalyzed, including oxidoreductases (EC 1), transferases (EC 2), hydrolases (EC 3), lyases (EC 4), isomerases (EC 5) and ligases (EC 6). However, it became apparent that none of these could describe the important group of enzymes that catalyse the movement of ions or molecules across membranes or their separation within membranes. Several of these involve the hydrolysis of ATP and had been previously classified as ATPases (EC 3.6.3.-), although the hydrolytic reaction is not their primary function. In August 2018, the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology classified these enzymes under a new enzyme class (EC) of translocases (EC 7). Enzyme Mechanism The reaction most translocases catalyse is: > AX + Bside 1 = A + X +  Bside 2 A clear example of an enzyme that follows this scheme is H+-transporting two- sector ATPase: > ATP + H2O + 4 H+side 1 = ADP + phosphate + 4 H+side 2 A) ATP-ADP translocase: protein responsible for the 1: 1 exchange of intramitochondrial ATP for ADP produced in the cytoplasm. B) Phosphate translocase: the transport of H2PO4- together with a proton are produced by symport H2PO4-/H+This ATPase carries out the dephosphorylation of ATP into ADP while it transports H+ to the other side of the membrane. However, other enzymes that also fall into this category do not follow the same reaction scheme. This is the case of ascorbate ferrireductase: > ascorbateside 1 \\\\+ Fe(III)side 2 = monodehydroascorbateside 1 \\\\+ Fe(II)side > 2 In which the enzyme only transports an electron in the catalysation of an oxidoreductase reaction between a molecule and an inorganic cation located on different sides of the membrane.  Functions and biological importance  The basic function, as already mentioned (see: ), is to \\"catalyse the movement of ions or molecules across membranes or their separation within membranes\\". This form of membrane transport is classified under active membrane transport, an energy-requiring process of pumping molecules and ions across membranes against a concentration gradient. Translocases biological importance relies primarily on their critical function, in the way that they provide movement across the cell's membrane in many cellular processes that are substantial, such as: * Oxidative phosphorylation > ADP/ATP translocase (ANT) imports adenosine diphosphate ADP from the cytosol > and exports ATP from the mitochondrial matrix, which are key transport steps > for oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotic organisms. ADP from the cytosol > is transported back into the mitochondrion for ATP synthesis and the > synthesised ATP, produced from oxidative phosphorylation, is exported out of > the mitochondrion for use in the cytosol, providing the cells with its main > energy currency. * Protein import into mitochondria TOM: Translocase of the outer membrane. Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM20. > Hundreds of proteins encoded by the nucleus are required for mitochondrial > metabolism, growth, division, and partitioning to daughter cells, and all of > these proteins must be imported into the organelle. Translocase of the outer > membrane (TOM) and translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) mediate the > import of proteins into the mitochondrion. The translocase of the outer > membrane (TOM) sorts proteins via several mechanisms either directly to the > outer membrane, the intermembrane space, or the translocase of the inner > membrane (TIM). Then, generally, the TIM23 machinery mediates protein > translocation into the matrix and the TIM22 machinery mediates insertion > into the inner membrane. *Fatty acids import into mitochondria (Carnitine Shuttle System) > Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) catalyzes both unidirectional > transport of carnitine and carnitine/acylcarnitine exchange in the inner > mitochondrial membrane, allowing the import of long-chain fatty acids into > the mitochondria where they are oxidized by the β-oxidation pathway. The > mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to long-chain fatty acids, hence the > need for this translocation.

The area is split between the cities of Manila and Pasay on the north side and Parañaque on the south. History The plan was to reclaim 3,000 hectares of land in Manila Bay. The project, formerly known as Boulevard 2000, was initiated by Imelda Marcos in 1977, with the creation of the Public Estate Authority (now Philippine Reclamation Authority) to manage the project. By the end of the Marcos rule in 1986, 660 hectares had been reclaimed, including the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex. On January 25, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order No. 35 and was organized as Manila Bay Freeport Zone. Description Bay City is administratively divided between the villages of Barangay 719 of Malate, Manila and Barangay 76 of Pasay in the northern Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex-Financial Center Area (CCP-FCA) section, and the villages of Barangay 76 of Pasay and Baclaran, Tambo and Don Galo of Parañaque in the southern Central Business Park and Asiaworld section. The area is most well known for being home of the SM Mall of Asia, the third largest mall in the Philippines, Aseana City, an integrated mixed use central business district serving the Bay Area, Entertainment City with Las Vegas-style casinos, amusement parks, theaters, office building, hotels, residential buildings and resorts. The project is under the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) owned by the Philippine government. Entertainment City is Asia's newest gaming and entertainment complex that PAGCOR proposed on of land on the reclamation area of Manila Bay. It lies on the western side of Roxas Boulevard in Parañaque and south of the SM Mall of Asia Complex. Investments to the project could reach up to $15 billion, which was scaled down from the more recent $20 billion budget announcement that had been previously announced in 2007. The first integrated resort complex to open in Entertainment City is Bloomberry-owned Solaire Resort & Casino on March 16, 2013. It was followed by City of Dreams Manila (soft opening December 14, 2014), Okada Manila (opened December 2016) and Resorts World Bayshore (opening in 2018). Although the PEA advertises Bay City as the \\"new business capital\\" of Manila, development is proceeding slowly. The main road in this area is Macapagal Boulevard which runs north–south through the center of Bay City. It is accessible from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport via the NAIA Expressway, and from the Makati CBD, Ortigas Center and Bonifacio Global City via Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA). Developments Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex The Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex covers the northernmost portion of Bay City and is under the jurisdiction of two cities, Manila (where it is part of the district of Malate) and Pasay. It is bounded by Manila Bay to the north and west, the Philippine Navy headquarters to the northeast, Roxas Boulevard to the east, and Jose Diokno Boulevard to the south. It is divided into two zones: the Art Zone, and the Commercial and Entertainment Zone. It features several brutalist structures designed in the 1960s and 1970s by Leandro Locsin, such as the Tanghalang Pambansa, the Philippine International Convention Center, and the Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila. Other locators in the complex include the Coconut Palace, the Manila Film Center and Star City amusement park. Financial Center Area The Financial Center Area covers the southern half () of the CCP-FCA island, the first land to be reclaimed under the Boulevard 2000 project of the Philippine Reclamation Authority. It is bounded by Jose Diokno Boulevard to the north, and the Libertad Channel to the south. The area includes the Philippine National Bank complex which also houses the Philippine Airlines headquarters, World Trade Center Metro Manila, Philippine Trade Training Center and the Government Service Insurance System complex which hosts the Senate of the Philippines. Central Business Park The Central Business Park (CBP) island covers the central portion of Bay City and is divided into three sections. The northernmost section, CBP I-A, has an area of and is home to the SM Central Business Park, the Metropolitan Park of the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, and the Philippine Reclamation Authority. The SM Central Business Park contains the corporate headquarters of SM Prime Holdings, as well as the SM Mall of Asia shopping mall complex which houses the Galeón museum and the SM by the Bay promenade. It also hosts the Mall of Asia Arena, SMX Convention Center, Conrad Manila, the Shrine of Jesus Church and a ferry terminal of the Metrostar Ferry. In the Metropolitan Park of Metrobank, the main locators are the BlueWave and Blue Bay Walk strip malls, Met Live shopping mall, Manila Tytana College and Le Pavilion. Other locations included in the said area are the DD Meridian Park of DoubleDragon Properties, a mixed-use development which houses the DoubleDragon Plaza and Hotel 101, and Walter Mart's W Mall. Immediately to the south are the CBP I-B and I-C lots occupied by the Aseana Business Park and PAGCOR's Entertainment City which is home to four multi-billion dollar casinos and integrated resorts: Solaire Resort & Casino, City of Dreams Manila, Okada Manila and the upcoming Westside City. The Aseana Business Park (Aseana City) is the location of the Neo- Chinatown, Aseana 1-3 Office Buildings, Singapore School Manila, The King's School, Manila, Ayala Malls Manila Bay, the Passport Center of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the S&R; Shopping area, and the upcoming Church of Saint John Paul II. Asiaworld and Cyber Bay City In the southern portion of Bay City in Parañaque lies Asiaworld, also known as Marina district, a property owned by the family of Tan Yu which contains mostly residential developments such as the gated community of Marina Baytown Village and Burgundy residential towers. It is also the location of the former Uniwide Sales Coastal Mall which formerly housed the Southwest Integrated Bus Terminal (SWITS). The Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange (PITx), the successor to SWITS, is situated at the north end of the Manila–Cavite Expressway. The area hosted Michael Jackson's HIStory World Tour concert in December 8 and 10 1996 in front of 110.000 people. South of Asiaworld is Freedom Island and two smaller islands collectively known as Three Islands (formerly Amari). The area is planned to contain the Cyber Bay City with the Golf Residential Community District serving as its anchor development. It would also provide other sports facilities and would contain open parks, schools, retail and residential components. The project was stalled due to the PEA-Amari scandal during the term of President Fidel Ramos. At present, the islands are protected as a Ramsar site known as the Las Piñas–Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area.

It was built from 1778 to 1781 for Archbishop József Batthyány, after the design of architect Melchior Hefele. In 1805, the Palace's Hall of Mirrors saw the signing of the fourth Peace of Pressburg, ending the War of the Third Coalition. Today, it serves as the seat of Mayor of Bratislava.  History  The palace and its most famous chamber, the Hall of Mirrors, were the location of the signing of the fourth Peace of Pressburg by Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein, Ignácz Gyulay and Charles Maurice de Talleyrand in 1805 after the Battle of Austerlitz, which effectively ended the War of the Third Coalition. As a result of the Peace of Pressburg, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, and Emperor Francis II proclaimed himself Emperor Francis I of Austria; this is commemorated today by a Roman-style bust of the Emperor on the staircase next to the Hall of Mirrors. The opening sessions of the Hungarian Diet, which convened in the University Library, took place here as well. István Széchenyi offered his yearly income to establish here the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Here Ferdinand V of Hungary promoted the first responsible Hungarian government (elsõ felelõs magyar kormány) and signed the April laws, where Lajos Batthyány, Lajos Kossuth, Bertalan Szemere, Ferenc Deák, Pál Esterházy, István Széchenyi, Lázár Mészáros, József Eötvös and Gábor Klauzál Hungarian ministers were also present. The city purchased the palace in 1903. During reconstruction in 1903, a series of six previously unknown tapestries were found behind a wall, depicting the legend of Hero and Leander and their tragic love. The tapestries were woven in the 1630s at the Mortlake Tapestry Works, near London. According to old Hungarian newspapers, literary lectures and author evenings were arranged in its Hall of Mirrors between the two world wars. Zseni Várnai, Aladár Schöpflin, Zsigmond Móricz, Thomas Mann also took part in these events. The scholar Paracelsus used to live here briefly and there is a memorial plate commemorating his visit. The Palace served as a temporary seat of the President of Slovakia before the Grassalkovich Palace became the permanent presidential residence in 1996. The Palace is open to the public as a tourist attraction. The famous Hall of Mirrors serves as the location for Bratislava City Council meetings.

Born on the island of São Jorge, in the municipality of Velas, he was also referred to as João Teixeira Soares. He was a parliamentary deputy for the islands of São Jorge and Graciosa, and the author of several publications on the history of the island of São Jorge, its popular culture, folklore, proverbs, and traditional poems. Biography Teixeira Soares was born in Velas, the son of Miguel Teixeira Soares de Sousa and Maria Angélica Soares de Albergaria. His family raised grapes and oranges in a settlement of Terreiros near his birthplace. In October 1849, he entered the University of Coimbra on the mainland of Portugal, where he earned the Bachelor of Mathematics degree in 1853 and a Doctor of Philosophy the following year. He had begun to study medicine in 1852, but he changed his course of study. In 1854, he returned to São Jorge where he assumed the direction of the family wine-making business. In the Portuguese legislative elections of 1864, he was elected parliamentary deputy for the constituencies of São Jorge and Graciosa. He headed for Lisbon, where he spent much of the remainder of his relatively short life. In Lisbon, when the Parliament was not in session, in the São Bento Palace, he studied historical documents related to his native island, particularly at the National Archive of Torre do Tombo, in the Castle of São Jorge. The methodical and painstaking work involved the transcription of numerous historical documents, and the discovery of other rare references that he used in his articles on local history. He met Teófilo Braga, who would, much later, become the Prime Minister of Portugal. A fellow Azorean, Braga shared Teixeira Soares's passion for folklore and other aspects of traditional culture. Together, they collected proverbs and popular poems from all nine islands. Braga's special interest in this area, however, involved the folksongs of the Azores. Teixeira Soares contributed his collection of the songs of São Jorge and was one of the chief collaborators on Braga's pioneering work, Cantos Populares do Archipelago Açorian (\\"Popular Songs from the Azorean Archipelago\\"). It was published in 1876, a year after Texeira Soares's death. He created a group of published works about São Jorge, and he also published numerous historic and ethnographic studies. He died at the age of 54 on the island of São Miguel, aged 47.

The term Northwest Coast or North West Coast is used in anthropology to refer to the groups of Indigenous people residing along the coast of what is now called British Columbia, Washington state, parts of Alaska, Oregon, and Northern California. The term Pacific Northwest is largely used in the American context. At one point the region had the highest population density of a region inhabited by Indigenous peoples in Canada.Aboriginal Identity (8), Sex (3) and Age Groups (12) for the Population of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2006 Census-20% Sample Data Click to view table notes, BC Retrieved 2009-10-05.Number and percentage of population reporting Aboriginal identity, Canada, provinces and territories, 2006 Retrieved 2009-10-05.Percentage of Aboriginal people in the population, Canada, provinces and territories, 2006 Retrieved 2009-10-05. Taku Tribe of the Tlingit people, ca. 1913 Chinook men List of nations The Pacific Northwest Coast at one time had the most densely populated areas of indigenous people ever recorded in Canada. The land and waters provided rich natural resources through cedar and salmon, and highly structured cultures developed from relatively dense populations. Within the Pacific Northwest, many different nations developed, each with their own distinct history, culture, and society. Some cultures in this region were very similar and share certain elements, such as the importance of salmon to their cultures, while others differed. Prior to contact, and for a brief time after colonization, some of these groups regularly conducted war against each other through raids and attacks. Through warfare they gathered captives for slavery. Tlingit Ceremonial cape, Tlingit people The Tlingit ( , ; the latter is considered inaccurate) are one of the furthest north indigenous nations in the Pacific Northwest Coast. Their autonym is Lingít , meaning \\"Human being\\". The Russian name for them, Koloshi, was derived from an Aleut term for the labret; and the related German name, Koulischen, may be encountered in older historical literature. The Tlingit are a matrilineal society. They developed a complex hunter-gatherer culture in the temperate rainforest of the Alaska Panhandle and adjoining inland areas of present-day British Columbia. Nisga'a The Tsetsaut were an Athabaskan speaking people whose territory was at the head of the Portland Canal. Little is known about them. Decimated by raiding and disease, their survivors were absorbed into the Nisga'a. The latter people now hold their former territories as they are now extinct. Haida The Haida people ( ) are well known as skilled artisans of wood, metal and design. They have also shown much perseverance and resolve in the area of forest conservation. The vast forests of cedar and spruce where the Haida make their home are on pre-glacial land, which is believed to be almost 14,000 years old. Haida communities located in Prince of Wales Island, Alaska and Haida Gwaii, British Columbia (previously referred to as the Queen Charlotte Islands) also share a common border with other Indigenous peoples, such as the Tlingit and the Tsimshian. The Haida were also famous for their long-distance raiding and slaving, reaching as far as Mexico. Tsimshian Tsimshian people in 1900 The Tsimshian ( ), translated as \\"People Inside the Skeena River,\\" are indigenous people who live around Terrace and Prince Rupert on the North Coast of British Columbia, and the southernmost corner of Alaska on Annette Island. There are about 10,000 Tsimshian, of which about 1,300 live in Alaska. Succession in Tsimshian society is matrilineal, and one's place in society was determined by one's clan or phratry (defined as four equal parts). Four main Tsimshian clans form the basic phratry. The Laxsgiik (Eagle Clan) and Ganhada (Raven Clan) form one half. Gispwudwada (Killer Whale Clan) and Laxgibuu (Wolf Clan) form the other half. Prior to European contact, marriage in Tsimshian society could not take place within a half-group, for example between a Wolf and a Killer Whale. It was considered to be incest even if there was no blood relationship. Marriages were only arranged between people from clans in different halves: for example, between a Killer Whale and a Raven or Eagle. Gitxsan The Gitxsan or Gitksan, meaning \\"people of the Skeena River\\", were known with the Nisga'a as Interior Tsimshian. They speak a closely related language to Nisga'a, though both are related to Coast Tsimshian. This is the English term for Tsimshian spoken on the coast. Although inland, their culture is part of the Northwest Coast culture area, and they share many common characteristics, including the clan system, an advanced art style, and war canoes. They share an historic alliance with the neighbouring Wetʼsuwetʼen, a subgroup of the Dakelh (or Carrier people). Together they waged a battle in the courts against British Columbia known as Delgamuukw v British Columbia, which had to do with land rights. Haisla The Haisla (also Xa’islak’ala, X̄a’islakʼala, X̌àʼislakʼala, X̣aʼislak’ala) are an indigenous nation living at Kitamaat in the North Coast region of the Canadian province of British Columbia. The name Haisla is derived from the Haisla word x̣àʼisla or x̣àʼisəla, \\"(those) living at the rivermouth, living downriver\\". Heiltsuk The Heiltsuk ( )Dictionary.com are an indigenous Nation of the Central Coast region of the Canadian province of British Columbia, centred on the island communities of Bella Bella and Klemtu. The Heiltsuk are the descendants of a number of tribal groups who came together in Bella Bella in the 19th century. They generally prefer the autonym Heiltsuk. Anthropology labelled them the Bella Bella, which is how they are more widely known. Nuxalk The Nuxalk (pronounced ), also known as the Bella Coola, are an Indigenous people of the Central Coast, as well as the furthest north of the Coast Salish cultures. Linguists have classified their Salishan language as independent of both Interior and Coast Salish language groups. It is quite different from that of their coastal neighbours, though it contains a large number of Wakashan loan words. They are believed to have been more connected to Interior Salish peoples, before Athabaskan-speaking groups now inland from them spread southwards, cutting the Nuxalk off from their linguistic relatives. Wuikinuxv The Wuikinuxv, also known as the Owekeeno or Rivers Inlet people (after their location), speak a language related to Heiltsuk, Wuikyala or Oowekyala (they are dialects of a language that has no independent name; linguists refer to it as Heiltsuk-Oweekyala). Together with the Heiltsuk and Haisla, they were once incorrectly known as the Northern Kwakiutl because of their language's close relationship with Kwakʼwala. Greatly reduced in numbers today, like other coastal peoples they were master carvers and painters. They had an elaborate ritual and clan system. The focus of their territory was Owikeno Lake, a freshwater fjord above a short stretch of river at the head of Rivers Inlet. Kwakwakaʼwakw Kwakwakaʼwakw people at a wedding ceremony in 1914 The Kwakwakaʼwakw are an indigenous people, numbering about 5,500, who live in British Columbia on northern Vancouver Island and the mainland. The autonym they prefer is Kwakwakaʼwakw. Their Indigenous language, part of the Wakashan languages family, is Kwakʼwala. The name Kwakwakaʼwakw means \\"speakers of Kwakʼwala\\". The language is now spoken by less than 5% of the population—about 250 people. Today 17 separate tribes make up the Kwakwakaʼwakw, who historically spoke the common language of Kwakʼwala. Some Kwakwakaʼwakw groups are now extinct. Kwakʼwala is a Northern Wakashan language, a grouping shared with Haisla, Heiltsuk and Oowekyala. Nuu-chah- nulth The Nuu-chah-nulth ( ; ) are an Indigenous people in Canada. Their traditional home is in the Pacific Northwest on the west coast of Vancouver Island. In pre-contact and early post-contact times, the number of nations was much greater, but as in the rest of the region, smallpox and other consequences of contact resulted in the disappearance of some groups, and the absorption of others into neighbouring groups. They were among the first Pacific peoples north of California to come into contact with Europeans. Competition between Spain and the United Kingdom over control of Nootka Sound led to a bitter international dispute around 1790, which was settled when Spain agreed to abandon its claim of exclusivity to the North Pacific coast, and to pay damages for British ships seized during the dispute. The Nuu-chah- nulth speak a Southern Wakashan language and are closely related to the Makah and Ditidaht. Makah The Makah are a Southern Wakashan people and are closely related to the Nuu-chah-nulth. They are also noted as whalers. Their territory is around the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula. Coast Salish Squamish elder woman spinning wool on spindle-whorl, circa 1893 The Coast Salish are the largest of the southern groups. They are a loose grouping of many tribes with numerous distinct cultures and languages. Territory claimed by Coast Salish peoples spans from the northern end of the Strait of Georgia, along the east side of Vancouver Island, covering most of southern Vancouver Island, all of the Lower Mainland and Sunshine Coast, all of Puget Sound except (formerly) for the Chimakum territory near Port Townsend, and all of the Olympic Peninsula except that of the Quileute, related to the now-extinct Chemakum. The Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound were officially united as the Salish Sea in 2010. The Coast Salish cultures differ considerably from those of their northern neighbours. It is one of the few Indigenous cultures along the coast with a patrilineal, not matrilineal, culture. They are also one of the few peoples on the coast whose traditional territories coincide with contemporary major metropolitan areas, namely the North Straits Salish-speaking peoples in and around Victoria, the Halkomelem- speaking peoples in and around Vancouver, and the Lushootseed-speaking peoples in and around Seattle. Pre-European contact, the Coast Salish numbered in the tens of thousands, and as such were one of the most populous groups on the northwest coast Chimakum The Chimakum people were a Chimakuan-speaking people whose traditional territory lay in the area of Port Townsend. Beset by warfare from surrounding Salish peoples, their last major presence in the region was eradicated by the Suquamish under Chief Seattle in the mid-19th century. Some survivors were absorbed by neighbouring Salish peoples, while some moved to join the Quileute on the southeast side of the Olympic Peninsula. Quileute The Quileute () are a Chimakuan-speaking people. Their traditional territory is in the western Olympic Peninsula, around the Quillayute and Hoh Rivers. Willapa The Willapa people are a traditionally Athabaskan-speaking people of southwestern Washington. Their territory was between Willapa Bay (named after them) and the prairie lands around the head of the Chehalis and Cowlitz Rivers. A related people, known as the Clatskanie () or Tlatskani, lived on the south side of the Columbia River in northwestern Oregon. Chinook The Chinookan peoples were once one of the most powerful and populous groups of tribes on the southern part of the Northwest Coast. Their territories flank the mouth of the Columbia River and stretch up that river in a narrow band adjacent to that river, as far as Celilo Falls. Their group of dialects are known as Chinookan. It is distinguished from the Chinook Jargon, which was partly based upon it, and is often called \\"Chinook.\\" Close allies of the Nuu-chah-nulth, they are also a canoe people, and pre-European contact, Chinook Jargon arose as a trading language incorporating both Chinookan and Wakashan vocabulary. The Chinookan peoples practiced slavery, likely learned from the Nuu-chah-nulth as it was more common to the north, and cranial deformation. Those without flattened heads were considered to be beneath or servile to those who had undergone the procedure as infants. One likely reason for the cultural prominence of the Chinookan peoples was their strategic position along the Columbia River, which acted as a massive trade corridor, as well as near Celilo Falls, the longest continuously-inhabited site in the Americas, used as a fishing site and trading hub for 15,000 years by a wide range of indigenous peoples. Tillamook The Tillamook or Nehalem peoples were a Coast Salishan- speaking group of tribes living roughly between Tillamook Head and Cape Meares on the northern Oregon Coast. The term 'Tillamook' itself is in fact an exonym, from the neighbouring Chinook-speaking Kathlamet people. Although the Tillamook language was a Coast Salish language, it was somewhat divergent from its more northerly cousins; likewise, the Tillamook culture was substantially different from that of other Coast Salish cultures, apparently influenced by its southern neighbours. They, and their southern neighbours, were less reliant on salmon runs and more reliant on fish trapping in estuaries, hunting, and shellfish gathering. Daʼnaxdaʼxw Nation The Daʼnaxdaʼxw Nation, or Da'naxda'xw/Awaetlatla Nation is a First Nations government in northern Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, their main community is the community of Alert Bay in the Queen Charlotte Strait region. There are approximately 225 members of the Daʼnaxdaʼxw Nation. The Nation is a member of the Kwakiutl District Council and, for treaty negotiation purposes, the Winalagalis Treaty Group which includes three other members of the Kwakiutl District Council (the Quatsino First Nation, the Gwaʼsala-ʼNakwaxdaʼxw Nations, and the Tlatlasikwala Nation).  History  A Kwakwakaʼwakw canoe in 1910. A canoe awaiting traditional invitation to make landfall by the local S'Klallam people at a beach in Port Angeles, Washington, in 2010. Canoes from several Coast Salish groups arrived for a ceremony commemorating the official naming of the Salish Sea. The area referred to as the Northwest Coast has a very long history of human occupation, exceptional linguistic diversity, population density and cultural and ceremonial development. Noted by anthropologists for its complexity, there is emerging research that the economies of these people were more complex and intensive than was previously assumed. Many groups have First Generation Stories - family stories that tell of the origin of the group, and often of humans themselves arising in specific locations along the coast. \\"the Indian history of British Columbia... began at least a hundred centuries before the Province itself was born....\\" Wilson Duff On the northwest coast of North America, the mild climate and abundant natural resources made possible the rise of a complex Aboriginal culture. The people who lived in what are today British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon were able to obtain a good living without much effort. They had time and energy to devote to the development of fine arts and crafts and to religious and social ceremonies. European colonization The indigenous populations were devastated by epidemics of infectious diseases, especially smallpox, brought in by European explorers and traders. Prior to European colonization, various reports from European explorers describe the tribes in the area bearing signs of smallpox. Nathaniel Portlock, a British ship's captain, described as having \\"expected to have seen a numerous tribe\\" but instead found \\"only of three men, three women\\" as well as the oldest of the men \\"marked with the small-pox\\", when referring to the Tlingit people in the North West Coast. Oral traditions of various tribes in the Pacific Northwest also refer to an epidemic of smallpox on the populations. There are many theories to how smallpox arrived in the Pacific Northwest. One theory is that an outbreak in central Mexico in 1779 spread north and infected the Shoshone in 1781, allowing the disease to spread into the lower Columbia River and Strait of Georgia via trade between the Flathead, Nez Perce, Walla Walla, and other various tribes. Spanish expeditions to the Northwest Coast from Mexico in 1774, 1775, and 1779 are also attributed to spreading smallpox to the local tribes in the area, with many documented outbreaks correlating to where the Spanish made landfall. Another theory describes the outbreak originating in the Kamchatka Peninsula in 1769 and spreading via Russian explorers to South Alaska and the Aleutians, thus through the Alaska panhandle and down the Pacific Coast. Due to the native population having no prior exposure to Old World diseases, local tribes may have lost as much as 90% of their population. This depopulation enabled an easier colonization of the Pacific Northwest by European and American migrants. Current times In current times the political and current context of life for these indigenous peoples varies, especially considering their relationship to Canada and the United States. In Canada Indigenous peoples are one of the fastest growing groups with a young and increasing population. Significant issues persist as a result of colonial laws and the now infamous Canadian Indian residential school system. Many of the most repressive elements of the Indian Act (federal legislation governing First Nations) were removed in 1951, and the right for First Nations to vote was granted in 1960. The 1951 amendment to the Indian Act lifted the potlatch ban, though the ban was never fully effective - it had pushed traditional culture underground. Since 1951 ceremonial practices and the potlatch have re-emerged widely along the coast. One development in recent times is the revival of ocean-going cedar canoes. Beginning in the late 1980s with early Haida and Heiltsuk canoes, the revival spread quickly after the Paddle to Seattle in 1989 and the 1993 'Qatuwas canoe festival in Bella Bella.Neel, David The Great Canoes: Reviving a Northwest Coast Tradition. Douglas & McIntyre. 1995. Many other journeys to different places along the coast have occurred; these voyages have come to be known as Tribal Canoe Journeys.  Material culture  Root digging stick with handle Both the sea and the land provided important sources of food and raw materials to Indigenous Peoples of the Northwest Coast, and many of these resources needed to be managed to ensure continual harvest. Historians and ethnographers provide evidence of cultivation practices and environment management strategies that have been used by First Nations peoples for centuries along the Northwest Coast. Practices like digging and tilling, pruning, controlled burning, fertilizing, streamscaping and habitat creation allowed Indigenous groups to intentionally manage the environment around them in order to encourage greater production of a resource for sustained harvesting.Deur and Turner 2005, p.16. Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Coast harvested root crops and shellfish through a process of digging and tilling. Using a digging stick made from hard wood, First Nations people would work the ground between tree roots and in bulb and rhizome patches, which loosened the compacted soil. Loosened soils made it easier to remove root crops whole and undamaged, and allowed roots, bulbs and rhizomes to grow more freely and abundantly with increased production. Society and culture Potlatch The Kwakwakaʼwakw continue the practice of potlatch. Illustrated here is Wawadit'la in Thunderbird Park, Victoria, (aka Mungo Martin House) a Kwakw _a_ k _a_ 'wakw \\"big house\\" built by Chief Mungo Martin in 1953. Very wealthy and prominent hosts would have a plankhouse specifically for potlatching and for housing guests. A potlatch is a highly complex event where people gather in order to commemorate a specific event (such as the raising of a totem pole or the appointment/election of a new chief). These potlatches would usually be held in competition with one another, providing a forum to display wealth within a tribe. In the potlatch ceremony the chief would give highly elaborate gifts to visiting peoples in order to establish his power and prestige, and by accepting these gifts the visitors conveyed their approval of the chief. There were also great feasts and displays of conspicuous consumption, such as the burning of articles, or throwing things into the sea, purely as a display of the great wealth of the chief. Groups of dancers put on elaborate dances and ceremonies. These dancers were members of secret \\"dancing societies\\". Watching these performances was considered an honour. Potlatches were held for several reasons: the confirmation of a new chief; coming of age; tattooing or piercing ceremonies; initiation into a secret society; marriages; the funeral of a chief; battle victory. Music Among the Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Coast, the music varies in function and expression. Though some groups have more cultural differences than the rest (like the Coast Salish and the more northern nations), there remain many similarities. Some instruments used by the Indigenous were hand drums made of animal hides, plank drums, log drums, box drums, along with whistlers, wood clappers, and rattles. A great deal of the instruments were used mostly in the potlatch, but also carried over in to other festivities throughout the year. The songs employed are used with dancing, although it is also for celebration, which at times may not be accompanied by dancing. Most singing is community based. There are some solo parts, often the lead singer would begin in the first line of each round of a song, but not long solos. For some ceremonies, solo songs would be used by men and women without the accompaniment of any person or drum. Usually slow in tempo and accompanied by a drum. Principal function of music in this area is spiritual; music honors the Earth, Creator, Ancestors, all aspects of the supernatural world. Sacred songs are not often shared with the wider world. Women and men, families own their own songs as property which can be inherited, sold or given as a gift to a prestigious guest at a Feast. Professionals existed for some communities, but music is taught and then rehearsed. For some nations, the tradition was those who made musical errors were punished, usually through shaming. Employing octave singing, but rather than running up and down the scale, it is not uncommon to jump notes and go from bottom to top or top to bottom in a couple of notes. Vocal Rhythmic patterns are often complex and run counter to rigid percussion beats. The tribes would dance in groups in circles. Art Totem poles in Victoria, British Columbia The creation of beautiful and practical objects (for all tribal communities) served as a means of transmitting stories, history, wisdom and property from generation to generation. Art provided Indigenous people with a tie to the land by depicting their histories on totem poles the Big (Plank) Houses of the Pacific Northwest coast – the symbols depicted were a constant reminder of their birth places, lineages and nations. Due to the abundance of natural resources and the affluence of most Northwest tribes, there was plenty of leisure time to create art. Many works of art served practical purposes, such as clothing, tools, weapons of war and hunting, transportation, cooking, and shelter; but others were purely aesthetic. Pacific Northwest Coast: Spiritualism, the supernatural and the importance of the environment played integral roles in day-to-day life. Therefore, it was not unusual for their worldly goods to be adorned with symbols, crests and totems that represented some important figure(s) from both the seen and unseen worlds. Often different northern tribes would adorn their possessions with symbols that represented a tribe as a collective (i.e., clan); this would often be a signal of differentiation among tribal groups. Such symbols could be compared to a coat of arms, or running up the flag of a country on a sailing ship, as it approached a harbour. After the arrival of the Europeans, Indigenous artifacts suddenly became a hot commodity to be collected and placed in museums and other institutions, and many tribal groups were looted of their precious items by over-zealous collectors. In recent years, many Indigenous organizations have been calling for a return of some of their sacred items, such as masks and regalia, that symbolize their cultural heritage.  Genetics  Haplogroup Q1a3a is a Y chromosome haplogroup generally associated with the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Q-M3 mutation appears on the Q lineage roughly 10 to 15 thousand years ago, as the migration throughout the Americas was underway by the early Paleo-Indians. The Na-Dené, Inuit and Indigenous Alaskan populations exhibit haplogroup Q (Y-DNA) mutations, however, which are distinct from other indigenous Amerindians along with various mtDNA mutations. This suggests that the migrant ancestors of the current inhabitants of the northern extremes of North America and Greenland derived from later migrant populations. Genetic analyses of HLA I and HLA II genes as well as HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 gene frequencies links the Ainu people of Japan to some Indigenous peoples of the Americas, especially to populations on the Pacific Northwest Coast such as Tlingit. The scientists suggest that the main ancestor of the Ainu and of some Native American groups can be traced back to Paleolithic groups in Southern Siberia.

He has also worked with a number of other rock musicians and with individual members of the Who on solo projects. Biography Bob Pridden was born in 1946 in Ickenham, England, and married Maria Noel. Pridden grew up only a few miles from the West London neighbourhoods in which Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle lived. His first job was working with the John Barry Seven. He became a roadie for the Who after talking to John Wolff, then the bands main roadie and driver. He made his debut as roadie at a gig in Streatham, London on 15 December 1966, and was promoted to sound engineer in 1969. He has provided the stage mix for every Who concert ever since. According to Pete Townshend in 2007, Pridden and the rest of the band \\"all converged just before the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. So we have worked together for 40 years.\\", although he missed the first two trips to the USA, finally going for the Herman Hermits tour which started in July 1967. Career Pridden is commonly credited for having created on-stage \\"wedge\\" monitors in the late '60s; previously, onstage performers had no way to hear themselves singing, so during the 1968 American tour he began placing a speaker cabinet on its side in front of the band. However, the band preferred stage side monitors for a long period, so he helped to develop these with the WEM company, even loaning the bands stage PA to other acts at both the 1969 and 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. Pridden then requested a slanted speaker cabinet that sat on the floor and tilted upwards toward the performer. Since that time, onstage \\"wedge\\" monitors have become standard equipment at virtually every live performance of any scale worldwide.Billboard, p. 56, 6 November 1971 Pridden has worked both on stage and in the studio with many other of classic rock's major names, as well as with younger acts. He is credited on several of the Who's albums including Live at Leeds, and produced the 1973 Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert. Pridden served as on stage sound engineer from the Who's 1969 tour onwards, and also for David Bowie and Paul McCartney at Live Aid in 1985. Many of the Who's songs, especially songs from Who's Next and Quadrophenia, need to have pre- recorded tapes when performed live. Pridden once said, \\"I don't trust machines. Machines go wrong. My heart pounds before I press the button hoping for it to work.\\" Daltrey also said, \\"Bob has had the tape recorder thrown at him many a time - especially when the thing'd break!.\\"Classic Albums: The Who – Who's Next - Eagle Rock (2001) Pridden is unusual in the music business for having attained recognition for his technical rather than musical input, and is rare in the fact that his name is known when most roadies and engineers are not. Although over sixty years old, he continued to tour with the Who, mixing many of their later live CD/DVD releases, and in 2006 he co-produced Roger Daltrey's vocals on the Who's album Endless Wire.\\"The Who plan new release for June\\" - TODAYshow.com\\"The Who rock Super Bowl XLIV halftime\\" - Broadcast Engineering Pridden eventually retired from his post as The Who's onstage sound man in 2016.

The music was written by Gabriel Ruiz, the original Spanish lyrics by Ricardo López Méndez, with English lyrics written by Sunny Skylar. The song was published in 1943. Versions The two biggest-selling versions in the United States were recorded by Bing Crosby and Andy Russell. The recording by Bing Crosby was recorded on February 17, 1944 for Decca Records as catalog number 18608. It first reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on June 29, 1944, and lasted 7 weeks on the chart, peaking at #4.

His ancestors were once prosperous landowners, but they became impoverished, having lost their fortune in the aftermath of the American Revolution. Osborne left his father's home at the age of fifteen, accepting work wherever it could be found. After several failed business ventures, Osborne founded D. M. Osborne & Co. in 1856, and made a fortune manufacturing agricultural machinery. Osborne's life revolved around his work. He was an exacting, but fair employer, and years after his death his former employees still spoke of him with admiration. One of Auburn's most respected citizens, Osborne served three terms as mayor (1877–1880); a position later held by both his son and one of his grandsons. Munson Osborne was described as a loving husband and father, though he had a tendency to behave like a \\"benevolent autocrat.\\" He respected his wife, and happily entertained her more liberal friends and relations. However, Osborne expected Eliza to conform, for the most part, to the traditional Victorian ideal of wife and mother. This meant virtually abandoning suffrage work after her marriage, and devoting the bulk of her time to domestic affairs.Penney, Sherry H.; Livinston, James D. A Very Dangerous Woman: Martha Wright and Women's Rights p. 223.

The case proved to be difficult and protracted, with McCormick ultimately agreeing to settle out of court, paying Osborne $225,000, an enormous sum at the time. However, the stress of the case had a terrible effect on Osborne. On July 6, 1886, Osborne suffered a massive coronary. Helen and her mother, having witnessed his collapse, tried fruitlessly to revive him, but he died later that evening.

Boston, 1700–1980: The Evolution of Urban Politics, pp. 142–144 Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984 James also took a keen interest in civil service reform, educational reform and legal reform, spearheading an effort to diversify the makeup of the Boston Chamber of Commerce, and helping to establish a juvenile court. In a testament to how highly regarded he was by Bostonians from every social strata, on multiple occasions James was asked to act as a mediator between corporate interests, the city, and labor unions. Elected on the Democratic ticket, James served for several years on the City Council, and during the First World War held the post of New England Fuel Administrator. He was largely responsible for preventing a severe coal shortage, actually using his own credit to ensure vital shipments of coal reached the Northeast, during the winter of 1917–1918. The Storrows rejected \\"Nativist\\" ideology, i.e., the anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant stance widely embraced by the American upper classes during the late 19th and early 20th century.Baltzell, Edward Digby. The Protestant Establishment: Aristocracy & Caste in America, pp. 93–95 New York: Random House, 1964 While serving on the Boston School Committee, James quickly \\"gained a reputation\\" among Irish-Catholics \\"for absolute fairness in the sensitive matter of hiring and promoting Boston teachers and administrators\\". He insisted that teachers should be hired and promoted on the basis of \\"merit regardless of religious background,\\" whereas before, Catholics had been routinely discriminated against. When James ran for re-election to the School Committee in 1905, he received a ringing endorsement from The Pilot, Boston's leading Irish-Catholic newspaper: :\\"Mr. Storrow is a Protestant, but he has a host of friends and admirers among the Catholics, clergy and laity alike, for his philanthropy which knows no test of religion nor of color; for his upright life; for his sincere devotion to the best interests of those citizens who most need the public schools. He will be found where he has been found heretofore, alert for the largest possible moral, material and intellectual benefits for the neediest, rather than seeking to control appointments for personal or political motives...\\" Philanthropic endeavors and social reform Helen was involved in a wide variety of charitable activities during her life ranging from settlement work to land conservation.Formisano, Ronald P.; Burns, Constance K. Boston, 1700–1980: The Evolution of Urban Politics, 142–143 Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984 Helen's initial focus was on children's charities, beginning with the playground movement.Karp, David A.; Stone, Gregory P.; Yoels, William C. Being Urban: A Sociology of City Life, pp. 201–202 Westport, CT: Praeger, 1991 Distressed by the number of children being killed and injured in accidents while playing in the streets, Boston philanthropists began constructing playgrounds. It was also hoped that if the children had a proper place to play, rather than congregating in the streets, they would be less likely to become involved in gang-related criminal activities. The North End of Boston during the late 19th century was an impoverished, over-crowded, filthy, disease ridden area, reminiscent of the London slums depicted by Dickens.Guerrier, Edith; Matson, Molly. An Independent Woman: The Autobiography of Edith Guerrier, p. xxvi Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1992 The ward suffered from the highest infant mortality rates, child mortality rates, and homicide rates, in Boston. Many affluent Bostonians blamed conditions in the North End on the residents themselves, immigrants, who were predominantly Jewish and Italian. Massachusetts state legislator Edward C. Chandler voiced the opinion of many in Boston when he stated that \\"the personal habits of the tenants are largely responsible for such conditions…Undoubtedly many a suitable tenement house is turned into a place of misery by the ignorance and vice of its occupants.\\" Helen agreed that further education was necessary, and should be encouraged in immigrant communities, but she rejected the notion that immigrants were inherently inferior, and disliked the condescension shown by many of her peers toward immigrants. She took a genuine interest in the women and children of the North End, joining the North Bennet Street Industrial School's board of managers in 1898, and serving as secretary of the institution. The school was founded in 1885 by Pauline Agassiz Shaw.\\"North Bennet Street Industrial School\\" pp. 315–316 Twenty-Fourth Annual Report of the State Board of Charity of Massachusetts Massachusetts State Board of Health.

It was at North Bennet Street Industrial School that Helen met Edith Guerrier. Guerrier, then a young art student, arrived at the school in 1899, looking for a position in the nursery. She approached Helen with a letter of introduction from her uncle, William Garrison, Jr., who was an old friend of Guerrier's father. Not long after coming to the school, Guerrier was tasked with the job of maintaining the school's reading room. Her story-hour quickly gained immense popularity with young women at the school, forming the foundation of what in 1901 became the Saturday Evening Girls' Club (S.E.G.). The club derived its name from the fact that its members were mainly young working-women, and high school students, who could only attend on Saturdays. The weekly story-hour was soon expanded to include discussions about history, politics, civics, economics, art, literature, and lectures given by well-known figures. Guerrier managed to attract a wide range of individuals to speak before the club: :\\"Edward Everett Hale, Reverend Paul Revere Frothingham, Charles Eliot Norton, activists Paul Davis andFindArticles.com Meyer Bloomfield, social reformers Vida Scudder and Robert Woods, and many doctors, lawyers, judges, librarians, artists, rabbis, clergy, performance artists, suffragists, business leaders, and writers spoke to the S.E.G. on a variety of classical and contemporary issues.\\" Seven additional clubs were eventually formed, each named for the day of the week when members met. There was a club for girls as young as ten, another for working women in their mid-twenties, and clubs for girls every age in between. At a time when many first and second generation immigrants failed to graduate, or even attend high school, clubs like the Saturday Evening Girls played a vital role in educating their members. One young woman, Vanessa Casassa Bruno, described her experience as a member of the Saturday Evening Girls during the 1910s: :\\"The S.E.G. talks that I have attended have helped me a great deal, in that I learned from them what other girls learned in high school, and I was thus given a general idea of the literature at different periods, civic and social problems in different countries, [the] fine arts...Through the club I became connected with the Branch Public Library. During my work there I was able to help children and foreigners to read proper books...to make them better citizens and scholars, as well as increasing my knowledge of books and authors.\\" Helen was inspired by Guerrier's desire to impart her knowledge of art and literature to the young women of the North End, taking an avid interest in Guerrier's work, and using her connections to generate funding, and attract speakers to the club.Guerrier, Edith; Matson, Molly. An Independent Woman: The Autobiography of Edith Guerrier, p. xxxvii Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1992 A naturally exuberant, enthusiastic woman, during the club's early years Helen became a familiar figure, forming lasting friendships with several of the girls, and providing the club with invaluable financial support. The Storrows would later personally finance the college education of several young men and women from the Saturday Girls Club, the North Bennet school, and various settlement houses they patronized. Believing that the young women would benefit from time spent in the countryside, Helen also provided them with a summer camp at Wingaersheek Beach in West Gloucester, Massachusetts.Guerrier, Edith; Matson, Molly. An Independent Woman: The Autobiography of Edith Guerrier, p. xxxii Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1992 During a tour of Europe in 1906, funded by Helen, Guerrier and her partner, Edith Brown, had an epiphany – they would return to America and develop a pottery.Guerrier, Edith; Matson, Molly. An Independent Woman: The Autobiography of Edith Guerrier, p. xxxiv Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1992 The enterprise would be operated by Brown, Guerrier, and the Saturday Girls, providing the young women with employment and a skill set. Helen readily agreed to subsidize the venture and the Paul Revere Pottery was born. In 1908, she purchased a large townhouse at 18 Hull Street to serve as the club's new headquarters; the pottery and kiln were erected in the basement. The operation was wholly run by the Saturday Girls. They produced and decorated the pottery, operated the kiln, ran the store in Boston where their wares were sold and, later on, they also conducted pottery classes. Helen, Guerrier, and Brown, agreed that an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere should surround the girls. Accordingly, their rooms were always filled with \\"fresh flowers and bright light,\\" and as they worked, the young women were treated to \\"dramatic readings and soothing music\\" performed by the children of well-to-do families who patronized the pottery. They produced a wide variety of objects, including pitchers, vases, inkwells, plates, bowls, and even lamps. The Saturday Girls regularly staged theatricals, operettas, recitals, and folk dancing exhibitions, to raise additional funds for the pottery. Helen personally instructed the girls in the art of folk dancing. Their performances were attended by leading Boston philanthropists and patrons of the arts, among them Isabella Stewart Gardner. While their productions met with great success, the girls often resented the supercilious attitude of their wealthy benefactors. As previously stated, in the early 20th century many wealthy Americans, including some supporters of the Saturday Girls Club, viewed Italian, Irish and Jewish immigrants as inherently ignorant, either unable or unwilling to comprehend cultural and intellectual subjects, and unlikely to benefit from advanced education. In order to raise funds and gain publicity, the club staged an annual exhibition, allowing affluent Bostonians to tour the pottery and view their work. The young women were angered by the “expectations of inferiority,” and the belittling remarks made openly by some visitors, who were astonished to discover that \\"illiterate\\" and \\"ignorant\\" girls could produce such beautiful artwork. The young women rebelled against their condescension: :\\"In an interesting display of oppositional resistance…the girls acted out by feigning ignorance of English and exhibited a general lack of intelligence, all for the visitors' benefit. This performance by the girls, though funny to them, apparently infuriated Storrow...visitors ultimately walked away from their visit to the pottery with the image of the ignorant immigrant...\\" It was Helen's fervent wish to dispel stereotypes of immigrants by demonstrating the artistic accomplishments of the women at the Paul Revere Pottery, and the organizations connected to the Saturday Girls Club. However, as one author noted: \\"For the girls, it [the opinion of the Brahmins] may not have mattered; Storrow's vision and dedication to securing a future for them, perhaps conflicted with their own ideas of identity, self-definition, and respect.\\" In spite of tensions between the young women and their benefactors, the pottery and clubs continued for several decades with considerable success. Helen's growing involvement in scouting precluded her from continuing to take a personal interest in the daily operations of the Saturday Girls Club. She announced in 1914 that she would no longer be able to subsidize the pottery, but agreed to fund the operation for an additional year, while they developed a plan to become self-sustaining. In 1915, before withdrawing the bulk of her support, Helen provided the club with a new building constructed on Nottingham Hill; an \\"L-shaped, two-story pottery, in the style of an English country house…with warm, well-lighted rooms,\\" and additional space, where Guerrier and Brown made their residence.Guerrier, Edith; Matson, Molly.

An Independent Woman: The Life of Lou Henry Hoover Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2000 After the initial founding of the American Girl Scouts organization, there were numerous squabbles with the older organization of British Girl Guides, including arguments over uniforms, territorial disputes, and an unsuccessful attempt by the Girl Guides to convince the Girl Scouts to change their name; the British organization considered the term \\"Scout\\" too masculine for a girls' movement.Parkins, Wendy. Fashioning the Body Politic: Dress, Gender, Citizenship, p. 133 New York: Berg, 2002 Helen responded to the latter argument by suggesting that, instead, the Girl Guides should refer to themselves as Scouts: :\\"Our name, Girl Scouts, is very dear to us, and seems to us the logical name. The terms scout and scouting apply to girls and their activities as appropriately as to boys, and represent the same laws and ideals. The idea that we are trying to make boys out of the girls is soon dissipated when the girls show their increased usefulness at home... :The suggestion to change the name met with the determined opposition from both our girls and their officers, and we shall in all probability remain scouts. I wish most heartily that we might share the same name. Would the Guides consider changing? I wish they would.\\" In spite of the initial tension between the British and American organizations, the Storrows became close personal friends of Lord Baden-Powell, who founded the Scouting movement, and his wife, Lady Baden-Powell. James Storrow's interest in the Boy Scouts mirrored his wife's interest in the girls' movement; he served as the second national president of the Boy Scouts of America.

Folk dancing Helen's interest in dance began in the early 20th century, when several middle-aged Boston socialites organized a dance class to \\"amuse themselves and their friends.\\"Charity Organization Society of the City of New York. \\"The Survey, Vol 26.,\\" p. 336 New York: The Charity Organization Society, 1911 Books.Google.com Helen later said: :\\"For several years we considered it only funny that we should be pirouetting and hopping about it in arabesque positions, and were ashamed to try to dance really well; but gradually we lost the feeling of self-consciousness and enjoyed it too much not to try to do our best.\\"' During her travels in Europe, Helen developed a passion for folk dancing, becoming a staunch devotee of Cecil Sharp, aiding him in his efforts to popularize folk dance in the United States.International Council for Traditional Music.

Cecil Sharp: His Life and Work, pp. 128–129 Chicago: University of Chicago, 1967 Helen devoted increasingly lengthy amounts of time to providing lessons in English folk dance. In 1911, during a benefit for the Playground Association of America, Helen could be found in the ballroom of the New Willard Hotel in New York City, leading a \\"practical demonstration\\" in folk dancing for those in attendance.\\"Efficiency in Play,\\" p. 11 La Follette's Weekly Magazine, Vol III, No. 21 May 27, 1911.

Deep community: Adventures in the Modern Folk Underground, p. 361 Cambridge: BlackWolf Press, 2003 She believed that everyone's life, be they young or old, male or female, could be enriched by dance.McKeever, William A. Training the Boy, p. 141 New York: The Macmillan Co., 1913 She wrote: :\\"As a means of exercise for girls and boys, and to break up snobbery and self-consciousness among them, folk dancing has been tried out and found to work wonders...it will do the same for grown-ups; it is doing the same where it is given a trial, but dynamite and a derrick are needed in most families...Our friends allow their daughters to make exhibitions of themselves in a way no North End mother would allow for a moment. At present anything goes. There seems to be total ignorance on the subject of what constitutes good dancing, and yet the principles can be clearly defined as those of any art. It seems to me they can be boiled down to three: :I. There should be pleasure in dancing... :II. Dancing should be for pleasure and not primarily for show. The moment it is self-conscious, there is something wrong. If in fancy dancing a position is taken because it is believed to be graceful, it isn't. There is no meaning in it. There is one thing wrong in ballet dancing; it is all meant to be looked at, and while stunts are humorous, it is better to leave them to acrobats, as they are not beautiful. :III. Dancing must develop the body naturally, strengthening the muscles in natural positions, not distorting them... :If we succeed in transplanting these beautiful old dances of other countries and they take root, they will grown and spread and blossom into other dances, showing the genius of our people, and reflecting our life and times.\\" Combining her love of dance with her passion for scouting, Helen arranged for teachers from the Country Dance Society to organize a summer dance camp at Long Pond in 1932. Pinewoods Camp operated independently, alongside the Scouts' Pine Tree Camp. Lily Conant later operated the camp, which was willed to Conant's family after Helen's death, becoming Pinewood Camp Inc., in 1975. Storrowton Village Storrowton Green at the Eastern States Exposition Helen oversaw the \\"home department\\" of the Eastern States Exposition, an annual fair occurring in New England.Parks, Richard H. \\"Village of Another Day.\\" New York Times June 29, 1941; p. xx7 In 1927, Helen purchased Gilbert House, a structure built in the 18th century, transporting the home from West Brookfield, to serve as a permanent headquarters for the department. From 1927 to 1930, Helen invested nearly half-a-million dollars constructing the village of Storrowton, transporting authentic Revolutionary and pre-Revolutionary buildings and restoring them. The village quickly became a popular tourist attraction. Among the buildings reconstructed at Storrowton were: the Potter House (1760); the Atkinson Store (1799); the legal office of Zachariah Eddy (1806); and the Salisbury church (1800). The church contained one of the oldest hand-crafted pipe organs in existence. As a birthday present for Helen, in 1935, Girl Scout volunteers planted a large herb garden near the Gilbert House, known as “Aunt Helen's Herb Garden,” filled with herbs commonly used in the Revolutionary period. The village was renamed Storrowton by the Trustees, in her honor, in 1944. The village is currently run as a living history museum. Further club and settlement work In addition to her work with the North Bennet school and the Saturday Girls Club, Helen and her husband helped found numerous social and charitable organizations in Boston between 1900 and 1930. In 1903, they helped found the West End House, a club for boys, mainly immigrants, providing classes and lectures on numerous subjects, including history, literature and physical education.Sammarco, Anthony M.

Boston's West End (Images of America, p. 75 Arcadia Publishing, 1998 In 1908, the Storrows provided the boys at West End House with a summer camp in East Parsonfield, Maine. West End House, like the Saturday Evening Girls Club, aimed to keep youths in poor immigrant neighborhoods off the streets, by providing them with educational and recreational opportunities. Their athletics contests gained both wide popularity and participation: :\\"A central feature of the West End House was the development of a number of athletic teams and contests. West End House teams helped to increase neighborhood solidarity through the development of a string of intracity rivalries...The Thanksgiving day race was a community event in the West End. Huge crowds lined the streets to watch the boys run for neighborhood glory...\\". Another of her husband's endeavors was the Boston Newsboy's Club, which he played a prominent role in founding, in 1909.\\"Boston Newsboys Club\\" p. 31 Thirty-second Annual Report of the State Board of Charity of Massachusetts Massachusetts State Board of Health. Boston, 1911 Books.Google.com The club's stated mission: \\"To befriend in every possible way the newsboys and other boys of the city of Boston, without distinction as to race, color, or creed.\\" As with the Storrows' other clubs, it provided Newsboys – youths who were then a common sight, selling newspapers on corners throughout the city – with an outlet for education and recreation, helping the boys graduate high school, and in some instances, go on to attend university.General Alliance of Workers with Boys. Work with boys: a magazine of methods, Volume 13, p. 85 Reading, PA: William McCormick, 1913 Books.Google.com Frustrated by the monotony of the activities sponsored by most women's clubs in Boston, in 1913, Helen founded the Women's City Club, \\"to promote a broad acquaintance among women through their common interest in the welfare of the city…\\"Vrabel, Jim. When in Boston, p. 261 Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2004 She served as the club's first president. Her goal was to gather members from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds, allowing for a diversity of views, to discuss relevant political and social issues. The Storrows supported America's entry into the First World War, and Helen presided over the War Service Committee organized by the Women's City Club, raising funds for the war effort.The Harvard Graduates' Magazine, vol 26, 1917–1918., p. 129-130 Boston: The Harvard Graduates' Magazine Association, 1918 Books.Google.com At the war's end, the Storrows converted their summer home into a sanatorium for wounded soldiers: :\\"J. J. Storrow has given his country residence, Storrow Farm, Lincoln, with the adjacent buildings and sixteen acres of land, for a Lincoln convalescent hospital for enfeebled and crippled soldiers. The services of several employees, such furniture as can be utilized, care of the grounds, heating, lighting, and the like are included in the gift. A staff of women doctors and nurses have volunteered for service, and a war service committee of the Women's City Club, of which Mrs. Storrow was first president, is aiding to raise fund and equipment.\\" Towards the end of her life, as the result of her brother's activism, Helen became interested in the cause of prison reform.\\"Mrs. Storrow Dies; Girl Scout Leader.\\" New York Times p. 50, November 12, 1944 To promote this cause, in 1930, she founded and served as president of the Women's Auxiliary of the Tom Brown House.

Apr. 3, 2005 Accessed Sept. 26, 2009. Auburnpub.com Helen and her sister Emily offered to donate a new city hall to Auburn in their father's memory. They hired prominent Boston architects Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch & Abbott; construction began in 1929. The dedication was held on April 5, 1930: : \\"Thousands of people filled the street surrounding the hall. Flags and streamers floated in the breeze. The Star-Spangled Banner opened the event, played by the Boys Band, and America closed it. The program was broadcast on WSYR Syracuse, and amplifiers were placed above city streets. Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts served as escorts to the dignitaries, which included Storrow, Osborne's son and current mayor Charles Devens Osborne, Syracuse Mayor Rolland B. Martin and a number of state politicians.\\" During her final years, Helen traveled frequently to Bermuda. As a gesture of her goodwill toward the island, she funded an annual scholarship allowing a student from Bermuda to study at Harvard. In 1931, Helen donated one million dollars to the State of Massachusetts to complete the development of the Charles River Basin, in which her husband had been involved prior to his death. It was largely due to the efforts of Helen and James Storrow that the Charles River Basin was landscaped and turned into a recreational area during the 1930s.\\"James Jackson Storrow, Jr. 66; Former Publisher of The Nation.\\" The Boston Globe Jan 15, 1984.

Latterell (born March 14, 1928) is an American environmental activist, He was a Biology professor at Shepherd University from 1968 to 1992. He founded the Jefferson County Watersheds Coalition, has led an annual cleanup of the Potomac River near Shepherdstown, West Virginia, and has conducted spring and fall counts of macroinvertebrate species in streams in Jefferson County, West Virginia. The presence and diversity of species have shown poor water quality in most streams, because of sediment from construction sites and inadequately treated sewer plant effluent. Legal Action Latterell was one of the plaintiffs in the landmark case, decided in 2003, on rules concerning degradation of West Virginia waters, OVEC v. EPA 3:02-0059 US District Court for Southern District of West Virginia, Huntington Division. The case won stricter rules protecting water quality. Latterell was also one of the plaintiffs in the first successful case stopping a subdivision at the Jefferson County Board of Zoning Appeals, the Thorn Hill case in 2000. Later he and others appealed other variations of the Thorn Hill subdivision, and his initial win in West Virginia Circuit Court was ultimately overturned by later decisions in Circuit Court. From 2004 to 2007 he and other citizens were the targets of a SLAPP suit by the Thorn Hill developers for two million dollars in damages alleged based on their opposition to Thorn Hill. The judge decided for the citizens and against the developers. Latterell also participated in cases on pollution at the West Virginia Public Service Commission and Environmental Quality Board. He and his wife, Frances Meehan Latterell, took soil samples at a former apple orchard proposed for the Huntfield subdivision, and found high levels of lead and arsenic, from the lead arsenate formerly used as an insecticide. The developer, who had not reported test results for lead and arsenic, committed to stripping the polluted soil and encapsulating it in berms. Other activities Dr. Richard Lewis Latterell is a scientist in plant genetics. He completed his PhD study on the plant genus nicotina in 1958 at Cornell University. Dr. Latterell also studied the interaction of bees and red clover plant species utilization, while at the University of Pennsylvania. Later in his career was a pioneer exobiologist on the Mars Simulator II (MSII), which simulated both the day/night cycle and the nitrogen & carbon dioxide environment of Mars in the Tarrytown, NY laboratory. Over 250 different seed types were tested for germination in the Mars Simulator II model, where over 50 plant species germinated without oxygen, including corn and rye. Studies found that an African succulent plant (cereus cactus) and a Peruvian cactus variety survived the longest in these Martian atmospheres. While working under these NASA contracts the 1960s for Union Carbide Laboratory in Tarrytown, New York, Dr. Latterell published studies in a variety of Academic Journals on seed germinations from these simulated Martian environments (MSII). *Nitrogen- and helium-induced anoxia – different lethal effects on rye seeds, Science v.153 (July 1) p. 69-70 (1966) *Behavior of plants under extraterrestrial conditions – seed germination in atmospheres containing nitrogen oxides, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, v.52 (July) p. 11-13 (1964 *Changes in Sensitivity of Maize chromosomes to X Rays during Seed Germination, American Journal of Botany, v49, n5 (May-Jun., 1962): 472-478 *The oxygen effect and its relation to changes in radiosensitivity during seed germination, Mutation Research v.4 (2) p. 191-200 (1967) *Nitrogen- and helium-induced anoxia – different lethal effects on rye seeds, v.153 (July 1) p. 69-70 (1966) *S.M.

Retrieved 25 August 2015 Balmoral Arcade opened in 1973 and was located at the southern end of Station Street, between Shannon Street (now a pedestrian mall) and Key Street which opened with 19 speciality stores. Quayside Shopping Centre opened in 1991 near both Bayside and Balmoral, on the carpark between Ross Smith Avenue and Station Street, with a Target department store, a Coles supermarket and 72 speciality stores. Bayside and Quayside were also linked by an enclosed bridge over Ross Smith Avenue. Balmoral Arcade and Quayside Shopping Centre were later merged with the Bayside Shopping Centre in which it subsequently renamed to Bayside Shopping Centre. Bayside and Balmoral were acquired by John Gandel, the owner of Quayside, during the late-1990s, and upgrades were carried out by manager CFS Retail Property Trust (later Novion Property Group). A portion of Ross Smith Avenue was permanently closed to create a new food court (underneath the existing bridge link). In 2004 the centre underwent a $63 million redevelopment which included a new 3 level building on the northern side of Beach Street linked by a multi-level pedestrian bridge on the former multi storey carpark opposite Myer. Kmart, Safeway (now Woolworths) and a further 55 stores were added as part of this development. This development was completed in March 2006. An entertainment precinct, on Wells Street (separated from the centre itself but still part of the Bayside complex) was added and features a 12 screen Australian Multiplex Cinemas complex (now Hoyts), Strike Bowling Bar and 10 restaurants/food outlets. Another upgrade in 2011 brought the combined total cost of development to AU$200 million since 1999, with reconfigured tenancies including an entire level dedicated to fashion stores, a refurbished second level food court and an Aldi supermarket.Staff Writer (8 June 2011). \\"Bayside gets big on fashion\\".

Career In the reign of Maria I of Portugal, Touvar governed the Captaincy of Espírito Santo, in the Portuguese colony of Brazil between December 1804 and December 1811. The early part of his work in Espírito Santo involved pursuing and attacking natives within his territory, a governmental practice that had in its objective the expansion of internal navigation. In 1803, the indigenous population had attacked Porto de Souza, leaving the garrison of Coutins totally destroyed. In 1809, Touvar pursued the natives while founding (in the ashes of the former garrison of Coutins) the base for the settlement of Linhares, in homage to D. Rodrigo de Souza Coutinho, who was instituted as Count of Linhares. Touvar served in the monarch's Council of State as a colonel in the Portuguese cavalry and Commander in the Order of Aviz under John VI of Portugal. Captaincy of the Azores After 1823, the reformist politics of the Count of Subserra (a Terceirense), powerful minister of John VI of Portugal, reestablished the Captaincy General of the Azores, giving it a new politico-administrative organization for the territory.José Guilherme Reis Leite (1999), p.325 Touvar was appointed 9th Captain-General for the Azores on 21 May 1824, and took up residence in the city of Angra on 11 June 1824. In 1825, King D. John VI was forced to recognize the independence of Brazil, where his son (D. Pedro) reigned as Emperor since 1822.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.87 Taking advantage that these events created, the Infante D. Miguel and his wife D. Carlota Joaquina attempted to distance Pedro from the throne of Portugal. Following the death of D. John VI, D. Pedro relinquished his title to the throne of Portugal in favour of his daughter D. Maria da Glória (who would reign as D. Maria), initially under the regency of her sister Isabel Maria. Following the 10 March 1826 abdication by D. Pedro, Queen D. Maria II signed a new Constitutional Charter and sent to the Azores Lord Stuart to promulgate the law and swear fealty to the new monarch. The municipalities of Ponta Delgada and Angra declared their loyalties to the Crown and new charter on 21 and 23 August 1826, in solemn ceremonies adhered by members of the three Estates General. But, with rising tensions between Absolutists and Liberals, D. Pedro decided to marry his daughter, Queen D. Maria II (who was still a minor), to his brother (D. Miguel) and transfer to him the regency, thereby avoiding conflict. Miguel was in exile in Austria, due to his early attempt to usurp the throne, but returned. Azoreans, generally, favoured the grand compromise, and Touvar, who was an Absolutist supporter, ordered three days of celebrations, immediately showing his antipathy towards Liberals. After several months, Miguel and his Absolutist faction staged a coup, and acclaimed Miguel King on 17 May 1828. The Absolutist counter-revolution eventually reached the Azores on 16 May 1828, and Touvar, aligning himself with the absolutists, sent orders to every island in the archipelago to swear fealty to the new monarch. When a boat delivering these orders docked in Velas on 11 June 1828, its military officers discovered that local authorities were hesitant and poorly motivated to acclaim the Infante King in the islands of the Azores. Following the Liberal Revolution, Touvar was deposed 22 June 1828, owing to his sympathies for the absolutists of the island of Terceira. Later life Touvar died in Lisbon on 14 June 1833.

It has the optimization of executing write-through on the first write and a write-back on all subsequent writes, reducing the overall bus traffic in consecutive writes to the computer memory. It was first described by James R. Goodman in (1983). Cache coherence protocols are an important issue in Symmetric multiprocessing systems, where each CPU maintains a cache of the memory.  States  In this protocol, each block in the local cache is in one of these four states: * Invalid: This block has an incoherent copy of the memory. * Valid: This block has a coherent copy of the memory. The data may be possibly shared, but its content is not modified. * Reserved: The block is the only copy of the memory, but it is still coherent. No write-back is needed if the block is replaced. * Dirty: The block is the only copy of the memory and it is incoherent. This copy was written one or more times. This is the only state that generates a write-back when the block is replaced in the cache. These states have exactly the same meanings as the four states of the MESI protocol (they are simply listed in reverse order), but this is a simplified form of it that avoids the Read for Ownership operation. Instead, all invalidation is done by writes to main memory. For any given pair of caches, the permitted states of a given cache line are as follows (abbreviated in the order above): {class= style=text-align:center ! !! I !! V !! R !! D - ! I     - ! V     - ! R     - ! D     }  Transitions  The protocol follows some transition rules for each event: Write-Once Transition DiagramThe \\"WM\\" transition from the Invalid state is erroneous; the write must be written through to memory and so leaves the line in the Reserved state. * Read hit: The information is supplied by the current cache. No state change. * Read miss: The data is read from main memory. The read is snooped by other caches; if any of them have the line in the Dirty state, the read is interrupted long enough to write the data back to memory before it is allowed to continue. Any copies in the Dirty or Reserved states are set to the Valid state. * Write hit: If the information in the cache is in Dirty or Reserved state, the cache line is updated in place and its state is set to Dirty without updating memory. If the information is in Valid state, a write-through operation is executed updating the block and the memory and the block state is changed to Reserved. Other caches snoop the write and set their copies to Invalid. * Write miss: A partial cache line write is handled as a read miss (if necessary to fetch the unwritten portion of the cache line) followed by a write hit. This leaves all other caches in the Invalid state, and the current cache in the Reserved state. This is a variant of the MESI protocol, but there is no explicit read-for-ownership or broadcast invalidate operation to bring a line into cache in the Exclusive state without performing a main memory write. Instead, the first write to a Valid (a.k.a. Shared) cache line performs a write through to memory, which implicitly invalidates other caches. After that, the line is in the Reserved (Exclusive) state, and further writes can be done without reference to main memory, leaving the cache line in the Dirty (Modified) state.

Song background The credits and Leeds Publishing Company list Watson as a co- writer. That should be the end of any controversy. However, later, Best claimed, without any proof whatsoever, that Watson had nothing to do with the creation of the song, but Watson maintained in his late 1960s autobiography that he and Best wrote the song together, lyrics and music respectively. Best was a member of Watson's group, the Brown Dots. The song was published in 1945 and released by Watson's quartet with Joe King as lead vocalist on the Manor Records label (catalog No. 1041A). Best who was always at odds with Watson, and began recording behind Watson's back with another band, after the publishing clearly listed the two names as composer (Best) and lyricist (Watson), had claimed that he'd originally written the lyrics for a little girl as a 12 year old boy, simply does not hold water, since a 12 year old would have no idea about being sentimental, as if two kids could have had a long history. Best and fans of Best had a list of petty complaints and accusations about and against Watson, which would seem to point to there being friction between the two Brown Dots members, rather than there being any validity to such things.

Every aggravation Malry suffers from society—such as being forced to walk along a particular stretch of pavement due to a building's placement—is revenged by a recompense—in this case, \\"[scratching] an unsightly line about a yard long into the blackened portland stone facing of the office block\\" (23–4). Having established this system, and growing progressively angry at society, Malry graduates from minor acts of personal revenge (mostly vandalism) to large- scale terrorism: bombing hoaxes, an actual bombing, and poisoning West London's drinking water. Shortly before he manages to bomb the House of Commons, he dies of cancer. Christie compares himself to \\"Guy Fawkes, with the difference that he was caught\\" and strictly follows a code of twelve principles. The first principle, \\"I am a cell of one\\" (89), forbids him from discussing his actions with anyone else, not even with his few friends or with the Shrike, his beloved girlfriend. Metafictional elements Johnson scatters many metafictional elements throughout the novel, often for comedic effect. Characters frequently mention in passing that they know that they are works of fiction, such as when Malry's mother says to him that she has been his mother for the purposes of the novel (27), or when Christie complains that the novel contains too many exclamation marks (166). Johnson also frequently emphasizes the written, and thereby invented, nature of the text. Following Malry's poisoning of a reservoir, Johnson writes: > A total of just over twenty thousand people died of cyanide poisoning that > morning. This was the first figure that came to hand as it is roughly the > number of words of which the novel consists so far. Be assured there are not > many more, neither deaths nor words. (147) Johnson introduces himself as a character near the novel's end, apologising to Christie that he won't be able to continue the book much further—to which Christie replies that people don't equate length with importance, and that readers no longer want long novels (165). Johnson delays his description of Christie until the sixth chapter, where he provides a description \\"with diffidence,\\" fearing that the reader will simply ignore it, or disagree: > What writer can compete with the reader's imagination! Christie is therefore > an average shape, height, weight, build, and colour. Make him what you will: > probably in the image of yourself. You are allowed complete freedom in the > matter of warts and moles; as long as he has at least one of either.

It is best known for its French Impressionist masterpieces, architecture, and stately grounds. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark as a nationally significant example of Colonial Revival architecture, built in 1901 to designs that were the result of a unique collaboration between Theodate Pope Riddle, one of the United States' first female architects, and the renowned firm of McKim, Mead & White. The house was built for Riddle's father, Alfred Atmore Pope, and the art collection it houses was collected by Pope and Riddle. House and museum The picturesque Sunken Garden at Hill–Stead Hill–Stead was created on as a country estate for wealthy industrialist Alfred Atmore Pope, to the designs of his daughter Theodate Pope Riddle. Egerton Swartwout of the renowned architectural firm McKim, Mead, and White translated her design into a working site plan, and construction took place over the period of 1898 to 1901. Theodate inherited the house after her parents deaths, and prior to her own passing in 1946 willed Hill–Stead Museum as a memorial to her parents and \\"for the benefit and enjoyment of the public\\". She directed that both the house and its contents remain intact, not to be moved, lent, or sold. Hill–Stead comprises , the balance having been sold off during the first years of the museum's operation. Buildings which remain part of the property include the Pope-Riddle House itself (a large mansion built in the Colonial Revival style and once described as \\"a great new house on a hilltop\\" by novelist and occasional guest Henry James); an 18th-century farm house; a carriage garage with an Arts and Crafts theater; a barn and additional farm buildings. American elm and barns located on the property (July 2019)Today, 19 rooms of the house are open to visitors. Remaining as it was at the time of Theodate's death, the house is extensively furnished with paintings, prints, objets d'art, and fine furniture and rugs. Highlights of the collection include major paintings by Eugène Carrière, Mary Cassatt, Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet and James McNeill Whistler; prints including three engravings by Albrecht Dürer (Melencolia I, 1514), 17 copper plate etchings and lithographs by James McNeill Whistler, and Japanese woodblock prints by artists Katsushika Hokusai, Utagawa Hiroshige and Kitagawa Utamaro; eight bronze sculptures by Antoine-Louis Barye; about 13,000 letters and postcards including correspondence from Mary Cassatt, Henry James and James McNeill Whistler; and about 2,500 photographs, including six of Gertrude Käsebier's art photographs. Hill–Stead's grounds were originally designed in consultation with landscape architect Warren H. Manning and feature a broad lawn with ha-ha and slate walkway; artificial pond; and formal, octagonal flower garden. Around 1920, landscape gardener Beatrix Farrand redesigned the estate's Sunken Garden (1 acre) at Theodate's request. Due to the wartime labor shortage experienced during the 1940s, the garden grassed over leaving only the summerhouse in place. Though it was replanted in time, it was not until the 1980s that the Sunken Garden was restored to exhibit Farrand's original plan. National Historic Landmark Hill–Stead was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1991. The Hill-Stead has also been the venue of one of the longest running poetry festivals in the country, the Sunken Garden Festival.

The Dreamcast VGA Box (also known generally as a DC VGA adapter or DC VGA cable) is an accessory for Sega's Dreamcast video game console that allows it to connect to a video display such as a computer monitor or an HDTV set through a VGA port. Because the Dreamcast hardware can produce a VGA-compatible video signal natively, this connection provides improved picture quality compared to standard composite video or S-Video connections, along with support for progressive scan video. Sega released the original VGA Box as an official accessory, but many third-party versions were also produced and sold worldwide in various form factors. Most games for the Dreamcast are VGA-compatible, while various workarounds exist to enable VGA output from many of the games that do not feature official support. Functionality Most VGA boxes also have S-Video and composite video output. A third-party Dreamcast VGA box When pins 6 and 7 on the Dreamcast's A/V out port are connected to the ground pin (such as when a VGA box is connected to the console and externally switched to VGA mode), the Dreamcast system internally switches to VGA mode, displaying a 720x480 image (480p progressive scan, at a standard EDTV resolution) in RGBHV at 31 kHz, which allows it to connect to a computer monitor or EDTV/HDTV set with a VGA input. The official VGA Box consists of a rectangular black plastic case, bearing a VGA out port and a 3.5 mm minijack for stereo audio output on one side, and an A/V output jack breakout panel (S-Video, composite, and RCA stereo audio jacks) on the other, for switching output either to a typical computer monitor and speakers/headphones or to a typical TV. Most third-party versions are functionally identical to Sega's model besides cosmetic differences, but some simplified designs lack the additional A/V breakout and output switch. These units can only be used for VGA and audio output. Some of these designs are streamlined to the point that no extra housing is required beyond the cable jacket and the connectors; such units are described generically as DC VGA cables. One enhanced model, the Performance-branded VGA Adapter for Dreamcast produced by InterAct, additionally features a VGA input port and stereo minijack input for PC video and audio pass-through, with automatic source switching when the Dreamcast system is powered on and off. This enables a computer or other daisy-chained video game console with VGA output to remain connected to the same monitor and speakers as the Dreamcast simultaneously, without swapping cables or using additional switches for both VGA video and 3.5 mm stereo minijack audio. It is also possible to modify a Dreamcast to add the same VGA functionality to the console itself, obviating the need for a standalone VGA box. Compatibility Software Most Dreamcast games are compatible with the VGA Box. Incompatible games will normally present an error message upon boot. All Dreamcast games can use a VGA box's S-Video and composite ports when the box is switched to TV mode, meaning one does not have to swap cables to play VGA-incompatible games as long as a display is also connected to one of these ports. There are a handful of European and North American games that did not include the necessary flag within the boot sector on the disc ('IP.BIN'), thus preventing the Dreamcast from booting in VGA mode. Common workarounds include unplugging the VGA Box while booting a game, or temporarily switching the VGA Box into TV mode while booting a game, or using a boot disc such as DC-X. Elements of some sprite- based games that were originally designed for interlaced display may appear less detailed when displayed in progressive mode due to the lack of scanlines softening the image. However, these games are officially considered compatible with the VGA Box because they can be played normally in VGA mode, and were thus branded as compatible on packaging and marketing materials. Hardware and accessories Dreamcast VGA boxes are compatible with Dreamcast systems from all regions, since all consoles are capable of producing the appropriate video signal. NTSC and PAL systems will produce images at the same resolution and horizontal scan rate when running similar compatible software. Dreamcast light guns will work with VGA or other connections when using a direct-view CRT VGA display or a multisync, significantly-bright CRT projector. They will not function with LCD, LED, and plasma screens, or digital projectors, regardless of the connection used. Digital displays The VGA Box can be connected to an HDTV or PC monitor's DVI port with a simple passive adapter, as long as the port is DVI-A or DVI-I compatible. It is also possible to convert the VGA output of the Dreamcast to HDMI or DVI-D via an active VGA to HDMI converter. However, since this is an analog-to-digital video conversion, the picture quality will depend on the processor in the converter and/or display, especially if any image scaling is performed. Such processing may also introduce or worsen display latency. Post Dreamcast discontinuation Demand for Dreamcast VGA boxes has risen among console owners in the years following the discontinuation of the Dreamcast due to an overall increase in the usage of HDTVs and computer monitors since then, as such displays increasingly lack standard S-Video and/or composite video connections. Accordingly, prices for Dreamcast VGA boxes on the second-hand market have increased as well, particularly for discontinued premium models. Based on this continuing demand, older and new third-party models also remain available from both retro game accessory companies and individual hobbyists selling homemade designs. Other video game consoles released shortly after the Dreamcast, such as the PlayStation 2, early revisions of the Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox, supported progressive scan through YPbPr component video, although relatively few PlayStation 2 titles took advantage of the feature compared to Dreamcast and the others. Various VGA accessories and independent hacks were produced for these consoles, mostly by third-party manufacturers and hobbyists. However, since none of these consoles were capable of producing a native RGBHV signal at 31 kHz for standard VGA output, these devices were generally designed around an outboard color space transcoder and/or scan converter. The most common and inexpensive of these devices, as with most similarly low-end general purpose signal converters, generated a VGA signal from composite or S-Video, resulting in poor quality. The complexity, cost, and lack of software support for such accessories led to far lower VGA usage compared to the Dreamcast. However, since these consoles supported YPbPr component video natively, they were easier to use with typical EDTVs and HDTVs that may have lacked VGA support. Later consoles widened support for progressive scan by featuring component video, VGA, and/or HDMI connection options.

They were quite popular in Ireland, and released several LPs, and two CDs – the compilation Ghosts And Heroes on the Kitten label in 1992 and another compilation Eyelids into Snow – A Collection in 2001. The founding members were Sonny Condell (also a member of another popular Irish music band Tír na nÓg), Philip King, Greg Boland and Jimmy O'Brien Moran. O'Brien Moran left the band in 1980, after the first album. Robbie Overson, replacing guitarist Greg Boland, joined the band in 1987. Scullion continue to play live. Formation In 1976 Sonny Condell and Philip King played together with Freddie White (vocals and guitar), Mick Daly (vocals and guitar), Dan Fitzgerald (drums) and Eamon Doyle (bass). This band was a fun relief for the members, all of whom were involved in other group and solo projects. King came up with the name \\"Scullion\\" for this collective. In the summer of 1979, former Tír na nÓg songwriter Sonny Condell (vocals and guitar) was sharing a flat in Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin with Greg Boland (guitarist), whom he had befriended during the recording of Camouflage, his debut solo album on the Mulligan label. They were joined around this time by Philip King (vocals and harmonica) who, having decided to quit teaching for a career in music, had also become their flatmate. Boland had just left Irish band Stagalee and they began doing some informal gigs together. King had also approached Mulligan with the aim of securing a solo album deal but, as the trio's performances were being well received, the idea of combining the approach to Mulligan as a group became an attractive alternative. All that was needed was a collective name and it was decided to re-use \\"Scullion\\". Early years A record deal was agreed and in late 1979 the band went into Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin, to record with producer P. J. Curtis. At Curtis' suggestion, Jimmy O'Brien Moran (pipes) was brought in to add a Celtic flavour to the sound and the band was expanded to four. The debut album, Scullion, was released in early 1980 and generated an increased demand for live performances. There followed a busy period of live performances, including an appearance at the Lisdoonvarna Festival in County Clare, which was to expand the audience base to national level. The band also spent a couple of months in the Netherlands, during which time they played some support concerts to John Martyn, whom they subsequently approached to produce their second album Balance and Control (1981) on the newly established Warner Bros. (Ireland) label. O'Brien Moran decided to pursue formal music studies at this point and the band reverted to a trio. They toured extensively up to the autumn of 1982. Early in 1983, they were approached by Nicky Ryan, who had just finished working as sound engineer and manager of Clannad. Ryan produced the third Scullion album, White Side of Night. Mid-1980s onwards In spring of 1985 the trio were approached to record and tour again. The result was Spin, their fourth album. The single Carol received very good airplay in Ireland over the next nine months, culminating in a performance at Self Aid on 17 May 1986. Shortly afterwards, Boland left the band after nearly seven years. He was replaced by Robbie Overson who is still the third member. In 1988, this lineup recorded the Cooler At The Edge EP which was produced by Donal Lunny. Two compilation albums Eyelids Into Snow – A Collection, and Ghosts and Heroes have been released, with both including live tracks. In mid-2012, Scullion recorded a new collection of songs and released their new album, Long Wave, in September, their first album in 27 years.

He is a notable and rare example of the successful escape from slavery and indentured servitude. The son of a black slave and a white indentured servant, he was born free under Virginia law, which at the time gave children the legal status of their mothers. Ashby worked around the Williamsburg area as a carter and carpenter. He was also known to deliver messages for the state, working for Governor Botetourt. Although he himself was indentured until the age of 31, by law, he managed to acquire many things that were well out of the realm of the average slave or servant, including a silver watch, candle making supplies, tea boards, and books. Matthew married Ann, a slave of the bricklayer, Samuel Spurr. They had two children named John and Mary, who attended the Bray school affiliated with the College of William and Mary. Ms. Anne Wager taught the children the Church of England catechism as well as other subjects. Matthew was able to use his free status to buy his children and wife from Spurr, at the cost of £150. Despite owning his own children and wife Ashby still had to petition the government for their freedom. Standing before the council, Ashby proclaimed that his wife had been faithful and diligent in all her wifely duties, and that his children were also deserving of their freedom. The council deliberated and found that they agreed with his proposal and his family was granted their freedom in 1769. Two years later Ashby died of a heart disease, leaving his family alone.

She states that these disparities, the black health deficit, are caused by the continuation of the slave health deficit. She encourages reparation in the form of long term monetary and legal commitments and a comprehensive civil rights health care law. Summary The book begins with statistics of short life expectancy, high death rates, high infant mortality, low birth weight rates, and high disease rates as compared to European Americans. Randall states that they are a direct result of slavery and the lack of health care that was provided from the time of slavery to the Jim Crow laws, the Affirmative Action time, and to the Racial Entrenchment time of the present. She points out the racial barriers to the access of health care, nursing homes, hospitals, physicians, and other professionals. In addition, she acknowledges a lack of minority health professionals and thus a shortage of minority input into the health care system. She insists that the health care system rid itself of intentional and inadvertent racism. The managed care organizations entice providers and facilitators to engage in discrimination. This has also led to a mistrust of the health care system by blacks. Randall insists that this is not simply paranoia but is based on a history of experimentation, Sickle Cell Screening Initiative, planning/involuntary sterilization, and the excuses that the medical system gave to justify its discriminations. These abuses contribute to her accusation of the human rights violations by institutional racism in the health care system, the large inequality in health status, and the lack of legal protection. She concludes her book with the authenticity of her call for reparations from the American government. The slave health deficit will continue to negatively impact African Americans unless a well planned legal program is enacted.

History Childhood home of Loretta Lynn Incorporated in 1912, the town was named for a director of Consolidation Coal Company (Consol), Van Lear Black. It owes its existence to the viable efforts of John Caldwell Calhoun Mayo. Mayo bought coal rights to land along Miller's Creek in Johnson County, which he later sold to Northern Coal and Coke, which in turn was later acquired by Consol. Consol built five miles of railroad into the Johnson County property with money loaned by Van Lear Black's Fidelity Trust. Eventually five coal mines were opened and operated in Van Lear from 1910 through 1946. The vast coal deposits were mined from five underground mines around the clock. The miners included immigrant Irish, Italians and Slavs, as well as Appalachians and locals. The mines were integrated; both blacks and whites worked underground. During the boom years the population surpassed 4000. In 1945 Consol merged with the Pittsburgh Coal Company, then divested itself of its Miller's Creek properties. The people who lived in company-owned housing were given first chance to purchase those homes and many did. However, most of the major buildings were torn down. Van Lear today Common box turtle (Terrapene ) observed at Butcher Holler, June 2014. Currently, Van Lear is an unincorporated community. There are no deep mines operating in Van Lear proper, although some mines operate nearby. Most of the residents work in locations outside Van Lear, including the nearby cities of Paintsville, Prestonsburg, and Pikeville. Since the end of local mining, only a handful of businesses continue to operate in the Van Lear area, including a bookstore, , Icky's 1950's Snack Shop (located inside the Coal Miners' Museum), Mine number 5 store/Webb's store, (owned by Loretta (Webb) Lynn's family) and Blood Moon Security Solutions, a private security company. People work in mining, education, health care, government, and retail/service jobs. The present population of Van Lear proper is roughly 1600. The total population of the Van Lear postal district (including Butcher Hollow) is over 3000. The Van Lear mines are referred to by country music singer Loretta Lynn in her song \\"Coal Miner's Daughter\\" and in the title song of her Van Lear Rose album, by Tyler Childers in the song \\"Coal\\" from his \\"Bottles and Bibles\\" album, and by Dwight Yoakam in \\"Miner's Prayer\\" from his Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc. album.

It was released in the United States on April 15, 2008 by Island Records. The singer began recording the album in 2007 in Anguilla, after writing and composing most of its material during and after her 2006 Adventures of Mimi Tour. Carey worked with various songwriters and producers on the project, including Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, The- Dream, Tricky Stewart, Scott Storch and Danja. The album revealed a more personal side of the singer, illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. It was meant to be a continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Although it shared similar vocal production as well as an inclination to her signature pop and R&B; ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC² included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns. E=MC² was generally well received by music critics, with many complimenting the record's broad genre influences, and musical and production styles. Some critics, however, felt that the album was too similar to The Emancipation of Mimi, and didn't offer anything new from the formula. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with opening week sales of 463,000 copies; the highest first-week sales of Carey's career. It opened inside the top-five on the albums chart in Australia, Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold over 2.5 million copies. Four singles were released to promote the album. The album's lead single, \\"Touch My Body\\", became Carey's eighteenth chart-topper on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, surpassing the record held by Elvis Presley. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the chart, tying Presley for most weeks at number one. It achieved strong worldwide charting, peaking within the top five of the singles charts in Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \\"Bye Bye\\" served as the album's second release. Although hailed by critics, and expected to have achieved large commercial success, the song stalled at number nineteen on the Hot 100, and managed to chart weakly internationally. The third single, \\"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\\" failed to garner success in any prominent music market. However, The fourth and final single \\"I Stay in Love\\" became her fourteenth chart topper on the Dance Club Songs chart.  Background and recording  In 2002, Mariah Carey signed a new record deal with Island Records and in 2005 she released her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best- selling album of 2005 the United States, and the second best-seller around the world, with over 12 million units sold. It earned a myriad of music industry awards, and brought Carey back to the top of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001. After completing The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC². E=MC² was hailed as one of the most anticipated albums of 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. Carey began writing and producing the music she saw fit, and not anything to please record executives. Throughout 2007, Carey recorded the album in a studio built into her private villa in Anguilla, in the Caribbean. She described E=MC² as one of her most expressive albums, and one that she felt free on, and able to express herself through her music. In an interview with The Bryan Times, Carey spoke of her sentiments on the album \\"It's hard for me to sit here and talk about it without sounding like if I'm bragging if I'm in love with it, but I am I love with this album. I think that having the success with the last record allowed me to have more freedom...and just make records that I like. It's kind of a really fun record\\".  Delays and release  The album was supposed to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: \\"You can't really put records out in December if you want the whole world to have a chance to actually hear it, [and] my fans all over the world are very important to me\\", adding that she also wants to put out a pair of singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: \\"This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down\\". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008. Prior to its release, the album's working title had been That Chick, which was also the working title of a song on the album that would eventually be titled, \\"I'm That Chick\\". As the release date drew near, the title was changed to E=MC², in reference to Carey's previous album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The title signifies \\"(E) Emancipation (=) of (MC) Mariah Carey (²) to the second power\\". It is a word play on Albert Einstein's famous mass–energy equivalence formula and has been dubbed as the sequel and improved counterpart to The Emancipation of Mimi. In his review of the album, Alex Macpherson from The Guardian described his thoughts on its title, as well as its meaning: > It is worth pondering what the title of Mariah Carey's eleventh studio album > could refer to. Emancipation, maybe, in a nod to her 2005 comeback album, > The Emancipation of Mimi; or perhaps the energy of the original equation, a > statement that Carey still has what it takes to party all night at the age > of 37, even as she describes herself as \\"eternally 12\\". Then again, she > could just be identifying herself alongside Einstein as a fellow genius. > Either way, 'E=MC²' finds Carey loopier than ever, embracing her own larger- > than-life image with gusto: Mariah Carey Squared indeed. Carey expressed how she considered Mimi the \\"main course\\", and felt that the new album would be treated as \\"dessert\\". In an interview with NME, the singer described her choice on the album's title: \\"Basically, I'm freer on this album than I've ever been. Some of the songs on the last album were cool but maybe not quite as neat as this album.\\" When questioned if the title represented Carey's interest in physics, she jokingly added \\"Einstein's theory? Physics? Me? Hello! I even failed remedial math. I could not pass seventh grade math even in the lowest class with the worst kids.\\" The album's similarity to its predecessor is not only found in the title and music, but also in its artwork. In the album's cover art, she holds almost the exact pose as from her last album, only with different lighting and wardrobe. It features a black backdrop, with Carey completely naked, except for a large feathered shawl covering her body. Only her first name appears in large pink letters on the cover, with 'E=MC²' appearing in small white letters on the top. In describing the cover, Macpherson wrote \\"Carey is naked but for the world's largest feather boa, an accessory for which flocks of birds have surely given their lives.\\"  Composition   Style and structure  Music critics compared E=MC² heavily to Carey's previous album, The Emancipation of Mimi, and felt it followed the same formula of ballads and dance-able tracks. Freedom De Luc of The Washington Post felt that after experiencing strong success for the first time in the 2000s with Mimi, Carey tried to create E=MC² with the same formula, although possibly a little improved: \\"Having found that winning formula of coquettish club bangers, emotional ballads and frisky, mid-tempo coos, the diva with the golden tone has eschewed radical experimentalism here for stasis. 'E=MC²' is mostly more of the same, then, with the '2' representing something sequential rather than exponential. Meet the new Mariah, almost exactly the same as the old . . . 'Mimi'!\\"  Songs and lyrics  The first song on the album's track list is \\"Migrate\\", a song Carey wrote and co-produced alongside Danja, and features a rap verse from T-Pain. Its melody is built on a heavy electronic beat, and incorporates whistle registers and several studio-created synthesizers into its melody. Additionally, the song features the inclusion of Auto-Tune and several vocal manipulators, which are used heavily on both Carey and T-Pain's vocals. Lyrically, the song finds the singer during a night out, migrating from several locations: from the car to the club, from the bar to the V.I.P, from the party to the after-party, and finally to the hotel. According to Brian Hiatt from VH1, she \\"hops from my car into the club ... from the bar to VIP ... from the party to the after-party ... afterparty to hotel\\" with T-Pain, who urges her to \\"bounce, bounce, bounce.\\" The album's lead single, \\"Touch My Body\\", was written and produced by Carey, Tricky Stewart and Terius \\"The Dream\\" Nash. The song's hook is built around a piano melody and \\"circular keyboard line\\", and features \\"a stuttering mid-tempo beat that's accented by finger snaps and electronic synthesizers\\" as its instrumentation. Lyrically, the song describes the protagonist revealing several bedroom fantasies in which she would like to engage in, asking her lover playfully to \\"touch her body\\". According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, it's a \\"questionably sexy striptease: a goofy-sleazy tryst vignette\\", with Carey singing \\"If there's a camera up in here then I best not catch this flick on YouTube.\\" \\"Cruise Control\\", featuring reggae artist Damian Marley, is influenced by R&B; and reggae, and finds her adapting to the genre by imitating Jamaican phrases, accents and styles of singing. \\"I Stay in Love\\" was released as the fourth and final single from the album. Written by Carey and Bryan-Michael Cox, is a mid-tempo \\"beat-driven\\" and \\"piano-laced\\" ballad, that is influenced by pop and R&B; music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. Its lyrics find Carey as her most vulnerable; she describes old times she shared with her lover, and that even though \\"we said let go\\", and \\"inside she knows it's over\\", she still \\"stays in love with him\\". Featuring American rapper Young Jeezy, \\"Side Effects\\" describes Carey's abusive relationship with Tommy Mottola, her ex-husband. During the first verse, she discusses the pair's background, and how she was young and naive, and believed everything he preached to her. The lyrics read \\"Keepin' me there, under your thumb / Cause you were scared that I'd become much / More than you could handle,\\" she confesses, and refers to herself as \\"Shining like a chandelier / That decorated every room inside / The private hell we built / And I dealt with it / Like a kid I wished / I could fly away.\\" Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe described it as \\"another look at her fractious marriage to Mottola\\", and wrote \\"Although the union ended in 1998, Carey is still suffering, including dreams of the 'violent times' and 'sleeping with the enemy'. Interestingly, her vocal approach here is almost emo, as she hits her rock-solid middle register and refuses to be held captive by the demons of her past.\\" MTV News writer Jennifer Vineyard described the song in detail: > [It] finally reveals a side of Mariah we don't see that often — her true > self. The Mariah we usually see and hear is a glossy one. Psychologists > might say her affect is 'off' — meaning her gestures and facial expressions > don't match her mood. There's a reason for that, as she explains on 'Side > Effects', which is the emotional abuse she says she suffered during her > marriage to music mogul Tommy Mottola. Mariah, who is usually quite guarded, > has alluded to the subject in songs like 'Petals', but never has she gone > into such detail as she does on 'Side Effects', in which she refers to the > marriage as a 'private hell that we built'. Even though it's been 11 years > since they split up, she sings in a lower register that she's still 'wakin' > up scared some nights ... dreaming about the violent times'. Her emotional > scars left her 'a little protective ... a little defensive ... a little > depressed', which makes her 'fake a smile' as she 'deal[s] with the side > effects'. Even though it features Young Jeezy, it sounds like a rock power > ballad. \\"I'm That Chick\\" is a song Carey wrote alongside Norwegian duo, Stargate. It is a fast-paced song, which features a \\"care-free feel\\", and is influenced by soul, pop and disco music genres. The song incorporates a sample from Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\", and features a strong thumping bass-line and hand claps. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters described it as a \\"late-night disco-bass groove\\", and highlighted its production as the album's finest. \\"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\\", the album's eventual third single, was written and produced by Carey and DJ Toomp. The song was described as a \\"mid-tempo\\", \\"party jam\\", that is influenced by pop, R&B; and soul genres. Critics elaborated on the song's \\"soul\\" influence, with Melissa Ruggieri from The News & Advance describing it as a \\"soul-thumper\\", while Digital Spys Nick Levine called it a \\"nod towards classic soul\\". The song's title is derived from the popular line, \\"me love you long time\\", from the 1987 war film, Full Metal Jacket. Additionally, its hook and instrumentation is derived from sampling Mark DeBarge's Stay With Me. Critics also noted how \\"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\\" \\"recalls\\" the melody riff and chord progression of the Hill Street Bluess theme song. The song's main source of production comes from its \\"lush keyboard work\\", and her usage of the \\"double voice\\", which she uses throughout the song's bridge. Carey described the effect as \\"layering her voice\\", so that the bridge would sound like a \\"swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs\\". \\"Bye Bye\\" served as the album's thirteenth track, and also composed by Carey and Stargate. An \\"inspirational power ballad\\", it is influenced by R&B; and pop music genres. The song is built on an understated and simple piano-driven melody, that is decorated with a soft bass-line. Lyrically, the song was described by critics as a \\"larger than life anthem\\", and an \\"inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad\\", and finds Carey remembering both her father, as well as any lost loved ones. While the verses are dedicated to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: \\"This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye\\". While listing several forms of loss, Carey encourages to never let go, and always live with their memory, and put their hands up if they ever lost someone, 'cause we won't ever say bye bye'. Serving as the album's closing number, \\"I Wish You Well\\" was compared to the closing number on Mimi, \\"Fly Like a Bird\\". Similarly, \\"I Wish You Well\\" incorporates gospel influence into its melody of \\"rousing piano waltz\\", that \\"extends forgiveness to those who have wronged her in the past and is pretty much interchangeable with its predecessors.\\" Extensively making use of the whistle register, she references Mottola in another light than \\"Side Effects\\": \\"'I Wish You Well's' message to Mottola is similarly striking. Accompanied by a piano and some multi-tracked backing vocals, Carey sings: \\"Still bruised, still walk on eggshells / Same frightened child, hide to protect myself / But you can't manipulate me like before.\\" She then prescribes Bible study and says, \\"I wish you well.\\"  Promotion  Following the song's digital release, Carey promoted the song on several live televised appearances and programs throughout the world. Only days prior to being released digitally, the singer was announced as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live, taking over for Janet Jackson who caught the flu and was unable to perform. Hosted by Jonah Hill, Carey performed both \\"Touch My Body\\", as well as live rendition of \\"Migrate\\" alongside T-Pain. Following the set, Carey and her manager at the time, Benny Medina, met with Lee Daniels, who then offered her a role in his film adaptation of Precious (2008), in which Carey would later star and earn acclaim for her acting. After reaching the top of the Billboard charts, the Empire State Building was lit up in Carey's motif colors, white, pink and lavender, for the entire week. On March 25, 2008, Carey was featured as the special guest performer at The Hills season premiere party, an event marking the start of a span of ten episodes airing in between season three and four. Carey performed \\"Touch My Body\\", \\"I'm That Chick\\" and \\"We Belong Together\\", before exiting the stage to a standing ovation. After the performance, Carey received strong praise from the program's cast members, with Lauren Conrad saying \\"I've always been a huge Mariah fan, and she's just so beautiful and talented'. Whitney Port and Audrina Patridge referred to Carey as \\"an amazing singer\\", while claiming to have listened to her music from a young age. On April 12, 2008, Carey made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Winfrey interviewed the singer on her weight loss, E=MC², and even showed footage of Carey in her New York apartment, showing off her lingerie closet. Following the interview, Carey performed a live rendition of \\"Bye Bye\\" for the audience, with three background vocalists assisting her. Kevin Johnson from St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the performance as \\"touching\\", and complimented the song's appeal. Carey and her dancers performing \\"Touch My Body\\" on Good Morning America on April 25, 2008 On the seventh season of the talent competition American Idol, Carey was featured as a mentor for the top-seven week. Titled \\"Mariah Carey Week\\" and airing live on April 14, 2008, the contestants were to perform a song from the singer's catalog. After all seven contestants sang their individual songs, they all came together for a live rendition of Carey's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men, \\"One Sweet Day\\". Overall, critics noted how a Carey themed week would be extremely difficult for the performers, due to their vocally strenuous nature. Following their joint performance, Carey emerged onto the stage and performed \\"Bye Bye\\" live, while backed by a trio of supporting vocalists. Tamara Jones of The Washington Post jokingly commented on Carey's flailing hand movements during the performance, writing how she was \\"waving like a malevolent homecoming queen\\". Gil Kaufman from MTV News complimented Carey's performance, commenting on her \\"barely there micro-dress\\" and writing how she \\"serenaded the audience with her homage to lost ones.\\" The Calgary Suns Lindsey Ward described it as a \\"less-than-fab performance\\", although complimenting on Carey's leaner figure, \\"Oh, who am I kidding? She would look hot in a paper bag.\\" On April 25, 2008, Carey opened the Good Morning America \\"Summer Concert Series\\" with a live performance in Times Square. Carey, wearing a pink mini- skirt, began the set with \\"Touch My Body\\" in front of thousands of fans. During the song, her backing vocals began to malfunction, causing it to repeat phrases and play during her main vocal moments. In order to let the sound engineer know of the problem, she substituted part of the lyrics for \\"stop singing my part now baby\\", and completed the final chorus. She continued on with \\"I'm That Chick\\", and completed the three-song set-list with her follow- up single, \\"Bye Bye\\". After marking the album's stateside launch with her appearance on Good Morning America, Carey took to Europe to perform on several programs. She began with an interview on the British radio station, BBC Radio 1, and continued onto a live rendition of \\"Touch My Body\\" on both The Sunday Night Project and The Paul O'Grady Show. Similarly, Carey performed the song live on the German talent show, Deutschland sucht den Superstar (Germany searches for the superstar), in April 2008. On August 8, 2008, Carey performed a mash-up of the song at the 2008 Teen Choice Awards. She began with her single at the time, \\"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\\", and worked into the bridge of \\"Touch My Body\\", before reverting to the former song. At the Fashion Rocks ceremony in 2009, Carey performed \\"Touch My Body\\" and her current single, \\"Obsessed\\", as well as the remix to her 1995 song \\"Fantasy\\". During the set- list, Carey was accompanied by six men in black ties, who hoisted her into the air in front of over 6,000 people during \\"Obsessed\\", and rigorous dance routines throughout \\"Touch My Body\\". In promotion for E=MC² and the single, Carey was featured as a guest judge and musical act on the fifth season of the British talent competition, The X Factor. During that week, all the contestants would have to sing songs from Carey's catalog. Prior to her arrival, one of the show's judges Dannii Minogue said \\"Could it get any more nerve-wracking for the contestants?\\", due to the general strenuous nature of Carey's songs. After several performances by the finalists, Carey performed \\"I Stay in Love\\", accompanied by three background vocalists. She received a standing ovation from the audience and judges, and continued backstage for a taped session with the contestants. At the end of the program, she performed her classic \\"Hero\\" (1993), and was eventually joined by the finalists for the finale of the song. \\"Hero\\" was re-recorded by the 2008 UK X Factor finalists and released as a single, becoming the best-selling single of 2008. According to reports, the episode gained a large increase in viewers due to Carey's presence, and was able to surpass its long-time rival program, Strictly Come Dancing, in the ratings. Carey made an appearance at the American Music Awards, held on November 23, 2008 at the Nokia Theatre. Wearing a long black gown, she performed the song after receiving an honorary award for her achievements in music. Chris Harris from MTV News described it as a \\"riveting performance\\".  Singles  \\"Touch My Body\\" was released as the lead single from the album on February 12, 2008. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its hook and production, as well as its playful lyrics. \\"Touch My Body\\" reached the top position on the Hot 100 in its fourth week, and became Carey's eighteenth chart topper, selling 286,000 digital downloads. The song's opening week broke several records, making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, surpassing the record held by Elvis Presley. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the Billboard chart history.\\" The song also sold the highest amount of digital records in one week, surpassing Rihanna's \\"Umbrella\\" (2007), which sold 277,000 units. Internationally, the song achieved strong chart success, peaking within the top five on the charts in Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The song's music video was directed by film-maker Brett Ratner, who had previously worked with the singer on five other music videos. It follows around a story revolving around a computer employees fantasy as he visits Carey's home. As he fixes her computer, he enters a fantasy in which the pair perform several activities together, including a pillow fight, playing laser tag, Guitar Hero and slot cars, and throw a frisbee, all while showing off Carey's figure in several revealing outfits. \\"Bye Bye\\" was announced as the second single from the album on April 15, 2008. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, and was heavily speculated to have become her 19th number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. Many reviewers complimented its simple and understated musical arrangement and personalized lyrics, while some felt the song was too simple for an artist of Carey's stature. The track only managed to reach a peak position of number nineteen on the Billboard Hot 100. Throughout other countries where it found release, the song achieved relatively weak charting, peaking within the top ten in New Zealand, and in the top-fifty in Canada, Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Justin Francis on the island of Antigua in the Caribbean. Notably, Carey and Cannon began dating during their trip to the island, and later wed on April 30, 2008. The video features behind-the-scenes footage of the couple, Carey promoting the album in the United Kingdom, as well as photos of several of Carey's close friends, family and past collaborators such as Luciano Pavarotti and Luther Vandross. The album's third single, \\"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\\", was released on June 1, 2008. Many complimented the song's production and incorporation of the \\"Stay With me\\" sample, while others were unimpressed with the chorus in general. Chuck Taylor of Billboard assured the song would endure strong success and radio appeal, and complimented its overall production, as well as Carey's voice: \\"[It's] a playful, beach-befitting groove, featuring a bright sample from DeBarge's \\"Stay With Me,\\" lushly woven vocals and Carey's highs doting on fans with her sonic signature.\\" In the United States, the song peaked at number fifty-eight, and at number twenty-seven in Japan. On the UK Singles Chart, \\"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\\" peaked at number eighty-four, and spent only one week in the chart. The song was featured on the final scene of You Don't Mess with the Zohan (2008), a film in which Carey made a cameo appearance. Its accompanying music video was shot over a three-day interval in Hawaii, and makes usage of the islands scenery, as well as shots of Carey in several bikinis, while swimming with a dolphin. \\"I Stay in Love\\" was released as the fourth and final single from the album on October 28, 2008. The song failed to chart on the Hot 100, though became Carey's fourteenth chart topper on the Hot Dance Club Play. Additionally, it peaked at number ninety-five on the UK Singles Chart. The song's accompanying music video was filmed by Carey's husband, Nick Cannon, and features Carey as a dancer in a Las Vegas show at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino Resort. Additionally, during the show and its preparations, Carey realizes that her ex-lover has found love with one of her fellow dancers, leading her to blow up the car he gave her, as well as its accompaniments in the Mojave Desert.  Tour  Since the album's release in early April, Carey had said publicly that she planned on embarking on a large worldwide tour in support of E=MC². In an interview with Billboard on March 28, 2008, Carey explained \\"It's come up, and I'm probably going to do it, but I don't know exactly how we're going to do it or when. I'm thinking probably September. But I think it's important to tour with this album, because there are so many songs that I really want to sing live, that I really enjoy.\\" Months later, in an interview with MTV News in July, Carey further addressed her plans of a tour: \\"We're looking at November right now. Please don't hold me accountable if it turns out to be December 5 or December 7 or January 18!\\" When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained \\"I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough.\\" Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled by early December. Tabloids and critics began heavily speculating that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many claimed to have seen Carey visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight. Though Carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on November 28, 2010, over two years later, she admitted she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.  Critical reception  E=MC² received a 64/100 (indicating \\"generally positive reviews\\") on the website Metacritic, which averages professional reviews into a numerical score. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of Allmusic, rated the album three out of five stars, and wrote \\"it's misleading to judge Mariah based on her new record of possessing the most number one singles, as she's not about longevity, she's about being permanently transient, a characteristic 'E=MC²' captures all too well.\\" Billboards Gary Trust felt that on the album, Carey was in \\"pristine form\\", stating, \\"She's proclaimed emancipation before, but Mariah Carey's never sounded as free as she does on her 10th album. Carey's made a pop album with equal parts levity and gravity.\\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Margeaux Watson graded E=MC² an 'A-', and described how the album's goal was to prove \\"her comeback was no fluke\\". She continued complimenting the album's several collaborations, and wrote \\"the result is a largely enjoyable mix of flirtatious club jams, midtempo love songs, and emotional ballads anchored by hip-hop beats that handsomely showcase the singer's powerful vocal chops.\\" Though Carey's voice had been criticized since her 2002 release, Charmbracelet, for not being able to deliver the \\"gravity defying vocals\\" from the 1990s, Roger Friedman from Fox News wrote \\"Her infamous eight-octave range has suffered a little wear and tear over the years, but Carey still can flutter from great highs to mellow lows like no one else.\\" Alex Macpherson from The Guardian gave the album four out of five stars, heavily describing the singer's vocal state throughout the album: \\"Carey's voice has been mocked, bizarrely, as being a triumph of technique over soul - an argument that fails to comprehend that technique and soul are intertwined, that technique primarily exists as a means to convey emotion - but she is on fine vocal form throughout 'E=MC²', whether belting out massive ballads, or layering her voice into a swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs.\\" Macpherson concluded his review with, \\"When she sings elsewhere, \\"Them other regularities, they can't compare with MC,\\" \\"it is hard not to agree\\", referencing a lyric on \\"For the Record\\". The Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra felt all of the album's tracks were strong, and wrote \\"Every track plays like a potential hit single, and that's exactly what fans will love about 'E=MC²'. Expect it to soundtrack much of the summer and beyond.\\" Los Angeles Times staff writer, Richard Cromelin, gave the album two out of four stars, noting its \\"alternatives to the glass-shattering flamboyance of her early '90s youth.\\" He concluded in his mixed review of the album, \\"Of course, consistency isn't so important when an album is assembled as a series of singles rather than a cohesive work. Fortunately for Carey, the tabloid-tailored real-life back story on one side and the producer's craft on the other matter more than the art of singing in this particular fairy tale.\\" Ben Ratliff of The New York Times felt the album didn't level up to par with Carey's previous release, writing \\"Much of the record sounds like urban-radio imitations, without the peculiarities and effective hooks of 'Mimi'. Maybe emancipation isn't a continuing procedure; maybe it only comes once.\\" Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey rated E=MC² four out of ten discs, describing it as a \\"shallow imitation of its predecessor\\". Sawdey concluded his review on a mixed note, stating \\" the second act of Mariah's comeback doesn't wisely expand her sound: it instead succumbs to the blueprint so carefully laid out by its predecessor, a pointless remake that exists only because it has to. If you ever had a doubt as to its formulaic nature, you need to look no further than its title. Long live the Diva.\\" Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone questioned why she limited her vocal abilities throughout the record, \\"nearly every song confines Carey to four-note verses, offering little room for her glorious range.\\" Journalist Eric Henderson, writing for Slant Magazine, graded the album three out of five stars, and concluding with, \\"Such are the rewards of an album like 'E=MC²', in which one does reach a solution, but not before Mariah bends over backward to show her work.\\" The album finished in the top-ten of several \\"best of 2008\\" lists, ending at number four on an official poll held by Billboard, eight by The Detroit News, and number ten by The San Diego Union-Tribune.

Applications for nanodots could include high-density information storage, energy storage, and light- emitting devices. Information storage Magnetic nanodots are being developed for future information storage. Nanodot technology could potentially store over one hundred times more data than today's hard drives. The nanodots can be thought of as tiny magnets which can switch polarity to represent a binary digit. Hard drives typically magnetize areas 200-250 nm long to store individual bits (as of 2006), while nanodots can be 50 nm in diameter or smaller. Thus nanodot-based storage could offer considerably higher information density than existing hard drives. Nanodots could also lead to ultrafast memory.

The book was initially published by William Morrow on March 1, 1999. The novel tells a fictionalized version of the real life counter-espionage and spy ring, known as the Crook Factory, that was set up by Ernest Hemingway in Cuba during World War II. Overview The novel is narrated by Joe Lucas, an FBI agent who is sent to Cuba by J. Edgar Hoover to monitor Hemingway's activities. Lucas is at first bewildered why the director of the FBI has taken a personal interest in Hemingway and his spy network, which Lucas considers amateurish and almost silly. As the novel unfolds it becomes clear that Hemingway's ragtag organization is at the center of a complicated game of war-time counter- intelligence involving the FBI, the OSS, British intelligence, and the two German intelligence organizations operating at that time, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and the Abwehr. Lucas goes from a reluctant monitor of Hemingway to an active participant in the Crook Factory's operations. Basis on actual events While the novel is fictional, it incorporates multiple real events and almost all real people as characters. An author's note at the end of the novel reveals that many of the novel's events are based in fact, most notably the existence and organization of the Crook Factory, along with Hoover's interest in Hemingway, the support Hemingway received from the US Ambassador to Cuba, the activities of German intelligence agents in Cuba and South America, and the various historical and celebrity figures who frequented the finca where Hemingway lived outside Havana.

It is named after its progenitor, Muhammad Ali Pasha, regarded as the founder of modern Egypt. It was also more formally known as the Alawiyya dynasty (). Because a majority of the rulers from this dynasty bore the title khedive, it was often referred to by contemporaries as the Khedival dynasty. Introduction Muhammad Ali was a commander in the Ottoman army that was sent to drive Napoleon's forces out of Egypt, but upon the French withdrawal, seized power himself and forced the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II to recognize him as Wāli, or Governor of Egypt in 1805. He traced his ancestry back to Ibrahim Aga, from Korca, Albania, who had moved to Kavala. Demonstrating his grander ambitions, he took the title of Khedive; however, this was not sanctioned by the Sublime Porte. Muhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire. He constructed a military state with around four percent of the populace serving the army to raise Egypt to a powerful positioning in the Ottoman Empire in a way showing various similarities to the Soviet strategies (without communism) conducted in the 20th century. Muhammad Ali summed up his vision for Egypt in this way: Portrait of Muhammad Ali Pasha in the Cairo Citadel museum At the height of his power, Muhammad Ali and his son Ibrahim Pasha's military strength did indeed threaten the very existence of the Ottoman Empire as he sought to supplant the Osman Dynasty with his own. Ultimately, the intervention of the Great Powers prevented Egyptian forces from marching on Constantinople, and henceforth, his dynasty's rule would be limited to Africa, and Sinai. Muhammad Ali had conquered Sudan in the first half of his reign and Egyptian control would be consolidated and expanded under his successors, most notably Ibrahim Pasha's son Isma'il I. Khedivate and British occupation Though Muhammad Ali and his descendants used the title of Khedive (Viceroy) in preference to the lesser Wāli, this was not recognized by the Porte until 1867 when Sultan Abdul-Aziz officially sanctioned its use by Isma'il Pasha and his successors. In contrast to his grandfather's policy of war against the Porte, Isma'il sought to strengthen the position of Egypt and Sudan and his dynasty using less confrontational means, and through a mixture of flattery and bribery, Isma'il secured official Ottoman recognition of Egypt and Sudan's virtual independence. This freedom was severely undermined in 1879 when the Sultan colluded with the Great Powers to depose Isma'il in favor of his son Tewfik. Three years later, Egypt and Sudan's freedom became little more than symbolic when the United Kingdom invaded and occupied the country, ostensibly to support Khedive Tewfik against his opponents in Ahmed Orabi's nationalist government. While the Khedive would continue to rule over Egypt and Sudan in name, in reality, ultimate power resided with the British High Commissioner. Khedive Isma'il In defiance of the Egyptians, the British proclaimed Sudan to be an Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, a territory under joint British and Egyptian rule rather than an integral part of Egypt. This was continually rejected by Egyptians, both in government and in the public at large, who insisted on the \\"unity of the Nile Valley\\", and would remain an issue of controversy and enmity between Egypt and Britain until Sudan's independence in 1956. Sultanate and Kingdom In 1914, Khedive Abbas II sided with the Ottoman Empire which had joined the Central Powers in the World War I, and was promptly deposed by the British in favor of his uncle Hussein Kamel. The legal fiction of Ottoman sovereignty over Egypt and Sudan, which had for all intents and purposes ended in 1805, was officially terminated, Hussein Kamel was declared Sultan of Egypt and Sudan, and the country became a British Protectorate. With nationalist sentiment rising, as evidenced by the revolution of 1919, Britain formally recognized Egyptian independence in 1922, and Hussein Kamel's successor, Sultan Fuad I, substituted the title of King for Sultan. However, British occupation and interference in Egyptian and Sudanese affairs persisted. Of particular concern to Egypt was Britain's continual efforts to divest Egypt of all control in Sudan. To both the King and the nationalist movement, this was intolerable, and the Egyptian Government made a point of stressing that Fuad and his son King Farouk I were \\"King of Egypt and Sudan\\". Dissolution The reign of Farouk was characterized by ever increasing nationalist discontent over the British occupation, royal corruption and incompetence, and the disastrous 1948 Arab–Israeli War. All these factors served to terminally undermine Farouk's position and paved the way for the revolution of 1952. Farouk was forced to abdicate in favor of his infant son Ahmed-Fuad who became King Fuad II, while administration of the country passed to the Free Officers Movement under Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser. The infant king's reign lasted less than a year and on June 18, 1953, the revolutionaries abolished the monarchy and declared Egypt a republic, ending a century and a half of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule.

The story revolves around a simulated reality, exactly the same as our own, known as the Loop: created to simulate the emergence and evolution of life. It is in this alternate universe that the events of the previous novels, Ring and Spiral took place. Plot The story revolves around a medical student named Kaoru Futami. His father, Hideyuki, contracts a deadly disease known as Metastatic Human Cancer (MHC), a terminal cancer affects all forms of organic life: humans, animals and plants. Events lead Hideyuki to tell Kaoru more about a research program he was involved in called the LOOP project: a virtual reality simulator which is meant to represent the emergence of life and how the world most likely evolved. It is known that almost everyone who was involved in the LOOP project has died of the same cancer. Kaoru takes a part-time job tutoring a boy named Ryoji, which is an asymptomatic carrier of MHC along with his mother, Reiko. Despite her being fifteen years his senior, Kaoru falls in love with Reiko. Eventually, they begin an affair once Ryoji begins chemotherapy. When he finds out, Ryoji commits suicide by falling backwards out of a twelve-story building. About a month afterwards, Kaoru learns from Reiko that she may be pregnant with Kaoru's child. He also reads Ryoji's suicide note, in which he explains his motivation for taking his own life. As Kaoru continues his investigation into the LOOP project, his father asks him to meet a microbiologist named Amano, was involved in the final stages of LOOP before it was scrapped. Amano reveals that LOOP utilized a hundred supercomputers strung together with the aim to recreate life, and tells Kaoru of a scientist in New Mexico who might still be alive. During this period he also finds out that the MHC cells all equal 2n X 3. Kaoru's mother, Machiko, convinces him to go to New Mexico after relating a tale of the \\"Ancient One\\" who has a thousand eyes watching. Kaoru then ventures to New Mexico, only to find the scientist dead. However, inside the scientist's lab, the computer turns itself on and tells Kaoru to put on a pair of virtual reality goggles and gloves, which brings him into the LOOP simulation. Kaoru experiences a Native American's life who has a wife and two children and is brutally murdered by whites. Coming out of the simulation, Kaoru calls Amano and asks for the coordinates of the events that are crucial to the LOOP evolution: the lives of Asakawa, Takayama and Yamamura. Amano pinpoints the exact coordinates of the events that take place. He also explains how Kaoru can either merge consciousness with people in LOOP or that he watch from afar like a ghost. He then finds out, in complete detail, events from the previous novels navigating from different angles. First he looks at things from Ryuji's eyes, then Asakawa, finally settling on a character named Ando who finds out the truth about Sadako. Soon after that, he has another discussion with Amano, who knows that the LOOP's creator had intentions to recreate Ryuji's death. By doing so, he could create a clone and insert him into a woman's womb. But what they forgot is that Ryuji's clone would carry the Ring Virus with his genes. Therefore, when Ryuji was reborn, the virus escaped and mutated into the MHC virus. Desperate to find the cure for the MHC virus, Kaoru ventures deeper west into the desert only to encounter a storm that leaves him on the verge of death. He is then saved by an old man named Eliot who has purposefully crafted all the events to bring Kaoru to him. After essentially resurrecting Kaoru, the man explains what has happened, and that, Kaoru is Ryuji's clone. As a result, Kaoru has an exceptional gift of immunity to the MHC virus. In order to stop the virus from destroying the real world, Kaoru is essentially sent back to the LOOP world as the one who solves (and eventually stops) the Ring virus. One of the main problems is that he cannot come back to the real world to see his father (still in the hospital) or Reiko ever again. However, in order to save them, he agrees. Upon accepting, the old man transfers Kaoru's analyzed molecules into the LOOP where he promises that Reiko can see him. In the LOOP, Kaoru solves the problem with the help of Ando. He watches Ando's resurrected son play in the water. Once Ando leaves, Kaoru looks up at the stars wondering about Reiko.

He prepared the first insulin treatment given to a child with diabetes in the USA in October 1922.Michael Somogyi (www.whonamedit.com) Somogyi later showed that excessive insulin makes diabetes unstable in the Chronic Somogyi rebound to which he gave his name. Career Michael Somogyi was born on March 7, 1883 in the village of Zsámánd in Hungary, (today Reinersdorf, part of Heiligenbrunn, Austria). He graduated in chemical engineering from the University of Budapest in 1905.Finding Aid to Photographs from the Dr. Michael Somogyi Collection, 1912-1971 (bulk 1950s) at the Science History Institute (For full finding aid, click on 'Dr. Michael Somogyi Collection Finding Aid'.) After an additional year as an assistant in biochemistry, Somogyi went to the United States, where he eventually found a position as an assistant in biochemistry at Cornell University (1906–1908). He returned to Budapest where he worked at the Municipal Laboratory for the next decade. In 1914, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Budapest, submitting a dissertation on catalytic hydrogenation. During World War I he was in charge of providing food to the destitute. Somogyi was invited to return to the United States by Philip A. Shaffer, whom he had known at Cornell. In 1922 Somogyi became an instructor in biochemistry at Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, Missouri. There Somogyi worked with Shaffer and Edward Adelbert Doisy on insulin preparation and insulin's use in the treatment of diabetes. In 1926, Somogyi became the first biochemist on the staff of the new Jewish Hospital of St. Louis where he worked closely with physicians. He directed the hospital's clinical laboratory until he retired in 1957. Research Insulin was discovered in 1921, by Frederick G. Banting, Charles Herbert Best and John James Rickard Macleod at the University of Toronto. At a time when most child diabetics lived no more than months or a few years, insulin offered the hope of extending lives. Somogyi worked with Philip A. Shaffer and Edward Adelbert Doisy on insulin preparation and insulin's use in the treatment of diabetes. He developed a method for extracting insulin from the pancreases of dogs. In 1922 doctors treated the first diabetic American child, a baby boy, with Somogyi’s insulin. Somogyi also developed a quicker, less expensive method for screening for diabetes, using sodium carbonate, urine, and heat. This led to the development of popular tests, including several varieties of urine sugar comparator from the Aloe Company of Saint Louis, Missouri. Urine Sugar Test kits were also produced by Eli Lilly & Company.

(As of 2011-05-28, the electronic text is not open access). The Chronic Somogyi rebound, a form of post-hypoglycemic hyperglycemia that Somogyi theorized could occur as a defensive mechanism, is named for him. It can be confused with the Dawn phenomenon and whether or not Somogyi's theory is actuallly correct is still contested. In 1949, Somogyi argued against the use of high doses of insulin on the grounds that it was a potentially dangerous form of treatment. He also argued that many diabetic patients could successfully manage their conditions through a combination of diet and weight loss. In 1969, Michael Somogyi suffered a stroke. He died on 21 July 1971.

He was the founder and director of the Academy of the Arabic Language in Damascus (1918) till his death. Early life Muhammad Kurd 'Ali's grandfather was a Kurd born in Sulaymaniyah in northern Iraq and came to Damascus in the early nineteenth century. His mother was Circassian. Kurd 'Ali learned to read and write in the kuttab where he also studied the Koran. He received his preparatory education at Al-Rushdiyya school, and then completed his secondary education at the Azariyya School. In secondary school he recalled that on the first day he was asked what neighborhood he was from, as the custom was to call students by their first name and the name of their neighborhood as last name. Hailing as he did from Zuqaq Burghul (Bulgur Alley), by this logic he would have for the rest of his schooling been linked to dried cracked wheat. Thus he lied, and told his teacher that he hailed from the neighborhood of Tadil, which he was familiar with since that is where his father had lived as a boy. Muhammad Kurd 'Ali loved writing and journalism and developed an early interest in reading books and collecting them since childhood. Although illiterate himself, his father encouraged him to acquire books, and gave him sufficient assistance to possess them. As Kurd 'Ali developed more skill in science and language, he started to read newspapers and magazines in French, Turkish and Arabic. At the age of sixteen, he was writing news articles and was paid by newspapers. His vocation did not stop at this point, he loved Arabic poetry and rhyme rhetoric; and he kept close company with well-known local senior scholars at the time, drawing on their knowledge and literature, such as: Saleem Bukhari, Sheikh Mohammed Al Mubarak, and Sheikh Taher Algaza’ri. Career in writing In 1897, he was entrusted with editing the government weekly newspaper (Sham); he kept this job for three years and was committed in his articles to assonance. Then Kurd 'Ali started corresponding with Al-Muqtataf (excerpt) magazine in Egypt for five years through which his fame spread into Egypt. Kurd 'Ali afterwards left for Cairo and remained there for ten months during which he worked as the editor of Al-Ra’ed Almasri (the Egyptian pioneer) newspaper. While there, he was introduced to many scientists, literary men and thinkers, which further broadened his horizon and increased his fame so much so that his name in Egypt became no less known than the most famous writers and the very best scholars of that time. He returned to Damascus only to find himself a victim of a slander that lead to orders by the Turk ruler to have Kurd 'Ali's house searched, but he was later found innocent. Following this incident, Kurd 'Ali emigrated to Egypt in 1906 and established the monthly Al-Muqtabas (quoted) magazine where he published scientific, literary and historical research; he also edited another two daily newspapers: Al-zaher and Al-Mu’ayyad. Citing from Western magazines, he used to report the latest news on science, civilization, invention and development; in addition to that, he translated a number of rare manuscripts. His work, therefore, was dedicated to the spreading of knowledge, both old and new. Kurd Ali was also noted for writing anti-Shia polemics. In Politics Muhammad Kurd 'Ali returned to Damascus in 1908 after the pronouncement of the Ottoman Constitution, and published the Al-Muqtabas magazine in addition to another daily newspaper he called Al-Muqtabas in collaboration with his brother Ahmed; he also founded its own press. But, under the Ottoman rule, he was subject to continuous harassment and restriction in the form of censorship and close monitoring of his writing and thinking; and as an example of that his newspaper was closed after one of the Turk rulers accused him of discussing the Sultan's family in one of his articles. Kurd 'Ali again fled to Egypt and then to Europe, but he returned later after he had been exonerated. These forms of harassment continued to haunt him until Kurd 'Ali finally handed the responsibility for the daily newspaper to his brother Ahmed and dedicated himself to the magazine. He became increasingly more apprehensive after the declaration of the First World War and the start of a revenge campaign by the Ottoman rulers against the ‘free Arabs’, who sought more political freedoms; so he closed the magazine and the newspaper. During this campaign Kurd 'Ali himself was almost driven to the gallows like many other freedom advocates and critics of the Ottoman regime; he was, however, spared thanks to a document found in the French consulate in Damascus written by a worker in the French Foreign Ministry before the war. According to the document, the French agent had approached Kurd 'Ali and, exploiting his dislike to the pro-Ottomans, he induced him to take a more positive approach towards the pro-French policy in the Middle East; but Kurd 'Ali's response was rather negative and he urged the French to alter their policy in Algeria and Tunisia. Similar documents like this included the 'official publication of confidentiality' that had been sent by the French ambassador in Istanbul to French consuls in Syria warning them from Kurd 'Ali and stating that: 'he only works with the Turks'. This came as a favourable evidence together with other papers of this kind found during the inspection of foreign consulates early in the war. Following this, Djemal Pasha summoned Kurd 'Ali and jubilantly informed him of this news but also warned him that should Kurd 'Ali turn to opposition again, Djamal Pasha threatened to kill him with his own pistol. He then ordered the newspaper to open again and gave Kurd 'Ali financial assistance; he then appointed him editor of Al-Sharq (the East) newspaper which was issued by the army. After entering the Faisali Covenant and the independence of Syria from the Ottoman Empire, Kurd 'Ali found the opportunity to fulfill the dream that he had had for long: the establishment of an Arab Academy in Damascus in a similar manner like in other civilized nations with the aim of saving the Arabic heritage and protecting and developing the Arabic language as a vehicle for disseminating literature and sciences. So, he presented the idea to the military ruler then Rida Pasha al-Rikabi, who agreed to convert the Court of knowledge into an Academy of the Arabic Language in Damascus. This was achieved in the eighth of June 1919, and Muhammad Kurd 'Ali was appointed president of the Assembly and continued to be so until his death. Heritage Kurd 'Ali cherished the Academy more than anything and looked at it as the one gift of his whole life and the fruit of all his strife so much so that he would not absent himself from any of the Academy's meetings. Mohammad Kurd 'Ali was a pioneer in journalism, and an authority on investigative journalism; he made a name for himself in writing and authorship and was one of the leading scholars in the Arab world. He is accredited as the first to establish high-quality newspaper and magazine in Damascus, and the first to establish an Arab Science Assembly in the Arab world. The style of his writing has been described as ‘easy but impossible’. It is characterised with bland expression and verbal eloquence; and it uses words loaded with semantic power, and sentences varying in length. His style is said to move away from affectation and aims to focus on the meaning, avoiding undue emphasis on the structure. In much of what he had written, Kurd 'Ali is sometimes argued to follow the same course of the writing as that of Ibn Khaldoun in his Introduction. Muhammad Kurd 'Ali assumed several jobs and positions in the press, in the university, in the Ministry, in the Arab Science Assembly in Damascus, and in the language Council in Egypt. He assumed the Ministry of Education twice in the era of the French occupation. He fills a prestigious literary and scientific place among his peers of other influential Arab scholars. His writings reached the number of twenty-two authorships including: *Khitat al sham (Description of Syria) six volumes, one of his most important works. *Al Islam wa al hadara al arabiya (Islam and Arab civilization) two volumes. *Tareekh al hadara (History of civilization) are two parts, translated from French. *Ghara'eb al gharb (Oddities of the West) two volumes. *Akwalana wa af'alana (Our words and deeds) two volumes. *Dimashq, madinat al sihr wa al shi'r (Damascus, city of charm and poetry). *Ghaber al andalus wa hadoroha (The Past of Andalusia and its Present). *Omara 'o al biaan (Princes of Eloquency) are two parts. *Al kadeem wa al hadeeth (The Old and the New), which is a selection of his articles. *Konoz al ajdad (Ancestors' Treasures). *Al idara al islamiya fi iz al arab (The Islamic Administration under Arabs). *Ghotat Dimashq (The Oasis of Damascus) *Almozakart (The Diaries) four parts. Muhammad Kurd 'Ali died On Thursday of April 2, 1953 in Damascus, and was buried beside the tomb of Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan in Damascus.

A 00 (typically read \\"Double O\\" and denoted in Fleming's novels by the letters \\"OO\\" rather than the digits \\"00\\") is a field agent that holds a licence to kill in the field, at his or her discretion, to complete any mission. The novel Moonraker establishes that the section routinely has three agents concurrently; the film series, beginning with Thunderball, establishes the number of 00 agents at a minimum of 9. Inspiration The origins of the Double O title may date to Fleming's wartime service. According to World War Two historian Damien Lewis in his book Churchill's Secret Warriors, agents of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) were given a \\"0\\" prefix when they became \\"zero-rated\\" upon completion of training in how to kill. As part of his role as assistant to the head of naval intelligence, Rear Admiral John Godfrey (himself the inspiration for M), Fleming acted as liaison to the SOE. Description In the first novel, Casino Royale, and the 2006 film adaptation, the 00 concept is introduced and, in Bond's words, means \\"that you've had to kill a chap in cold blood in the course of some assignment.\\" Bond's 00 number (007) was awarded to him because he twice killed in fulfilling assignments. (This differentiates from deadly force used by non-00 agents in the course of self-defence or offensive action; plus, in the original time frame of the novel—the early 1950s—many MI6 agents would have had recent war service.) In the second novel, Live and Let Die, the 00 number designates a past killing; not until the third novel, Moonraker, does the 00 number designate a licence to kill. Thereafter, the novels are ambiguous about whether a 00 agent's licence to kill is limited, with varying accounts in Dr. No, Goldfinger, and The Man with the Golden Gun. Per Fleming's Moonraker, 00 agents face mandatory retirement at 45; John Gardner contradicts this in his novels, depicting a fifty-odd-year-old secret agent. Sebastian Faulks's Devil May Care features M giving Bond a choice of when to retire. Fleming himself only mentions five 00 agents in all. According to Moonraker, James Bond is the most senior of three 00 agents; the two others were 008 and 0011. The three men share an office and a secretary named Loelia Ponsonby. Later novels feature two more 00 agents; 009 is mentioned in Thunderball and 006 is mentioned in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Other authors have elaborated and expanded upon the 00 agents. While they presumably have been sent on dangerous missions as Bond has, little has been revealed about most of them. Several have been named, both by Fleming and other authors, along with passing references to their service records, which suggest that agents are largely recruited (as Bond was) from the British military's special forces. In the films, the 00 section is a discrete area of MI6, whose agents report directly to M, and tend to be sent on special assignments and troubleshooting missions, often involving rogue agents (from Britain or other countries) or situations where an \\"ordinary\\" intelligence operation uncovers or reveals terrorist or criminal activity too sensitive to be dealt with using ordinary procedural or legal measures, and where the aforementioned discretionary \\"licence to kill\\" is deemed necessary or useful in rectifying the situation. The World Is Not Enough introduces a special insignia for the 00 Section. Bond's fellow 00 agents appear receiving briefings in Thunderball and The World Is Not Enough. The latter film shows a woman in one of the 00 chairs. In Thunderball, there are nine chairs for the 00 agents; Moneypenny says every 00 agent in Europe has been recalled, not every 00 agent in the world. Behind the scenes photos of the film reveal that one of the agents in the chairs is female as well. As with the books, other writers have elaborated and expanded upon the 00 agents in the films and in other media. In GoldenEye, 006 is an alias for Alec Trevelyan; as of 2019, Trevelyan is the only 00 agent other than Bond to play a major role in an EON Productions film, with all other appearances either being brief or dialogue references only. List of 00s The following lists are of the known 00 agents of the British Secret Service who exist in the Ian Fleming novels & short stories, the officially licensed novels, the EON movies, or in the official video games or comic strips. 00 Agents from Ian Fleming's Bond stories {  ! style=\\"white- space:nowrap;\\" 00-agent ! style=\\"width:15%;\\" Name ! Description -  006  Unnamed  006, a Royal Marine commando, is mentioned in the novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service. -  007 James Bond  James Bond is the only agent 007. In the novel You Only Live Twice, Bond was transferred into another branch and given the number 7777, suggesting there was no active agent 007 in that time; he is later reinstated as 007 in the novel The Man with the Golden Gun. -  008  Bill  In the novel Moonraker, 008 (called \\"Bill\\" by Bond) is mentioned as being on recuperative leave after returning from a mission behind the Iron Curtain. In the novel Goldfinger, Bond thinks to himself that 008 would likely avenge Bond by killing Goldfinger. As Bond thinks this, he ruminates that 008 is \\"a good man, more careful than Bond.\\" - 009  Unnamed  Referred to in the novel Thunderball. Referred to in the movies Octopussy, The World Is Not Enough and Spectre. -  0011  Unnamed  Mentioned in the novel Moonraker as vanishing while on assignment in Singapore. } 00 Agents from Bond stories by other authors {  ! style=\\"white- space:nowrap;\\" 00-agent ! style=\\"width:15%;\\" Name ! Description -  001  Edward Donne  Referred to in the Raymond Benson novel Doubleshot, Edward Donne is the only known agent 001. -  004  Frederick Wardner, Scarlett Papava  A 004 appears in the Benson novel The Facts of Death. In the Sebastian Faulks novel Devil May Care, Bond girl Scarlett Papava is unveiled as 004, replacing the previous agent who was killed in Berlin. -  005  Stuart Thomas  Was 005 until defective eyesight impaired his marksmanship, and he was made head of Station G (Greece) in the Kingsley Amis novel Colonel Sun. -  006  Major Jack Giddings  In The Moneypenny Diaries: Guardian Angel, 006 is named as Major Jack Giddings and second to Bond in the 00 section. -  007 James Bond  As above. In the John Gardner novels, agent 007 is the remaining active 00-agent as the section was disbanded in the 1980s. This was later contradicted in the Raymond Benson novels. In Anthony Horowitz's continuation novel, set before the events of Casino Royale, an unnamed agent 007 is murdered, which leads to James Bond taking over the code- number in Forever and A Day, thus marking his first ever assignment as a 00-agent. - 0010  Unnamed  Referred to in the Benson novel The Man with the Red Tattoo. -  0012  Sam Johnston  Although unmentioned on screen, Benson's The World Is Not Enough novelisation has Bond investigating 0012's death at story's start (seen in a photograph of a dark-haired man, in the film). } 00 Agents from the Eon film franchise {  ! style=\\"white-space:nowrap;\\" 00-agent ! style=\\"width:15%;\\" Name ! Description -  002  Bill Fairbanks, John  A 002 first appears in Thunderball. He is shot through the neck and killed by Francisco Scaramanga, in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1969 (film version: The Man with the Golden Gun 1974). In The Living Daylights film, another Agent 002, named \\"John\\", played by Glyn Baker; was training at Gibraltar, with 004 and 007. 002 was \\"killed\\" and eliminated from the exercise when he landed close to a waiting SAS guard. -  003  Unnamed  003 first appears in Thunderball. Either he or another 003 is found dead, in Siberia, in A View to a Kill. -  004  Unnamed 004 first appears in Thunderball, where he is played by Frederick Warder. In The Living Daylights, either he or another 004 accompanied 002 and 007 to Gibraltar; he is murdered by a false KGB agent who tags the body with \\"Death to Spies\\" in Russian after his support rope is cut and he is sent plummeting down a cliff to his death. -  005 Unnamed 005 appears in Thunderball. -  006  Alec Trevelyan  A 006 first appears in Thunderball, where he is portrayed by Peter Roy. When 006 was used again thirty years later in GoldenEye it was not mentioned whether this was meant to be the same character or a replacement. In GoldenEye 006 was named Alec Trevelyan, the main antagonist in the film, and portrayed by Sean Bean. In a mission at Arkhangelsk, he was apparently shot and killed, but later reveals that he faked his death. He heads the Janus crime syndicate which plans to steal the GoldenEye satellite from the Russian Federation, intending to use it to cripple Britain due to a financial meltdown. His motivation for these plans was a personal one: avenging his family, who were all Lienz Cossacks, betrayed to the Communists by the British government after World War II had ended. He also begrudged Bond's not allowing him time to escape the Soviet chemical weapons factory they were sent to destroy at the beginning of the film. Trevelyan is killed after Bond drops him from the antenna above the satellite dish, and the subsequent destruction of the facility. The GoldenEye novelisation was written by John Gardner. -  007 James Bond  See above. -  008  Unnamed  In Goldfinger M threatens to replace 007 with agent 008. Later in the film, Bond tells Auric Goldfinger, \\"...if I fail to report, 008 replaces me.\\", and Goldfinger replies, \\"I'm sure he'll be more successful.\\" In The Living Daylights, M again threatens to replace 007 saying \\"I'll recall 008 from Hong Kong\\". In the movies, 008 is the only agent (other than Bond) that is not always killed doing his job. - 009  Unnamed  009 first appears in Thunderball. Either he or another 009 (dressed as a clown) was killed by Mischka and Grischka after the opening credits in Octopussy by throwing a knife into his back as he tries to escape them. In The World Is Not Enough, M assigned another 009 to kill Renard; despite putting a bullet in his head, Renard lives, with the bullet slowly killing off his senses. In Spectre, Q laments that a new Aston Martin originally intended to be used by 007 has been reassigned to 009 following Bond's destruction of several buildings in Mexico City. A switch inside the car labelled \\"Atmosphere\\" is later revealed to begin playing 009's personal choices in music. -  0012  Sam Johnston  Although unmentioned on screen, Benson's The World Is Not Enough novelisation has Bond investigating 0012's death at story's start (seen in a photograph of a dark-haired man, in the film). -  Unknown  Nomi  Appears in No Time to Die, who has been a veteran 00-agent for two years by the time the events of the film take place. -  Unknown  Unidentified  Two films, Thunderball and The World Is Not Enough, have scenes in which Bond joins groups of other 00 agents for briefings. In Thunderball, only fleeting glimpses of these individuals are provided. In The World Is Not Enough several are visible as they receive instructions from M and her assistant, Bill Tanner, including one female 00 agent. } 00 Agents from computer and video games {  ! style=\\"white-space:nowrap;\\" 00-agent ! style=\\"width:15%;\\" Name ! Description -  003  Jack Mason  In the Everything or Nothing video game (2004), 003 is Jack Mason, who is shot in the gut and killed by Nikolai Diavolo, a villain connected with the villain Max Zorin from A View to a Kill. -  004  Aidan Flemmings In the GoldenEye video game, on the Silo mission briefing, Q mentions to 007 to \\"remember to treat the timed explosives with respect – you remember what happened to 004 in Beirut\\"; it is unclear whether he speaks of another agent or one of the ones in the EON films. -  007 James Bond  See above. -  008  Bill Timothy  In the video game James Bond 007, 008 gives Bond an exploding pen before dying. -  Unknown  Jonathan \\"GoldenEye\\" Hunter  A former 00-agent featured in GoldenEye: Rogue Agent. He was shot in the right eye, and was dismissed by MI6 for \\"reckless brutality\\". He joined up with Auric Goldfinger against the shooter, Dr. Julius No, and eventually received a gold-hued artificial eye as a replacement, which granted him several hidden abilities. After killing both Goldfinger and Dr. No, he becomes Ernst Stavro Blofeld's personal bodyguard. The game takes place in an alternate universe. } 00 Agents from other official media {  ! style=\\"white-space:nowrap;\\" 00-agent ! style=\\"width:15%;\\" Name ! Description -  007 James Bond  See above. -  008  Bill Timothy  008 is mentioned to have been murdered in the comic book VARGR for which 007 himself avenges the death of his colleague by taking the life of the latter's killer. - 009  Peter Smith  The graphic novels Deadly Double and Serpent's Tooth feature a fourth Agent 009. In early 2016, there were rumours about a 13-part Netflix series starring Mehzeb Chowdhury as 009 agent Cyrus Varten. This was revealed to be a social experiment conducted by Mehzeb himself to gauge the audiences' reaction towards an extended Bond universe. -  0013  Briony Thorne  A female 00-agent appearing in the comic strip Fear Face (published 18 January 1971 to 20 April 1971 in The Daily Express). Thorne is revealed to be a double agent for China. -  Unknown  Agent York  Killed in the comic strip River of Death (published 24 June 1969 to 29 November 1969 in The Daily Express). Agent York is a 00 agent but his number is not revealed. -  Unknown  Suzi Kew  A recurring character in the Daily Express comic strip series of the 1960s and 1970s, Suzi Kew is a 00 agent but her number is not revealed. } False 00 Agents from Casino Royale (1967) The 1967 film adaptation of Fleming's first novel, Casino Royale, spoofed the EON film series. As part of its storyline, Sir James Bond (David Niven), after having assumed the position of M, mandates that all MI6 agents - male and female - be renamed James Bond 007 in order to confuse enemy agents of SMERSH. {  ! style=\\"white-space:nowrap;\\" 00-agent ! style=\\"width:15%;\\" Name ! Description -  007 Evelyn Tremble  Baccarat master. Portrayed by Peter Sellers. -  007 Vesper Lynd  Bond's former lover. Portrayed by Ursula Andress. -  007 Miss Moneypenny  Daughter of Bond's retired secretary, with the same name as her mother. Portrayed by Barbara Bouchet. -  007 Mata Bond  Illegitimate daughter of Bond and Mata Hari. Portrayed by Joanna Pettet. -  007 The Detainer  A female agent who ultimately is the one to defeat the villain, Dr. Noah. Real name unrevealed. Portrayed by Daliah Lavi. -  007 Cooper  An agent who closely resembles the stereotypical image of Bond. Portrayed by Terence Cooper. -  007 Jimmy Bond  Nephew of Sir James Bond who, tired of being looked down upon (due to his short stature and meek demeanour), creates the persona of Dr. Noah, head of the evil organization SMERSH. As his duplicity is not known until late in the film, he technically falls under his uncle's naming edict. Portrayed by Woody Allen. -  007 \\"James Bond\\"  Prior to renaming all MI6 agents, Sir James mentions that the agency had given \\"my name and number\\" to another individual. Two dialogue references are made to this Bond: one has McTerry (M) expressing concern that he may be targeted by assassins; later in the film, it is said that he has left the service and entered the world of television. } See also *List of James Bond parodies and spin-offs References Category:James Bond characters Category:Fictional British secret agents Category:Fictional intelligence agencies ","title":"00 Agent"},{"id":"10954361","text":"Politics Lost: How American Democracy Was Trivialized By People Who Think You're Stupid, reprinted in 2007 as Politics Lost: From RFK to W: How Politicians Have Become Less Courageous and More Interested in Keeping Power than in Doing What's Right for America, is a 2006 book by journalist Joe Klein on the loss of spontaneity and authenticity in American politics.

It organizes periodic scientific meetings and is overseeing the completion and implementation of the PhyloCode. In the second meeting, rules concerning the choice of name for crown clades were discussed, along with rules to clarify the use of binomial species names in the context of phylogenetic nomenclature and to enhance the information content of these names (regarding the monophyly or paraphyly of the genus name, considered a prenomen, in the context of the PhyloCode). It was also decided then to expand the CPN (Committee on Phylogenetic Nomenclature) from nine to twelve members. The third meeting convened at Dalhousie University in Halifax, from July 20 to 22. The editors of the Companion Volume presented a progress report, and a demonstration of the RegNum on-line registration database was given.

It was intended to equip the clandestine air force that Germany was assembling at Lipetsk. The layout owed something to designer Walter Rethel's time with Fokker. Of conventional configuration, the SD I featured a welded steel tube frame, metal-covered ahead of the cockpit, and fabric-covered aft of it. The wooden sesquiplane wings were braced with N-type interplane struts, without any wires - a typical Fokker feature. In flight, performance and handling proved disappointing at anything but very low speeds. Questions also arose as to the structural soundness of the design, and development was terminated very soon thereafter. Specifications References * * World Aircraft Information Files.

There it would observe 80% of the sky for the Cosmic microwave background radiation in the frequency range from 20–100 GHz. Apart from detecting large scale CMB polarization it will also provide maps of Galactic synchrotron emission at lowest frequencies. The project was headed by Stefano Cortiglioni of the IASF-CNR in Bologna and completely funded by the Italian Space Agency. Due to the project's reliance on the Space Shuttle, and the setback of the Columbia disaster, timely launch was unlikely.

Symptoms Cholinergic urticaria typically presents with a number of small, short-lasting hives but may also involve cutaneous inflammation (wheals) and pain which develops usually in response to exercise, bathing, staying in a heated environment, or emotional stress. Although the symptoms subside rapidly, commonly within 1 hour, Cholinergic urticaria may significantly impair quality of life, especially in relation to sporting activities. Causes * Sweat hypersensitivity * Acquired anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis * Idiopathic * Opioid use *Cholinesterase inhibitors Subtypes Sweat hypersensitivity This subtype of CU refers to those who are hypersensitive to their own sweat. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by injecting autologous (the person's own) sweat into the skin. Features The hives are observed to coincide with perspiration points of sweating. Pathophysiology Tanaka et al. found that the sweat hyper-sensitivities of CU and atopic dermatitis seem to be virtually the same, and therefore, the sweat-induced histamine release from basophils may also be mediated by a specific IgE for sweat in atopic dermatitis as well as CU. Treatment * Proposed first-line treatment: Rapid desensitization protocol using autologous sweat. * Non-pharmacological treatment: Forced perspiration by excessive body warming (hot bath or exercise) used daily may reduce the symptoms through exhaustion of inflammatory mediators. This non-pharmacological treatment is contraindicated in those with CU as a result of hypohidrosis (see below). * Antihistamines are a commonly prescribed first-line treatment for conventional urticaria, but its effectiveness in the treatment of CU is rather limited in most cases. Some research suggests that first-generation antihistamines with anticholinergic properties such as diphenhydramine are most successful at treating CU. * Treatment(s) with mixed success: omalizumab (anti-IgE therapy), danazol (synthetic androgen), propranolol (beta blocker), zileuton (antileukotriene). Acquired anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis This subtype of CU refers to those who have abnormally reduced sweating. Diagnosis Sweat is readily visualized by a topical indicator such as iodinated starch or sodium alizarin sulphonate. Both undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat. A thermoregulatory sweat test evaluates the body's response to a thermal stimulus by inducing sweating through the use of a hot box ⁄ room, thermal blanket or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing can indicate anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis (see Minor test). A skin biopsy may reveal cellular infiltrates in sweat glands or ducts. Features Severe heat intolerance (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and headache), and tingling, pricking, pinchy or burning pain over the entire body on exposure to hot environments or prolonged exercise which improve after cooling the body. Occurs in the absence of any causative skin, metabolic, or neurological disorders. Diagram visualizing the overflow of acetylcholine to adjacent mast cells. Pathophysiology The wheals, hypohidrosis, and pain seems to result from the low expression levels of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 3 (CHRM3) in the eccrine gland epithelial cells. Elevated expression levels of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES and CCL17/TARC which result in chemoattracted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations to the surrounding area may be responsible for exerting a downmodulatory effect on the AchE and CHRM3 expressions. Corticosteroid inhibits the expressions of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES and CCL17/TARC. This further support the notion that CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES and CCL17/TARC play a crucial role. Treatment * First-line treatment: H1RAs are first-line therapy for patients with CholU, but many patients show only a mild to moderate response to standard H1RA doses. The addition of an H2RA was reported to be effective in patients with refractory CholU that was unresponsive to up-dosing of an H1RA. Other studies have demonstrated the efficacy of scopolamine butylbromide (an anticholinergic agent); combinations of propranolol (a b2-adrenergic blocker), antihistamines, and montelukast; and treatment and injection with botulinum toxin. doi=10.1007/s10286-017-0418-6 * Non-pharmacological treatment: In the absence of sweat, cold-water sprays and wet towels can be used to increase the evaporative loss of heat from the skin. Shifting to a cooler or air- conditioned environments when necessary can also reduce discomfort. In the event of severe hyperthermia (body temperature >106 °F/41 °C), drastic measures such as immersion in ice-cold water are necessary to prevent irreversible brain damage. Idiopathic Unknown or unclassified at this time. This represents those who do not fall under any of the above categories. Prevalence Though overall research is limited, various studies indicate that CU is relatively common across populations with prevalence rates reportedly ranging from 5% to 20% (depending on locale, race, and age). The condition is more common in young adults, and prevalence appears to peak in adults aged 26–28 (up to 20%). The vast majority of cases are reported to be mild, and proportionally few individuals seek medical attention regarding the condition. History Cholinergic urticaria was first described by DukeD in 1924 as \\"urticaria calorica\\". The term cholinergic is derived from the finding that hives similar to those of CU can be evoked using cholinergic agonists (e.g. methacholine).

It is classified under the isomerase, racemase, epimerase, and enzyme acting on hydroxyl acids and derivatives classes of enzymes. It is found in certain halophilic archaea, such as Haloarcula marismortui, and in a few species of bacteria, such as several Lactobacillus species (which produce D- and L-lactate) including Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus, and Lactobacillus plantarum, as well as in non-lactic acid bacteria such as Clostridium beijerinckii. The gene encoding lactate racemase in _L. plantarum_ was identified as _larA_ and shown to be associated with a widespread maturation system involving _larB_ , _larC1_ , _larC2_ , and _larE_. The optimal pH for its activity is 5.8-6.2 in L. sakei. Structure and properties The molecular weight of lactate racemase differs in the various organisms in which it has been found, ranging from 25,000 to 82,400 g/mol. The structure of the enzyme from _L. plantarum_ was solved by Jian Hu and Robert P. Hausinger of Michigan State University and co-workers there and elsewhere. The protein contains a previously unknown covalently-linked nickel- pincer nucleotide (NPN) cofactor (pyridinium 3-thioamide-5-thiocarboxylic acid mononucleotide), where the nickel atom is bound to C4 of the pyridinium ring and two sulfur atoms. This cofactor participates in a proton-coupled hydride- transfer mechanism. There have been a number of recent studies on NPN cofactor synthesis by the LarB, LarE, and LarC proteins. LarB is a carboxylase/hydrolase of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), providing pyridinium-3,5-dicarboxylic acid mononucleotide and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). LarE is an ATP-dependent sulfur transferase that converts the two substrate carboxyl groups into thioacids by sacrificing the sulfur atoms of a cysteine residue in the protein. Finally, LarC inserts nickel into the organic ligand by a CTP-dependent process to complete synthesis of the NPN cofactor. Enzyme activity In many of the species containing lactate racemase, the physiological role of the enzyme is to convert substrate D-lactate into L-lactate. In other species, such as _L. plantarum_ , the cellular role is to transform L-lactate into D-lactate for incorporation into the cell wall. The in vitro reaction catalyzed by the enzyme reaches equilibrium at the point where approximately equimolar concentrations of the D- and L-isomers exist. L. plantarum initially produces L-lactate, which induces the activity of lactate racemase. By contrast, D-lactate represses lactate racemase activity in this species. Therefore, Lar activity appears to be regulated by the ratio of L-lactate/D-lactate. L. plantarum LarA represents a new type of nickel- dependent enzyme, due to its novel nickel-pincer ligand ligand cofactor. Importance Two pathways appear to exist in L. plantarum for transforming pyruvate into D-lactate. One of them involves the NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenase that directly produces D-lactate (LdhD), and the other is through the sequential activities of an L-specific lactate dehydrogenase followed by lactate racemase. If the LdhD enzyme is inactivated or inhibited, lactate racemase provides the bacterium with a rescue pathway for the production of D-lactate. This pathway is significant because the production of D-lactate in L. plantarum is linked to the biosynthesis of the cell wall. Mutants lacking LdhD activity that also had the lar operon deleted only produced L-lactate, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis was not able to occur.

He was drafted by the 49ers in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football at Central Michigan. High school career While attending Rockford High School (Rockford, Michigan), Staley earned two letters in football and two in track. He was named Grand Rapids Press Dream Team member. During his high school career, he caught 24 passes for 559 yards, and earned seven touchdowns as a prep senior. Staley was ranked No. 13 overall prospect by the Detroit Free Press and No. 49 by the Detroit News. Staley was also a standout track and field athlete for the Rockford High School track team. During this time he set three school records. In the 200-meter dash, he set a record with a time of 21.9 seconds. In the 4 × 100 metres relay, he placed with a time of 42.56 seconds, and in the 4 × 200m relay, he finished with a time of 1:27.86 minutes. He also placed sixth in state in the 200 meters to earn all-state honors. The team was fourth in the 4 × 100m, fourth in 4 × 200m and sixth in 4 × 400m. His time of 21.9 seconds in the 200 meters ranks as the fastest among offensive linemen ever in the NFL. College career Staley received an athletic scholarship to attend Central Michigan University, where he played for the Central Michigan Chippewas football team from 2004 to 2007. Staley began his career as a tight end. He added 80 pounds to his 6' 5\\" frame without sacrificing footspeed. He played in 11 games as a true freshman, catching 11 passes for 130 yards and one touchdown and posted a career-high two catches for 34 yards and a touchdown against Eastern Michigan University. Due to his size, Staley was moved to the offensive line during his sophomore season. He started all 11 games at right tackle. He started all 11 games at left tackle and did not allow a single sack. He recorded 53 knockdown blocks and was part of an offensive line that helped CMU average 418.8 yards of offense per game. He also blocked for CMU's single-season total yardage record holder, Kent Smith. Staley helped pave the way for true freshman Ontario Sneed to run for 1,065 yards and earn Freshman All-America honors. Staley was invited to play in the 2007 East–West Shrine Game and he was named a preseason All-MAC First Team selection by Athlon Sports and MAC Report Online. Staley was a dominant player at left tackle. Known for his size, Staley's speed was a rare exception. He ran a 4.70 seconds in the 40-yard dash at CMU's junior pro day. Staley was part of an offensive front that helped CMU boast a 1,000-yard rusher in three consecutive seasons. He was a key part of an offensive line that allowed Kent Smith to pass for at least 2,000 yards in 2004 and 2005. Staley played alongside former Cincinnati Bengals lineman Adam Kieft, who was also his high school teammate at Rockford High School. Professional career Staley with Brit Miller at 49ers training camp in 2010 Staley was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round, 28th overall, in the 2007 NFL Draft. The pick was acquired after the team traded into the first round with the New England Patriots giving up their 2008 first round pick (which became Jerod Mayo) and a 2007 fourth-round pick (which was subsequently traded to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Randy Moss). He was named the starting right tackle over Kwame Harris on August 28, 2007. He finished the season with all 16 starts and allowed 8 sacks. In the 2008 NFL season, Staley was moved to left tackle starting every game, allowing just 8.5 sacks. Prior to the 2009 season, Staley signed a six-year contract extension with the 49ers through the 2017 season. He missed seven games of the season with a sprained knee, but managed to start all the other 9 games allowing just 3 sacks and having no penalties called against him. On October 30, 2011, he caught a pass from a tackle eligible formation for a key first down in the 49ers' 20-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns. On December 27, 2011 Staley was named to the 2012 Pro Bowl and started at left tackle for the NFC. He started every game for the 49ers during the 2011 season as they rushed for over 2,000 yards. On December 26, 2012, Staley was named to the 2013 Pro Bowl. He started every game for the 49ers that season, despite a small scare involving a concussion. The 49ers finished 4th in the regular season, with 2,491 yards of rushing offense, 3rd in the league with 5.1 yards per carry, and tied for second in the league for the number of runs of at least 20 yards in length. At the end of the 2012 season, Staley and the 49ers appeared in Super Bowl XLVII. He started in the game, but the 49ers fell to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 34–31. He signed a two-year extension in the 2014 offseason to extend his tenure through the 2019 season. In 2017, Staley started 15 games at left tackle, missing one game with an eye injury, on his way to his sixth Pro Bowl. On April 17, 2018, Staley signed a restructured contract with the 49ers which gave him a pay raise over the next two seasons. On June 5, 2019, Staley signed a two-year contract extension with the 49ers through the 2021 season. Staley reached another Super Bowl in the 2019 season, but the 49ers lost 31-20 in Super Bowl LIV to the Kansas City Chiefs. On April 25, 2020, Staley announced his retirement from the NFL after 13 seasons. He was released with an injury settlement on May 1, 2020. Personal life Staley is married to former professional soccer player Carrie Dew. They have two daughters, Grace and Audrey. He has hosted a video blog known as the \\"Joe Show\\" for the 49ers website.

Synopsis There are twelve dimensions and a Mojie, a dimension where evil resides. Mojie has taken over ten dimensions in a series of showdowns between good and evil. The inter- dimensional war in the Gold dimension resulted in a tie in which both Mojie forces and KO fighters suffered great damages. Now, the story continues in the Iron dimension where the outcome has yet to be decided. Following the loss of the KO fighters' powers in KO One, Xiu was given a mission to find the KO fighters’ alternate selves in his dimension, the Iron dimension, in order to restore their powers and turn the tide against the dark forces. His search leads him to a boy named Xia Tian, Wang Da Dong's counterpart, who has the potential to become a savior of worlds, a Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren. Xia Tian's incredible power is sealed away by a Feng Long Tie on his neck making him essentially a Ma Gua, or a muggle. Any attempt to use his power would awaken Gui Long, an evil entity in him. But, Gui Long is not the only obstacle Xia Tian has to overcome to become the Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren. His family's objections and his own lack of interest in becoming the savior of worlds are also obstacles. However, his attitude begins to change after he meets a girl from his childhood, Han. To save her life, he boldly goes into Mie to recover her soul. Then and there, he realizes he needs to become stronger so he can protect his loved ones. Although Xia Tian has the determination to become the Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren, he must go through many more tests and trials. He is also not the only one with such potential. Characters ;Xia Xiong (夏雄) Mother of Xia Yu (夏宇), Xia Tian (夏天), and Xia Mei (夏美). Ye Si Ren's (葉思仁) ex-wife. As the sole bread winner in the family and owner of a truck company, she takes on the roles that traditionally belonged to fathers and sons. Despite her tough exterior, she desires the closeness and comfort of a normal family life. She wants her children to lead normal lives, so she sealed Xia Tian and Xia Mei's powers with a pair of \\"Feng Long Tie\\" (封龍貼 / Seal Dragon Patch) since they were young. Among her 3 children, she worries about Xia Tian the most. She loves to cook, but most people are repulsed by her cooking because she makes the worst food. The only people who enjoy her cooking are Demon Hunter, Jiu Wu and herself, which explains why she doesn't stop making food even though everybody else protests about her cooking. She divorced Ye Si Ren because he was irresponsible as a father and unfaithful as a husband. But though her marriage fell apart years ago, she still loves Ye Si Ren and desires his company. When Ye Si Ren reveals his identity as a member of the evil Ye He Na La Family, she finally expresses her true feelings and the two of them become closer than before. But obstacles don't stop coming in-between them. In the initial episodes, she wears a metal glove called \\"Qilin Shou\\" (麒麟手 / Qilin Glove) to cast a family spell called \\"Qi Lin Mai Chong Guang Tao Can\\" (麒麟脈衝光套餐). Later, she uses a gun named \\"Wu Feng\\" (烏風 / Zaocys), which was given to her by the God of Guns years ago. ;Xia Tian (夏天) / Gui Long (鬼龍) Xia Tian (Summer in translation) is a sweet kid with a good heart, but he often gets taken advantage of due to his naivety. Though he is born with powerful abilities, he dislikes using them. He dreams to follow his father's footsteps and become a guitarist, which is met with his mother's strong opposition. As the drama progresses, he convinces her to allow him to follow his dream. To control his powerful but unstable abilities, a \\"Feng Long Tie\\" (封龍貼) was placed on his neck making him no different from a \\"Ma Gua\\" (麻瓜 / Muggle). Xiu believes Xia Tian has the potential to become a \\"Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren\\" (終極鐵克人/ Ultimate Iron Man), a savior of worlds, so he teaches Xia Tian how to play guitar and control Gui Long (鬼龍 / Ghostly Dragon) - his evil half with greater power, who on several occasions, attempts to destroy Xia Tian in order to become the dominant personality. His biggest motivation for developing his power and guitar skills is Han, a girl that he met when he was a child and has liked her ever since. When he takes off the Feng Long Tie, he transforms into Gui Long and becomes unable to control his actions. Gui Long's main weapon is a guitar pick called \\"Gui Long Pi Ke\\" (鬼龍鎞克 / Gui Long Guitar Pick). ;Lan Ling Wang (蘭陵王) Lan Ling Wang was once a highly trained soldier and commander for the Ye He Na La family. His clothing is almost an exact duplicate to the Final Fantasy VII character, Cloud Strife. His lifestyle is pretty retro. When Lan Ling Wang first appears in the story, he just appears and disappears around the Xia family and Dong Cheng Wei (東城衛). He was ordered to find \\"Sou Hun Qu\\" (蒐魂曲 / Soul Collecting Melody) and \\"Xi Hun Qu\\" (洗魂曲 / Soul Cleansing Melody). His family was killed when he softened to the Xia Lan Xing De family and he tried to take revenge on the killer, but his powers were drained by a \\"Gui Ling Yan Huo Qiu\\" (鬼靈焰火球 / Ghostly Fireball) and becomes a Ma Gua (麻瓜) for a time throughout the series, until the Master of the Ye He Na La family executes his plan to dominate the world. Lan Ling Wang casts an ancient spell to ruin his plan, which results in the restoration of the Ye Ha Na La family's power and his powers. When Lan Ling Wang first lost his powers, he learned that someone had put a \\"Qi Xin Zhou\\" (七星咒 / Seven Stars Curse) on his family six generations ago. If he, the seventh generation, cannot lift the curse before the eighth generation is born, then the following generations will lose their true powers and become slaves of the Ye He Na La Family forever. However, if he can lift it, he will gather up the energy of hatred that his ancestors have collected over the centuries and turn him into a \\"Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren\\" (終極鐵克人 / Ultimate Iron Man). Lan Ling Wang carries a sword from the spiritual realm known as \\"Lan Ling Zhan\\" (攔靈斬). It can gather the destructive energy and produce a powerful blast called \\"Fen Jian Da Fa\\" (弅劍大法), which can eliminate everything within 100 miles, including himself. ;Jiu Wu (灸舞) Jiu Wu (sounds like ninety-five) is the newly ascended ruler of the Iron Dimension. An organization called Tie Ke Jin Wei Jun (鐵克禁衛軍 / The Iron Imperial Army) is under his control to protect the Iron Dimension. When he first appears, he has a deep, strange voice which makes him seem powerful and out of the ordinary. But after about twelve episodes, his powerful voice returned to a normal one. He has a younger brother named Jiu Lai, who has the appearance of an old man due to his misuse of supernatural powers. Because he rarely reveals himself, people that know his brother assume that their appearances and ages would be alike; some even refer their names to be similar. As the ruler, his main responsibility is to preserve \\"Fang Hu Ci Chang\\" (防護磁場 / Defense Magnetic Shield) that protects their world from outside attacks: if he gets hurt, the shield will weaken, allowing evil to invade their world; but as he keeps on preserving the force field, it also weakens him in the process, making him unable to use his powers under certain circumstances. Jiu Wu has been famous since young for his \\"Jiu Bu Qin Gui Shou\\" (九步擒鬼手), which indicates the ability to find the opponent's Achilles' Heel within nine steps. No one has ever escaped this attack until he meets the father of the Ye He Na La Family. ;Xia Liu (夏流) The playful grandfather of Xia Tian (夏天), Xia Yu (夏宇) and Xia Mei (夏美); and the head of the family. Xia Liu (because his name sounds like \\"pervert\\" (下流), his name is often dragged into that theme) literally sleeps under the house as the entrance to his bedroom is located under the living room table. Xia Liu is the guardian of the entrance to the ghostly dimension, Mie (滅). He may be senile, but he is also the most powerful member in the family: that is before Xia Tian becomes the superior member. His poor memory is often a laughing point. Removing people's memories is one of Xia Liu's many abilities, and is the first one to be used on screen. His main weapon is a pair of cymbals called \\"Ke Mo Ba\\" (剋魔鈸), which he uses to attack with sound waves and to cast spells. His most notable attacks are eight spells that are mainly used for fighting evils, called \\"Xiang Mo Ba Jue\\" (降魔八訣). ;Ye Si Ren (葉思仁) Ex-husband of Xia Xiong (夏雄), and father of Xia Tian (夏天), Xia Yu (夏宇) and Xia Mei (夏美). Ye Si Ren (sounds close to \\"死人\\" / Dead Man) owns a pub called \\"The Ass Pub\\" (老屁股) and is a very gifted musician. Because of his naïvety and unfaithfulness, he and Xia Xiong's marriage ended years ago, but he still has feelings for her. He is constantly interfering with Xia Xiong's dates. Even though he was not a very good husband, he is a very good father, and will do anything in his capacity to protect his family. At the start, he appears as a Ma Gua (麻瓜), but when Xia Yu's dark powers begin to manifest, he reveals himself as the head member of the Ye He Na La family (葉赫那啦家族) and plays the Xi Hun Qu (洗魂曲 / Soul Cleansing Melody) in order to cleanse Xia Yu's evil instincts and powers. ;Xia Yu (夏宇) / Gui Feng (鬼鳳) Xia Yu is the eldest child. He rarely worries his mother. As a student majoring in law and finance at National Taiwan University, he is great with money and handles the family budget. He is also a money-lover. He always cooks and takes care of his younger siblings during his mother's absence. Despite being the person everyone trusts and relies on, he resents being the only \\"Ma Gua\\" (麻瓜) in the family and doing the menial jobs around the home. Evil sees his jealousy and uses that to turn him evil by giving him a ring to absorb other people's powers. The ring unwittingly unlocks Xia Yu's sealed power. As it turns out, he is not a Ma Gua by birth. Rather, his father secretly sealed his power upon birth because he exhibited the pure evil genes. When he fully comes into his powers, his dark instincts start to take over. The situation forces his father to use \\"Xi Hun Qu\\" (洗魂曲 / Soul Cleansing Melody) to cleanse his soul and seal his power again, which they remain until his paternal grandfather's plan of world domination backfires causing a beam of dark energy to strike directly at him, turning him into \\"Gui Feng\\" (鬼鳳 / Ghostly Phoenix). ;Xia Mei (夏美) / Gui Wa (鬼娃) The youngest child and only daughter of Xia Xiong and Ye Si Ren. Despite being born in a powerful magic family, Xia Mei is the only base- levelled power-user, which makes her the least powerful member in the family. Nevertheless, she is strongest among lower-level power-users. Initially, she has a crush on Xiu, the guitarist of Dong Cheng Wei (東城衛), but later falls for Lan Ling Wang. She is so obsessed with Lan Ling Wang and is willing to sacrifice anything for him. By partially ripping off her Feng Long Tie (封龍貼), Xia Mei can use her power of electricity to attack people; Ren Chen Wen often falls victim to her attacks. However, since her powers belong to basic level, she cannot do any serious damage. When she rips off her Feng Long Tie completely, she becomes Gui Wa (鬼娃 / Ghostly Doll), and becomes able to scare people with Zhen Zi (貞子 - a demon from the movie \\"The Ring\\"), a ghost-like demon with pale skin and a green glow, which she conjures with a little puppet that appears along when she transforms. ;Xiu (脩) Xiu is the leader and guitarist in the band, Dong Cheng Wei (東城衛). At first he thought that Xia Tian was just a Ma Gua (麻瓜), but when he sensed his special powers he started suspecting that Xia Tian might have the potential to become the legendary Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren (終極鐵克人), so he becomes Xia Tian's guitar teacher and later trainer. Xiu has the ability to force someone to act according to his commands, a spell that every member in his family, the Hu Yan Jue Luo family, is capable of. His special weapon is a guitar pick called \\"Shen Feng Pi Ke\\" (神風鎞克 / God's Wind Guitar Pick), which allows its master to increase his magical abilities and produce healing energy. ;Han (寒) Han is the girl Xia Tian met and saved from a gang of naughty kids when she was young. She then gave him her hairpin as a gift, and the two became friends. After her mom died, she was abducted by evil power-users. Xia Tian thought she moved away. Years later, Han reappears when Xia Tian and his father are attacked by loan sharks and unwittingly rescues them (although she does hit Xia Tian on the head).

Their goal was to show the way wuxia would be when it's in the present day and in the future. GTV and Comic International Production Co., Ltd, 終極一家幕後寫真, 152-157. In the first episode they paid homage to the wuxia genre by having Xiu transfer his energy to the KO Fighters in an effort to restore their powers. This \\"transferring of energy\\" to help others is a recurring theme in The X-Family. While working on this show, the writing team made a conscious effort to continue the comic book theme from KO One, as well as to incorporate video game elements popular with their teenage viewers. To do this, they gave almost all their Iron Dimension characters special powers and weapons that were more powerful than their Gold Dimension counterparts. GTV and Comic International Production Co., Ltd, 終極一家幕後寫真, 154. For example, Lan Ling Wang has \\"Lan Ling Zhan,\\" a huge sword that can obliterate a city block when his entire life force is channeled into it. While, his Gold Dimension counterpart Wang Ya Se has \\"Shi Zhong Jian,\\" a little sword in a rock, that merely enhances his fighting power. To show the effects of different powers and weapons, special effects were used, which tagged on additional filming and post-production time. As result, it took eight months, from September 2006 to April 2007, to finish shooting this show. GTV and Comic International Production Co., Ltd, 終極一家幕後寫真, 152. The plot may be unrealistic, but the characters are partly based on the actors and actresses who portray them. In the show, Dong Cheng Wei (東城衛) is a unit of the Iron Protection Team that protects the Iron Dimension with its music. In real life, Dong Cheng Wei is a rock band started by Chen De Xiu and Jiro Wang back when they were in high school. GTV and Comic International Production Co., Ltd, 終極一家幕後寫真, 155. Xiu is a current member of this band; Jiro is both a member of this band as well as Fahrenheit. Also, the actors make references by casually talking about how to act a certain way, use scriptwriting threats, and the production team. This is used for a subtle humour tactic in the story.  Controversy  Days before its airing date, a wave of opposition against the show played out on the net. Taiwanese netizens pointed out the costume for the character Lan Ling Wang had a high degree of similarity to the character Cloud Strife in Final Fantasy VII Taiwan Final Fantasy No Copy August 6, 2007. Retrieved November 1, 2007. and blasted the network for its blatant copyright violation. To those who love FF7 and hate copycats. August 3, 2007. Retrieved November 01, 2007. Executive producer Wang Xin Gui was dismayed by the accusation and denied its validity. Producer Wang Xin Gui denies copyright infringement. August 6, 2007. Retrieved November 01, 2007. Netizens were dissatisfied by the producer's answer and proceeded to send petitions to boycott the show. The producer responded by issuing a public apology through Comic International Productions Co., Ltd, and stated that they were in the process of negotiating with Square Enix about intellectual property rights. It also stated the similarity between Lan Ling Wang and Cloud Strife was purely coincidental. Public apology to Square Enix September 4, 2007. Retrieved November 01, 2007. As result of the uproar, HIM International Music postponed the original soundtrack release date due to its CD album had contained images involved in the copyright dispute. Original Soundtrack release date postponed. August 9, 2007. Retrieved November 01, 2007. The show and its companion books were released as scheduled.

Theasurus artificosae memoria was published in Venice in 1579. He gives a Dante-esque description of hell as a memory space system arranged around a well at the top of a flight of steps consisting of the punishments for heretics, Jews, idolators and hypocrites. In contrast heaven is depicted as the throne of Christ, surrounded by a celestial hierarchy of Apostles, Patriarchs, Prophets, Martyrs, Confessors, virgins, Holy Hebrews and an enormous array of saints.

The album fared moderately, and was later released in Japan, but became the band's final album. Background The album became the band's second and final release, after their split was announced during their It's Only Natural Farewell Tour. It's Only Natural was a complete departure from the band's debut album, Keep It Natural, which took inspiration from manager Lou Pearlman's other boyband, O-Town. This time, the band decided to take a more mature musical direction, drawing upon a rock and pop sound similar to that of The Calling. The album also drew inspiration from Pearlman's biggest success, the Backstreet Boys. Four singles were released from the album: \\"What If\\", released on November 10, 2003, \\"Let Me Just Fly\\", released on February 16, 2004, \\"Just One Last Dance\\", a collaboration with Sarah Connor, released on March 1, 2004, and \\"Why It Hurts\\", released on September 13, 2004. The German version of the album omits \\"Just One Last Dance\\", and also does not include \\"Why it Hurts\\", due to the fact it was recorded after the album's initial release, but before the release of the album in Japan, hence its appearance. \\"Just One Last Dance\\" also appears on the Japanese version. \\"Cabdriver\\" and \\"3 Miles\\" had been planned for released as singles, but due to band's disbandment, nothing came of them. As \\"Cabdriver\\" was recorded after the album's release, it only appeared as a B-side in Germany, but again, appears on the Japanese release. All four singles from the album appeared in the German Singles Chart top forty, despite little promotion. The album was released in Germany, Austria, Switzerland as well as Malaysia, Philippines, and Japan.

Writing for the Ted Hughes Society journal in 2012, Neil Roberts, Emeritus Professor of English Literature at the University of Sheffield, said: > Crow holds a uniquely important place in Hughes [sic] oeuvre. It heralds the > ambitious second phase of his work, lasting roughly from the late sixties to > the late seventies, when he turned from direct engagement with the natural > world to unified mythical narratives and sequences. It was his most > controversial work: a stylistic experiment which abandoned many of the > attractive features of his earlier work, and an ideological challenge to > both Christianity and humanism. Hughes wrote Crow, mostly between 1966 and > 1969, after a barren period following the death of Sylvia Plath. He looked > back on the years of work on Crow as a time of imaginative freedom and > creative energy, which he felt that he never subsequently recovered. He > described Crow as his masterpiece... The book is a collection of poems about the character Crow, which borrows extensively from many world mythologies, notably both trickster and Christian mythology. A central core group of poems in the work can be seen as an attack on Christianity.

A 20th- century derivative of the ancient dizi (bamboo transverse flute), the xindi is western influenced, fully chromatic, and usually lacks the dizi's distinctive di mo, or buzzing membrane. The xindi is also known as the 11-hole di (十一孔笛). Its design is western influenced and based on the principal of equal temperament. It first appeared in the early 1930s. It was designed and produced by Ding Silin (丁西林1893-1974). Characteristics and range The biggest difference between the xindi and the traditional Chinese di is that there are an additional five finger-holes compared to the six found on the di. Additionally, it has three more finger-holes than the Xiāo (簫) - an eight-hole flute which, itself, has extra finger-holes compared to the di, for the right little finger and left thumb. The additional finger-holes on the xindi are for the right-hand thumb, the little finger of the left hand, and the left index finger, which has to alternate between two finger-holes. The traditional flute exhibits imperfections during modulation due to difficulties in controlling the intonation of the semitone. Thus, the purpose of the additional holes is to help correct these imperfections. Through its 11-hole design, the xindi can play every semitone in the octave perfectly, and modulation is made easier and smoother due to its ability to be played in different keys. The player only needs to use their fingers to move down the holes to change key easily, whereas with the traditional Chinese flute the instrument itself must be changed. The biggest difference between the xindi and the traditional dizi is the xindi’s lack of a dimo (笛膜, lit. \\"di membrane\\"), which creates the characteristic timbre. This is why the xindi is unlike the qudi (曲笛) or bangdi (梆笛), which have a brighter and crisper timbre. Its tone is between that of a traditional Chinese flute and that of a Western concert flute, giving it a much mellower sound. Contrary to the two differences to the traditional dizi, the length and range of the xindi is similar to that of a G key Dà dí (大笛). Its range is also similar to the G range, which is common with the flute. The common range is from a lower tone D to a higher tone E, a total of 15 notes. Occasionally it can play in the treble range, however the sound is not desirable. Role of the xindi in music In the modern day Chinese orchestra, the xindi plays an important role in the mid and lower tonal ranges, alongside other di instruments. It has the same function as the Cháng dí (长笛) in the Chinese Symphony Orchestra. The xindi features in more than half of all traditional Chinese ensemble music. Sometimes, the xindi is replaced by other instruments of similar range such as the dadi, xiao or changdi. This is due to its reduced popularity because of its complicated fingering and an insufficient range. Sometimes the qudi is used to simulate a xindi’s sound instead of a xindi itself; this is achieved by placing a plastic film over the Mó kǒng (膜孔). Although the xindi features significantly in ensemble performance, its use for solo performance is very rare. Due to its complicated fingering and limited range changes, it is often considered a slightly inferior performance instrument in comparison to the dadi or flute. It is mainly valued for its ability to play in semitones, which means it can be used for western style music more easily. However, it is not considered to be the optimal choice because the western flute has a broader range and a tone which complements the other orchestral instruments better. All these reasons contribute to why its use for solo performance is so restricted and rare. Further reading *Lee Yuan-Yuan and Shen, Sinyan.

A scroll found in the cave, part of the Babatha archive Image of a fragment of one of the biblical manuscripts found in the Cave of Letters The Cave of Letters is a cave in Nahal Hever in the Judean Desert where letters and fragments of papyri from the Roman Empire period were found. Some are related to the Bar Kokhba revolt (circa 131-136), including letters of correspondence between Bar-Kokhba and his subordinates. Another notable bundle of papyri, known as the Babatha cache, comprises legal documents of Babatha, a female landowner of the same period. Manuscripts sites in the Judaean desert Geography The cave is located at the head of Nahal Hever in the Judean desert, about south of Qumran, 20 km south of Wadi Murabba'at. The site is a few kilometers southwest of En-gedi, approximately 10 kilometers north of Masada, on the western shore of the Dead Sea. The cave has two openings, three halls and some crevices. History The cave was discovered by Bedouin of the Ta\`amireh tribe and explored in 1953 and 1955 by inspector of the Israel Department of Antiquities, Yohanan Aharoni. In 1953, after the sale of letters written by Bar-Kokhba found in the caves of Wadi Murabba'at, an expedition was organized to explore these caves. However the expedition first visited Nahal Hever, where the team noticed remnants of a Roman siege camp directly above the Cave of Letters. Another camp was also discovered on the southern side of the ravine. In the Cave of Letters, archaeologists found Chalcolithic remains from the 4th millennium BCE as well as artifacts from the Roman period. Further exploration of the cave was abandoned because of some boulders obstructing access to other parts of the cave. It was not until 1960, when more documents from the Bar-Kokhba Revolt were sold to scholars in Jordan, that further exploration was approved. On March 23, 1960, four teams set out to explore the caves over a period of two weeks. Yigael Yadin led a team to search the northern side of the ravine at Nahal Hever. 1960 Archeological finds The first finding was of a niche of skulls. Tucked away in a crevasse opening were remains of human skeletons, wrapped in textiles and covered in a large mat. One skeleton was covered by a colorful mat and other textiles, while the remains of a child dressed in a tunic were discovered in a leather lined basket. The textiles found were some of the earliest known of the Roman period and were dated around 135, the end of the Bar-Kokhba Revolt. These textiles were of importance in showing the kinds of dyes and the weaving material used, but of greater importance was the acquisition of a complete set of clothes worn by Jews of the 1st and 2nd century: the mantles of men and women, a child's linen tunic, and some un-spun wool dyed purple. Other finds of archeological significance were samples of Bar Kochba Revolt coinage, inscribed on one side 'Shimeon' and on the other, 'to the Freedom of Jerusalem' (). Some arrows were found at the entrance to the cave, and a basket of bronze vessels and incense shovels. They had been made with Roman images on them, but the faces of the various pagan gods and creatures were defaced (see Aniconism in Judaism). A tied bundle of documents, the Bar-Kokhba letters, was found in a waterskin, next to what were apparently a woman's belongings: wool, cosmetic tools, beads, a perfume flask and a mirror. Bar- Kokhba letters Of fifteen letters, most were written in Aramaic and Hebrew, and two in Greek. Most were addressed from the leader (but not in one handwriting) to his subordinates Yehonathan and Masabala, who sat at En-Gedi. Yadin theorized that Yehonathan and Masabala finally carried their cache to the cave. The letters are linguistically interesting as they include many spelling errors, revealing a spoken Hebrew which parallels in places phenomena from modern colloquial Hebrew despite the two sharing no direct relation. A letter consisting of four slats of wood tied together with the other papyri was the only one that used the words \\"Nesi Israel\\" (the others used \\"Shimeon ben/bar Kosiba\\"). This letter is written in Aramaic and it addresses two subordinates, ordering them to confiscate some wheat from a man and deliver the man and the wheat safely to him, and threatens to severely punish them if they fail. The letter also warns that no one should give shelter to any man from Tekoa. This warning includes the description of the punishment; \\"Concerning every man of Tekoa who will be found at your place – the house in which they dwell will be burned and you [too] will be punished\\". Another letter (P. Yadin 50) concerned the arrest of Eleazar bar Ḥitta: \\"Shimeon bar Kosiba, to Yehonathan bar Be'ayan, and Masabala bar Shimeon, [my order is] that you will send to me Eleazar, bar Ḥitta, immediately, before the Sabbath\\". Documents acquired later revealed that Eleazar bar Ḥitta was a wealthy land owner in Ein-Gedi who didn't cooperate with Bar-Kokhba. It goes on to describe what is to be done with his property; wheat and fruit are to be confiscated, the herds should not trample the trees \\"and as for the spice fields, no one is to get anywhere near it\\".Yadin 1971, cited in The force with which the order is given shows how valuable the spice fields in particular were. This is also supported in Pliny's Historia Naturalis, describing the conquest of Ein-Gedi during the First Jewish Revolt, when the Romans had to fight for every bush, as the Jews wanted to destroy them. Another letter (P. Yadin 57) is a request from Bar-Kokhba to supply the Four species for the feast of Sukkot. The request is unusual, in that it is not addressed to his subordinates Yehonathan and Masabala, but to a third party, whose name is Yehuda bar Menashe. Because of the nature of the request, it has been interpreted as indicating distrust between Bar-Kohkba and his subordinates. A second letter (P. Yadin 52)Greek Text, Papyri.info concerned the same request of the four species, except this letter was written in Greek by a man called Soumaios, who was probably a Nabataean. \\"The letter is written in Greek as we have no one who knows Hebrew [or Aramaic].\\" This passage of the letter is of particular interest to scholars because it might indicate that non-Jews were a part of Bar-Kohkba's revolt, a fact that is also supported by the third century historian Dio Cassius, \\"And many outside nations were joining for the eagerness of gain\\".Roman History, 69:13.1. See Cassius Dio, Translation by Earnest Cary. Roman History, book 69, 12.1-14.3. Loeb Classical Library, 9 volumes, Greek texts and facing English translation: Harvard University Press, 1914 thru 1927. Online in LacusCurtius: and livius.org:. Book scan in Internet Archive:. Or this could be a case in which no Jewish soldiers at this camp could write in Aramaic or Hebrew. This letter is not from Bar-Kohkba but someone else who was writing to Yehonathan and Masabala. The person that wrote this letter is telling Yehonathan and Masabala that he is sending to them a messenger, and they are to send him back with palm branches and citron. Second exploration in 1961 Iron Age house keys found in Cave of Letters, Nahal Hever Canyon, Israel Museum, Jerusalem In the second dig of the Cave of Letters, in a previously explored section of the cave, a well concealed crevice was discovered and in it a number of artifacts were found in a palm basket. These included an empty jewelry box, with a barrel shaped top and a flat bottom that was painted with yellow and red dots, some wooden plates and bowls, and an iron sickle. A pair of woman's sandals was also discovered, one of which was examined by an orthopedic specialist, who judged from the shape of it that the wearer of the sandal must have had a limp. Among the rest of the artifacts discovered were three knives, a frying pan, and a mirror similar to one found the previous year. Under the basket, a bag held another bundle of documents, that would be known as Babatha’s cache. Still below there was a reed tube and six papyri, next to a leather pouch. More artifacts were found elsewhere in the cave, including a second coin from the \\"Freedom of Jerusalem\\" period, two cooking pots, and a fowling net. The net measured 6.5 by 10 meters, with wide holes and a drawstring. Another cache was found in a hidden cleft, and in it were six iron keys, known in the Mishnah as \\"knee\\" or \\"elbow\\" keys, so named because they were shaped to fit through a small opening through the gate and engage the lock on the other side of the gate. The next discovery was of a set of one large glass bowl, and two smaller glass plates, in a palm fiber wrap, as well as two willow baskets and a strip of papyrus with verses 7 and 8 chapter 20 of Book of Numbers written in Hebrew - these two verses concern God's commandment to Moses and Ahron to speak to the desert rock so that it produce water. The documents discovered to be part of the leather pouch dealt with various land transactions, some being dealt with by Bar-Kokhba's administrators during his first year as Nasi Israel. Another one described the terms in which the lands of En-gedi would be leased and included signatures of four of the leases. The Babatha cache The Babatha (or Babata) cache contains 35 documents covering a wide range of legal issues, dated between 94 and 132. One was the deed of a palm grove which contained details of the water rights in it, \\"one every Sunday, every year, for ever\\". This particular document goes on to reassure the buyer of his rights and that of his heirs, and contains many legal terms of the time. The cache also contained Babatha's marriage contract to her second husband Yehudah, as well as a document describing the conditions of a loan of 300 silver denarii to him by her. This document stated that if he refuses payment he would be liable under the law to pay her double the amount and damages. There is also a document where she petitions to become sole guardian of her son Yeshua, orphaned when her first husband died. Other documents were found concerning the splitting of her husband Yehudah's property between various family members, including his daughter from his other marriage. Other documents were found concerning her second husband's property; the most interesting one is a summons by her, to her husband's other wife. This document is dated 7 July 131, and states, “In the presence of the witness...Babata [daughter of] Shimeon of Maoza summoned Miriam [Mariame] daughter of Be'ayan of En-gedi to come forth together with her and Haterius Nepos the governor wherever he may be present; since you [Miriam] plundered everything in the house of Yehudah son of Eleazar Khthusion, my husband and yours...\\" The last document is dated August 19, 132, the year of the Bar-Kohkba Revolt. In this document she uses a form of address, 'Yeshua son of Yeshua my orphan son', that suggests that her previous petition for guardianship of her son might have failed. The document is a receipt, ‘from you on account of aliments and clothing of the said Yeshua my son, six denarii of silver from the first of the month of Panemos [June] of the said 27th year [of Provincia Arabia] until the thirtieth of Gorpiaios [August] three full months’.

It was written in English (mid-1982) for the German channel Süddeutscher Rundfunk, recorded in October 1982 and broadcast on 19 May 1983 where it attracted \\"an audience of two million viewers.\\"Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 683 The mime artist Helfrid Foron played both parts. It was published by Faber in Collected Shorter Plays in 1984. Originally entitled Nachtstück (Night Piece), it is a wordless play, the only sound that of a male voice humming, then singing, from the last seven bars of Schubert’s lied Nacht und Träume, words by Matthäus Casimir von Collin: \\"Holde Träume, kehret wieder!\\" (\\"Sweet dreams, come back\\"). Schubert was a composer much loved by Beckett – \\"the composer who spoke most to him … whom he considered a friend in suffering\\"Grindea, M., ‘Beckett’s Involvement with Music’ in Bryden, M., (Ed.) Samuel Beckett and Music, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), p 183 – and this lied was one of the author’s favourites. James Knowlson, in his biography of Beckett, states that the actual text used however was a slightly modified version by Heinrich Joseph von Collin, Matthäus’s brother.Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 681 Synopsis Beckett lists five elements that make up the play: evening light, the dreamer (A), his dreamt self (B), a pair of dreamt hands and the last seven bars of Schubert’s lied. It reads more like a formula or a list of ingredients than a cast. The action begins with a dreamer sitting alone in a dark empty room; his hands are resting on the table before him. He is on the far left of the screen and we are presented with his right profile. A male voice hums the last seven bars of the Schubert lied. Then we hear the same section sung, the man rests his head on his hands and the light fades until the words \\"Holde Träume\\" whereupon it fades up on the man’s dreamt self who is seated on an invisible podium four feet higher and well to the right of him. We see his left profile, a mirror image of his waking self. His is bathed in what Beckett describes as a \\"kinder light.\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 305 The dreamer is still faintly visible throughout though. A left hand appears out of the darkness and gently rests on B. As the man raises his head it withdraws. The right appears with a cup from which B drinks. It vanishes and then reappears to gently wipe his brow with a cloth. Then it disappears again. B raises his head to gaze upon the invisible face and holds out his right hand, palm upward. The right hand returns and rests on B’s right hand. He looks at the two hands together and adds his left hand. Together the three hands sink to the table and B rests his head on them. Finally the left hand comes out of the darkness and rests gently on his head. The dream fades as A awakens but when the music is replayed the sequence is replayed, in close-up and slower. Afterwards the camera withdraws leaving us with an image of a \\"recovering\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 306 A before the light fades away completely.  Interpretation Albrecht Dürer, Study of Praying Hands, 1508 The play finds its origin in Beckett’s fascination with Albrecht Dürer's famous etching of praying hands, a reproduction of which had hung in his room at Cooldrinagh as a child, however \\"the dark, empty room with its rectangle of light and its black-coated figure hunched over the table, resembled a schematised seventeenth century Dutch painting even more explicitly than Ohio Impromptu.\\".Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 682 Beckett insisted to Dr Müller-Freinfels that \\"the sex of the hands must remain uncertain. One of our numerous teasers\\".Samuel Beckett to Dr Müller-Freinfels, 30 July 1982. Quoted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 682 He did, however concede to James Knowlson that these \\"sexless hands … might perhaps be a boy’s hands\\".Samuel Beckett to James Knowlson, undated. Quoted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 682 In the end, practicality demanded that he opt for female hands with the proviso, \\"Large but female. As more conceivably male than male conceivably female.\\"Samuel Beckett to Dr Müller-Freinfels, 5 August 1982. Quoted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 682 \\"Beckett never endorses a belief in salvation from, or redemption for, suffering. But the need for some temporary comfort from suffering becomes acute in his late work, especially in the work for television.\\"Herren, G., ‘Nacht und Träumeas – Beckett’s Agony in the Garden’ in Journal of Beckett Studies, 11.1, Spring 2001, p 55 The helping hand is an image of consolation. It suggests a kind of benediction. In ritualistic and sacramental fashion the blessed shade offers him first a cup from which he drinks and then gently wipes his brow with a cloth. \\"The screen layout calls to mind certain religious paintings where a vision often appears in a top corner of the canvas, normally the Virgin Mary, Christ ascended in his glory or a ministering angel. The chalice, cloth and comforting hand are similarly images commonly found in religious paintings.\\" Beckett’s cameraman, Jim Lewis said that: : \\"… at the moment when the drops of perspiration are wiped from the brow of the character, Beckett simply said that the cloth alluded to the veil that Veronica used to wipe the brow of Jesus on the Way of the Cross. The imprint of Christ’s face remains on the cloth.\\"Lewis, J., Beckett et la caméra, p 379. Quoted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 682 \\"The play could have been sentimental, even maudlin. The mysterious quality of the action, the beauty of the singing … and the specificity of the repeated, almost ritualistic patterns avoid this. What, on the printed page, seems a very slight piece, acquires on the screen a strange, haunting beauty.\\" One has to assume, using the same logic as Beckett did with Quad II, that the dream/memory/fantasy is winding down and that, if it was to receive a third run through, it would be slower again suggesting that it is fading away. Perhaps even now it is no longer accessible consciously, only via the unconscious. \\"In Beckett’s production for German television a central door, not mentioned in the text, was shown in the shots of A, disappearing in the shots of B, as though A had entered the world of B through the door of memory.\\"Pountney, R., Theatre of Shadows: Samuel Beckett’s Drama 1956-1976 (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988), p 213 But why use such Judeo-Christocentric imagery when so much of his more famous work revolves around life in a godless universe? As he conceded to Colin Duckworth, \\"Christianity is a mythology with which I am perfectly familiar, so I naturally use it\\".Duckworth, C.. Angels of Darkness: Dramatic Effect in Samuel Beckett with Special Reference to Eugène Ionesco (London: Allen, 1972), p 18 One might imagine Beckett appending the same disclaimer he applied to Berkeley’s philosophy in Film: \\"No truth value attaches to above, regarded as of merely structural and dramatic convenience\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 163 References Category:1983 plays Category:Plays by Samuel Beckett Category:Theatre of the Absurd ","title":"Nacht und Träume (play)"},{"id":"10954755","text":"Hudd Kar Di is an Indian television series.

Those terms pin some characters that has been often considered a part of Italian neorealism as well.Vitti A., La Ciociaria nel cinema, in Zangrilli F., Bonaviri G., La Ciociaria tra letteratura e cinema, Metauro ed., Pesaro 2002, pp. 291-305 Many writers say that they have found poetical inspiration in lands south of Rome thanks to a large variety of local traditions, ancient rural landscapes and people's provincialism. Those characters should belong to a geographical region between Tevere and Garigliano, where artists like Alberto Moravia, Elsa Morante, Cesare Zavattini, Cesare Pascarella, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Giuseppe De Santis, Vittorio De Sica lived, producing famous novels and movies. Location of Two Women in Vallecorsa In 1960 De Sica made a film \\"Two Women\\" in Vallecorsa, where he represented in cinematography Moravia's novel \\"La Ciociara\\"; for the first time the terms ciociari and Ciociaria appeared in Italian cinematography. After that some film makers of Italian neorealism who lived in southern Lazio called this land Ciociaria as well as the landscapes they represented in some movies. The term was taken both from ancient books of tourist voyages like Pascarella's Viaggio in Ciociaria and from some fascist historical searches about province of Frosinone and \\"ruralization\\". In this uncertain context De Santis considered Ciociaria in cinematography as a topos with which the oppressions of poor pleasants has been expressed in some Italian neorealistic films and he showed this point of view in his movie Non c'è pace tra gli ulivi explicitly.De Santis G., Letter to Adriano Baracco, in «Cinema», 15 november 1950, n. 50 Between Miracles is another movie in which Ciociaria is evoked, following a public statement of the author Nino Manfredi who says that the plot represents a part of his life during which he was contemporary rebel and repressed, just in Ciociaria, where he was born.Manfredi N., Nudo d'attore, Mondadori, Milano 1993, p. 9. In common language terms like Ciociaria and ciociari are used to denote both any movies set in southern Latium and many actors who was born in province of Frosinone or in province of Latina. Some people thinks the term ciociaro is an insult so they refuse to be called like that.An Italian spot where Sofia Loren was called ciociara has been contested by some politicals of Lazio because they considered that term as offensive.

Life  Early life She was the eldest child of Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden, and his wife Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. She was born 13 July 1776, twin sister of Katharina Amalie Christiane Luise. Caroline was considered as a bride for Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien, but the fear of attracting opposition from France made her family hesitate. Marriage On 9 March 1797, in Karlsruhe, she became the second spouse of Maximilian, Duke of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, who two years later would inherit the Electorate of Bavaria. As a result of the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the rank of Elector became obsolete, and the ruler of Bavaria was promoted to the rank of King. As a result, Caroline became Queen of Bavaria. With her husband Caroline had seven children, including two pairs of twins, an interesting occurrence considering Caroline was also a twin herself. She was allowed to keep her Protestant religion and had her own Protestant pastor, which was unique for a Bavarian queen. She was described as a very dignified consort and hostess of the Bavarian court, and raised her daughters to have a strong sense of duty. Death and funeral Caroline of Baden died 13 November 1841, outliving her husband by sixteen years and one month. Due to her Protestant religion, her funeral was conducted with so little royal dignity that there were public protests. By order of the Catholic archbishop of Munich, Lothar Anselm von Gebsattel, all participating Catholic clergy were dressed in ordinary clothes instead of church vestments. The Protestant clergy were halted at the church door and not allowed to proceed inside for the service, so Ludwig Friedrich Schmidt gave the funeral sermon there. Afterwards, the funeral procession dissipated, and the coffin was placed in the burial crypt without ceremony. This treatment of his beloved stepmother permanently softened the attitude of Caroline's stepson Ludwig I of Bavaria, who up until that time had been a strong opponent of Protestantism in spite of his marriage to the Protestant princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen.

Like the preceding SD I, it was intended to equip the clandestine air force that Germany was assembling at Lipetsk and was hoped to overcome the shortcomings of that type.

The landing gear and tailplane were of far stronger construction. The SD II was flown competitively against the Heinkel HD 37 in 1929 and was found to have highly undesirable handling characteristics. Development was terminated at that point.

Talkin' Funny had its original run on Chicago Public-access television cable TV channel CAN21. The TV show first aired on October 4, 2005 and ran for 6 seasons, airing its final episode on CAN21 on June 29, 2009. It aired on Monday nights at 7:30 p.m. in the Chicago area. In 2020, amid stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the hosts relaunched the call-in show as Talkin' Funny 2020 on their YouTube channel. The first episode of Talkin' Funny 2020 streamed live on April 14, 2020 with special guest Jordan Klepper. All three participants appeared remotely by video chat. Sasha and the Noob formerly appeared in the live game show Don't Spit the Water at the Playground Theater. Sasha is played by Steve Gadlin, a Chicago comedian and entrepreneur known for his business I Want to Draw a Cat for You. Gadlin also hosts occasional seasons of Steve Gadlin's Star Makers, which airs on various public television and public access stations nationwide, including CAN21 and AMGTV. He has produced and appeared as a performer in Don't Spit the Water and Impress These Apes through his production company, Blewt! The Noob is played by Paul Luikart. In season 2, episode 13, callers began flushing the toilet on the phone. This became a monumental moment in the history of Talkin' Funny. Format The show begins with the character of The Noob blowing his slide whistle. Sasha then takes calls from viewers. Viewers ask questions, make comments, scream, curse, tell jokes, play simple games (such as their trademark \\"Hide the Peanut\\") or may interact with paper characters put in front of a desk-mounted camera by Sasha. A guest, usually someone in the Chicago comedy community, then comes on. Viewers sometimes ask questions, but often ignore the guest entirely. Calls then continue until the show's 25 minutes are up, with an often hasty slide whistle ending. Characters Sasha * Sasha is an international comedian, and is the main voice of the show. He is almost always seen wearing a red vest; often stares, mouth agape, due to an inability to control his bowels. The Noob * The origin of The Noob's name is actually completely independent of the online gaming community that popularized it. He rarely speaks, because when he was a little boy, he watched his father kill his mother, and instead communicates by slide whistle. In the first episode of Talkin' Funny 2020, he did not have access to a slide whistle, so instead played a recorder. Army * Army is a blue octopus on a sheet of paper. He only says \\"BLUBUBLUBLUBUBUBUBLU\\" and shakes uncontrollably. Ned Littletoes * Ned is a pink hat mustache sporting cowboy from the old west. He also doubles as the phone screener. The Laugh Cougar * Never actually seen on screen, only a drawn likeness of the laugh cougar. Tells jokes which usually end in the punchline \\"Wilfred Brimly\\" Mr. Sloat * Mr. Sloat is a shady character that has appeared in two episodes, Season 3 episodes 8 and 13. He is alleged to be involved in some illegal activities and is labeled a terrorist by Governor Kevin. Steve * Steve has only appeared in one episode, \\"Talkin' Seriously,\\" Season 2 Episode 9. Paul * Paul has appeared in Season 2 Episodes 9 and 11, Season 3 Episode 4, as well as Season 4 Episode 4. Diabolical Dina * Kidnapped The Noob and trapped him into the comic book dimension in Season 4 Episode 10. Professor Hopchump *Expert in dimensions. Trapped in the comic book dimension and eaten by Diabolical Dina in Season 4 Episode 11. Prank Calling The show is set up in such a fashion that it almost invites viewers to 'prank call' the show. One aspect of the appeal of the show is the haphazard and candid way Sasha and The Noob try to cover up explicit and graphic language spoken by the callers to the duo, usually a hasty cut-off of the caller in the middle of his or her cursing rant, or, if the language is suggestive but not explicit, the hosts' deliberate skewing of the meaning of the language (i.e. pootietang). One frequent gag is the 'flush- gag', where a caller attempts to flush their toilet in earshot of the phone, doing so at what they believe is the least expected moment possible. It has become custom as of late for the hosts to then eat sour candies. Frequent Callers David * David calls very often, and is frequently incomprehensible. Speaks to the television, not the phone creating a 7-second delay in his answers. Often feuds with Caller Bill, but it is clear that he longs for his touch. Mel * Mel has a southern accent and is bizarrely enthusiastic. Buddy Bill & His Wife Joani * Buddy Bill is usually the caller, with his wife heard in the background.... She calls in once in a while but makes Bill watch the show on a black and white TV in the basement while she watches girly shows on the big TV upstairs. Governor Kevin * Governor Kevin is in high school, and is not associated with Governor Kevin from Teamo Supremo Governor Kevin's Little Sister * Governor Kevin's little sister is loud and annoying, she also helped Kevin win the election by saying \\"Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin!\\" Da Noob's Father * Da Noob's father is sometimes speaking words, sometimes speaking slidewhistle, but is always pleading for Da Noob's love. Jessica * Jessica has a pretty voice. Joe * Joe always refers to someone named MaNoob (and once Manure) sitting to Sasha's left. Often asks when \\"Miss Mia\\" from \\"Chic-a-Go-Go\\" will be a guest. Uses the phrase \\"pootietang\\" liberally. Dead for a Ducat's manager * Calls in to shamelessly promote his band, Dead for a Ducat. Band member Keegan is another frequent caller. Bo Cleveland * Usually calls in to just yell \\"Baba Booey\\" and then promptly hangs up. Sean Hardy * Orders P-Zone's thinking the show is a Pizza Hut. Sometimes craves Buffalo Wild Wings. Once asked Sasha to go with him to Lake Gaston. References External links *Talkin Funny's Main Page * *Steve Gadlin's Star Makers on IMDB * Blewt's Youtube page * Blewt!

The 1986 film At Close Range is based loosely on Johnston's gang. Early years Bruce Johnston was a son of James Johnston, Sr. Along with his brother James, Jr., he was raised by his grandmother Harriet Steffy and grandaunt Sarah Martin, and neither of the boys started associating with their father until a few years before Bruce began his criminal activities. Gang He founded and led the Johnston Gang, which had a wide network and operated primarily in Chester County, according to a 1980 Pennsylvania Crime Commission report. He and the Johnston Gang also committed crimes in Lancaster County on several occasions and even crossed the state lines that bordered Maryland and Delaware. They primarily engaged in theft, stealing items that ranged from antiques to drugs. In each break-in or theft, gang members used their skills in picking locks, cracking safes, and disarming or averting security systems. They used walkie-talkies and police scanners. While doing a job in one part of the county, they would divert the state police by phoning a false report elsewhere. Gang members * Bruce Johnston Sr., Gang leader * David Johnston * Norman Johnston * Richard Mitchell, whom later became a witness for the State * James Griffin, whom later became a witness for the State * Edward Otter * Davis Schonely * Leslie Dale, whom later became a witness for the State * Gary Wayne Crouch, deceased * Richard Donnell, whom was believed to have drowned fellow gang member Jack W. Baen * Roy Meyers, whom later became a witness for the State * Jack W. Baen, whom drowned in 1970; murder charges were filed against Leslie Dale and Richard Donnell * Francis Matherly * Ancell E. Hamm, whom killed two police officers of the Kennett Square Police Department (William Davis and Richard Posey) in 1972 and was sentenced to two consecutive life terms. He was also one of the earliest Johnston Gang members. Chronology of crimes 1971 In August of 1971, the gang targeted the Dutch Wonderland castle on Lincoln Highway East. The police believe that the main culprits were David, Norman, and Bruce, Sr., and that they made away with $33,000 worth of cash and property. 1972 Ancell E. Hamm, murdered two Kennett Square patrolmen. As a result, police began heavily investigating the gang's activities. 1975 The gang broke into the shop at Meadia Heights Country Club in Lancaster, PA. They drilled holes in the side of the shop and disarmed the alarm system, and used dynamite to gain access to a safe. They made off with $15,000 in money and golf equipment, none of which was ever recovered. 1976 Janet Gazzerro and her husband Frank were convicted of bribing a juror who was on the Chester County Common Pleas Court where among others Bruce Johnston Sr. was accused of the theft of a tractor. Janet and Frank received $83,000 in stolen rugs, jewelry and furs. Janet testified that Bruce Sr. gave her two or three garden tractors, of which she kept one or two, and gave the third to the juror in question. Bruce Sr., David and Norman Johnston and Roy Myers were acquitted of the theft charges. When the police were gathering information about the burglary ring, Manheim resident Gary G. Hauck was asked to testify. Hauck had unknowingly bought a piece of farm equipment stolen by the Johnston gang in 1976. Police traced it back to the ring and wanted Hauck to testify who he had bought it from. Hauck, then a self-employed auto body worker, told a reporter he had gotten a call at 2:00 the morning before the preliminary hearing. The caller urged him not to identify anyone at the hearing. To convince Hauck that he wasn't fooling, the caller said Hauck would find dynamite under the seat of his truck, but that it wasn't hooked up. Hauck looked and found five sticks of dynamite, and did not identify at the hearing. Later, during a trial of the brothers, Hauck said he had lied at the hearing because of the threat. 1977 April: The brothers transported $21,900 in stolen cigarettes across state lines. They all pleaded guilty to this crime in 1981. May: The three brothers stole $28,000 from Longwood Gardens in Chester County. In 1981 they were serving two- to four-year sentences for convictions on state charges of this crime. August 1978 victims As the Johnston Gang came under increased police surveillance due to their high-profile activities, they began an assassination campaign to eliminate any potential witnesses. * James \\"Jimmy\\" Johnston, Jr. (18) — murdered August 16, 1978 * Dwayne Lincoln (17) — murdered August 16, 1978 * Wayne Sampson (20) — murdered August 16, 1978 * James Sampson (24) — murdered August 21, 1978 * Robin Miller (15) girlfriend of Bruce Johnston Jr.) — murdered August 30, 1978 * Bruce Johnston Jr. (19) — critically injured during an attempted murder - August 30, 1978 Investigation, arrest, trial and appeal 1979 The brothers were found guilty of stealing farm tractors in Ephrata and selling them to an associate. They were sentenced to four to nine years for the thefts. Bruce Sr. appealed, but the police were already hot on the trail of the brothers for murdering the young members of the operation to cover up other burglaries. 1981 Bruce was convicted of the murders of Gary Crouch, James Johnston, James Sampson, Robin Miller, Wayne Sampson and Duane Lincoln and for the attempted murder of Bruce Jr. He received 6 consecutive life sentences. David and Norman were convicted of the murders of James Johnston, Robin Miller, Wayne Sampson and Duane Lincoln. They both received 4 life sentences. 1987 The Johnston brothers returned to the courts seeking new trials. Their attorneys were claiming that in the former trial it wasn't revealed to the defense that key witness James Griffin, a former gang member, had testified under an immunity agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office. The attorneys wanted to know whether or not he made a similar agreement with local and state authorities in exchange for freedom. On the witness stand Griffin testified that he was never prosecuted for committing about 150 burglaries while a member of the gang. Afterwards David Johnston is serving his sentence in Greene, Pennsylvania. Norman was in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, but he was transferred to Camp Hill, Pennsylvania after his 1999 escape. He is currently located in Forest, Pennsylvania. Bruce was in Graterford, Pennsylvania until his death in 2002. When Norman Johnston escaped, Bruce Johnston Sr. and David Johnston were moved to solitary confinement. Bruce appealed his sentence many times but to no avail. Norman Johnston was featured on America's Most Wanted on August 15, 1999. Three of the \\"Kiddy Gang\\" murder victims (Wayne Sampson, 20, Duane Lincoln, 17, and James Johnston, 18) had disappeared in August and were shot and buried along the infamous Devil's Road/Cult House Road [Cossart Road] along the Northern Delaware/Pennsylvania Border in Pennsbury Township, Pennsylvania. This road is also the location where some of the film The Village (2004 film) was filmed. In 2002, Bruce Johnston Sr. died of cancer at the age of 63 in Graterford Prison, Graterford, Pa. After testifying against his father, Bruce Johnston Jr. had additional brushes with the law. In 2013, he was arrested on drug delivery charges. “He had the opportunity for a new chance. It did not work out, though. That’s sad,” said Joseph Carroll, the former Chester County district attorney who dealt with Johnston Jr. in connection with his testimony against his father and other members of the gang. “I think some of us felt bad for the guy,” added Carroll. “You grow up in that environment and what could your future be? My impression was that he was a victim of circumstance in where he grew up.“ He is currently serving a sentence of 7-14 years.

Recently, the Tuneros de San Luis moved to Chihuahua and took the Dorados namesake, which also brought the LMB (AAA) Mexican Baseball League to Chihuahua for the first time since 1982. The Dorados played their home games at Estadio Chihuahua. The Dorados will be sold to either Nuevo Laredo or Aguascalientes for the 2011–2012 season.El Manana article: Apoya LMB entrada de Dorados (LMB supports the entrance of Dorados to Nuevo Laredo) (es) Dorados de Chihuahua baseball history Mexican League 1940 The Mexican League was founded in 1925 with 5 teams and slowly grew. By the late 1930s and 40s, the league was drawing the top players from the Negro Leagues, including Satchel Paige, Cool Papa Bell, Martin Dihigo, Ray Dandridge and Willie Wells. Native Mexican talent was almost run out of the league in 1940, when many Cuban and Negro League stars took central stage – only a handful of Mexican players like Angel Castro and Jesus Valenzuela were competitive with the foreign imports. Three Negro Leaguers won Triple Crowns in a 4-year period – since then only three other players have won Triple Crowns in the Mexican League. The Dorados de Chihuahua joined the Mexican League in 1940. The Golden men were 14-67 and 42 games out of first in dead last. The teams loan super stars were Lonnie Summers and Jacinto Roque, both of whom spent time on other clubs. The Dorados also played in the short-lived Mexican National League in 1946. Arizona–Texas League 1952 Formed from the Arizona State League in 1931, the Arizona–Texas League was a class D circuit that ran from '31-'32 and '37-'39. In '40-'41 it was promoted to class C, then halted play from 1942 to 1946. In '47-'50 the league again organized and competed until 1951 when it merged with the Sunset League to form the Southwest International League. Chihuahua Dorados joined the league towards the end in 1952, winning 57 and losing 83, finishing 27 and 1/2 games out of first. Though the team did not win as many games as expected, they drew an impressive 130,329 fans in 70 home games in 1952; out drawing every other team in the league by double. The Central Mexican League 1956-57 The Central Mexican League was a class C operation which lasted two seasons, 1956 and 1957. The six-team circuit was very offense-friendly and ERAs over 8 were about as common as ERAs under 3.50. Both the City of Juarez and Chihuahua represented the state of Chihuahua Mexico. In 1956 the great pitcher Marte de Alejandro propelled Chihuahua to a second-place finish behind the Saltillo Saraperos by only a half game, with an astounding 129 strikeouts and 18 victories in the short season of only 100 games. Both teams had equal records on the last day of the season, yet a loss by Chihuahua and a forfeit by Saltillo's opponent gave the crown to the Saraperos. Chihuahua's manager Manuel Arroyo was furious, and promised a local paper that the Dorados would win in 1957, which they did. 1957 marked the Gold men's first crown outright, posting a 62 and 38 record behind the great pitching of Antonio Dicochea, 17 wins and 157 Strikeouts. Arizona–Mexico League 1958 In 1955 the Arizona–Texas League became the Arizona–Mexico League. The circuit continued only four more seasons before the class C league bid adieu to baseball. During these four seasons more than 1,700,000 fans went through the gate. The Cananea Mineros was the only team to win more than one league title, taking two back to back, in 1955 and 1956. They drew 347,247 fans those two years. Chihuahua joined the league for its final year in 1958. In 1958 the Dorados, skippered by Leonel Aldama, went 56 and 62 falling to fourth place, yet still leading the league in 58 with 59,917 fans in attendance. Mexican League 1973–1982 Returning to the Mexican League in 1973, Chihuahua, now under the name Centauros de Chihuahua in relation to a nickname for Pancho Villa, went 527 and 776. Never climbing above second place, the Centauros were a fan favorite drawing the most fans over the 10-year stretch. Independent Semi Pro State Baseball 1985–2002 For much of the next 20 years Chihuahua was without a professional team, instead a sponsored independent city team was organized to play against other independent teams in the surrounding area. Many college and high school players from the Texas-Louisiana league, along with stragglers form the now defunct Western League spent time playing among these teams gaining valuable experience and giving the crowds a great show. Some of the greatest imports from the US during this time were: pitcher Duke Richards later with the Alexandria Aces 19 wins and 3 losses, catcher Moose Edmunds from the Bend Bandits, .329 avg with 15 home runs and 4 steals of home (two coming in one game), outfielder George Wallace Johnson Jr 62 Stolen Bases, and Tim Leone cut from the Edinburg Roadrunners, was a heavy hitting first baseman who clubbed an amazing 40 home runs in one season for Chihuahua. Mexican League 2003–2010 2003 marked official talks and action to bring Chihuahua back into the LMB, along with its cousin Juarez. In 2007 The Mexican League announced the San Luis Potosí Tuneros were moving to the city of Chihuahua, where the team became known as the Dorados. The Tuneros finished out of the playoffs in 2007 with an overall record of 49-61, which ranked 15th among 16 Liga teams in attendance. Just over 68,000 fans turned out for games in San Luis Potosí for an average of about 1,200 fans per game. Only the perpetually cash-strapped Campeche Piratas did worse at the gate. Although the Tuneros never won an LMB pennant in San Luis, the old Chihuahua Dorados failed to even make the Mexican League playoffs in twelve seasons in the 1970s and 1980s. The new Dorados featured such holdovers from the Tuneros as Sharnol Adriana, Darryl Brinkley and Pat O'Sullivan. As the Liga's most northwesterly city after Tijuana, the Dorados remained in the LMB Northern Division until 2010.

He designed and built more churches and hospitals than any other architect.Copper Country Architects-Erhard Brielmaier Erhard Brielmaier History Brielmaier was born in Neufra near Rottweil, Württemberg. His mother immigrated to America with Brielmaier and his siblings in 1850 to join their father, a carpenter who had settled in White Oak, Ohio. On November 27, 1860, Brielmaier married Theresia Haag and they had 13 children. In 1873, the clan moved to Milwaukee, where Brielmaier worked his way from carpenter, sculptor, and altar-builder to that of an architect with a national reputation. Brielmaier's sons (Bernard Anselm, Joseph Mary, and Leo Anthony) received training in architecture, and with them he formed the organization of Erhard Brielmaier & Sons Co., Architects, which constructed over a thousand Catholic churches, schools and hospitals throughout the United States and Canada.Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada-Erhard Brielmaier Brielmaier had architecture offices in Chicago and Milwaukee in the late 19th century and 20th century. Brielmaier and Sons focused on the architecture of churches, hospitals (such as the Mayo Clinic Hospital), and schools and university buildings (such as Marquette University). In the Milwaukee area there are about 30 buildings by Brielmaier and his sons designated with historical status. One of the most notable is the Basilica of St. Josaphat in Milwaukee, which was based on St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It was designed with conservation in mind by using the materials from the dismantled federal building in Chicago. The Chicago federal building's postal emblems appear as brass ornaments on the entrance doors. At the time it was constructed, St. Josaphat's had the fifth largest cupola in the world. It was later designated a basilica. Saint Anthony of Padua Catholic Church, on Ninth and Mitchell in Milwaukee, is another historical church whose interior was designed by Brielmaier. The interior of the church is still original with the high altar, four side altars, and the pulpit having been designed and crafted by Brielmaier. Brielmaier was concerned with the education of his children who followed the Brielmaier tradition and become artists. His oldest son, John (Johannes) Erhard Brielmaier (September 4, 1861-September 9, 1913), studied wood sculpturing in Stuttgart. Johannes's artwork is found throughout the United States, mostly in altars and sculptures. His artworks are known for their depth and elaborate carvings of magnificent detail. Brielmaier's daughter, Clotilde Elizabeth Brielmaier (March 4, 1867-March 29, 1915), spent several years in Munich and Rome studying art. Her artwork can be viewed in Europe as well as the United States. She is credited with being the first woman to own her own art studio in the United States and was credited as being an artist that could easily stand on her own alongside the male artists of her time. Many of Clotilde Brielmaier's paintings, especially the murals in chapels and churches, have been destroyed over the years, either because of natural disaster or through the simplification policy of the Catholic Church. Some of her large portraits can be found in historical museums in the United States. The generation of Brielmaier artists following their grandfather, Erhard Brielmaier, include: Thomasita Fessler, who was born Majella Nicola Fessler on February 23, 1912 and died April 1, 2005. Sr. Thomasita established the art department at Cardinal Stritch College, becoming the chair of the art department ands founding the Studio San Damiano based on her philosophy of \\"Nature is God's art and art is man's nature\\" as well as the Brielmaier tradition of, \\"A child who learns to create will not destroy.\\" Carl (Mary) R. Brielmaier (grandson of Erhard) continued the church painting tradition. Carl was born May 12, 1892. He left his immediate family before a teen and studied with Clothilde Brielmaier. Carl was known to use many different names within his life and work, including the name Erhard so the extent of artwork credited to him is variable. Much of the church painting he is known to have created is within the Midwestern United States, mostly in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio. Carl Brielmaier passed down the family's art tradition to his daughter, Rose Brielmaier. He died in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Milwaukee, where both the historic Gothic Revival style gate house and Romanesque chapel were designed by him.

It is most often performed on weight machines because reducing the weight quickly is thought by some to be extremely important, but it can also be performed with dumbbells and other free weights. History The approach of reducing resistance during sets was described in the late 1940s by Henry Atkins, editor of Body Culture magazine, who called it the multi-poundage system. In the 1980s, drop sets formed part of Joe Weider's Weider System. Example While performing a biceps curl, the person lifting the weight would start with a 25 pound dumbbell and do as many repetitions as possible without significantly compromising form. Then a 20-pound weight would be used until exhaustion is reached. One could continue to \\"drop\\" down as many times as he or she wishes, but usually the weight is not dropped to below fifty percent of his/her one rep maximum. Variations There are many variations possible while using the same basic concept of reducing the weight used. One way is to do a specified number of repetitions at each weight (without necessarily reaching the point of muscle failure) with an increase in the number of repetitions each time the weight is reduced. The amount or percentage of weight reduced at each step is also one aspect of the method with much variety. A wide drop set method is one in which a large percentage (usually 30% or more) of the starting weight is shed with each weight reduction. A tight drop set would remove anywhere from 10% to 25%. These definitions are somewhat arbitrary, of course, and not everyone will agree on the exact definitions. Effects In adults in their 50s, 12 weeks of drop- set training conducted thrice-weekly can improve muscle mass, muscle strength, muscle endurance and tasks of functionality. Drop set usage can increase the hypertrophic response to resistance training. Some researchers have reported mixed or inconclusive findings. Cautions As it is very easy to \\"over train\\" with drop sets , it is highly recommended that no more than one to two drop sets be done per muscle group on any given workout. This technique is also not recommended as a long term regimen. The primary focus on drop setting is to \\"shock\\" the muscles by adding stress, thus incentivizing additional hypertrophy. Other names Drop sets and the technique also go by the names breakdowns, burnouts, descending sets, triple-drops (when a total of three different weights are used), down the rack or running the rack (when using dumbbells), up the stack (because with a weight machine, the pin is moved up the stack of plates with each drop in weight), strip sets (when you \\"strip\\" weights off the ends of a bar), or the stripping technique (so called because of \\"stripping\\" weight plates off with each drop in weight).

Education  Maltzahn was educated at Eton College where he took up the sport of rowing, Oxford Brookes University and Kellogg College, Oxford where he studied Architectural History.  The Boat Race  Whilst at Oxford University, Maltzahn was a member of Oxford University Boat Club and took part in the Boat Race in 2005. Both universities had extremely strong intakes that year, with Cambridge boasting several world champions and the Oxford crew including Olympic silver medallist Barney Williams. Oxford, with Maltzahn at four, won the epic contest by 2 lengths in a time of 16 minutes 42 minutes.  International Rowing Career  Maltzahn won his first senior international vest in 2001. He sat in the four seat of the Great Britain Eight, which finished fifth in the final of the Rowing World Championships in Lucerne. He stroked the Eight in 2002 at the championships in Seville.

As Kellogg College does not have its own boat club, Maltzahn was able to choose which college he wished to row for, and asked the Oxford University Rowing Clubs (OURCs) to grant him membership of the Christ Church Boat Club – for whom his Oxford and Great Britain crewmate Robin Bourne-Taylor competed. In 2005, with Maltzahn in the stroke seat, Christ Church Men's 1st VIII won blades. Subsequently the OURCs have agreed that all members of Kellogg College are automatically eligible to row for Christ Church.

It is the largest high school in the Missoula County Public Schools District. Hellgate has approximately 1200 students, and a faculty of approximately 100. It is an AA high school, the classification given to Montana's largest high schools. It was ranked Montana's ninth-best high school by US News in 2014. History Knight: Hellgate Mascot First established in 1908 as Missoula County High School, the school was later renamed Hellgate High, shortly after the foundation of Sentinel High School. Hellgate is one of the oldest high school buildings in the State of Montana. It is a three-story building blending several different forms of architecture, with a network of tunnels. On September 24, 1952, the morning after giving his Checkers speech, Republican vice-presidential candidate Richard Nixon spoke at the school. He denied that politics was a dirty game, and stated that if students thought it was, they should get involved and clean it up. The name Hellgate High School was not used until well after the building now known as Sentinel High School opened in 1956. Originally, what is now known as Sentinel was to be the new Missoula County High School replacing what is now known as Hellgate. As Missoula grew, classes were slowly returned to the Hellgate building, the 9th graders, then the 10th graders. In the mid‑1960s, Hellgate and Sentinel were created as separate four‑year high schools, with all the old team names going to Sentinel, and the new team names (pages, squires, and knights) were created with all new traditions. Before Sentinel opened, Missoula County High School was the only public high school in Missoula, with Frenchtown High School the only other public high school in the County. Hellgate is named for Hellgate Canyon, a passage carved by the Clark Fork River through the mountains where Blackfeet warriors would lay in wait for the Salish. French trappers called the canyon ', translated as \\"\\". Hell Gate Canyon remained a dangerous site until 1855, when the Flatheads and Blackfeet signed a treaty. Hellgate High School Programs Academic In 2007, the Hellgate Academic WorldQuest team received first place in the state competition, and second in the nation. The team returned to nationals in 2010 and 2014. Music Hellgate High Schools successful music programs send many band, orchestra, choir, and jazz students to the All-Northwest and All-State programs each year. Choir In 1997, the Choir Director received the Milken Family Foundation's National Educator Award. In 2014, Hellgate's choir was selected to sing at Carnegie Hall. Missoula Youth Choir Formed in 1987 by founders David Heidel and Dean Peterson, for the sole purpose of performing at the first International Choral Festival, the Missoula Youth Choir () has performed at every Festival since. is composed of select high school students from Missoula's public high schools. conductors are local Missoula high school directors who have collaborated on many school festival and concerts. Band John Combs, the school's former band director, who , serves as the fine arts supervisor for Missoula County Public Schools, was named outstanding music educator in both Montana and the Rocky Mountain West in 2010.

Radomski (born 1969) is a former batboy and clubhouse employee, colloquially known by players as Murdock, for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball from 1985 to 1995. On April 27, 2007, he pleaded guilty in United States district court to money laundering and illegal distribution of anabolic steroids, human growth hormone, Clenbuterol, amphetamines and other drugs to \\"dozens of current and former Major League Baseball players, and associates, on teams throughout Major League Baseball.\\" Radomski faced a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. He was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to pay a fine of $18,575, due to his cooperation with the federal government and the Mitchell Report. Players' reactions Several former members of the New York Mets were quoted in the April 28, 2007 edition of The New York Times as remembering Radomski. Dave Magadan, former hitting coach for the Boston Red Sox and former Met from 1986–1992, was quoted as saying \\"He was huge, I mean huge\\" in reference to Radomski's physical build. Howard Johnson, former hitting coach for the Mets, and former third baseman from 1985-1993 was quoted as saying \\"He was a clubhouse kid, one of several, one of the kids that were there,\\" when asked about Radomski. Ron Darling, former pitcher for the Mets from 1983-1991 had no recollection of the former team employee. Reaction of the New York Mets On April 26, 2007, the New York Mets issued a statement on behalf of the entire organization prior to the start of the team's game with the Washington Nationals at RFK Stadium: > We were surprised and disappointed to learn of the guilty plea today. The > conduct in question is diametrically opposed to the values and standards of > the Mets organization and our owners. We are and always have been adamantly > opposed to the use of performance-enhancing drugs and continue to support > Major League Baseball's efforts to eradicate any such use in our game. Reaction of former Mets general manager Steve Phillips Steve Phillips, former general manager of the Mets from 1997–2003, and former analyst for ESPN's Baseball Tonight, wrote an article in reference to Radomski's guilty plea, where he stated: Mitchell Report Radomski was a prominent witness in former United States Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell's investigation into the use of performance-enhancing substances in Major League Baseball. Bases Loaded Radomski authored a book in January 2009 titled Bases Loaded – The inside story of the steroid era by the central figure in the Mitchell Report. In this book, he names and describes many of his relationships with Major League Baseball players, his steroid sales, and his interactions with Mitchell and Jeff Novitzki.

Early life Author James Warren The last of eight children, Sean Ensign was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. From an early age, he learned to appreciate the value and beauty of music. Ensign taught himself to play the piano. He took every chance that presented itself to sing. However, it was not until he began writing his own songs that he was able to fully express himself emotionally and artistically. Before releasing his first album, Ensign worked as a professional hospital intensive care nurse and as a male fitness model. Since retiring from music in 2013, Sean is now working as a nurse anesthetist in Minneapolis, Minnesota. While under the pen name James Warren (named after his late father), Sean also wrote a fan-fiction novel called \\"Lost\\" based on the 1970s and 1990s Sid & Marty Krofft television series \\"Land of the Lost\\". This adaption (or reboot) retells the story of the Marshall family epic adventures while trapped in another dimension with dinosaurs and dangerous creatures. Currently, he is working on an audio version of his first book and writing the second novel entitled, \\"Darkness.\\" Cover of Jame's first Land of the Lost Fan Fiction Book series book. Career Ensign started on the road to becoming a successful singer and songwriter after being signed to the label, Titan Sounds. He soon began to make waves in the music world, particularly, the Club/Dance music industry. His debut single, \\"It's My Life (Finally)\\" peaked at No. 35 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play and No. 21 on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. The follow-up single, \\"Without You\\" saw greater success peaking at No. 4 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play. Both songs are from his debut album, Finally which blends Hi-NRG music songs with passionate ballads. He also covered the Ace of Base song, \\"Everytime It Rains.\\" Ensign's third single \\"Everytime It Rains\\" is in the works with an acoustic ballad version and many Club/Dance remixes done by other producers including Hex Hector for the CD single. The remixes are being sent to DJs and clubs in both Europe and the United States. Sean released eight singles from his first studio album, all of which charted on various music charts around the world. All the releases included several remixes by famous DJs and music producers including Hex Hector, The Electric Allstars, and 7th Heaven Productions. Sean began working on a second studio album entitled, \\"Feel the Music,\\" but due to the continued unauthorized downloads of his music and the loss of revenue from those sales, he retired (at least for now) from the music industry.

He served in the Royal Navy from the early 20th century through most of the Second World War. During the First World War, he was an integral part of the Naval Intelligence Division in its early years. Family James was the son of Major W.C. James of the 16th Lancers and his wife Effie, daughter of the painter John Everett Millais. He was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond and HMS Britannia. Bubbles The five-year-old James in Bubbles As a child, James sat as a subject for several paintings by his grandfather, Millais. The most well-known of these is Bubbles, in which the five-year-old William is shown gazing enraptured at a bubble he has just blown. When the painting was used in an advertisement for Pears soap, it became famous. The image dogged James throughout his life, and he was regularly nicknamed \\"Bubbles\\".H.M.S. Hood Crew Information- Biography of Admiral William Milbourne James Naval career James pursued a career in the Royal Navy, rising to hold a number of important positions. Following early service on the training ship HMS Britannia, he was confirmed in the rank of sub-lieutenant on 15 April 1901. He was posted to the destroyer HMS Skate on 7 October 1902, and promoted to lieutenant later the same year, when in November he was posted to the battleship HMS Venerable, on her first commission, to the Mediterranean Fleet. He achieved the rank of commander in 1913. During the First World War he served as executive officer aboard the battlecruiser HMS Queen Mary, leaving the ship a day before it sailed to its doom at the Battle of Jutland.Liddell Hart Centre for Military ArchivesBattle of Jutland Memoir He was flag-commander to Vice Admiral Sir Frederick Doveton Sturdee, commanding the 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet in HMS Benbow from 1916 to 1917. Later in the war he assisted William Reginald Hall, the Director of Naval Intelligence, eventually becoming deputy director. Hall and James worked together in \\"Room 40\\" which decrypted a number of crucial enemy signals relating to the Battle of Jutland, the plans of Roger Casement and the Zimmermann Telegram. At one point James ran Room 40 on Hall's behalf. James related some of the events in his biography of Hall, published in 1955.James, W, The Eyes of the Navy. A Biographical Study of Admiral Sir Reginald Hall, Methuen, 1955. In the inter-war years, James first served in the China Station as commander of HMS Curlew and local chief of staff from 1921 to 1922. From 1923, he was Deputy Director at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and Director in 1925. In 1926 he returned as flag captain of HMS Royal Sovereign. He went on to be Naval Assistant to the First Sea Lord in 1927, Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet in 1929 and Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet in 1930. In 1932 he took command of the Battlecruiser Squadron, which he controlled from . He was made vice admiral in 1933 and from 1935 to 1938 he was Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff and a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty. He was honoured with a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. From 1938 James was a full admiral. During the Second World War, James served as Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth from 1939. In 1940 he commanded Operation Ariel, the evacuation of British troops from Brittany and Normandy, a parallel operation to the Dunkirk evacuation. In 1942 he was appointed as Chief of Naval Information, in charge of coordinating naval publicity. James was elected in 1943 as Conservative Member of Parliament for the constituency of Portsmouth North, which he held until 1945. He retired from the Navy in 1944. Retirement Following his retirement from public life, James was active in support for ventures relating to seafaring, supporting clubs such as the Elie and Earlsferry Sailing Club, which named their dinghy Bubbles in his honour.Elie and Earelferry Sailing Club Most of his retirement was dedicated to his writings on aspects of British naval history. Writings In addition to his biography of Hall, he published books and articles on other aspects of his wartime experiences, including an account of Winston Churchill's attitudes to naval affairs in Churchill by His Contemporaries. Other publications on naval matters included: *New battleship organisations and notes for Executive Officers (1916) *Songs of the sailor men (1916) *The British Navy in adversity: a study of the American War of Independence (1926) *Blue water and green fields (1939) *Admiral Sir William Fisher (1943) *The Portsmouth letters (1946) *The British Navies in the Second World War (1946) *The durable monument: Horatio Nelson (1948) *The influence of sea power on the history of the British people (1948) *Old oak : the life of Sir John Jervis, Earl of Vincent (1950) *The sky was always blue (1951) *The eyes of the navy: a biographical study of Admiral Sir Reginald Hall (1955) *A great seaman: the life of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Henry Oliver (1956) His most notable non-Naval publication was The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais told for the first time in their unpublished letters (1947), a collection of family letters detailing the romance between his grandparents. His grandmother Effie Gray had been married to John Ruskin when she fell in love with Millais. Her first marriage was annulled, due to non-consummation. James was the first to publish the full details of these events and to vindicate his grandmother, whose victimisation by the Ruskin family he documented. James's book has been the inspiration for at least two plays.The Order of Release;The Countess .

A right-handed pitcher, he appeared in 385 games, largely in relief, for the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds and Chicago White Sox. Brosnan was listed as tall and .Schudel, Matt (July 6, 2014) \\"Big league pitcher's books offered inside accounts of baseball\\", The Washington Post, page C8 Retrieved September 4, 2017 During his career, Brosnan was known as an intellectual, for keeping books in his locker to read and for his personal habits of puffing on a pipe while wearing his glasses, reading books during games. His teammates often referred to him as \\"The Professor\\". He attended Xavier University. Early life Brosnan was born on October 24, 1929 in Cincinnati. His father worked as a lathe operator for a milling company. His mother encouraged the pursuit of education and the arts and Brosnan spent little time engaged in athletics. He graduated from Elder High School, located in the Price Hill neighborhood of Cincinnati. Eventually, his height led him to sports and he played for the local American Legion baseball team. By the age of 17 Brosnan had joined the Chicago Cubs minor league baseball organization. His time there was interrupted by a two-year enlistment in the Army where he pitched for the military baseball team on Fort Meade, Maryland. After his enlistment was over, Brosnan returned to the Cubs organization. Baseball career In 1954, the Cubs brought Brosnan to the major leagues where he pitched poorly. As a result, he was returned to the Cubs minor league affiliate in Los Angeles where he won 17 games and had a 2.38 ERA. In 1956 the Cubs brought him back to the major leagues where he stayed until his retirement.Goldsborough, Bob (July 11, 2014) \\"Jim Brosnan, big league pitcher and author, dies\\", Chicago Tribune Retrieved September 4, 2017 Brosnan pitched with mixed success in Chicago where his record was 14−18 before he was traded to St Louis Cardinals and then to the Cincinnati Reds where he enjoyed success as a relief pitcher. Relying on a good fastball and slider, Brosnan enjoyed a career best season with the Reds in 1960 when he compiled an 8–3 record and a 2.36 ERA. In 1961 the Reds won the National League pennant and played the New York Yankees in the World Series, Brosnan's only post-season appearance. The Reds, facing a formidable Yankees team led by Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, lost in five games. Brosnan was traded to the Chicago White Sox in 1963 where he finished his career. By then, he had published his first book, The Long Season, which led to considerable controversy, and the White Sox, not wanting any more distractions, wrote a clause in his contract forbidding him to write any more books. Brosnan declined the contract and retired from baseball instead. Author While known as a moderately effective pitcher, both as a starter and a reliever, Brosnan gained greater fame by becoming one of the first athletes to publish a candid personal diary. Up to that point such books were \\"sanitized\\" for the general public and used ghostwriters. Instead, Brosnan's book, The Long Season, a season which found him being traded from St. Louis to Cincinnati around the halfway point of the 1959 baseball season, touched on the subjects of racial awareness, boredom, fatigue, and skirt-chasing by players, as well as the never ending stress of trying to maintain a position on the big league roster. Two years later, Brosnan again kept a diary, a fortuitous circumstance as the Reds would win the National League championship in 1961, before falling to the New York Yankees in the World Series. Brosnan's book was published under the appropriate title Pennant Race. Brosnan's books garnered both praise and criticism. Pulitzer-prize winning columnist Red Smith praised The Long Season as \\"...caustic and candid, and, in a way, courageous.\\" Others, such as Joe Garagiola famously called Brosnan a \\"kooky beatnik.\\" Writing in the Chicago Tribune in July 1960, then-White Sox president Bill Veeck acknowledged that The Long Season was \\"delightful\\" but that \\"Brosnan has his say about many who may have, in times past, had their say about him. This just doesn't seem to come off so well, and tends to lessen the impact and enjoyment of his undeniably colorful material. Post career After his playing days, Brosnan continued writing and also became a sportscaster. He worked for several years as a sports anchor in the Chicago area and delivered sportscasts for the Chicago-area radio station WFYR. Brosnan also wrote for a broad range of publications, including Boys' Life, Sport, Sports Illustrated, Playboy, Esquire and the Chicago Tribune Magazine. Brosnan's subjects extended far beyond baseball. In a December 1966 article in the Tribune magazine titled \\"Lo, the Impudent Bird!\\" Brosnan wrote a story about his resistance to hunting, a sport enjoyed by many of his friends. Brosnan also wrote books for boys, including Little League to Big League, Great Baseball Pitchers and Great Rookies of the Major Leagues. During the June 13, 1966 episode of To Tell The Truth, Brosnan appeared as himself; none of the panelists correctly picked him as the contestant. Death and legacy Brosnan died at the age of 84 while in hospice in Park Ridge, Illinois. At the time of his death he was recovering from a stroke when sepsis set in. His survivors include three children, Jamie Kruidenier of Champaign, Illinois, Tim Brosnan of Morton Grove, Illinois, and Kimberly Brosnan-Myers, of Philadelphia, as well as a brother and four grandchildren. Brosnan's first book, The Long Season, was named by Sports Illustrated as the 19th best sports book of all time and credited the work as serving as a model for Jim Bouton's book Ball Four, Jerry Kramer's book Instant Replay, and many other first-person sports memoirs. > \\"The Long Season not merely changed everything, it remains, decades later, > the best of its kind.\\" -- Washington Post book critic Jonathan Yardley Brosnan was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2007.\\"Shrine of the Eternals – Inductees\\".

The Sneeuberg: A new centre of floristic endemism on the Great Escarpment, South Africa. South African Journal of Botany. pp 196 – 238. They are geologically part of the Karoo System and fall within the Karoo semi-arid climatic region. As their name suggests, the mountains have frigid winters, with occasional snowfalls during strong cold fronts. Summers are hot with some late afternoon thunderstorms. The highest peak, called Kompasberg (2502m) (Afrikaans for Compass Mountain), is north of the small village of Nieu-Bethesda and dominates all surrounding areas with its prominent steep-sided height. Geology Map of the Sneeuberge in the District of Graaff-Reinet, reflecting the political boundaries of 1795 The Sneeuberg's underlying rock consists mostly of dolerite sill, dyke, basin, laccolith and rock sheets that have intruded into the older Beaufort Group sandstone and mudstone of the Karoo Supergroup. Metamorphic rock made up of hornfels and quartzite are found along the contact zones between the sedimentary strata and the dolerite intrusions. Sneeuberg's four major peaks all stand as pyramids above the 2100 m plateau. The highest peaks are found in the Great Escarpment west of the Eastern Cape Drakensberg. The 2504 m high Compassberg is one of the highest free-standing peaks outside of the Drakensberg Massif and Lesotho Highlands in Southern Africa. The four peaks are all generally capped with angular boulders believed to have been formed by mechanical weathering from frost action. The range forms a mountain arc that stretches about 200 km in length. From west to east, it is made up of the Onder-Sneeuberg, Kamdebooberge, Meelberg, Koudeveldberge, Toorberg, Winterhoekberge, Compassberg, Lootsberg, Renosterberg, AgterRenosterberg, Wapadsberg, Nardousberg, Tandjiesberg, Coetzeesberg, Bankberg, Aasvoëlkrans, Groot Bruintjieshoogde and Boschberg. The mountain range is separated from the Nuweveldberge (the western Great Escarpment) by Nelspoort Interval formed by the Gouritz–Kariega drainage basin, and by the Great Fish River valley from the Great Winterberg–Amatola mountains (the eastern Great Escarpment). Vegetation Psoralea margaretiflora, an endemic plant of the Sneeuberge The area is a meeting place for several biomes because of the major climatic, topographic and geological changes. These are namely the grassland, Nama Karoo, forest, Albany thickets, azonal and fynbos biome. In 2008, Sneeuberge was home to 1195 flora species. 107 (9%) were alien species, 33 (2.8%) were endemic and 13 (1.1%) were near-endemic. Five species previously reported as Drakensberg Alpine Centre pervasive plants are now known to occur in the Sneeuberg. Situated close to the Cape Floristic Region, a centre of endemism, Sneeuberge is a subcentre for endemism, featuring several pervasive plant species. The mountain's primary land-use was previously largely livestock grazing because of its richness in grass species. The grasslands situated in higher altitudes is used for cattle and the shrublands in lower altitudes are used for sheep and goats.Nordenstam, B, Clark, VR, Devos, N and Barker, NP. 2009. Two new species of Euryops (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) from the Sneeuberg, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. South African Journal of Botany. pp 145 – 152.

The first matches took place in Selanik, now known as Thessaloniki, in 1875. F.C. Smyrna was the first football club established in Turkey. The same men brought football from İzmir to Istanbul in 1895. The first competitive matches between İzmir and Istanbul clubs took place in 1897, 1898, 1899, and 1904. The İzmir team won every match.Sivritepe, Erdinç Before the Turkish leagues turkish-soccer.com, accessed 21 June 2010 Early years (1875–1958) Fuat Hüsnü Kayacan, the first ever Turkish football player. The first Turkish man to play the sport was a soldier on assignment in İzmir in 1898. The first teams in the Ottoman Empire consisted of Greek, Armenian and English players. The first club made up of Turkish footballers was Black Stockings FC, in 1899. Police of the Ottoman Empire invaded the pitch, arresting as many players as they could catch. Cadi Keuy FRC, Moda FC, Elpis, and Imogene FC followed the precedent set by Black Stockings. The first competitive league was created in 1904. Based in Istanbul and titled the \\"Constantinople Football League\\", it consisted the four aforementioned clubs (Cadi Keuy FRC, Moda FC, Elpis, and Imogene FC). However, Turkish players were still prohibited to compete. In the following years, clubs such as Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray (Still-active Turkish club with the oldest football team. Despite Beşiktaş was founded in 1903, they started football activities in 1911) were founded with Turkish players. The league was also known as the Sunday League because the matches took place on Sunday. Two teams from the Ottoman Empire competed in football at the 1906 Intercalated Games: Smyrna and Thessaloniki. Both clubs lost heavily to Denmark and Athens, losing 5-1 and 5-0 respectively. However, Athens withdrew from the second place match, allowing Smyrna to compete against Thessaloniki. Smyrna won 3–0, winning the silver medal. Another league was created in Istanbul in 1912. The league was called The Friday League, and the clubs played their matches on Friday. The league was made up of Darülfünun S.K., İstanbul J.K. (later known as Türk İdman Ocağı, who became Trabzonspor in 1967), Anadolu S.K., Sanayii F.K., Şehremini S.K., and Fenerbahçe S.K. (II). The Sunday League remained the dominant league until the 1915–16 season, when both leagues merged. Turkey national football team squad in 1929. The İstanbul Türk İdman Birliği was created by Beşiktaş in 1919. The league was not allowed to join the Friday League. Later on, in 1922, the Türkiye İdman Cemiyetleri İttifakı was founded. The league was made up of clubs from various cities throughout Turkey. The league helped create the Turkish Football Federation on 23 April 1923 as Futbol Hey'et-i Müttehidesi. In the same year the Turkey national football team played its first ever international match against Romania. Leagues were being created in other cities such as Adana, Ankara, Eskişehir, İzmir, and Trabzon. The Milli Küme was created in 1937 as a competition between the top clubs from Ankara, Istanbul, and İzmir. The competition lasted until 1950. The first professional leagues were established in 1952 in the big three cities. The first national professional league was created in 1959, known as the Milli Lig. After the creation of the second and third divisions, professional leagues outside of the national league became amateur competitions. The Milli Lig (National league) was first held in 1959 with clubs from Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir. Qualification took place in 1958 to decide who would take part in the sixteen club, two group league. Fenerbahçe were the champions of the first Milli Lig, with Metin Oktay of Galatasaray finishing top scorer.

This was an all-new design from Walter Rethel, sharing nothing with his other fighter designs for Arado of the late 1920s. It was a conventional unequal-span, staggered biplane, with the slightly gulled top wing attached to the upper fuselage. It was equipped with a single, large float under the fuselage and two outrigger floats near the wingtips. After evaluation at Travemünde, the floats were removed and a simple, wheeled undercarriage was fitted for competitive evaluation with the Heinkel HD 38 at Lipetsk. The Heinkel was selected, and the SSD I was relegated to trainer duties with the LVS in 1932. Specifications References * * World Aircraft Information Files. Brightstar Publishing, London.

Son of Jean Joseph Poncet and Catherine Jeanne Chabalier, he was inspired by his grandfather Jean-Pierre Antoine Chabalier, surgeon in the Imperial Army. He studied medicine in Lyon, where he served as interne des hôpitaux. He was a member of the Lyon ambulance corps during the Franco-Prussian War, and in 1878 became a member of the surgical section of the Lyon faculty of medicine. In 1883 he attained the chair of operative medicine in Lyon. With Louis Léopold Ollier, Poncet is credited for introducing aseptic practices to Hôtel-Dieu. A rare form of polyarthritis that occurs in patients with tuberculous infection is named after him, and is called \\"Poncet's disease\\".

The Order had fourteen founding members who were nobles and military leaders of the Holy Roman Empire: * Duke of Württemberg-Oels * Prince Piccolomini * Count von Clary und Aldringen * Baron von Eib * Ritter Fachner von Trauenstein * Keck von Schwarzbach * Count von Kollowrat-Krakowsky * Baron von Milchling * Baron Moser von Filseck * Count von Nostitz * Baron Reichlin von Meldegg * Wiedersperger von Wiedersperg * Baron von Zobel von Giebelstadt Having seen the consequences of ongoing religious wars in Europe, the Order's founders dedicated themselves to \\"worship the Supreme Being, show tolerance towards all religions, loyalty towards their princes, support the needs of their military, the poor, widows and orphans.\\" [Perrot: 1821]. The Order was uniquely composed of both Protestant and Catholic nobles and leaders at a time when religion violently divided Europe and the German states within the Holy Roman Empire, and other knightly orders allied themselves exclusively with one faith or the other. When the Order was founded in 1755, it was originally with the name \\"The Knights of the Order of Jonathan, Defenders of the Honour of Divine Providence\\". In 1767 the reference to Jonathan was removed from the name. Finally, in 1785 a further change was made, and the Order's constitution was revised by the General Chapter to rename it \\"The Equestrian, Secular and Chapterial Order of Saint Joachim\\". Albert Pike, prominent American Mason and American Civil War general, associated the Order of Saint Joachim with Illuminati-related Enlightenment societies. In his 1883 work, \\"A Historical Inquiry In Regard To The Grand Constitutions Of 1786\\", he stated that the disbanded Illuminati continued on through the various branches of the Rosicrucian Order, including the later versions of the Gold Rosicrucians, namely, the Order of Perfect Initiates of Asia, or the Asiatic Brethren, and the various Orders of Light, specifically mentioning \\"The Order of Saint Joachim (St. Jonathan)\\". However, having been founded in 1755, The Order of Saint Joachim pre-existed the Illuminati. Records show that a few Illuminati were members of the early Order of Saint Joachim, specifically Count von Kollowrat-Krakowsky, as well as Freemasons and Rosicrucians. The Order of Saint Joachim had direct connection to the Gülden und Rosenkreuzer (Gold Rosicrucians), founded in 1777, which also had Illuminati and Masonic roots. The Gold Rosicrucians was Hermetic in character, drawing heavily on Eastern and Islamic mysticism. The Gold Rosicrucians was headed by Johann Karl Baron von Ecker und Eckhoffen, who in 1787 was Chancellor of The Order of Saint Joachim. Baron von Ecker und Eckhoffen is named as a member of several other mystic societies, including the Christian Masonry of Bohemia in 1756, and the Asiatic Brethren.http://www.loge-carl-zum-felsen.de/entstehung.html The Order of Saint Joachim was recognized in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by several contemporary sovereigns and states. Leopold II, King of Hungary and Bohemia (later Holy Roman Emperor) formally acknowledged and sanctioned the wearing of the insignia of the Order on May 23, 1790 with a document of Royal Concession. He appointed the Comte Christian von Leiningen, a knight of The Order of Saint Joachim and relative of the Grand Master, to be Chamberlain of the Imperial Palace. On 27 April 1791 King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia issued a similar Royal Grant recognizing the legitimacy of the Order and permitting the wearing of the insignia of The Order of Saint Joachim on Prussian officers' military uniforms. 19th century Nathaniel Hone, R.A., 1777 In 1801, 'Sir' Levett Hanson wrote to Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson offering him membership of the order to recognize his victory at the Battle of the Nile. Following the review and approval of the English College of Arms, the King's Warrant approving the acceptance and wear of the insignia of the Order of Saint Joachim was granted.The Memoirs of The Life of Vice-Admiral Viscount Nelson, K.B., Thomas Joseph Pettigrew, London, 1849, pp. 665-6 Nelson was wearing the breast cross of the Order of Saint Joachim at the Battle of Trafalgar and is still seen on the famous \\"Trafalgar coat\\" in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, UK. Several other Englishmen later received the King's Warrant to accept the Order of Saint Joachim, including Nelson's brother, Viscount Merton, General Sir Charles Imhoff, May Issue - Obituaries p. 543. and Philippe d'Auvergne, Prince de Boullion, Rear Admiral of the Blue. pp. 107-8. In 1802, Hanson published An Accurate Historical Account of all the Orders of Knighthood at present existing in Europe casting the Order of Saint Joachim as equal to existing chivalric orders and dedicating the work to Nelson. Levett Hanson, Calendar of Knights; Containing Lists of Knights Bachelor, British Knights of Foreign Orders, Francis Townsend, Pursuivant of Arms, London, 1828 Knighthoods granted by The Order of Saint Joachim to British subjects and confirmed by the King's Warrant also entitled to holder to assume the title of 'Sir' as in the case of Sir Charles Imhoff where \\"King George the Third not only permitted Imhoff... to accept the insignia and rank of a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Joachim, but granted him at the same time leave to assume, in virtue of that foreign decoration, the titular distinction of a Knight of England.\\" In 1834 one critic - George Frederick Beltz, Lancaster Herald - claimed that the Order seemed to be domiciled wherever Hanson found himself, and that 'Knighthoods' were available to anyone with sufficient funds. \\"It was long understood,\\" he wrote, \\"that moyennant a certain not inconsiderable deposit at a banking house at Pall-mall, the distinction was at the service of any one who might have a fancy for it; and that letters-missive were soon forthcoming from 'Sir' Levett, containing due notification of election by the 'equestrian, secular and chapteral Order,' at its last sitting at Bamberg, Hamburgh, Lubeck or wherever that personage happened, at the time, to be domiciliated.\\"Review of the Chandos Peerage Case: Adjudicated 1803, and of the Pretensions of Sir Samuel-Egerton Brydges, Baronet, to Designate Himself Per Legem Terrae Baron Chandos of Sudeley, George Frederick Beltz, Lancaster Herald, Richard Bentley, London, 1834 Napoleon's brother-in-law, Joachim Murat (March 25, 1767 - October 13, 1815), a Marshal of France, usurped the grand mastership of the Order of Saint Joachim in 1806 when he was made the Grand Duke of the newly created \\"Duchy of Berg and Cleves\\". During his term as Grand Duke of Berg and Cleves (March 15, 1806 to August 1, 1808 when he left to become King of Naples) Joachim Murat declared himself the Grand Master of The Order of Saint Joachim, and expanded the Order to include members of the French Legion of Honour. His authority was never recognized by the rest of the Order in exile. Following the Treaty of Vienna, The Order of Saint Joachim continued to be associated with the House of Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha. Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (2 January 1784 - 29 January 1844) continued to award the Order of Saint Joachim. A letter from 1821 exists from a Dr. Joseph Romain Louis de Kirckhoff (also de Kerckhov) thanking Ernst I, Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha for awarding him the Order of Saint Joachim.http://www.stjoachimorder.org/images/SaxeCoburgGothaGM%20Letter1821.jpg His son, Ernest II, (21 June 1818 – 22 August 1893) is known to have included the Order's post-nominals \\"K.J.\\" among his awards and honours. Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria (26 February 1861 – 10 September 1948) a prince of the Koháry branch of the ducal family of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, was popularly pictured with the insignia of The Order of St Joachim in 1888, although the connection between the two is unknown. 1888 cigarette card published by Kinney Bros. Tobacco Co. from the series “International Cards” - N238 in Burdick ’s American Card Catalogue. 20th and 21st centuries In the early 19th century the order was said to have \\"enjoyed considerable recognition in the early 19th century, including support from the English College of Arms\\". However in the late 19th the Order had reportedly 'drifted into obscurity'. A manuscript dated November, 1892 is a translation by F.G. Irwin of a document in the Paris Arsenal Library of a French Masonic ceremony from the “Rite of Adoption Ritual of 35º Chevalieres of St Joachim.\\"https://www.stjoachimorder.org/history-of- the-order/the-enlightenment/ The ritual described is almost identical to the Order of Saint Joachim’s Ceremony of Investiture from the early 1800s. The French 35th Degree also has added Masonic-style floor work, wands for the officers, signs and a “secret” handshake which do not appear in the Order’s published ceremony. Because the French ceremony includes both men and women performing the ritual, it likely belongs to the French Grand Orient de France branch of Masonry. Of interest is the opening of the “Court” where it is stated that the reason for the gathering is for “the purpose of studying the Ritual and practices of Freemasonry and tracing its connection with the chivalric orders and the Rite of Adoption, and especially with the Order of Saint Joachim.” The Order of Saint Joachim was reorganized in 1929 as “politically neutral” and specifically rejecting any connection to Freemasonry or the earlier requirement and division of the Order into noble and non-noble classes. According to the official history of the Order published in 1948, The Order of Saint Joachim was forced to “go quiet” during the Nazi period in Germany, but its members maintained informal connections to one another.https://www.stjoachimorder.org/history-of-the-order/ From 1948 the Order was led by a \\"Reorganization Council\\" and in 1988 the Order was led by Helmut von Bräundle-Falkensee as Grand Master, until his death on 14 October 2007. Bräundle-Falkensee was an Austrian who was also founder and Secretary General of the Austrian Albert Schweitzer Society. After his death, a Canadian barrister named Stephen Lautens (b. 1959) was elected the new Grand Master. The Order has its Chapterhouse in England and additional Commanderies in the United States, Canada and Austria. It is registered as a charity in the UK (Registered Charity No. 1047873) and supports numerous causes including care for the homeless, ex-servicemen, hospitals and children's charities. In Canada, the Order is organized as a federal not-for-profit corporation, where its general charitable purpose is to promote religious tolerance, support the widows and orphans of war, refugees and indigent servicemen and women.. In Canada it also operates a charitable arm, The Noble Hearts Foundation (Charitable Registration Number: 83471 3000 RR0001).https://www.stjoachimorder.org/governance/canadian-commandery/ An exhibition displaying the heraldry of Admiral Nelson at the College of Arms in 2005 featured a replica of Nelson's uniform with its honorary blazons. Among the orders of merit worn by Nelson was the Order of St Joachim. The star, said the College of Arms incorrectly in its newsletter, was \\"the bogus Order of St. Joachim created and hawked around the Courts of Europe by 'Sir' Levett Hanson.\\"College of Arms Newsletter, December 2005, college-of-arms.gov.uk In a subsequent newsletter several months later, the editors issued a retraction: \\"The Order of St. Joachim referred to in the last issue,\\" said the College-of- Arms, \\"was not (as there stated) created by Levett Hanson, but dated back to an order founded in 1755 by a group of mostly German princes.\\"College of Arms Newsletter, March 2006, college-of-arms.gov.uk In the British Broadcasting Corporation 2010 project \\"A History of the World in 100 Objects\\", one of the objects chosen was the insignia of the Order of St. Joachim awarded to Philippe d'Auvergne, Vice Admiral of the Blue, in 1803.https://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/0JfsaZatRLmqHSzF7SCVmQ Status and legitimacy The Order of Saint Joachim did not owe its existence to a royal or noble house, or \\"fons honorum\\". Its founder and first Grand Master, Prince Christian Franz von Saxen-Coburg-Saalfeld, was the son of a sovereign duke, but never himself a ruler. The next three Grand Masters were sovereign rulers (Duke de Monfort followed by successive counts of Leinigen), and would technically qualify as a \\"fons\\". Instead of being a hereditary position, the grand mastership was elected by its members. Writing in 1828, English College of Arms Windsor Herald, Francis Townsend, Esq., FSA, stated: \\"This Order owes its foundation to no crowned head, but has been recognized both in Great Britain and abroad, as an Order of Knighthood.\\" p. XXV. The post-nominals of a Knight of the Order of Saint Joachim (\\"K.J.\\") were listed in \\"Debrett's Baronetage of England\\" between 1815, Vol. 1. and around 1840, and were similarly published in the 1832 \\"A Key to Both Houses of Parliament\\".

Davis (July 11, 1907 - July 18, 2000) was an American lawyer, law clerk, and law professor whose career included work on the defense team of Alger Hiss and ten years of service as the 14th Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United States from September 1, 1961 to August 31, 1970. Early life, education, and family John F. Davis was born on July 11, 1907, in Portland, Maine. His parents were Marshall Davis and Marguerite Gifford. He attended the public schools in Portland, graduating from high school in 1924. He attended Bates College, graduating in 1928 Phi Beta Kappa, and Harvard Law School, from which he obtained his law degree in 1932. He worked on the Harvard Law Review. Career Davis's first job was with Robb, Clark, and Bennet in New York City. Civil service In 1933, Davis became a government attorney at the United States Department of the Interior. In 1936, he briefly worked for a U.S. Senate committee investigating railroad finance, then moved to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). During World War II, he worked as counsel for the United States Coast Guard. Private law practice In 1947, Davis returned to private practice in Washington, DC. By 1948, he had become one of four partners in the law firm of Hilmer & Davis at 1700 I Street NW. Hiss case Davis is best remembered as one of the defense attorneys who represented accused Soviet espionage agent Alger Hiss before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1948 and at Hiss's two 1949–50 trials for perjury in the Southern District of New York. On August 25, 1948, Davis first appeared as counsel to Hiss on \\"Confrontation Day\\", when Hiss and Whittaker Chambers (who, under subpoena, had testified about Soviet underground networks he had run in Washington in the 1930s, including the Ware Group, of which Hiss was a member). In September 1948, he worked with William L. Marbury, Jr.. After the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury, Davis served on his defense team under Edward Cochrane McLean. After Hiss's conviction in January 1950, although Hiss worked for the rest of his life to prove his innocence, Davis (like Marbury and McLean) did not partake in those efforts. In 1974, Allen Weinstein interviewed Davis for his book Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case. According to Weinstein, Davis said that Hiss had contacted him in December 1948 about an \\"old typewriter\\" turned out to be the Woodstock typewriter used for scores of stolen documents that formed evidence during the two trials of Hiss in 1949. Davis also recommended that the Hiss defense team build an identical typewriter to prove \\"forgery by typewriter\\", but experts were unable to do so. Civil service again During the 1950s, Davis served as an assistant Solicitor General in the U.S. Department of Justice. He argued more than 50 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. These included a government antitrust case against the DuPont Company, which forced it to divest from General Motors Corporation of $2.5 Billion or 23% of GM stock. In 1961, Davis was appointed Clerk of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren, succeeding James R. Browning, who had been appointed to a federal judgeship by President Kennedy. As Clerk, Davis was responsible for maintaining the Court's docket and files. He also administered the oath of office to several new Justices, including Thurgood Marshall, the Court's first African American member, and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Davis served as Clerk of the Supreme Court until 1970, when he returned to private practice in Washington, also serving during the 1970s as a Special Master for the Supreme Court in two cases within the Court's original jurisdiction and co-authoring a law review article on the precedential effect of Supreme Court opinions approved by only a plurality (as opposed to a majority) of the Justices. Law School Davis also taught during the 1970s as a law professor at Georgetown University and later at the University of Maryland School of Law. He retired from the latter position in 1988. Personal and death In 1937, Davis married Valre Talley (died in 1978). He later married Jane Mason. He had two children, a son named Marcus and a daughter named Susan. He was a member of the American Law Institute. Davis died age 93 on July 18, 2000, exactly one week after his birthday, in Washington, DC. His survivors were his wife, son Marcus and daughter Susan, stepchildren Clint and Timothy Keeney Jr., five grandchildren, and five great- grandchildren. Lawyer, professor, and biographer G. Edward White is a son-in- law. Legacy A portrait of Davis hangs in the Supreme Court. Davis believed that Hiss was innocent of espionage.

He was the nephew of John Marshall. Early life and family Thomas Marshall was born June 7, 1801, in Frankfort, Kentucky.\\"Marshall, Thomas Francis\\". Biographical Directory of the United States Congress He was a son of Dr. Louis Marshall and the nephew of John Marshall.Biographical Cyclopedia, p. 271 Marshall received his early education from his parents. He then studied in Virginia under his uncle, James Marshall. Returning to Kentucky, he studied law under John J. Crittenden. He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Versailles, Kentucky in 1828. Political career Marshall attended the convention that drafted the 1830 Constitution of Virginia so that he could observe the debate among the delegates, which included his uncle John Marshall, John Randolph, James Madison, and James Monroe. Thereafter, he pursued politics, befriending Henry Clay and being elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1832. While a member of the House, he distinguished himself by a report denouncing the doctrine of nullification, as proposed by the state of South Carolina to the several states. He moved to Louisville, Kentucky in 1833 and resumed his legal practice, but his practice was again interrupted by election to the Kentucky House of Representatives, where he served until 1836. In 1837, Marshall sought election to the U.S. House of Representatives, but was defeated by incumbent William J. Graves. Embarrassed by the loss, he returned to Woodford County and was elected twice more to the state legislature, serving from 1838 to 1839. In 1841, he was elected a Whig to represent Kentucky's Tenth District in the U.S. House of Representatives. Although he was a frequent orator in that body, only two of his speeches were reported in the local newspapers owing to his admonition to reporters not to \\"pass on the public their infernal gibberish for my English\\". After publicly differing with Henry Clay on the issues of renewing the charter of the Second Bank of the United States and the annexation of Texas, he considered it futile to run for re-election in Clay's home district and declined to seek renomination to his seat in Congress. Marshall campaigned for James K. Polk, Clay's opponent in the 1844 presidential election. In 1845, he was again unsuccessful in his bid for a seat in Congress, losing to Garrett Davis.Biographical Cyclopedia, p. 272 During the Mexican–American War, he served a captain of cavalry volunteers for a year. After returning from the war, Marshall unsuccessfully sought to be a delegate to the constitutional convention that drafted the 1850 Kentucky Constitution. He campaigned for Winfield Scott in the 1852 presidential election and was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1854. He served a single term, which marked his last service in public office. Later life and death In 1856, Marshall moved to Chicago, Illinois. He later returned to Kentucky and continued to practice law. He devoted the latter years of his life to the study of geology and history, and lectured successfully through the northern and eastern United States. A collection of his writings and speeches was edited by W. L. Barre (Cincinnati, 1858). He died near Versailles, Kentucky, on September 22, 1864 and was interred in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.

Operational history The sole V.I (D-1594), took part in the 1928 Berlin ILA-exhibition and was subsequently sold to Deutsche Luft Hansa (DLH) in the Autumn of 1929 and named Tenerife on 12 December 1929. After a successful proving flight to Tenerife, the aircraft crashed near Berlin, on 19 December 1929, during its return flight, killing both pilots, though the mechanic survived.

And it's saying that the best way to boycott a business is to start your own.\\" Part of group member Chuck D's voice was sampled on the track \\"Ten Crack Commandments\\" by The Notorious B.I.G., off the album Life After Death.

(The new release's title was a combination of the words from the two original songs' individual titles, making the title, like the song itself, a mashup.) The song was included as a bonus track on the expanded edition of The Day Is My Enemy.

This house, built in 1893, represents an essential step in the evolution of the Belgian architect. In many ways, it was an innovative dwelling, although it does not feature the novel spatial composition of the almost contemporary Hôtel Tassel. The house is located 266, /, in the municipality of Schaerbeek in Brussels (Belgium). The Autrique House was built for the engineer Eugène Autrique and his family. Due to budget restrictions, the family wanted a simple but comfortable home. For this reason, many custom made details, which Horta designed himself in most of the other town houses he built, were abolished. The house was kept in a relatively good condition during the 20th century. In the 1990s, it was bought by the municipality of Schaerbeek. It was thoroughly renovated and is now opened to the public. History Built by Victor Horta in 1893 for his friend Eugène Autrique, the Autrique House constitutes the missing link between traditional private architecture and the emerging Art Nouveau style. All typical Art Nouveau characteristics are already present in this early work of Horta: fine iron pillars and columns of the facade, sgraffito, stained glass, mosaics, and importance of natural light and decorative elements of floral inspiration. These characteristics were to be developed and magnified by Horta and his disciples. Building The Autrique House was the first town house built by Victor Horta. This dwelling was already innovative for its application of a novel Art Nouveau decorative scheme that did not include references to other historical styles. However, the floor plan and spatial composition of the Autrique House remained rather traditional. On the deep and narrow building plot, the rooms were organised according to a traditional scheme used in most Belgian town houses at that time. It consisted of a suite of rooms on the left side of the building plot, flanked by a rather narrow entrance hall with stairs and a corridor that led to a small garden at the back. From the three- room suite, only the first and the last had windows, and so the middle room, used mostly as a dining room, was rather gloomy. Awards The Autrique house received in 2005 the Medal of Europa Nostra for \\"the scrupulous restoration of an early masterpiece of Victor Horta, and for the creation of a scenography which pays tribute to the private architecture of Brussels and opens a door to an imaginary world.\\" See also * Victor Horta * Art Nouveau in Brussels References External links * Official website of the Maison Autrique Category:Houses in Belgium Category:Museums in Brussels Category:Historic house museums in Belgium Category:Schaerbeek Category:Victor Horta buildings Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Brussels Category:Art Nouveau houses Category:Houses completed in 1893 ","title":"Maison Autrique"},{"id":"10955778","text":"Sean Burrage was named President of Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant, Oklahoma on May 15, 2014, by the Regional University System of Oklahoma Board of Regents.

History  The day was selected by the United Nations General Assembly for two reasons. First, on 26 June 1945, the United Nations Charter was signed during the midst of World War II – the first international instrument obliging UN members to respect and promote human rights. Second, 26 June 1987 was when the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment came into effect. The decision to annually observe the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture was taken by the UN General Assembly at the proposal of Denmark, which is home to the world-renowned International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT). The first 26 June events were launched in 1998. Since then, nearly 100 organizations in dozens of countries all over the world mark the day each year with events, celebrations and campaigns. On 16 July 2009, the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture was chosen as a public holiday in Bosnia and Herzegovina.У БиХ четири дана државних празника (\\"Four days of public holidays in Bosnia and Herzegovina\\") Past observances {  !Year !Theme -  2015  Right To Rehabilitation (R2R) }  Global campaign  Every year the IRCT monitors the campaign plans of organizations around the world and towards the end of the year publishes the 26 June Global Report where it describes the events held in commemoration of the day.

Born in Florence as Cosimo Caccini, he entered into the Dominican order of the Catholic Church as a teenager. Caccini began his career in the monastery of San Marco and gradually became renowned for his passionate sermons. He frequently preached at the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, which would later be the site of his most famous sermon.The Galileo Project, Tommaso Caccini Some historians, however, speculate that the motives behind Caccini's sermons were questionable because \\"his fanaticism was never divorced from personal ambition for advancement within the Dominican order.\\" Perhaps one indication of Caccini's desire for success is reflected by his decision to be named as \\"Tommaso,\\" which is thought to be in honor of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas was best known for his views on theology and philosophy, and he often discussed the effects of philosophy on Church doctrine.Stanford Encyclopedia, Saint Thomas Acquinas Historical accounts suggest that unlike his namesake, Father Caccini was hardly interested in balancing theology with philosophical ideals. In fact, Caccini's highly controversial sermons, which often vilified critics of Church doctrine, eventually resulted in discipline by the Archbishop of Bologna. The Pigeon League In Florence, Caccini became a member of a group known as the \\"Pigeon League,\\" named after Lodovico delle Colombe.The Galileo Project, Tommaso Caccini Colombo means \\"pigeon\\" in Italian Colombe was reputed to be one of the first individuals in the Church to attempt to derail Galileo Galilei's scientific endeavors. Another famous member of the Pigeon League was Niccolò Lorini, who often utilized references to Scripture in his fiercely critical sermons against Galileo.Mariano Artigas, Facultades de Ciencias y Ecelsiastica de Filosofia, New Light on the Galileo Affair Colombe denounced Galileo's discussion of Copernican theory, soon after Galileo confirmed several celestial discoveries in 1609. Lorini followed by issuing a scathing sermon in 1613 responding to Galileo's Letters on Solar Spots.Doug Linder, The Trial of Galileo Soon after Lorini's sermon, Galileo issued a response, known as the Letter to Castelli. The Letter attempted to demonstrate that Copernican theory and the Book of Joshua were not mutually exclusive. Caccini saw the Letter to Castelli as an opportunity to discredit Galileo and his followers even further. Sermon at Santa Maria Novella On December 20, 1614, Caccini issued a sermon at the Santa Maria Novella in Florence strongly opposing Galileo's support of Copernican theory. While the exact text of the sermon is not clear, historians suggest that Caccini preached that mathematics and science were contrary to the word of the Bible, and therefore, heretical.Maurice Finnochiaro, The Galileo Affair: A Documentary History 300, 330 n. 13 (Univ. Cal. Press 1998) Although Caccini appeared to have criticized mathematics and science generally, he singled out Galileo and his followers. He made a point to utilize the biblical phrase, \\"Ye Men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up in heaven?\\"Finnorchiaro at 330 n. 13 The phrase can be found in Acts 1:11. The phrase refers to the inhabitants of Galilee who gazed into the sky expecting Jesus to return as he made his way to heaven. Caccini attempted to play on the words of the passage by starkly contrasting Galileo's allegedly heretical acts to the unwavering faith of the inhabitants of Galilee. Reaction The reaction to Caccini's sermon ranged from vocal opposition to praise. Galileo himself is said to have described Caccini as an individual \\"of very great ignorance, no less a mind full of venom and devoid of charity.\\"The Trial of Galileo, Key Figures Within the Church itself, there was substantial disagreement over how to address Caccini's scathing sermon. Matteo Caccini, Tommaso Caccini's own brother and former prior of a monastery in Cortona, was appalled by Caccini's sermon in Florence. He stated: \\"I am so angry that I could not be more...[Father Tommaso] revealed such dreadful plans I could scarcely control myself. In any event, I wash my hands of him forever and ever.\\" The preacher general of the Dominican order echoed Matteo Caccini's sentiments in a letter he issued to Galileo. Apologizing on behalf of the Order, he lamented that: \\"[he had] to answer for all the idiocies\\" that his fellow brothers perpetrated.Rivka Feldhay, Galileo & the Church: The Political Inquisition 204, 205 (Cambridge Univ. Press 2003) Testimony in Rome Despite opposition from relatively high-ranking members in the Dominican order towards Caccini's views, some historians speculate that Caccini's sermon was the catalyst for the trial of Galileo that took place in Rome in 1615. By the time the Holy Office called Caccini to testify against Galileo, he was residing at the Roman convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Caccini was an alumnus of the College of St. Thomas, the future Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum having become Master and Bachelor there.Finnochiaro at 136; Mary Allen Olney, The Private Life of Galileo 87 (Nichols & Noys 1870). http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/tommaso-caccini_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ Accessed 2-17-2013 On March 20, 1615, in front of several high-ranking officials within the Church, Caccini testified regarding his sermon and his knowledge of Galileo and his followers. Caccini stated that following his sermon, he reported to the Father Inquisitor in Florence that Galileo's supporters should be disciplined for their \\"petulant minds.\\"Finnochiaro at 137 Caccini accused Galileo's followers of making blasphemous statements that questioned God's existence and the Church's declaration that miracles were acts performed by saints.Finnochiaro at 137 (\\"God is not otherwise a substance, but an accident\\") (\\"in truth miracles said to have been made by saints are not real miracles.\\") Caccini went on to state that the notion that the earth travels around the sun was offensive to the Scripture, which declared the earth motionless.Finnochiaro at 138 In addition to discussing his activities following the sermon, examiners asked Caccini to discuss his opinions regarding Galileo and his followers. Despite the fact that Caccini clearly despised Galileo's teachings, he attempted to act diplomatically when asked about Galileo's character. He openly noted that Galileo had been regarded as \\"a good Catholic\\" by many.Finnochiaro at 139 Nonetheless, Caccini demonstrated his disapproval of Galileo's views subtly in his closing statement. When asked if he had any hostility towards Galileo or his followers, Caccini responded \\"...I do not have any hostility towards Galileo...or toward [the] disciples of Galileo. Rather I pray to God for them.\\"Finnochiaro at 140 After the Trial While Caccini hoped that his claims would encourage Rome to act against Galileo, his testimony was met with mixed reviews. Most of his claims were disregarded by the Church with the exception of the claim that Galileo's Letter on Sunspots was heretical. In 1616, following an examination of the Letter, the Holy Office issued a report that the notion of a stationary sun was heretical. The Holy Office further enjoined Galileo on February 26, 1616 from teaching or defending the notion that the earth revolved around a stationary sun.Finnochiaro at 147 After giving his testimony in 1615, Caccini used his opposition to Galileo as a vehicle to achieve his ambitious professional goals. Gradually his career progressed in Rome, and he eventually became the prior of the monastery of San Marco where he continued to assist in the prosecution of Galileo. Caccini died at the age of 74 in Florence in 1648.

Initially he had trained as a carpenter. His ability, leadership skills, personal qualities and business acumen transformed him from an employee to a builder of note. Many local tradesmen were employed by him, making him an asset to the district in which he lived. Works depot James' company was registered as J A Goyen Pty, Ltd and is listed in relevant phone books. By 1972 the company was in the names Goyen, J A and McIntyre, C R. His works depot was at 18 Montgomery Street, Kogarah and, later, at 4 Montgomery Street, Kogarah. House building The first house built by James (\\"Jimmy\\") Goyen was a modest dwelling built for his sister, Martha Mannins, at 36 Gibbes Street, Rockdale in 1924. Apart from bricking in the basement the house remained unaltered into the late 1990s. (Martha's son, Charles Nicholas Mannins, later became a builder as well. Mannins Avenue, Kingsgrove is named after him because he constructed the houses in the street.) The Depression of the 1930s disrupted his building work. During this period he found work as an employee of a greengrocer. Many of the houses built by James have a distinctive, decorative brickwork which was often used as a signature to his work. Goyen Avenue, Bexley was named after him for he was responsible for the construction of the houses in the street. Houses with this unique style of brickwork are characteristic of many houses in the avenue. Other houses with his typical style of brickwork are dotted around the district. These include houses in George Street, Rockdale and in Bay Street, Brighton-Le-Sands (on the south side of the street, just east of West Botany Street, Rockdale). After World War II there was a housing shortage leading to a frenzy in house construction. Building materials became very scarce. James and his business partner, C R McIntyre, won the tender to construct houses in a new estate in Brighton-le-Sands in what is now McIntyre Avenue. The contrast in housing design and construction between the pre-war houses in Goyen Avenue and those in McIntyre Avenue reflect this difficulty in obtaining suitable and adequate building materials. This contrast is further reflected by the differences in building materials used in McIntyre Avenue and in the house built nearby several years earlier at 6 Carinya Ave for James' cousin. James was engaged to build the house. But he saw how scarce building materials were becoming and he was not free to start the construction for some months. So James passed the responsibility for building the house at 6 Carinya Avenue to his bricklayer, Mr Cheyney, to ensure that adequate building materials were available for the construction of the house. World War II James could not serve in the army or air force because of severe deafness, the result of scarlet fever when he was 14 years of age. James and his workmen not of military age were employed by the Public Works Department of New South Wales to build air-raid shelters. Government tenders James' firm won the tender to construct the first building of the St George Technical College on the site of the old Moorefields Racecourse. The building is located at the corner of President Avenue and Princes Highway, Kogarah. This college is now (in 2007) integrated into a broader TAFE system. Sylvania Waters James' business won the contract to construct the suburb on the new Hooker Estate east of Sylvania Waters, on Georges River. He was responsible for the design, construction of dwellings and promotion of the new suburb. Family background James Nicholas Jimmy Goyen was born in Surry Hills and died in Kogarah. He was the son of Nicholas Goyen and Eliza Mary Snow Aspinall, daughter of the builder Albert Aspinall. Although his birth was registered as \\"Nicholas\\" James was baptised as \\"James Albert\\", the name he used throughout his life and in his business name. He only found his registered name by accident later in life. Jimmy, his wife, Mary, and their four daughters lived at several addresses in Bexley and at 2 George Street, Rockdale before moving to Cronulla.

It was a staple food for many centuries.The Oxford Companion to Food The word pottage comes from the same Old French root as potage, which is a dish of more recent origin. Pottage ordinarily consisted of various ingredients easily available to serfs and peasants, and could be kept over the fire for a period of days, during which time some of it could be eaten, and more ingredients added. The result was a dish that was constantly changing. Pottage consistently remained a staple of the poor's diet throughout most of 9th to 17th-century Europe. When wealthier people ate pottage, they would add more expensive ingredients such as meats. The pottage that these people ate was much like modern-day soups. This is similar to the Welsh cawl, which is a broth, soup or stew often cooked on and off for days at a time over the fire in a traditional inglenook. In Nigeria the words pottage and porridge are synonymous, and such foods are consumed as a main meal. Nigerian yam pottage/porridge includes tomatoes and other culinary vegetables along with the yam. It may also have fish and/or other meat. In the King James Bible translation of the story of Jacob and Esau in the Book of Genesis, Esau, being famished, sold his birthright (the rights of the eldest son) to his twin brother Jacob in exchange for a meal of \\"bread and pottage of lentiles\\" (Gen 25:29-34). This incident is the origin of the phrase a \\"mess of pottage\\" (which is not in any Biblical text) to mean a bad bargain involving short-term gain and long-term loss. Preparation Pottage was typically boiled for several hours until the entire mixture took on a homogeneous texture and flavour; this was intended to break down complex starches and to ensure the food was safe for consumption. It was often served, when possible, with bread. Middle Ages In Middle English thick pottages (stondyng) made with cereals, shredded meat, seasoned with spices and sometimes thickened with egg yolks and bread crumbs were called by various names like brewet, egerdouce, mortrew, mawmenee, blancmange and blance dessore. Thinner pottages were said to be ronnyng. Frumenty was a pottage made with fresh cleaned wheat grain that was boiled until it burst, allowed to cool, then boiled with broth and either cow milk or almond milk, and thickened with egg yolk and flavored with sugar and spices. Colonial America Pottage had long been a staple of the English diet. During the Middle Ages it was usually made with wheat, barley, rye, or oats. Native American cuisine also had a similar dish, but it was made with maize rather than the traditional European grain varieties. An early 17th century British recipe for pottage was made by boiling mutton and oatmeal with violet leaves, endive, chicory, strawberry leaves, spinach, langdebeefe, marigold flowers, scallions and parsley. In the cuisine of New England, pottage began as boiled grain, vegetables, seasonings and meat, fowl or fish. This simple staple of early American cuisine eventually evolved into the chowders and baked beans typical of New England's cuisine. A version of \\"scotch barley broth\\" is attested to in the 18th century colonial recipe collection called Mrs Gardiner's Family Receipts. Indian succotash, sometimes called pondomenast or Indian pottage was made with boiled corn and, when available, meat like venison, bear, moose, otter, raccoon or beaver. Dried fish like shad, eel, or herring could be used in place of the meat. Kidney beans were sometimes mixed into Indian pottage, along with fruits like Jerusalem artichoke, pumpkin, squash. Ground nuts like acorns, chestnuts or walnuts were used to thicken the pottage.

The Siletz River Volcanics, located in the Oregon Coast Range, United States, are a sequence of basaltic pillow lavas that make up part of Siletzia. The basaltic pillow lavas originally came from submarine volcanoes that existed during the Eocene. The Paleocene to Eocene volcanics consist of volcanism flows and sills of tholeitic to alkalic basalts with associated tuff-breccia, siltstone and sandstone. The flows are vesiculated with zeolite filled amygdules. The volcanics originated as oceanic crust and seamounts. Potassium argon dating gives an age of 50.7 ± 3.1 to 58.1 ± 1.5 Ma. The sequence has been divided into a lower pillowed tholeiitic unit and an upper porphyritic alkali basalt unit.

Over the next couple of years, McAbee wrote and directed short films including The Ketchup and Mustard Man and The Man on the Moon. As a means of self-distribution, McAbee developed live musical performances that incorporated his short films. The show was called The Billy Nayer Chronicles. It was presented at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival as the festival's first multi-media event. In 1996 McAbee wrote his first feature film, The American Astronaut. The screenplay was accepted to the 1998 Sundance screenwriters lab. The film premiered at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. In 2007 he wrote Stingray Sam with the intention of self- distribution on multiple platforms. Stingray Sam premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. In 2011 The Billy Nayer Show released its final album and disbanded. In 2012 McAbee released a non-budget experimental feature, Crazy and Thief. In 2012 McAbee founded the international arts collaborative, Captain Ahab's Motorcycle Club with the goal of creating international solidarity between artists through the creation of a globally generated feature film, called Deep Astronomy. Beginning in 2012 and extending into 2017, McAbee performed concerts in support of this project throughout the US, Europe and Australia. In 2015, McAbee recorded and produced his first solo album, Small Star Seminar, which become a catalyst for the film's narrative. In 2017 McAbee developed a live performance entitled Deep Astronomy and the Romantic Sciences.

As of September 2005, they are on an indefinite hiatus. Biography Eden Maine was formed in 1999 by vocalist Adam Symonds and bassist Nick Brown. After going through several lineup changes, drummer Kieran Iles was recruited, and the band started to develop their own sound, drawing elements from metal, and hardcore. At this time, the guitarists in the band were Faeryn Lee and Neil Green. Faeryn soon left the band to move back to the US, and was replaced by Simon Davis. With Simon in the line up, they completed the writing for their debut EP; The Treachery Pact, and prepared to enter the studio. However, it was around this time, after months of growing tension, that Neil Green decided to move on from the band. The remaining members chose to enter the studio as a four piece. They enlisted the services of Kurt Ballou to handle production duties and entered Southern Studios in January 2002, while advertising for a new guitarist. It was not long before they found interest from Phil Buch, who completed the band's lineup, joining them in the studio to finish the recording.  The Treachery Pact  The Treachery Pact EP was released in early 2002 through UK label Ignition Records. Gaining many positive reviews from UK and international press, the band started to grow in stature. They embarked on a heavy touring schedule, sharing the stage with many well established bands, including Sepultura, Lostprophets, Converge, The Dillinger Escape Plan and more. The band's touring took them around much of the UK and Europe. During this time they were also courted by several labels, and came very close to signing to Visible Noise, before pulling out of the deal late in the day, feeling that their music might be compromised by the schedule that would be expected of them from the label. They then worked closely with Belgian-based Fuel Records, but never entered into a full agreement with the label. With the band choosing to move away from Ignition (now renamed Engineer) records, they opted to carry on as an unsigned band, until they were presented with an offer completely meeting their satisfaction.  To You the First Star  In Summer 2004 the band entered Foel Studio in Wales as an unsigned band, with producer Andrew Schneider to record their debut full-length album To You the First Star. The band's sound had evolved, moving away from metalcore towards a more epic sound incorporating elements of noisecore, post-metal and post rock. Following the recording, UK label Undergroove Records showed an interest in working with the band on the release. An agreement was reached and the album was released in early 2005. The new album split opinions amongst Eden Maine's existing fanbase. Many found the direction shift challenging, exciting and original, while others missed the full-throttled attack of the earlier release. The press, however, were mostly unified in their praise of the album, tipping the band to go on to bigger and better things.  Indefinite hiatus  Following the release of To You the First Star, the band embarked upon their most intensive touring schedule to date. This time they toured mainly as a headline act, taking bands such as Reflux and Lack along with them. They reached more countries and cities than ever before, subsequently attaining a strong following in mainland Europe. After three months of non-stop touring, the band took a break to regroup. At this time, a North American label approached them with a view to giving To You the First Star a release. This would be coupled with extensive touring of the US and Canada. This unfortunately led to inner turmoil for the band, due to the financial restraints among some of the members, and the risks involved. The group went through their most difficult period, and were unsure of the next best step to take. Conversely, at this time they were enjoying a spree of creativity, once again embarking upon a different direction, involving many more of their individual influences. The band were unable to work through the conflict caused by the financial problems and inability to tour as they would have liked. Members felt that they had different priorities, and different directions in mind. Rather than break up entirely, they took the decision to take an 'indefinite hiatus' to pursue other musical projects. They took the decision that if and when they were to regroup, they would move on completely from their previous material. And so in early 2006 they played their 'final show', performing material from both their EP and album, with the knowledge that this would be the last time these songs were performed. The band has remained inactive since, with various members going on to be involved in other projects including: *The Rifle Volunteer (Adam Symonds and Nick Brown) **shels (Simon Davis and Phil Buch) *Mia Hope - now defunct (Phil Buch) *Astrohenge (Kieran Iles) *So this is Paris - now defunct (Phil Buch) *Reservations at Dorcia - now defunct (Phil Buch) *Talons (Simon Davis) *Latitudes - (Adam Symonds provides vocals on 'Agonist') Discography *The Treachery Pact (EP) (2002) *To You the First Star (2005) References External links * Eden Maine at MySpace * Category:Musical groups established in 1997 Category:Post- metal musical groups Category:English metalcore musical groups Category:Musical groups from St Albans ","title":"Eden Maine"},{"id":"10956038","text":"Norwegian diplomatic missions This is a list of diplomatic missions of Norway, excluding honorary consulates.

The original Hebrew title, Sof Davar (Hebrew:סוף דבר) can be translated literally as The End Result or Epilogue. Shabtai died in 1981, before completing a final draft. The novel was published posthumously, edited for publication by the literary scholar Dan Miron and Shabtai's wife Edna. An English translation was published in 1987 by Viking Press.Life at the Last Moment - New York Times review of Past Perfect] Plot Meir, a 42-year-old architect from Tel Aviv, is suddenly stricken with the fear of dying. The plot deals with the changes in his life following this realization of his mortality, including an affair with his doctor, the death of his mother, and a trip to Europe. It ends with a birth following Meir's death, which could be seen as Meir's reincarnation as a baby or else as a return to his own birth, following Nietzsche's concept of the eternal return. Style The novel serves as an indirect continuation of Past Continuous in terms of narrative, prose style, and themes. Unlike Past Continuous, which was written as a single book-long paragraph (broken up in the English translation), in Past Perfect the narrative has been broken down into four parts, and divided further into paragraphs, albeit lengthy ones. The first part is written in the same Stream of Consciousness mode as the earlier novel, moving seamlessly between Meir's thought and external events. The later parts of the novel move away from this style, towards a more varied narration, until the very end, when Meir's death and rebirth are described in a lyrical, almost magical-realist style.

Balanced lines are a common method of transmitting many types of electrical communication signals between two points on two wires. In a balanced line the two signal lines are of a matched impedance to help ensure that interference induced in the line is common-mode and can be removed at the receiving end by circuitry with good common-mode rejection. To maintain the balance, circuit blocks which interface to the line, or are connected in the line, must also be balanced. Balanced lines work because the interfering noise from the surrounding environment induces equal noise voltages into both wires. By measuring the voltage difference between the two wires at the receiving end, the original signal is recovered while the noise is cancelled. Any inequality in the noise induced in each wire is an imbalance and will result in the noise not being fully cancelled. One requirement for balance is that both wires are an equal distance from the noise source. This is often achieved by placing the wires as close together as possible and twisting them together. Another requirement is that the impedance to ground (or to whichever reference point is being used by the difference detector) is the same for both conductors at all points along the length of the line. If one wire has a higher impedance to ground it will tend to have a higher noise induced, destroying the balance. Balance and symmetry Example of 4 different circuit configurations, using a low-pass filter, to demonstrate. Fig. 1. Unbalanced, asymmetrical circuit. Fig. 2. Unbalanced, symmetrical circuit. Fig. 3. Balanced, asymmetrical circuit. Fig. 4. Balanced, symmetrical circuit. A balanced circuit will normally show a symmetry of its components about a horizontal line midway between the two conductors (example in figure 3). This is different from what is normally meant by a symmetrical circuit, which is a circuit showing symmetry of its components about a vertical line at its midpoint. An example of a symmetrical circuit is shown in figure 2. Circuits designed for use with balanced lines will often be designed to be both balanced and symmetrical as shown in figure 4. The advantages of symmetry are that the same impedance is presented at both ports and that the circuit has the same effect on signals travelling in both directions on the line. Balance and symmetry are usually associated with reflected horizontal and vertical physical symmetry respectively as shown in figures 1 to 4. However, physical symmetry is not a necessary requirement for these conditions. It is only necessary that the electrical impedances are symmetrical. It is possible to design circuits that are not physically symmetrical but which have equivalent impedances which are symmetrical. Balanced signals and balanced circuits A balanced signal is one where the voltages on each wire are symmetrical with respect to ground (or some other reference). That is, the signals are inverted with respect to each other. A balanced circuit is a circuit where the two sides have identical transmission characteristics in all respects. A balanced line is a line in which the two wires will carry balanced currents (that is, equal and opposite currents) when balanced (symmetrical) voltages are applied. The condition for balance of lines and circuits will be met, in the case of passive circuitry, if the impedances are balanced. The line and circuit remain balanced, and the benefits of common-mode noise rejection continue to apply, whether or not the applied signal is itself balanced (symmetrical), always provided that the generator producing that signal maintains the impedance balance of the line.Whitaker, 2001, pp.371-372. Driving and receiving circuits Fig. 5. Balanced line connected by transformers. Fig. 6. Balanced line connected to electronically balanced circuitry. Fig. 7. Balanced line connected to an unbalanced signal, but with balanced impedances. There are a number of ways that a balanced line can be driven and the signal detected. In all methods, for the continued benefit of good noise immunity, it is essential that the driving and receiving circuit maintain the impedance balance of the line. It is also essential that the receiving circuit detects only differential signals and rejects common-mode signals. It is not essential (although it is often the case) that the transmitted signal is balanced, that is, symmetrical about ground. Transformer balance The conceptually simplest way to connect to a balanced line is through transformers at each end shown in figure 5. Transformers were the original method of making such connections in telephony, and before the advent of active circuitry were the only way. In the telephony application they are known as repeating coils. Transformers have the additional advantage of completely isolating (or \\"floating\\") the line from earth and earth loop currents, which are an undesirable possibility with other methods. The side of the transformer facing the line, in a good quality design, will have the winding laid in two parts (often with a centre tap provided) which are carefully balanced to maintain the line balance. Line side and equipment side windings are more useful concepts than the more usual primary and secondary windings when discussing these kinds of transformers. At the sending end the line side winding is the secondary, but at the receiving end the line side winding is the primary. When discussing a two-wire circuit primary and secondary cease to have any meaning at all, since signals are flowing in both directions at once. The equipment side winding of the transformer does not need to be so carefully balanced. In fact, one leg of the equipment side can be earthed without effecting the balance on the line as shown in figure 5. With transformers the sending and receiving circuitry can be entirely unbalanced with the transformer providing the balancing.Thompson, pp.164-166. Electronic balance Electronic balance, or active balance, is achieved using differential amplifiers at each end of the line. An op-amp implementation of this is shown in figure 6, other circuitry is possible. Unlike transformer balance, there is no isolation of the circuitry from the line. Each of the two wires is driven by an op amp circuit which are identical except that one is inverting and one is non- inverting. Each one produces an unbalanced signal individually but together they drive the line with a symmetrical balanced signal.Slone, p.334.Vasilescu, pp.299-300. Because the currents in the two lines are equal and opposite, this has the further advantage that radiated signals cancel each other except in the near field of the conductors, thereby reducing cross-talk onto other conductors. While it is not possible to create an isolated drive with op-amp circuitry alone, it is possible to create a floating output. This is important if one leg of the line might become grounded or connected to some other voltage reference. Grounding one leg of the line in the circuit of figure 6 will result in the line voltage being halved since only one op-amp is now providing signal. To achieve a floating output additional feedback paths are required between the two op-amps resulting in a more complex circuit than figure 6, but still avoiding the expense of a transformer. A floating op-amp output can only float within the limits of the op-amp's supply rails.Whitaker, 2003, pp.223-224. An isolated output can be achieved without transformers with the addition of opto-isolators.Peyton and Walsh, pp.27-28. Impedance balance As noted above, it is possible to drive a balanced line with an unbalanced signal and still maintain the line balance. This is represented in outline in figure 7. Amplifier A is assumed to be an ideal (that is, zero output impedance) unbalanced output amp. This is connected through a resistor to one leg of the line. The other leg is connected through another resistor of the same value. The impedance to ground of both legs is the same and the line remains balanced. The receiving amplifier still rejects any common-mode noise as it has a differential input. On the other hand, the line signal is not balanced.Rivers The voltages at the input to the two legs, V+ and V− are given by; :V_+ = V_\\\\mathrm {in} \\\\frac{Z_\\\\mathrm {in}+R_1}{Z_\\\\mathrm {in}+2R_1} :V_- = V_\\\\mathrm {in} \\\\frac{R_1}{Z_\\\\mathrm {in}+2R_1} Where Zin is the input impedance of the line. These are clearly not symmetrical since V− is much smaller than V+. They are not even opposite polarities. In audio applications V− is usually so small it can be taken as zero.Elliot & Beis, 2002 Balanced to unbalanced conversion A circuit that has the specific purpose of converting between balanced and unbalanced formats is called a balun. A balun could be a transformer with one leg earthed on the unbalanced side as described in the transformer balance section above. Other circuits are possible such as autotransformers or active circuits. Connectors Common connectors used with balanced circuits include modular connectors on telephone instruments and broadband data, and XLR connectors for professional audio. 1/4\\" tip/ring/sleeve (TRS) phone connectors were once widely used on manual switchboards and other telephone infrastructure. Such connectors are now more commonly seen in miniature sizes (2.5 and 3.5 mm) being used for unbalanced stereo audio; however, professional audio equipment such as mixing consoles still commonly use balanced and unbalanced \\"line-level\\" connections with 1/4\\" phone jacks.

Sylk features a mix of socio-political editorial combined with pictorials of scantily clad female models (the \\"Sylk Girls\\"). Sylk Magazine was one of the first men's magazines to forsake print and embrace 100% Internet distribution. Overview Sylk Magazine started in 2004 as an online publication. It addresses national and global socio-political topics such as foreign policy, environmental issues, and social issues, outlining problems and looking at their causes and their wider implications on culture.http://www.pr.com/press- release/29945, February 14, 2007 It does not feature content on pop culture. Sylk Girls Sylk Magazines \\"Sylk Girls\\" are women new to modelling, many having never shot anything before Sylk, rather than popular models, celebrities, and debutantes. The purpose is to give new models exposure. Sylk Magazine focuses both on the models' physical attributes and on their personal attributes. Sylk Pictorials outline each model's personality, intelligence, and accomplishments. Glamor photography is usually identified with the use of makeup styling and heavy post-processing (air brushing) of images, often to the degree of reshaping body and facial features. However, Sylk Magazine prefers to keep the models makeup light/casual and minimize the retouching of images so that the Sylk Girls have a more natural appearance. Sylk pictorials use an interactive layout broken into pages, with three photos and part of the model's bio on each page. The layout allows readers to quickly switch between photos without leaving the page and to enlarge the photos they want to see in more detail, without the use of Flash. Marketing The name \\"Sylk\\" was chosen because the fabric silk is associated with elegance, high quality, and intimate and sexual connotations. Additionally, \\"Sylk\\" was chosen as a name because silk is a luxury item that people often use without thinking about its history and the political influences of the silk trade. The misspelling is intended to represent the magazine as having a rebellious nature. Sylk Magazine originally had the tag line \\"Nothing is Sexier Than Sylk\\", before switching in 2005 to \\"Sylk Magazine: Art, Politics & Sex\\". (\\"Art, Politics & Sex\\" are stated to represent the \\"three pillars\\" upon which society is built.) In 2007, \\"All Juice, No Pulp\\" was added to emphasize the magazine's purely online nature, and \\"A Smarter Men's Magazine\\" was added after a Fleshbot posting calling the magazine \\"T&A; for the thinking man\\".Sylk: The Thinking Man's Boobies, February 23, 2007 Europe In April 2007, Sylk Magazine partnered with Turkish company MobilARGE Ltd. for mobile distribution in Europe.http://www.pr.com/press-release/35289, April 10, 2007 Versions *There is a free mobile version with the latest articles and recent pictorials. *There is also a \\"Work Safe\\" version that has no photos, only articles.

He served as the head football coach at the University of Pittsburgh from 1947 to 1949 and for one season as the head basketball coach at the University of Tulsa (1942–43). Playing days Milligan played high school football at Aliquippa High School and Kiski School. While at college at the University of Pittsburgh, Milligan played guard from 1929 to 1931 under the school's legendary coach Jock Sutherland. The lightest of Pitt guards in 1930, and listed at a height of 5 feet, 10 inches and weighing 168 pounds, Milligan broke into the lineup at left guard when Hart Morris was injured in an October 11 game at Western Reserve. The teams on which Milligan played while at Pitt were regional powers and nationally regarded. The 1929 Pitt team went undefeated in the regular season and won the Eastern Championship and appeared in the Rose Bowl losing to USC. The loss did not prevent football historian Parke H. Davis from naming Pitt as that season's national champion. The following season, Milligan's first as a regular starter, saw the Panthers go 6–2–1. This was followed by an 8–1 finish in 1931 in which the Panthers recorded six shutouts, including a 40–0 dismantling of Nebraska. That season also saw Pitt defeat Penn State in State College, using only one first-string player, by a score of 41–6 en route to winning the Eastern Championship. These accomplishments would prompt Parke Davis to again name the Panthers national champions. During his summers in college, Milligan worked as a desk sergeant with the Aliquippa Police Department. Coaching career As a coach, Milligan held several assistant football coaching positions during his career, in which he typically specialized in coaching the lines. He had his only tenure as a head football coach for three seasons at his alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh. Milligan served one season as the head coach for the basketball team at Tulsa, where he also served as a football assistant. Early years Milligan became an assistant coach at Pitt under head coach Jock Sutherland in 1934. He remained a coach at the university, where he served as the coach of the football program's freshman squad, until he quit shortly after the resignation of Sutherland in 1938. From there Milligan took an assistant coaching position at Florida which was followed by an assistant position at Tulsa where he served as the offensive line coach. Tulsa basketball head coach While at Tulsa, Milligan took over head basketball coaching duties from Tex Ryon who left in 1942 after his second stint coaching the team. Milligan was winless in his basketball coaching tenure at Tulsa, where he went 0–10 during the 1942-43 season. Milligan was replaced as the Tulsa's basketball coach the following year by Woody West.Bonham, Chad. Golden Hurricane Basketball at the University of Tulsa. Chicago: Arcadia, 2004, pg. 19 Pitt football head coach Pitt football head coach \\"Mike\\" Milligan (right) congratulates Nick Bolkovac after a 7-0 shut out of undefeated Penn State on November 20, 1948. In the fourth quarter, Bolkovac scored the winning touchdown when he intercepted a pass and returned it from the 23 yard line. Bolkovac also prevented a tying score on the last play of the game by stopping Penn State fullback Fran Rogel at the Pitt one yard line. Milligan returned to his alma mater in 1946 as a top assistant for Pitt under head coach Wes Fesler, who left after his only season at Pitt to coach his alma mater Ohio State. Fesler's departure opened the door for Milligan's promotion to the head coaching position. Milligan's head coaching tenure at Pitt was underscored by one of the most satisfying wins in Pitt history when the Panthers defeated the Fesler-coached Ohio State team 12–0 for their only win of the 1947 season. Milligan brought Pitt back to winning records in 1948 and 1949, achieving consecutive 6–3 seasons that included appearances in the national rankings and back-to-back shutouts of Penn State, the first of which snapped Penn State's 17-game unbeaten streak. After Pitt, a twenty-point underdog, defeated defending Rose Bowl champion Northwestern on the road on October 1, 1949, Milligan was named the United Press \\"Coach of the Week\\". At the end of the 1949 season, he was also nominated for the Scripps-Howard \\"Coach of the Year\\" award. However, Milligan resigned on January 27, 1950, due to a perceived snub by the university offering him only a one-year contract, and he never returned to a head coaching position. Later years Following his stint as the Pitt head coach, Milligan took a series of assistant football coaching positions and was a highly regarded as a line coach. He spent a year as an assistant at USC in 1950, was an assistant at Purdue from 1951 to 1952, and then moved to an assistant position at Nebraska beginning from 1953 to 1955.

For this operation, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, and the Igor I. Sikorsky Award for Humanitarian Service. Early life Mykola Melnyk was born on December 17, 1953 and grew up in the town of Stavyshche in the Kyiv Oblast in Ukraine (at that time the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic). Upon his school graduation, Melnyk worked as a sports coach, and later as a telephone station technician in Stavyshche, later moving to Zaporizhia for a construction job. In 1972–74 he served his conscript service in the Soviet Armed Forces. Pilot career In 1979 Mykola Melnyk graduated from the Civil Aviation Pilot School (KLUGA) in Kremenchuk and began working as a civilian helicopter pilot in different cities. Later he continued his education at the Kremenchuk Department of the Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute and the Civil Aviation Academy in Leningrad. After graduation from the special test pilot school in 1984, Melnyk worked as a test pilot, particularly for the Kamov helicopter design bureau in Feodosiya.МЕЛЬНИК, Микола Миколайович, \\"Remembrance Book\\" Chernobyl mission After the April 1986 Chernobyl disaster, Melnyk was directed to work in the cleanup operations. Lethal levels of radiation created after the Reactor #4 fire prevented ground liquidator teams from most operations on the roof of the power plant building. However, helicopters could reach and leave the area above the building within seconds, thus inflicting less health damage to the personnel on board. They were employed to cover building openings with sandbags and lead slabs, install necessary equipment, commence aerial photography and atmospheric radioactive contamination monitoring.БОЕВЫЕ ДЕЙСТВИЯ В \\"МИРНОМ\\" НЕБЕ Воздушная битва при Чернобыле (Aerial Battle of Chernobyl) in \\"Aviatsiya i Vremia\\" magazine, 2011, #2; Melnyk, among others, was assigned to such missions as an experienced civilian helicopter pilot. He flew 46 sorties over the reactor building, for a combined total duration of 52 hours. The most important of those sorties was the so-called \\"Operation Igla\\" (Operation Needle), the June 19, 1986 installation of a giant -long radiation probe on top of the building by means of a precision drop from the KamovSources name either Kamov Ka-27 or Kamov Ka-32 as the model of exact helicopter. coaxial rotor helicopter.Операция «Игла» , Работа Мельника , Страсти по Чернобылю , Губарев, В.

This operation was described as dropping a \\"needle\\" into a precise spot; it was considered especially difficult. When Melnyk successfully completed the operation during a training exercise in Moscow, the observers broke into applause. Melnyk did not know the purpose of the training, however, until several days later when he flew to Kyiv to undertake the actual mission. The first attempt to insert the \\"needle\\" into the actual reactor was foiled by a frozen crust above the target; Melnyk succeeded on the third try. According to the \\"Remembrance Book\\" by the Chornobyl Museum, Melnyk participated in the 'liquidator' operations on site of the disaster from May 20, 1986 until September 9, 1986. In 1994, he underwent two surgeries related to health problems attributed to his radiation exposure. Subsequent aviation career and death Upon return from Chernobyl mission, Melnyk continued his work as a test pilot at the Kamov helicopter testing center in Feodosiya until 1992. In independent Ukraine, the facility was reorganized as a separate Feodosiya Kamov Research and Production Enterprise \\"Vertolit\\" (Феодосійське науково- виробниче об'єднання \\"Вертоліт\\" імені Камова). Some time after the fall of the Soviet Union, Melnyk co-founded a cargo airline in Kyiv. The company operated Antonov An-24 airplanes and Kamov helicopters as a subcontractor for DHL and United Parcel Service. However, he gradually became disappointed with the business, citing lack of sustainable demand for his helicopter specialization. In 1995, Spanish airline Helicopteros del Sureste approached Melnyk for help with purchase of Soviet-made helicopters. Melnyk used the opportunity to move to Alicante (Spain), where he became contracted as a pilot and instructor specializing in Soviet-designed helicopters with the Helicopteros del Sureste.Летчик-Герой Чернобыля ведет Ка-32 в Испанию He trained at least 25 local pilots and also has worked in aerial firefighting. As of 2006, Melnyk had 13,400 recorded flight hours. According to a Ukrainian regional newspaper, Mykola Melnyk died in Spain on July 26, 2013. Recognition and awards Soviet awards Melnyk was awarded as a Hero of the Soviet Union, by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued on October 6, 1987 for his \\"courage, heroism and self-sacrifice displayed during liquidation of the Chernobyl NPP accident consequences\\". Later he was also decorated with the Soviet Order of Lenin for the same deeds. International awards In 1990, as part of its \\"Salute to Excellence\\" awards program, the Helicopter Association International honored Melnyk (as Nikolai Melnik) with its Igor I. Sikorsky Award for Humanitarian Service. The Sikorsky award is presented annually to one or more persons \\"who best demonstrate(s) the value of civil rotorcraft to society by saving lives, protecting property, and aiding those in distress\\". The award to Melnyk recognized his efforts as a Chernobyl 'liquidator'. The award committee specified that Melnyk was recognized as a representative of \\"all the valiant aircrews who participated in relief efforts following the Chernobyl nuclear power station accident\\".. In Spain Melnyk received a Spanish royal award for aerial firefighting.

First of a trilogy set in alternative version of World War I, it has Central Powers (known in-universe as \\"Clankers\\") using mechanized war machines opposed by Entente Powers (as \\"Darwinists\\") who fabricate living creatures genetically. The central protagonists are Aleksander, son of Archduke Franz Ferdinand; and Deryn, a Scottish girl with dreams of joining the British Air Service with her brother. The sequels are Behemoth and Goliath. \\"Goliath\\" by Scott Westerfeld The first two chapters of this book were released with Bogus to Bubbly: Insider's Guide to the World of Uglies. The book was named the Best Young Adult Novel by the Aurealis Award in 2009, Locus in 2010, and Mir Fantastiki in 2011. Plot It is the cusp of World War I, and all the European powers are arming up. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans have their Clankers, diesel-driven iron machines loaded with guns and ammunition. The British Darwinists employ fabricated animals as their weaponry. Their Leviathan is a whale airship, and the most masterful beast in the British fleet. Aleksander Ferdinand, prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, is on the run. His own people have turned on him. His title is worthless. All he has is a battle-torn Stormwalker and a loyal crew of men. Meanwhile, Deryn, a commoner girl, is staying with her brother Jaspert in London. Her father died in a ballooning accident and her mother and aunts want her to grow up as a proper lady. Deryn dreams of joining the British Air Service and to serve on one of the great air beasts. In order to do so, she must pose as a boy (\\"Dylan Sharp\\"). To pass the starting exam, she goes aloft with a Huxley (a jellyfish- like creature which uses hydrogen to float) to prove her air-worthiness. However, a storm hits while she is aloft, severely tossing Deryn and the Huxley about, and they narrowly survive—she is forced to cut the Huxley loose from its mooring in order to avoid crashing into a nearby building. This results in Deryn and the Huxley being blown out over the North Sea; she is thrilled when she and the Huxley are rescued by the Leviathan, the most famous of the air-beasts, a massive ecosystem comprising many different animals but based largely on a whale. She is inducted into the crew of the Leviathan, and makes friends with the 'Monkey Luddite' Newkirk. The Leviathan's mission is to transport a top British boffin, or scientist, and a secret package to Constantinople. Deryn is surprised to learn the boffin is a woman, Dr. Nora Barlow, and is afraid Barlow will discover her secret. In the air over Europe, the Leviathan comes under attack from German airplanes. The crew fights back and defeats the planes, but not before the great whale's hydrogen bladder is severely punctured. The airship crash-lands in Switzerland on the very glacier where Alek's group is hiding. Alek and Volger witness the crash, but Volger insists they do nothing to interfere, as they will risk giving away their position to the Germans or being captured by the British. Alek is unable to stomach letting the crew of the Leviathan suffer out on the ice, and secretly leaves the fortress to bring medicine to the crew of the fallen ship. The first person he finds is an unconscious Deryn, who had fallen from the rigging during the crash. Alek revives her and claims unconvincingly to be a Swiss villager. Deryn is suspicious of him and sounds the alarm, resulting in Alek's capture. Alek continues to insist he is just a bystander trying to help, but the captain refuses to release him and instead leaves him under Deryn's charge. The secret cargo brought by Dr. Barlow is revealed to be eggs of some kind, though most were destroyed in the crash. Alek's \\"family\\" comes to his rescue, and battle almost erupts between the two sides, but Deryn's quick thinking in bringing Alek to the front and holding him as a hostage brings everyone together to talk under a flag of truce. Realizing their differences are outweighed by their similarities, Alek offers a sizable chunk from their food storage so the ship can replenish its hydrogen supply and take off again. However, as they travel back to the Leviathan, two German zeppelins appear and send out commandos to capture them. Unfortunately, one of the zeppelins escapes, and the Stormwalker is severely damaged by an aerial bomb, making it impossible to stand up and repair. Thanks to the diplomacy of Dr. Barlow and a bright idea from Alek, the two groups decide to combine their technologies and leave together as one group. Alek also admits his true origins to Deryn/Dylan and Dr. Barlow when he realizes he let a few too many things slip. The Austrians dismantle the Stormwalker and use its engines to replace those lost by the Leviathan. The Austrian engines prove to be much more powerful than its previous ones, propelling them quickly away from danger and Herkules, a deadly Clanker ship. In the aftermath, Dr. Barlow reveals information about a fabricated ship in England that was sold to the Ottoman Empire but then taken back by Winston Churchill despite being paid in full, thus creating tension between the British and the Ottomans. The novel closes with the Leviathan continuing its flight towards Constantinople with Alek watching the mysterious eggs that will hatch into some unknown fabricated species. Main characters Deryn (Dylan) Sharp: Despite her father having been killed in a ballooning accident, Deryn longs to be in the sky and free, although her mother and aunts try to force to her be a proper lady. Deryn spends the last of her inheritance to travel to London and live with her brother, where she studies to take the midshipman exams to enter the British Air Service like her brother. The most difficult part is acting as a boy since women cannot enter the Service. It is her lucky day when her airman test goes awry and she is scooped up by the Leviathan and finishes her tests up there. She is enlisted as a midshipman. She is able to best many other Middies at learning the ropes because she went up so frequently with her father and because she pays attention during class. She does her best to hide that she is a girl from everyone on board, though the observant eye of Dr. Barlow has noticed the lack of a beard on her chin. Luckily, Barlow has attributed it to Deryn lying about her age rather than being a girl. As she gets to know Alek, she realizes that she owes him her life and, after he hugs her, that she may even have feelings for him, which she quickly tries to repress. Prince Aleksandar (Alek): Alek is in serious danger after his parents are killed since he is in line for the throne of the Austro-Hungarian empire. He spends the better part of this book on the run. He is intelligent, and capable of operating a Stormwalker. He is also fluent in several languages, including English, French, Latin, Greek and German. His hubris tends to get the better of him at times, and puts them in danger many times in the book. Wildcount Volger: A rather stingy man, Volger has done an excellent job of pretending to disdain Alek and his supposed common birth, though in fact he knows that his father has altered his previously morganatic marriage to Alek's mother (a marriage where any children born cannot inherit) to a full marriage, making Alek heir to his uncle's throne. Volger is a schemer, and is prepared for new events, such as the death of Alek's father. He is quite shrewd and trains Alek in fencing and politics, never allowing the young Prince to better him. Dr. Nora Darwin Barlow: A female boffin is rare according to Deryn's reaction upon meeting Dr. Barlow, proving just how exceptional the doctor is in her field as well as her family: she is the granddaughter of Charles Darwin, after whom the Darwinists are named. She is also quite clever in general, figuring out secrets with her observational skills and knows several languages. She is the creator and caretaker of mysterious eggs that will hatch into a \\"perspicacious\\" loris of her making and a weapon to bear against the Clankers. The character's name comes from the real world person Nora Barlow. Otto Klopp: Aleksandar's \\"master of mechaniks.\\" He is sometimes referred to as Alek's tutor. He is a commoner who uses a more aristocratic accent when talking to Alek and his family and can pilot the Stormwalker and other mechanical machines with ease. Hoffman: One of the helpers/storm walker gunners that helps Alek escape. He also helps put the Clanker engines on the Leviathan. He was also a major engineer in the Habsburg Guard before the war. Hans Bauer: One of the helpers/storm walker gunners who helps Alek escape. He also helps put the Clanker engines on the Leviathan. Factions Clanker: Countries that use steam-driven iron machines are referred to as Clanker nations. The machines themselves and their users are also referred to as Clankers. The main Clanker nations are Germany and Austria-Hungary, generally the Central Powers with the name possibly a spoof of it. Though officially neutral, the Ottoman Empire is considered a Clanker nation as they believe Darwinist creations are against God. Characters who are part of this faction include Alek, Otto Klopp, and Wildcount Volger. Darwinist: The Darwinist countries currently consist of the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Belgium, Algeria (a colony of France), Serbia, and Japan (Note: Japan has Clanker technology). These factions employ fabricated animals as their weaponry. An example is the Leviathan, a whale airship of the British fleet. Characters who are part of this faction include Deryn Sharp and Dr. Nora Barlow. Named after Charles Darwin, who helped develop the theory of evolution and, in the universe of the book series, discovered DNA, called Life Threads in their world. Neutral: The Ottoman Empire, despite being a society with a Clanker-oriented economy, has yet to enter the war. * Switzerland can be considered politically neutral as it is mentioned in the book several times that it is the last place for fugitives and that just by being there, the British are breaking the terms of its neutrality. Their economy seems to be Clanker-based. * The United States of America is mentioned as neutral in Behemoth, with a fusion of Clanker and Darwinist technologies. The country is split between the two: Clankers in the North (based on its industry) and Darwinist in the South (based on its agriculture). The country joins the war by the end of Goliath on the Darwinist side, three years earlier than in real time history. * Portugal, Spain and Italy appear to be Darwinist nations that have yet to join in the war. Warfare technology used Clanker machines Clankers made machines mostly large in order to have great effect *Cyklops Storm-walker: a two-legged machine designed for combat. Alek and his men use one to escape to Switzerland. *Zeppelin: a dirigible designed for air travel, transport and combat. The Germans use several to try and destroy the Leviathan. *Dreadnought: an enormous land ship with side-mounted cannons. Essentially designed for combat, with a lower deck for its scouts, it can be used for travel thanks to its six legs. * Aeroplane: a plane designed for air combat, used to attempt to take down the Leviathan. Darwinist creations Darwinists created animal-weapons in order to do greater damage, have better agility. *Leviathan: the name of a large, fabricated airwhale that Deryn and Alek travel on. It is a living ecosystem, using the whale cilia for flight, bacteria to make hydrogen, bees to make honey, and strafing hawks and fléchette bats for battle (see below). *Minotaur: the name of an airship similar to the Leviathan where Deryn's brother Jaspert serves. *\\"Huxleys\\": giant jellyfish-like creatures fabricated from the life threads of the medusa jellyfish. These creatures breathe hydrogen and are similar in function to hot-air balloons. Usually these are used to scout overhead. They are named after Thomas Henry Huxley, a renowned biologist known as Darwin's Bulldog for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. *Message lizards: fabricated lizards used aboard the Leviathan and other Darwinist creations and buildings. They only repeat what they hear. *Strafing hawks: the Leviathan's main defence. When armed with acidic spider webs on their wings, they are capable of slicing through metal. *Fléchette bats: bats fabricated with moth and mosquito threads. These bats are able to ingest and release metal spikes in \\"the usual manner\\". *Hydrogen sniffers: dog-like creatures bred to sniff for hydrogen leaks on an airship. *Kraken: a sea creature designed for ocean battles. *Behemoth: a sea creature like a Kraken that is bigger and stronger. *Elephantine: a large elephant like creature. Development Leviathan and its subsequent sequels stand out notably to other young adult novels that are published in recent years for featuring illustrations in-between its pages. The idea of incorporating illustrations into them began back in 2007 when author Westerfeld had discovered illustrations for the Japanese translation of his earlier work Uglies, to which he had shared them on his blog. He was met with feedback from English-speaking fans who complained of how their novels were lacking in such features; until one reader pointed out how they are a norm in Japanese novels, particularly light novels. Further research by Westerfeld also found it to be a commonality in old Western novels prior to the invention of the camera. Inspiration also came from adventure novels that were around during the World War I era, which became one basis of research for the series' settings. Reception Leviathan received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, and was compared to works by Hayao Miyazaki, Kenneth Oppel and Naomi Novik, but promised that the novel could \\"stand—or fly—on its own.\\" It also gained a starred review from School Library Journal, who said it was \\"Full of nonstop action\\" and that \\"This steampunk adventure is sure to become a classic.\\" The ALSC selected it as a 2010 Notable Children's Book and the YALSA listed it on their 2010 Best Books for Young Adults. In addition, Leviathan won the 2009 Aurealis Award for Best Young Adult Novel. Historical liberties The novel is an alternate history story of events around World War I. The author closes the book with an explanation of what events were real and which were fictional. *In reality, the Archduke and the princess were shot while riding in a coach during the day. In the novel, they survive this attempt, only to be poisoned that night. *It was once speculated that the Austrian and/or German government arranged for the death of the Archduke either as an excuse for war, or for their distaste for his politics. This theory was discredited much later in the 21st century. *Archduke Franz Ferdinand actually had three children, not one, and none of them were named Aleksandar. However, like Alek, these children did not inherit their father's land or title because of the nature of their mother's heritage. *The Archduke really did petition the Pope to have the conditions of his morganatic marriage adjusted, but in reality he was unsuccessful. *In the novel, Charles Darwin not only made discoveries into evolution and biology, but also DNA and genetics and how to manipulate them, which is what allowed the creation of the fabricated creatures used by the British. Exactly how fabricated creatures are made is never explained. In reality, the structure of DNA was not discovered until the 1950s. *Dr. Nora Barlow was a real person, the granddaughter of Charles Darwin. However she was a geneticist, not a diplomat. *Dr. Barlow's pet, Tazza, a thylacine, is a real animal and would have been alive at the time of the story, however the real Nora Barlow never owned one as a pet. *The first armored fighting vehicle did not enter battle until 1916, and used treads like farm tractors instead of legs, a concept that Alek dismisses as \\"preposterous\\" (likely as a joke).

Its first edition was issued by Editora Abril. on March 20, 1970, and since then the it has become the most successful sports publication in Brazil, even though it focuses fully on football It is currently published by Editora Caras. History First weekly period The magazine was published on a weekly basis throughout the 1970s, and the 1980s, until August 1990. It was launched just before the 1970 World Cup, in order to fill the void of a national publication about the sport, and Pelé was featured on the cover of the first edition, which sold almost 200,000 copies.\\"38 anos da Placar\\" , Placar.com.br, March 31, 2008 The magazine defended the modernization of the administration of Brazilian football, and on issues number 23 and 24, in 1970, a series of articles by Michel Laurence and Narciso James proposed many changes, among them the creation of a forsooth national championship, which would be created in 1971.\\"Placar, o iniciador da revolução\\", Fausto Neto, Placar number 31, Editora Abril, October 16, 1970, page 36 Consolidation In the very beginning, the sales were a success: it sold over 100,000 weekly copies during the 1970 World Cup. But, after the end of the tournament, sales dropped to an average of 40,000 copies.Entrevista com Juca Kfouri , September 28, 2007, page 4 In order to reduce costs, in 1972 a pullout was created, starting with the number 131. Made with cheaper paper, it contained the \\"Tabelão\\", a listing of results and boxscores the magazine called \\"the Official Diary of Brazilian football\\".\\"O garoto do Placar\\", Placar number 115, May 26, 1972, Editora Abril, page 17 It also featured \\"fresher\\" news, such as the weekend games, while the magazine itself brought more timeless articles, such as profiles and columns about games from the previous week. The pullout was canceled by late 1974. Sales were sustained mostly by the same football lottery that later would be target of an investigation by the magazine. With tips and collective bets, in 1972 Placar sold 250,000 copies one week because of an article about the lottery.Paulo Vinicius Coelho, Jornalismo Esportivo, Editora Contexto, 2003, page 98 \\"Football Lottery Mafia\\" In 1979, Milton Coelho da Graça, then-director of Placar, explained to Juca Kfouri, then-director of special projects who handled the section about the football lottery, that he had been noticing some coincidences when few people won.Carlos Alencar, Juca Kfouri: O Militante da Notícia, Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, 2006, page 45 Milton asked, and Kfouri went to Brasília and asked to see the winning tickets, but was denied with an allegation of bank secrecy.Carlos Alencar, Juca Kfouri: O Militante da Notícia, Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, 2006, page 49 In the same year, Milton left Abril, and Kfouri was promoted to his post. Still suspecting about the lottery, every end of month he incited the newsroom, to no avail: \\"Who is man enough to uncover the unfairness of the soccer lottery?\\"Carlos Alencar, Juca Kfouri: O Militante da Notícia, Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, 2006, page 51 During another trip to Brasília, he asked again to see the winning tickets. This time, some were shown: \\"One put a triple bet in games other people would try to guess,\\" Kfouri told later. \\"Corinthians x Juventus, triple. Flamengo x Olaria, triple. Vasco x Botafogo, Vasco. Atlético-PR x Coritiba, Coritiba. Inter x Livramento, triple. It's not possible. They play the triple bet in easy games and simple bets in hard ones. There's something strange here.\\"Carlos Alencar, Juca Kfouri: O Militante da Notícia, Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, 2006, page 53 End of weekly editions Other efforts were made to try and reach new audiences, such as in 1984, when the magazine opened a larger room for sports other than football. The experience lasted from April to November, when the other sports, along with the slogan \\"All sports\\" (\\"Todos os esportes\\"), were dropped from the cover and started to receive less attention from the magazine. In September 1985, for the 800th edition, the traditional \\"Tabelão\\" section, with the listing of local boxscores and results from abroad, was removed because it was deemed too expensive.Entrevista com Juca Kfouri , September 28, 2007, page 5 One year later, in September 1986, the section made its comeback after protests of over 600 readers,Placar number 858, Editora Abril, November 3, 1986, page 15 by mail and phone. At first, the section covered just the 1986 Brazilian League,Placar number 850, Editora Abril, 8 de setembro de 1986, page 15 but later, gradually, it was extended to other tournaments. With stagnated sales numbers since 1985,Paulo Vinicius Coelho, Jornalismo Esportivo, Editora Contexto, 2003, page 84 another effort was made in 1988, with a bigger format, less pages and a cheaper paper, in a phase known as Placar Mais. In the outset, it became Abril's best-selling magazine, even though it turned a loss if too many copies were sold, hence a limit was set. The good times didn't last long, though, since the magazine never sold much ad pages. The fatal blow came with the Brazilian flop in the 1990 World Cup, that was aggravated by the terrible campaigns of the bigger teams in the 1990 Paulista League (small clubs Bragantino and Novorizontino made the finals that year) and the controversial finals of the Carioca League (the title was decided in the courts). Placar always turned a profit with commemorative editions of titles, but that year this option wasn't available, and Abril decided to stop investing in a weekly football magazine.Entrevista com Juca Kfouri , September 28, 2007, page 2 After years of bad results (between 1979, and 1995, the magazine's results were in the black for just three years), cuts were made in the newsroom,Carlos Alencar, Juca Kfouri: O Militante da Notícia, Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, 2006, pages. 44-45 and the magazine was no longer published weekly. Just one year earlier, the letter from the editor of the 1,000th issue stated that Placar reached that milestone \\"healthy\\" and with average sales of 127,000 copies.Placar number 1.000, Editora Abril, August 1989, page 3 Thematic editions A special about Pelé's 50th birthday, had sales of 99,700 of the 100,000 copies that were printed.Carlos Alencar, Juca Kfouri: O Militante da Notícia, Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, 2006, page 104 The special edition even earned Placar an Esso Prize, the third the magazine has won.Placar number 1.101, Editora Abril, March 1995, page 48 The success of that edition made Kfouri propose that Abril kept a line of thematic magazines with a small newsroom. Abril approved the idea, as long as there was no periodicity, but the timetable for 1991 called for 12 issues. \\"We made the 12,\\" recalled Kfouri. \\"No one mentioned the magazine as 'Placar, Abril's monthly football magazine', but it was a fact that it was monthly. And its results began to live in the black ink.\\" The only months when there was no numbered editions were December 1993, July 1994, August 1994 and February 1995. The magazine maintained its critic position of the Brazilian football brass, which made the president of Federação Paulista de Futebol, Eduardo José Farah, deny the publication's photographers entrance on the field for the 1991 Brazilian League finals, between Bragantino and São Paulo, in Bragança Paulista.\\"Clubes aprovam Paulistão 2002\\", Estadão.com.br, December 26, 2001 During the 1994 World Cup, special editions were launched after every game the Brazilian national team played. They were produced directly in Brazil with inferior paper, but the sales, weak for the first edition, grew steadily after each game. Starting with the fourth special edition, the sales were satisfactory, and the commemorative edition after the title sold over 500,000 copies. The series produced a profit of 500,000 dollars.Paulo Vinicius Coelho, Jornalismo Esportivo, Editora Contexto, 2003, page 104 This was the era when the magazine had its higher figure for a price: in August 1993, it cost 290,000 cruzeiros reais. \\"Futebol, sexo e rock 'n roll\\" The success generated by the 1994 World Cup editions and the Brazilian victory itself triggered big changes starting April 1995, just after the magazine celebrated its 25th anniversary. Those changes included the exits of every journalist of the newsroom, except Manoel Coelho and Paulo Vinicius Coelho.Paulo Vinicius Coelho, Jornalismo Esportivo, Editora Contexto, 2003, page 52 Approximately 1 million dollars were invested, with young adults as a target.\\"A Placar está de cara nova\\", Gazeta Mercantil, 4 April 1995, pageina C-7 The new slogan would be \\"Futebol, sexo e rock 'n roll\\" (\\"Football, Sex and Rock 'n Roll\\"). The format was also changed, to 27,5 cm x 35,8 cm, and, for the first time in its history, Placar sold subscriptions. American designer Roger Black was charged with the graphical project. The first edition of the new phase, with Edmundo as cover athlete, sold 350,000 copies.Entrevista com Juca Kfouri , September 28, 2007, page 3 Just a few months later, Kfouri left Placar and Abril because of interferences by the brass with the magazine. To Abril, it was not interesting to denounce Brazilian soccer brass in a pullout that circulated with the monthly editions, because it feared for the TV contracts TVA, also from Abril, had.Carlos Alencar, Juca Kfouri: O Militante da Notícia, Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, 2006, pages. 110-111 Roberto Civita, Abril's president, offered Kfouri the name of the magazine for a price, since Placar didn't turn a profit and the publisher would also get rid of the possibility of being sued again, but the negotiations didn't go any further.Carlos Alencar, Juca Kfouri: O Militante da Notícia, Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, 2006, page 112 During the next few years, a few visual (such as yet another new format, to 22,6 cm x 29,9 cm, in 1996) and content (football once again was the main theme) adjustments were made. During the 1998 World Cup, Placar again published special editions after each Brazilian game, but, this time, many professionals were sent to host country France — even the page design was made there. The huge costs and the sagging sales (compared to the previous World Cup) made for a flop. Second weekly phase and current format Once again, Placar was being published sporadically, albeit in a larger quantity than the previous \\"sporadic period\\", in 1990. Each special, even the simultaneous ones, was numbered. But in May 2003 the magazine was back to a monthly periodicity, and the specials no longer followed the numbering. In March 2008, an article about TV color man and former player Casagrande's internment raised a controversy,\\"Casão — fim\\" , Alberto Helena Jr., Blog do Helena, April 1, 2008 with journalists defending and criticizing\\"Sociedade não precisa saber da vida de Casão\\", Ubiratan Leal, Balípodo, April 3, 2008 the magazine's posture. Bola de Prata Bola de Prata is an annual award given by Placar to the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A best players from each position. Each player is given a rating after every match they play. The players with highest average rating from each position are awarded the Bola de Prata. The player with highest average rating overall is awarded the Bola de Ouro.

Michelle Forbes, who played Paul's wife in the first season, made two brief appearances in the second season. Production on Season 2 began in New York City in the fall and wrapped up in early 2009. According to The New York Times, production relocated to New York from Los Angeles at the insistence of Byrne, who otherwise threatened to resign. The move and the addition of Sunday night to the schedule were considered votes of confidence in the series by HBO executives. HBO Canada, a multiplex channel that includes The Movie Network in Eastern Canada and Movie Central in Western Canada, aired the program simultaneously with HBO in the U.S. During the first few weeks of Season 1, episodes were available on HBO's website in streaming video. The free service was discontinued, however, when Apple's iTunes and Amazon Unbox began offering the first 15 shows for download. In July 2020, it was reported that HBO was developing a reboot of the series. Plot Set in Baltimore, psychotherapist Dr. Paul Weston has a private practice where he carries out sessions with his patients in his own home. He begins to question his own abilities and motives, so he seeks help from his former mentor and therapist Dr. Gina Toll, whom he has not seen for ten years. Characters Paul Weston Gabriel Byrne portrays Paul Weston, a charming, relentless psychologist, who is seeking his own peaceful existence, free of self-doubt and ambivalence. Paul is a graduate of Georgetown University, where he earned his undergraduate degree, Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree and The New School, where he received his PhD (however, there is a scene in season one in which two diplomas from the University of Pennsylvania are displayed near the door to Paul's office). In summer 1988, he moved to Maryland, where he worked at the Washington–Baltimore Psychoanalytic Institute and later established his private practice in Baltimore. Gina Toll Dianne Wiest portrays psychotherapist Gina Toll, Paul Weston's former mentor and clinical supervisor whom Paul avoided for nine years after an argument over reservations expressed by Gina in a letter of recommendation on Paul's behalf. She acts as a sounding board for Paul's doubts about his own motives and abilities. Season summaries Each episode of In Treatment focuses on one patient, including Paul, who is seeing his clinical supervisor and psychotherapist, Gina. Season 1 Therapy patient Laura, professes her love for Paul, which causes their relationship to grow more complex and difficult to control. Laura's personal issues include being seduced by a much older man when she was a teenager. She begins an unsatisfying sexual relationship with Alex, another of Paul’s patients. Paul reflects on his own feelings for her and believes that he is in love with her, however sessions with Gina fail to resolve his inner conflict over his desire and professional responsibility. Midway through the season, Laura ends her therapy with Paul after he continues to reject her advances. Paul and Laura encounter each other at Alex's funeral, and later Paul decides pursue Laura at the risk of destroying his marriage, but a panic attack prevents him from going through with it. Alex, a fighter pilot who finds it impossible to express his internal struggles, meets Laura and has a brief affair with her. Paul tries to get Alex to break through to his reasons for running himself to exhaustion and examine his feelings about killing Iraqi schoolchildren during a sanctioned mission. Alex drifts into instability, eventually deciding to end his therapy, and returns to the military just as Paul begins to make progress with Alex's repressed insecurities. Alex is killed during a training exercise, and although his death is ruled an accident, some indications suggest that Alex's death may have been a suicidal reaction caused by the trauma of therapeutic reflection. Sophie's ambivalence to life is elicited and broken down by Paul, who is able to successfully examine her underage sexual relationship with her much-older gymnastics coach Cy and its effects on her, in addition to her conflicted feelings about her divorced parents and her father's distance from her. Eventually, Sophie benefits greatly from her therapy with Paul and begins to repair her relationship with her parents. At the end of the season, Sophie leaves Baltimore to pursue further gymnastic training in Denver. Jake and Amy's debate regarding whether or not she should have an abortion is just the prologue to an extremely volatile, dysfunctional relationship. During their second therapy session, Amy experiences a miscarriage, but the couple returns to therapy to work on their issues. Amy's inability to hold emotional connection leads her to have an affair with her boss, a man she finds \\"gross\\" but uses as a buffer against her husband. Jake and Amy each have an individual sessions, and finally and sadly decide to end their tumultuous marriage and share custody of their son. Jake believes that the therapy was helpful, but Amy thinks it hurt their marriage. Throughout the season, Gina and Paul confront each other over issues regarding their shared history and opposing views, but by the finale Paul realizes he needs her input and agrees to continue therapy. The first season consists of 43 episodes, with each episode airing on their allotted day of the week, Monday to Friday. The episodes were spread over nine weeks for most of the characters, except in the final week, which did not have Monday or Tuesday night installments. {  width=\\"98%\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: silver; color: #000000; text- align:left;\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Main Characters - ! style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Actor ! style=\\"width:9em;\\"  Character ! style=\\"width:6em;\\"  Weekday !

He is served with a malpractice lawsuit from Alex's father in the first episode, and becomes preoccupied with the consequences. Alex Sr. sues Paul for negligence, charging him with failing to prevent the death of his son Alex Jr., a former patient who voluntarily discontinued therapy and was killed in a plane crash that was either an accident or suicide. Alex, Sr. and his lawyers contend that Paul's professional responsibility was to contact the military and report Alex, Jr. unfit for duty. (from season 1). Alex Sr. later meets with Paul and makes a loaded offer: if Paul writes a letter taking blame for Alex Jr.'s death, he will drop the lawsuit against him, satisfied to have his belief that Paul is 100% at fault confirmed. Paul's personal neurotic and self-aggrandizing behavior was a significant theme throughout the series. He identified with all of his patients' issues and interpersonal conflicts on some level. Ironically, he was their composite personality, except he was intended to be the resolution expert. His self-doubt and feelings of personal inadequacy revealed over the seven weeks made him appear even more vulnerable than those he was treating. As the final episode drew to a close, Paul pulled the plug on his own desire for treatment, with the same ambivalence his patients had exhibited. Was it really making a difference? Alex's father has a meeting where he makes this offer: he will drop his lawsuit if Paul will write him a letter taking 100% of the blame for Alex's death. Paul considers this offer but later concurs with Gina's advice and tells Alex Sr. his offer is rejected. The lawsuit was dismissed as frivolous, and his angst involving his professional competency was alleviated, at least temporarily. The final symbolic message Paul delivered to his audience by that decision was, there are times in one's life when therapy is valuable for a person to become more grounded in reality. However, more often than not, therapy alone only serves as a road map to find a patient's way in the world. Paul realizes he \\"needs to stop analyzing his life and needs to start living it\\". Given enough time and patience, and by accepting that there are past events that cannot be controlled or changed, everything in life tends to work out by itself and not by recreation or reparation of former deeds. The season had seven episodes for each character. The \\"Monday\\" and \\"Tuesday\\" sessions aired back-to-back on Sundays, while the remaining three ran on Mondays. HBO repeated the episodes in sequence, several times each week. The season's executive producer was Warren Leight, who previously worked on Law and Order: Criminal Intent. {  width=\\"98%\\" ! style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Actor ! style=\\"width:9em;\\"  Character ! style=\\"width:6em;\\"  Weekday !

The format is similar, each week, a series of patients visit psychotherapist Paul Weston in half-hour episodes, while in the last, Paul visits his own therapist who is Adele Brouse rather than Gina Toll who appeared in the first two seasons. Also, there are only three patients this time around, and their stories offer a similar depth to the previous seasons. Paul still lives in Cobble Hill in Brooklyn though he does now have a young girlfriend, Wendy. On Mondays, he meets with Sunil, a widower transported to New York from Calcutta following the death of his wife, to live with his son, his son’s wife and their two young children. Tuesday’s patient is Frances, a self-described successful actress who has returned to the stage, but has difficulty remembering her lines. She’s also coping with a dying sister, a broken marriage and a scornful teenage daughter. On Wednesdays Paul sees Jesse, a high school student who believes his adopted parents hate him because he is gay though he is also bitter, abusive and manipulative. Paul eventually re-enters therapy with the young psychoanalyst Adele Brouse, initially seeking a prescription for sleep medication, but she accurately perceives that lack of sleep is not his real problem. The show remained set in Paul's apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the same location of his office in season 2. Unlike its first two seasons, the third season contained only four episodes per week. The show aired on Mondays and Tuesdays and, like season 2, had seven weeks of sessions. Following the final episode of the second season, Leight said in an interview that a third season remained a possibility, but pointed out that the show had been exhausting for everyone involved and also somewhat less than a \\"breakout hit\\" for HBO. However, on October 23, 2009, HBO announced that it had picked up In Treatment for a third season. Production began in early 2010 for a premiere in late October. {  width=\\"98%\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: silver; color: #000000; text-align:left;\\" colspan=\\"5\\"Main Characters - ! style=\\"width:12em;\\"  Actor ! style=\\"width:9em;\\"  Character ! style=\\"width:6em;\\"  Weekday !

Sunil talks to Paul even though psychotherapy is stigmatized in his culture. -  Debra Winger  Frances  Tuesday  A successful actress, Frances comes to see Paul because she is having trouble remembering her lines Meanwhile, she is troubled that her sister has breast cancer like her mother, and fears that she is next. -  Dane DeHaan  Jesse  Wednesday  A homosexual teenager living with his adoptive parents, Jesse harbors significant anger toward them and himself.

The final result was the ending of the series, with the third season being the last. Critical response The series was generally well-received, attaining positive reviews. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 70/100, the second season scored 85/100, and the third season scored 83/100. The Los Angeles Times Mary McNamara called it \\"cleverly conceived,\\" well-written and -acted, though \\"stagey\\" and \\"strain[ing]... believability\\". Variety's Brian Lowry deemed it \\"more interesting structurally than in its execution\\". On Slate, Troy Patterson found it tiresome for its \\"nattering\\" and \\"ambitious hogwash\\". In Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker gave it a \\"B+\\", with \\"lots of great soapy intrigue\\". The New York Times praised the show: \\"In Treatment [...] is hypnotic, mostly because it withholds information as intelligently as it reveals it. [...] The half-hour episodes are addictive, and few viewers are likely to be satisfied with just one session at a time. [...] In Treatment provides an irresistible peek at the psychopathology of everyday life—on someone else's tab.\\" Differences from BeTipul The script of the first season of In Treatment was heavily based on BeTipul's Hebrew script, and the Israeli writers are credited in the episodes' final credits. The following are the main differences between the shows: * In Treatment skips the first 2 episodes of the last week, unlike BeTipul, making its first season two episodes shorter. * In Treatment's episode 36, which takes place outside of the therapist's office, is completely absent in BeTipul. * Paul's interactions with his son Ian have no equivalent in BeTipul, as the therapist's oldest son is away in the army for the entire first season. Instead, that entire episode is dedicated to the therapist's talk with his daughter, which is interrupted in the American episode. * The treated pilot's military association. * The treated pilot's father's life and cultural background and his difficult experiences with his father. (In the Israeli version, the pilot's father is a Holocaust survivor.) * Avi Belleli's opening theme was considerably shortened for the American series. * In season 2 of BeTipul, Oliver is the son of the characters who receive couple's therapy in season 1. * In season 2 of BeTipul, April's brother has bipolar disorder, not autism as in the American version. * Season 3 stories of In Treatment are completely new and have no affiliation with the original show as BeTipul only ran for two seasons.

He held the position from 1966 until his death in March 2014. His tenure as an Orthodox bishop was the longest serving in American history. Education Saliba was educated at Balamand Orthodox Theological Seminary in Lebanon and at schools in Syria. He later studied in England at the Anglican Kelham Theological College and the University of London. After moving to the United States he studied at Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology and at Wayne State University, where he received a B.A. in history. On March 1, 1959, Saliba was ordained to the priesthood by Metropolitan Anthony (Bashir) and assigned to the pastorate at Saint George Church in Cleveland, Ohio. He undertook graduate theological studies at Saint Vladimir Orthodox Theological Seminary in Yonkers, New York, and was graduated from that institution with a Master of Divinity degree in 1965. In March 1966, the Antiochian Archdiocese, meeting in special convention, nominated Saliba to succeed the late Metropolitan Anthony (Bashir) as Archbishop of New York and Metropolitan of all North America. In July of that year, the Patriarchal Vicar for the widowed See of New York, Metropolitan Ilyas (Kurban), Archbishop of Tripoli, elevated Saliba to an archimandrite. Saliba was elected for the See of New York by the Holy Synod of the Antiochian Patriarchate on August 5, 1966, and on August 14 was consecrated to the episcopacy by Patriarch Theodosios VI (Abourjaily) at the Monastery of the Prophet Elias in Dhour Shouier, Lebanon. Saliba was enthroned at the Cathedral of Saint Nicholas in Brooklyn, New York, on October 13, 1966. In 1977, the two Antiochian Jurisdictions in North America merged. Bishop Philip was chosen to lead them. Twenty years after the radical nineteen-sixties, the Jesus People were losing steam and some of them had begun pursuing New Testament Christianity forming the Evangelical Orthodox Church. After studying the ancient Church through to the time of the East-West Schism contact was made with the Greek Archdiocese and the Orthodox Church in America. The EOC leaders, led by Fr. Peter E. Gillquist, approached Metropolitan Philip. After an extended process Metropolitan Philip brought 17 Evangelical Orthodox Parishes into the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America.

His presidency of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, starting the year Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, was crucial in that organization’s ability to assert its independence from National Socialist policies. Education Mey studied physics and mathematics at the Humboldt University of Berlin from 1897. He received his doctorate in 1902 under Emil Warburg; his thesis was on the cathode gradient of alkali metals.Karl Mey Über das Kathodengefälle der Alkalimetalle, Annalen der Physik Volume 316, Issue 5, pp.127-145 (1903) Career After receipt of his doctorate, Mey was employed at the Militärversuchsamt Tegel and then at the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts- Gesellschaft, where he specialized in research and development of incandescent light bulbs. He became head of the AEG light bulb factory in 1909.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Karl Mey. During World War I, from 1914 to 1917, he served in the infantry and saw action at the Western Front. After the war, Mey was again employed at AEG. After the merger of AEG, the Auer Company, and Siemens & Halske into Osram AG in Berlin, he supervised the whole research and development branch. Mey was active in a number of professional organizations and held offices in them. Circa 1931, he became vice-chairman of the Deutsche Glastechnische Gesellschaft (German Technical Glass Society).Deutsche Glastechnische Gesellschaft Web Site: DGG From 1931 to 1945, he was president of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für technische Physik (German Society for Technical Physics). During the period 1933 to 1935, he was the president of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (Acronym: DPG; translation: German Physical Society.). With Mey being elected president of the DPG during the year that Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, as opposed to the Nobel Laureate Johannes Stark, who was a supporter of the anti- Semitic Deutsche Physik, the DPG asserted its independence from slavishly following National Socialist policies.Hoffmann, 2005, p. 307. In May 1945, Mey was arrested by Russian forces as a “leading military industrialist” and deported to the Soviet Union.

It is part of WMS' SuperPin line of widebody games. Country singer Carlene Carter provided the voice of Red, and her song, \\"Every Little Thing\\", is featured in the game. The game is considered an unofficial successor of FunHouse, as both were designed by Pat Lawlor and feature animated talking head(s) along with some similar playfield layout ideas. It is equipped with a shaker motor to make the machine vibrate and has two manual plungers, one on each side of the cabinet. It was the first pinball machine to feature an additional daily highscore list. Gameplay The primary goal is to help Red and Ted, a pair of road construction workers, travel through the United States from east to west. The player can visit a total of 18 different cities/states, each of which starts its own scoring mode as listed below. * New York - Smash a Cab * Miami - Spring Break * Atlanta - Worker Trapped * Ohio (Turnpike)- Trapped in Ohio * New Orleans - Mardi Gras * Nashville - Change the Station (2 Ball Multiball) * Chicago - Evil Toll Roads * Dallas - Monster Cab * Kansas City - Tornado (2 Ball Multiball) * Minnesota/Minneapolis - Frozen People * Albuquerque - Trading Post (Sell Souvenirs) * Denver - Gold Rush * Butte - Tunnel Hunt * Salt Lake City - Old West * Las Vegas - Slot Machine * Seattle - Alien Invasion * San Francisco - Monster Attack * Los Angeles - Earthshaker (reminiscence to Earthshaker!) The game features a \\"wizard mode\\" called Super Payday, which can be started by visiting any of the last three cities in the above list and locking two balls as indicated on the display and playfield before the mode timer runs out. Up to five extra balls can be earned per play; a score award is given for each one earned thereafter.
