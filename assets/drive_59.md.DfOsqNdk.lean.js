It is Aarne–Thompson type 401, the girl transformed into an animal. Synopsis A queen wished her naughty daughter would turn into a raven and fly away, so she could have some peace, and her wish was instantly fulfilled. She flew away to a forest. In the forest, a man heard a raven tell him she was an enchanted princess, and he could deliver her if he went to a certain cottage and accepted no food from the old woman there. The raven would drive by in a carriage every day for three days. If he remained awake, he would break the spell. Each day, the old woman persuaded him to drink but one sip, and each day, overcome by weariness, he was fast asleep by the time the raven drove past. On the final day, the raven left the sleeping man a bottle of wine, a loaf, and a piece of meat, all three of which were inexhaustible and put a gold ring with her name on his finger. She also gave him a letter telling him there was another way he might deliver her: by coming to the golden castle of Stromberg. The man wandered, looking for the castle, and found a giant who threatened to eat him, but the man fed him with his magical provisions. Then the giant brought out his map, which displayed all the towns, villages and houses in the land – but not the castle. He asked the man to wait until his brother came home. The brother was able to find the castle on an older map, but it was thousands of miles away. The brother agreed to carry the man to within a hundred leagues of the castle, and the man walks the rest. As the man approached the glass mountain on which the golden castle stood, he could see the bewitched princess drive her carriage around the castle and go in. But the glass mountain was too slippery for him to climb, and he lived in a hut at the foot of the mountain for a year. One day he met three robbers fighting over three magical items: a stick that opened doors, an invisibility mantle, and a horse that could ride up the glass-mountain. The man offered them a mysterious reward in exchange for the items, but he insisted on first trying them out, to see if they worked as promised. After he had mounted the horse, taken the stick, and was made invisible by the cloak, he hit the robbers with his stick and rode up the glass mountain. He used the stick and mantle to get into the castle and threw his ring into the princess's cup. She couldn't find her rescuer though she searched the entire castle, until he finally revealed himself by throwing off the mantle. They were married.

It is a traditional flavor source used in the fermentation of the wash of Jamaican rum. Similar in process to sour mash in Bourbon whiskey, it is a crucial step in achieving an authentic rum flavor. In Europe, waste liquors from alcohol distillation are referred to as vinasse. Dunder contains many by-products that help in future fermentations, including dead yeast cells, which are an excellent yeast nutrient. Subsequent fermentations using dunder must be carefully controlled to prevent stress on the yeast which will cause a greater amount of mutations. Also if planning to store dunder before use it is advised to refrigerate the dunder to suppress cell division as to prevent mutations. These mutations change flavor, alcohol content, and overall affect consistency of the finished product. Dunder, if not used to re-pitch the yeast colony, can also be applied as fertilizer. Traditionally, 20% to 35% of a new wash is dunder from one or more previous washes. This lowers pH, conserves liquid, provides yeast nutrient, and concentrates two critical flavoring esters (\\"rum oils\\") to ensure good rum flavor. Also traditionally, after a run, the spent liquid from the still (dunder) was tossed in \\"the dunder pit\\", where it would settle, and where bacterial action would develop the rum oils. It was then removed to make wash as needed. References Category:Yeasts ","title":"Dunder"},{"id":"2550185","text":"Akiyama (written: lit. \\"autumn mountain\\") is a Japanese surname.

Course and features Mangroves on the shores of Salt Pan Creek. Salt Pan Creek rises west southwest of the suburb of Mount Lewis, within the City of Canterbury-Bankstown local government area, and flows generally south by east through Georges River local government area, before reaching its confluence with the Georges River, at Riverwood. The catchment area of the creek is approximately , and is subject to flooding due to vegetation modification and urban development. Vegetation in the catchment area consists of three endangered ecological species, including coastal saltmarsh, Cooks River Castlereagh Ironbark Forest, and Shale / Sandstone Transition Forest. Vegetation varies substantially throughout the catchment area and includes freshwater environments, estuarine environments, mangroves and saltmarshes, riparian and terrestrial environments, which provide important habitat for native fauna. History From as early as 1809, the land surrounding Salt Pan Creek was the site of uprising by Australian Aborigines against colonial settlement. Tedbury, the son of Pemulwuy, an Aboriginal elder, was involved in a skirmish that saw Frederick Meredith, a European settler, injured with a spear and forced to abandon his farm. It is understood that Meredith and another settler, sought to clear and cultivate land surrounding the creek that may have been an important food source for Aborigines. Between 1926 and 1935, lands surrounding the creek became a focal point for indigenous rights, as they set up squatter camps that consisted of refugee families whose traditional lands had been resumed and also those seeking to escape the Aboriginal Protection Board. Salt Pan Creek was named by early colonial settlers, who took salt from the swampland by evaporating the salt water.

Written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon, it originally aired February 29, 2000 on the WB Television Network. Plot :Note: Buffy and Faith will be referred to by the character they are, rather than the body they're in. Buffy, in Faith's body, is abducted by the Watchers Council's team. Meanwhile Faith, in Buffy's body, gives herself a makeover and heads to The Bronze, where she has ruthless fun at the expense of Spike and Tara. Tara recognizes that something is wrong, and she and Willow perform a spell to find the real Buffy. Faith visits Riley and has sex with him while Buffy escapes the Council's team and heads back to Sunnydale in search of Giles and her friends. Buffy convinces Giles of her identity with the help of Willow and Tara. Meanwhile, Adam convinces a group of vampires of their superiority and they attack a church. Faith tries to leave town, but after seeing what's happening on the news, goes to the church to help while Buffy does the same. Faith and Riley each kill one of the three gang members, but the leader overpowers Faith. Before he can kill her, Buffy stakes him from behind. They fight, and Buffy (with the help of Willow and Tara's conjured Draconian Katra device) restores herself and Faith to their rightful bodies. Faith subsequently escapes and leaves town, and Buffy discovers that Riley had sex with Faith during the body swap. Production In a scene where Faith in Buffy's body tries to seduce Riley, the camera \\"cut[s] to a medium close-up shot of her leather-clad backside\\", ostensibly Riley's point-of-view shot. Jason Middleton notes that this is a rare case where the audience's gaze is \\"positioned in a highly fetishistic relation towards Buffy's body\\". However, Middleton notes, the show disavows this viewing position by reminding the audience that it is Faith's positioning the body, connoting its \\"look-at-me- ness\\"; Buffy herself is disconnected from this image of her body. Riley, with whom the viewer is identified, disavows the shot by appearing confused and taken aback rather than sexually predatory. Middleton concludes this covertly allows \\"a scopophilic position ... for the viewer, even as the show disavows this position\\". Eliza Dushku is credited \\"as Buffy\\" in guest starring credits, not as Faith, to reflect the plot of the episode. Analysis Gregory Stevenson, in Televised Morality: The Case of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, finds it significant that Faith's moment where she \\"confesses the truth about herself and begins to experience the weight of moral responsibility\\" occurs in a church. In their book discussing existentialism in Buffy, Richardson and Rabb argue that this episode and the previous (intended or not) explore the impact of Sartre's Look - the outside view that causes a person to redefine themselves from the perspective of the Other. Faith can now literally see herself as Buffy sees her. When the real Buffy escapes from the Watchers’ Council and challenges Faith, the two fight, and Faith (in Buffy’s body) repeatedly punches her own face in a fit of self-loathing, shouting, \\"You’re nothing! Disgusting, murderous bitch! You're nothing! You're disgusting!\\" According to Richardson and Rabb, \\"Faith is finally seeing herself as Buffy sees her and is even harder on herself than Buffy has ever been.\\" Continuity =Arc significance= *Faith literally takes over Buffy's life, realizing an earlier sense of anxiety that Buffy experienced in \\"Faith, Hope & Trick\\" when Faith first arrives in Sunnydale. This theme is explored further in Season 7, particularly the episodes \\"Empty Places\\", and \\"Touched\\". *Crossover with Angel: Faith ends up escaping to Los Angeles in \\"Five by Five\\". *While in Buffy's body and thus in the Scoobies' company, Faith vividly imagines killing Willow; in \\"Sanctuary,\\" she has a similar fantasy of killing Angel. As Buffy, Faith acknowledges Willow's hatred of Faith, first expressed in \\"Choices,\\" where Willow mocked Faith's troubled past and told her that, unlike Buffy and Angel, Willow did not think Faith could ever redeem herself. Willow would later reconcile with Faith after she experiences her own spiral during Season 6, which gives her the perspective of what Faith has gone through. *When Faith flirts and teases with Spike in Buffy's body, Spike clearly reveals some of the repressed lust he harbors for Buffy, foreshadowing their later relationship. *Spike and Faith do not meet again until three years later, when the Slayer returns to Sunnydale as an ally against the First Evil. Faith reminds him of this conversation, and he clearly remembers it, noting that it is \\"not the kind of thing a man forgets.\\" *Both slayers come to understand each other a bit better. As Buffy (in Faith's body) feels how lonely, helpless Faith really is and understands how people actually treat her. Faith (in Buffy's body) starts to feel remorse and feels the power of how good it feels to help, as she helped the girl in The Bronze and was actually thanked. *Faith (in Buffy's body) becomes the first person to recognize Willow and Tara's romantic relationship when she comments that Willow \\"isn't driving stick anymore.\\" She, along with Oz in \\"New Moon Rising\\" and Spike in \\"The Yoko Factor\\", are the only characters to recognize it without being told. *This episode also contains the first explicit references stating that Tara and Willow are having a romantic relationship (previously all that had been given were \\"hints\\"). *Tara demonstrates her power, as she is the only one who recognizes that Buffy is not acting herself: the first of many times Tara sees more than meets the eye when it comes to the Scooby Gang's problems. She shows her magical knowledge, as she knows how to find out what is wrong. *Tara and Willow's spell to find Buffy in the nether realm is used as a metaphor for their first sexual experience. *Buffy (in Faith's body) convinces Giles of her identity by describing people and events from past episodes, including Ethan Rayne's transformation of Giles into a demon (\\"A New Man\\"), Giles' girlfriend Olivia (first seen in \\"The Freshman\\"), and Buffy's telepathic discovery that Giles had sex with her mother Joyce (\\"Earshot\\"). *Faith (in Buffy's body) states that \\"Faith's\\" arrest was \\"poetic justice\\". This references Faith and Buffy's earlier confrontation in \\"Graduation Day\\" in which Buffy states that sacrificing Faith's blood as a cure for Angel would be \\"poetic justice\\", as Faith was the one who poisoned him. *While Faith (in Buffy's body) is being punched by the vampire in the church, Buffy (in Faith's body) stakes the vampire from behind in the same way as Faith had done in Season 3's \\"Bad Girls\\". *Willow references \\"The Pack\\" when she refers to possession by hyena. *When Buffy is \\"not herself\\" for some reason, she often appears with crimped hair, as she does in this episode while Faith is possessing her body. This also occurs noticeably in \\"Beer Bad\\", when Buffy becomes a prehistoric version of herself, in \\"Something Blue\\", when Willow's spell causes her to become engaged to Spike and in the next episode when Jonathan bends reality. *When Faith (in Buffy's body) is talking to Tara in the Bronze, she says: \\"I guess you never really know someone 'til you've been inside their skin.\\" She is referring to a line in the book To Kill a Mockingbird: \\"You don't really know a person until you climb into their skin and walk around in it.\\" *Faith (in Buffy's body) sleeps with Riley, further complicating Buffy's relationship with him. *The episode reveals Riley is a regular churchgoer. Unlike many openly Christian TV characters, he is clearly not Christian-like about sex - not only in accepting his fellow soldiers' premarital sexual activities (and engaging in premarital sex himself in this episode) but in assisting the UC Sunnydale Lesbian Alliance in \\"Something Blue\\". *Adam begins rallying vampires to aid him in his plans. *Faith begins taking steps to rejoin the side of good. *In an instance of foreshadowing, if you look closer at Joyce's credit card, it expires in May 2001–the month Buffy dies in the episode \\"The Gift\\" (aired May 22, 2001). Faith (in Buffy's body) also words this expiration date while buying a plane ticket on the phone.

The Pacific lodge style of architecture is based loosely on vague notions of cedar lodges and log cabin dwellings of early inhabitants of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. This style can be seen in historic National Park hotels, such as the Lake Quinault Lodge, and in the houses of some wealthier Seattleites of the timber baron era. However, most early Seattleites preferred to mimic the accepted styles of the East; to this day, historical pastiches remain more popular throughout the region. History The \\"Pacific Lodge\\" style of architecture is based on necessity. The homes were made out of nearby materials, which were often cedar and stone. The stone base seen in many Pacific Lodge homes is to both accent the nature around the house, as well as to protect it from snowfall and ground water. Most \\"Pacific Lodge\\" homes have unique sizes and shapes, and this is due to the fact that historically pacific lodge homes were built out of necessity. A small house was initially built and then later modified and expanded, creating a compound look. Design Pacific Lodge homes often feature exposed wood exteriors and interiors, high ceilings with interlocking exposed beams, and large windows. Most \\"Pacific Lodge\\" houses are large due to the fact that they have to match the massive landscapes they are often built next to or on. Large angled roofs are used to keep off snow and the elements. Most roofs extend past the house a few feet to ensure that snow and water are not falling on or near the sides of the house. \\"Pacific Lodge\\" homes can range from giant mansions to tiny cabins. Architectural influences The architectural style of \\"Pacific Lodge\\" homes is based on the log homes built in the northwest and national parks in the past. The biggest influence on the \\"Pacific Lodge\\" home was the lodges built in many western National Parks that still stand today. The railroad system had a huge influence on expanding the \\"Pacific Lodge\\" style of architecture as well. Buildings were needed to house both people and goods, and builders used whatever they had lying around. This led to the idea of tying houses in with nature and using locally-sourced materials. Examples The Bill Gates estate is based on this style. 1\\\\. \\"Pacific Lodge.\\" Architectural Styles -. Windermere Real Estate, n.d. Web. 06 Dec. 2015. . 2\\\\.

Arderne's help was given to both the rich and the poor. His view on fees was that rich men should be charged as much as possible, but poor men should be remedied free of charge.

In his early life, he resided in Newark-on-Trent. It is also believed he could have lived in Nottingham. It is thought that he attended the University of Montpellier, where he was a scholar of the ancients. He was in London by 1370 when he is thought to have been admitted as a member of the Guild of Surgeons. He saw active military service in the Hundred Years' War in the army of Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster, and John of Gaunt. He fought also at the Siege of Algeciras (1342-1344), one of the first European battles in which gunpowder was used; the injuries he saw there informed his medical writings for three decades. He referred to himself as Master Surgeon in his works. He developed several treatments for knights, most notably for an infliction called \\"Fistula In Ano\\", a condition where a large, painful lump appears between the base of the spine and the anus, caused by long amounts of time sitting on a horse. He could successfully cut this lump out, and described how to do so in a historical document which still remains. In technical terms, the Fistula in Ano, without any regard to the strict definition of the word, is understood to be an abscess, running upon, or into the Intestinum Rectum; though an abscess in this part, when once ruptured, does generally, if neglected, grow callous in its cavity and edges, and become at last what is properly called a fistula. (This condition is now diagnosed as a sacrococcygeal fistula, more commonly known as a pilonidal cyst.) He also created an ointment for arrow wounds and clysters made out of hemlock, opium and henbane in 1376. He died without a male heir.

The word “skill” highlights the practical function. The term alone has a broad meaning, and describes a particular ability to complete tasks ranging from easier ones like “learning how to kick a ball” to harder ones like “learning how to be creative.\\" In this specific instance, the word “skill” has to be interpreted as the ability to master hardly controlled actions. The word “soft” is the opposite of “hard”, may appear to mean “subjective, fuzzy, and unreliable,\\" \\"but, \\"calling these skills soft or noncognitive belies their importance.\\" Because of their subjectivity, soft skills are often not assessed and yet many in business consulting argue that they lie at the foundation of what makes a leader and will determine if an employee will rise to a leadership position. Soft skills represent personal skills necessary for such activities as team work and motivating others. History The term soft skills was created by the U.S. Army in the late 1960's. It refers to any skill that does not employ the use of machinery. The military realized that many important activities were included within this category, and in fact, the social skills necessary to lead groups, motivate soldiers, and win wars were encompassed by skills they had not yet catalogued or fully studied. Since 1959, the U.S. Army has been investing a considerable amount of resources into technology-based development of training procedures. In 1968 the U.S. Army officially introduced a training doctrine known as \\"Systems Engineering of Training\\" covered in the document CON Reg 350-100-1.Silber, K.H. & Foshay, W.R., Handbook of Improving Performance in the Workplace, Instructional Design and Training Delivery, John Wiley & Sons 2009, , p.63 PG Whitmore cited the CON Reg 350-100-1 definition: \\"job-related skills involving actions affecting primarily people and paper, e.g., inspecting troops, supervising office personnel, conducting studies, preparing maintenance reports, preparing efficiency reports, designing bridge structures.\\"CON Reg 350-100-1, as cited in Whitmore, Paul G., \\"What are soft skills?\\" In 1972, thanks to an US Army training manual, the formal usage of the term \\"soft skills\\" began.Katherine S. Newman, Chutes and Ladders: Navigating the Low-wage Labor Market, Harvard University Press 2006, , p.351 At the 1972 CONARC Soft Skills Conference, Dr. Whitmore presented a reportWhitmore, Paul G., \\"What are soft skills?\\", Paper presented at the CONARC Soft Skills Conference, Texas, 12–13 December 1972Fry, John P., \\"Procedures for Implementing Soft-Skill Training in CONARC Schools,\\" Paper presented at the CONARC Soft Skills Conference, Texas, 12–13 December 1972Whitmore, Paul G.; Fry, John P., \\"Soft Skills: Definition, Behavioral Model Analysis, Training Procedures. Professional Paper 3-74.\\", Research Report ERIC Number: ED158043, 48pp. aimed at figuring out how the term \\"soft skills\\" is understood in various CONARC schools. After designing and processing a questionnaire, experts formulated a new tentative definition: \\"Soft skills are important job-related skills that involve little or no interaction with machines and whose application on the job is quite generalized.\\" They further criticized the state of the concept then as vague with a remark \\"in other words, those job functions about which we know a good deal are hard skills and those about which we know very little are soft skills.\\" Another immediate study by them also concluded in a negative tone. Psychologist Nicholas Humphrey famously stated that social intelligence, rather than qualitative intelligence, defines humans. Many industries today give prominence to the soft skills of their employees. Concept Soft skills are a cluster of productive personality traits that characterize one's relationships in a milieu. These skills can include social graces, communication abilities, language skills, personal habits, cognitive or emotional empathy, time management, teamwork and leadership traits. A definition based on review literature explains soft skills as an umbrella term for skills under three key functional elements: people skills, social skills, and personal career attributes. The importance of soft skills lies in the fact that they are not restricted to a specific field. These thinking dispositions consist of a group of abilities that can be used in every aspect of people’s lives, without any need to readapt them based on the situation. Their ductility helps “people to adapt and behave positively so that they can deal effectively with the challenges of their professional and everyday life”. Soft skills make people flexible in a world which keeps changing. The interest in soft skills has increased over the course of the years. The more researches are conducted, the more people understand the relevance of this concept. The huge amount of fund companies and worldwide organizations are investing in the training and development of this field shows this interest. The European Commission launched the program Agenda for new skills and jobs in 2012 in order to train and explain to young adults this new set of skills. Now, in the 21st century, soft skills are a major differentiator, a sine qua non for employability and success in life.Heckman and Kautz, Hard Evidence on Soft Skills, 2012 The Nobel prize James Heckman claims that “soft skills predict success in life, that they casually produce that success, and that programs that enhance soft skills have an important place in an effective portfolio of public policies”. The significance employers give to the topic is shown by the fact that soft skills are now as important as GPA (once considered the most important factor in making decisions) in hiring a new worker. The high request, and the broadly diffused confusion about the meaning and the training of soft skills represent two elements that can explain the lack of soft skills in the job market. Employers struggle to find leaders and worker able to keep up with the evolving job market. The problem is not limited to young people who are looking for a job, but also for actual employees. A public interest study conducted by McDonald’s in UK predicted over half a million people will be held back from job sectors by 2020 due to lack of soft skills. = Hard vs soft skills = “Hard skills include technical or administrative competence”. Soft skills are commonly used to “refer to the “emotional side” of human beings in opposition to the IQ (Intelligent Quotient) component related to hard skills”. Hard and soft skills are usually defined as similar concepts or complements. This fact demonstrates how these two different types of abilities are strictly related. Hard skills were the only skills necessary for career employment and were generally quantifiable and measurable from an educational background, work experience or through interview. Success at work seemed to be related solely to the technical ability of completing tasks. For this reason, employer and companies used to hire new people based only on their objective competencies. This clarifies why nowadays people with good soft skills are in such shorter supply than workers with good hard skills. The trend has changed in the last years. Hard skills still represent a fundamental aspect, but soft skills equaled them for importance. According to the leadership professor Robert Lavasseur, most of the researchers he interviewed in this field “rated soft skills higher than technical skills”. Studies by Stanford Research Institute and the Carnegie Mellon Foundation among Fortune 500 CEOs confirm this idea establishing that 75% of long term job success resulted from soft skills and only 25% from technical skills (Sinha, 2008). Another study found that 80% of achievements in career are determined by soft skills and only 20% by hard skills. = Measuring Soft Skills = Recent studies by the OECD have found that soft skills can be meaningfully measured within cultural and linguistic boundaries. Such measures include a combination of methods that include self-reported personality, behavioural surveys and objective psychological assessments. These measurements can be improved by collecting data from multiple sources across learning contexts such as the school environment, family context and the wider community and triangulating the data (OECD, 2015). This is because surveys can be subject to bias and having multiple sources such as self, teacher, peer and parental reporting can provide unique perspectives on student’s skills as well as infer latent personality (John and De Fruyt, 2014). In addition, anchoring vignettes is another method that can be implemented to lessen biases and increase data quality as well as improve cross-cultural comparability of soft skill assessments (Kyllonen and Bertling, 2014). Education Because of their rising importance, the need to teach soft skills has become a major concern for educators all over the world. Because soft skills are poorly defined, teaching them is more challenging, compared to classical skills. For this reason, the first step consists of understanding how to evaluate them, so that educators can track student progress. As for teaching, evaluating soft skills is harder than technical skills. “Quizzes or exams cannot accurately measure interpersonal and leadership skills”. Group projects seem to be a good way to develop soft skills, but evaluating them still represent an hard obstacle. Researchers consider peer evaluation a good compromise between working in groups and an objective evaluation. The researches conducted on this topic reported both positive and negative results. The study carried out by professor Zhang of Georgia Southern University, although with few participants, “is an initial step in designing and validating a peer assessment scale”. “The development of soft skills is much more difficult than the development of hard skills because it requires actively interacting with others on an ongoing basis and being willing to accept behavioral feedback”. While hard skills can be learned studying from a book or from individual training, soft skills needs a combination of environment and other people to be mastered. For this reason, learning doesn’t depend solely on the person, but it is influenced by different factors that make the education harder and unpredictable. Training transfer, “defined as the extent to which what is learned in training is applied on the job and enhances job-related performance”, is another reason why the education of soft skills is hard. “Prior research and anecdotal evidence has emphasized that soft-skills training is significantly less likely to transfer from training to job than hard-skills training”. This forces companies and organizations to invest more money and time in training, and not all are willing to do it. The OECD ‘Future of Education and Skills 2030’ report released in 2019 highlighted the growing importance of soft skills in education due to trends such as globalisation and rapid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence, which demand changes of the labour market and the skills future workers require in order to succeed. The report states that, ‘to remain competitive, workers will need to acquire new skills continually, which requires flexibility, a positive attitude towards lifelong learning and curiosity’ (OECD, 2019). Research has been conducted investigating the transfer of soft skills and knowledge through formats such as play (DeKorver, Choi and Town, 2017) as well as project-based learning (Lee and Tsai, 2004). Another key finding from the literature is that in order to maximise benefits of soft skills over the long-term, they should be focused on young children particularly from the age of 1 – 9 years old. Nobel prize winners Heckman and Kautz (2012) provided evidence of this in their analysis of the Perry Preschool Soft Skills program, where they found how personality traits can be changed in ways that produce beneficial life outcomes. The program involved teaching social skills to 3 and 4 year old children from low income black families with initial IQ scores below 85 at age 3. 128 children participated in the four year high-quality preschool education program which emphasised active learning. The children were involved in activities designed to develop their decision making and problem solving skills and that were planned, executed and reviewed by the children themselves with support from adults. Teachers also paid weekly 1.5 hour visits to each student’s home to involve the mother in the educational process and help implement the preschool curriculum at home. This longitudinal study was evaluated using randomised controlled trials (RCT). It was found that the group which experienced the enrichment preschool program compared to the control group which didn’t participate had significantly more positive life outcomes than their peers by the age of 40. This included that 60% of the program group earned more per year (over USD $20, 000) as compared to the 40% that the non-program group. In addition, 77% of the program group graduated highschool whereas only 60% of the non-program group graduated. Other life outcomes included program school participants were less likely to get arrested, owned their own home and car and had fewer teenage pregnancies (Heckman and Kautz, 2012). Evidence from other studies are consistent with the findings from the Perry Preschool Program, such as data from Project STAR (Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio) carried out by Krueger and Whitmore (2001) and Project PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies) that teaches self-control, emotional awareness and social-problem skills aimed at elementary school children (Bierman et al., 2010). Both studies have found implementing soft skills education to small groups of children at a young age have led to significantly higher wages in early adulthood compared to their peers and other lifetime successes (Dee and West, 2011; Durlak et al., 2011). = Metacognition = The same OECD report emphasised the importance of metacognitive skills for lifelong learning. Metacognition amounts to thinking about one’s thinking. More specifically, it refers to the processes used to assess one’s understanding. It includes critical thinking, reflection, and awareness of oneself as a thinker and a learner (Chick, 2013). With increasing automation, purely cognitive or professional skills no longer suffice to navigate this VUCA world (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) (Yeo, 2019, OECD 2015).  Future Labour Market  According to the OECD's Skills Outlook 2019 report, life-long learning or metacognition, is becoming more necessary for employment and for handling a future environment of increased uncertainty. The report states, ‘humans are likely to be able to handle uncertainty better than AI,’ as the latter is able to complete specific tasks efficiently and can respond effectively to some characteristics of uncertainty and complexity. However, if the context of the task and goals are ambiguous or mutable, the program often experiences a ‘breakdown’. In contrast, humans can respond more readily to uncertainty, volatility, complexity, and ambiguity ,through being adaptable learners and being able to readily adopt, develop, and discard their beliefs and their understanding of the world, when given a new context (OECD, 2019). Notwithstanding this, humans sometimes fail to do so productively and machines, in many cases, lack those capacities entirely (Laukkonen, Biddell and Gallagher, 2018). The National Business Education Association deems soft skills as critical for being industrious in today’s workplace.https://www.nbea.org/newsite/curriculum/policy/no_67.pdf For this reason, soft skills are increasingly sought out by employers in addition to standard qualifications. A shortage of soft skills makes people who have them incredibly valuable and desired to companies. College students are becoming more aware of the importance of soft skills for their future job. A survey conducted by some professors showed how the majority of college students and graduates “rate highly their levels of soft skill competencies”. However, these students tend to overestimate their real capacities. Indeed, employers hiring college students “complain the new hires lack these soft skills or have overstated their level of competency”. Following is a \\"top ten\\" list of soft skills sought by employers in college students and in new workers. It was compiled by Eastern Kentucky University from executive listings.Marcel M. Robles, Executive Perceptions of the Top 10 Soft Skills Needed in Today’s Workplace , Business Communication Quarterly, 75(4) 453–465 (pdf) # Communication – oral speaking capability, written, presenting, listening, clear speech & writing. # Courtesy – manners, etiquette, business etiquette, gracious, says please and thank you, respectful. # Flexibility – adaptability, willing to change, lifelong learner, accepts new things, adjusts, teachable. # Integrity – honest, ethical, high morals, has personal values, does what’s right. # Interpersonal skills – nice, personable, sense of humor, friendly, nurturing, empathetic, has self-control, patient, sociability, warmth, social skills. # Positive attitude – optimistic, enthusiastic, encouraging, happy, confident. # Professionalism – businesslike, well-dressed, appearance, poised. # Responsibility – accountable, reliable, gets the job done, resourceful, self-disciplined, wants to do well, conscientious, common sense. # Teamwork – cooperative, gets along with others, agreeable, supportive, helpful, collaborative. # Work ethic – hard working, willing to work, loyal, initiative, self-motivated, on time, good attendance.

Purpose  The NPMHU is a national organization of employees dedicated to advancing the interests of its members and their families. The primary purpose of the Union is to negotiate and enforce a National Agreement with the U.S. Postal Service, a contract that establishes wages, cost-of-living adjustments and other pay increases, working conditions, and fringe benefits for all workers within its jurisdiction. The Union also protects workers’ rights by representing them in day-to-day problems on the job, like discipline, violations of seniority, discrimination, or other management abuse, and addresses such work-place concerns as safety, health, and the impact of technological change.  Governance: Local and National Roles  Mail Handler members belong to a local union, with jurisdiction in their city, town, or area. Locals elect their own officers and conduct their own day-to-day business. They negotiate a Local Memorandum of Understanding to supplement the National Agreement on certain local concerns. Nationally, NPMHU has its headquarters in Washington D.C. to administer the Union and to implement programs and policies mandated by the Constitution and the National Executive Board.

It runs from Robert's Linn (), a burn (stream) flowing into the Slitrig Water, westward and north-westward to the head of the Dean Burn (), a tributary of the Borthwick Water. It is about long (as the crow flies), and consists of a ditch and bank. The Deil's Dyke was once considered to extend to the Catrail.  Description  The Catrail is discontinuous and although the various sections are not fully aligned they are considered parts of a single structure on the grounds that the profile is similar from section to section. Between sections, the line generally seems to follow the courses of streams and rivers. In profile, the earthwork consists of a ditch about 6–12 ft wide and 2–4.5 ft deep, and a parallel embankment about 8–13 ft wide and 2 ft high. There is generally a lesser bank running along the other side of the ditch which is quite wide but only a few inches high. The main bank is on the north- east side of the ditch. The Catrail cuts across the upper Teviot valley, separating the low-lying farmland to the north-east around Hawick in Teviotdale from the hillier up-river country to the south-west.  Interpretation  It is not known when or by whom the Catrail was made, or for what purpose. However, since it is not substantial enough to be an effective military barrier, it seems likely to have been a territorial boundary marker, possibly dating from the Early Middle Ages.

The band, a perennial local favorite, consists of brothers Rob and Bill Graber and Scott Macdonald, all of whom share in the tasks of songwriting and singing. Under their original name Tilt-A-Whirl, the band released their first album, This, in 1990 on the small Minneapolis label Big Money, Inc. As the record was being released, the band was sued for trademark infringement by Sellner Manufacturing, the manufacturer of the Tilt-A-Whirl amusement ride. Rather than go to court, the band changed their name to Arcwelder, the title of an instrumental on the record. The initial release of This had a disclaimer sticker noting the lack of affiliation between the ride's manufacturer and the band. Arcwelder has toured the U.S., with such bands as the Jesus Lizard, Jawbox, and Tar, and has played shows with such artists as Dirty Three, Pegboy, Caspar Brötzmann, and Cows. In 1992, the song, \\"Favor\\", from the album, Jacket Made in Canada, appeared at number 32 on John Peel's \\"Festive Fifty\\". In both 2002 and 2012, Arcwelder was invited to perform in the UK All Tomorrow's Parties music festival, by those years' curators Shellac. The names of all three members of Arcwelder appear on the cover of the 1997 Shellac album, The Futurist. First Avenue The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh. All of the original members of the band reformed for a performance at the Touch and Go 25th anniversary celebration held September 8–10, 2006 in Chicago, Illinois. Arcwelder has no relation to the now-defunct Australian band \\"The Arcwelders\\", a Melbourne-based band that performed at various venues between 1989 and 1994 and are also best known for the hit song, \\"This Place\\".

The album was actually the third to be recorded, and was intended to be released through the label Feel Good All Over prior to The Charm of the Highway Strip. However, due to the label delaying its release for over a year, it would not emerge until five months after its successor. It was later reissued by Merge Records in 1999.  Background  During the recording of Holiday, original Magnetic Fields vocalist Susan Anway left the band, moving from the band's native Massachusetts to Arizona. Rather than search for a new vocalist for the band, Merritt decided to sing the songs he had been writing instead. Nonetheless, an alternate version of Holiday closing track \\"Take Ecstasy with Me\\" with Anway on vocals featured on the compilation Oh, Merge: A Merge Records 10 Year Anniversary Compilation (1999).  Music Holiday features a synthpop sound, particularly one reminiscent of the genre's early 1980s heyday. Steve Mason of AllMusic compared the album's sound to Architecture & Morality-era Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. While the songs on the album are accessible and melodic, they nonetheless exude a \\"chilly tone\\" and fondness for what Mason described as \\"odd noises and unexpected accents.\\" Merritt's instrumentation on the album consists of simply \\"a closetful of early Casio, Yamaha and other keyboards,\\" which Merritt layers over each other. Trouser Press felt the album consists of songs with Casio keyboards as their foundation, albeit \\"accessorized\\" with \\"the unconventional bookends of Johny Blood's tuba and Sam Davol's cello.\\" Doug Bleggi of Stereogum felt the album blurs the line between guitars and synthesisers. Holiday opens with \\"BBC Radiophonic Workshop,\\" named after the electronic pioneers of the same name. With its lo-fi production and combination of synthesised and acoustic instrumentation, the 20-second track features an \\"oddly eccentric looping of tones.\\" \\"Desert Island\\" makes use of fuzzy reverb'. \\"Deep Sea Diving Suit\\" makes use of a jew harp-style sound. Len Comaratta of Consequence of Sound wrote: \\"The upbeat, quirky, plucking sound associated with the instrument sails along as if it was bed music to the song itself.\\" Stephen Merritt sings in a deep baritone voice. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork compared his vocals on the album to Calvin Johnson. In the words of Mason, the phrasing of the album's lyrics \\"vacillates mostly between the poles of deadpan wryness and romantic longing\\" and, with their \\"striking imagery\\" and \\"Cole Porter-level rhymes,\\" mix mordant wit with unabashed romanticism.  Release  Though Holiday was completed in 1993, it took a long time for John Henderson, the owner of the band's then-current label Feel Good All Over, to release it on the label, and by the time the label did eventually release it in 1994, the band had signed to Merge Records which had already released their fourth recorded album, The Charm of the Highway Strip that April. The close release dates of the two albums meant that some magazines reviewed the albums together, which annoyed Merritt. It has also been speculated that this would have meant consumers would buy one of the two albums, but not both. In anticipation of the band's then-upcoming 69 Love Songs album, Merge Records re-released Holiday on January 12, 1999, alongside a re-release of The House of Tomorrow.  Reception  Stewart Mason of AllMusic rated the album four stars out of five, commenting that \\"[the] songwriting is a huge leap beyond the first two Magnetic Fields albums\\" and felt that \\"[e]very track here is a winner.\\" Robert Christgau gave the song a three-star honorable mention rating, quipping the album contains \\"more songs about songs and songs\\" and highlighted \\"Strange Powers\\" and \\"Swinging London\\". Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork called the album a \\"classic\\" and \\"definitely an inspired record.\\"  Legacy  The intro of \\"The Flowers She Sent and the Flowers She Said She Sent\\" was used in an episode (\\"Nightcrawlers\\") of Nickelodeon's The Adventures of Pete & Pete. The song \\"Strange Powers\\" was used in an episode (\\"Forget the Herring\\") of HBO's Bored to Death.

This contrasts with domain names which resolve to an organisation (e.g. a company) or a service that organisation offers. Vanity domains may be compared with vanity car registration plates, which similarly identify their owner as an individual and not just someone relying on another organisation's services. A subdomain of an ISP's domain that is aliased to an individual user account is a vanity domain. Other definitions include: * the Free On-line Dictionary of Computing defines it as \\"A domain you register for the sole purpose of having your own domain so you can have an easily remembered URL and e-mail address\\", * while the Jargon File defines it as \\"An Internet domain, particularly in the .com or .org top-level domains, apparently created for no reason other than boosting the creator's ego.\\" vanity domain * The Sun iPlanet Messaging Server uses \`msgVanityDomain\` to set up a domain name for e-mail use which is not fully hosted. These uses apply primarily to regular domain names registered at the highest allowed level rather than subdomains (although, technically speaking, a second-level domain is actually a subdomain of its top-level domain). Because vanity domains are operated for or on behalf of individuals, they typically will not offer the full complement of services an organisational domain name (or rather, the host that it points to) would be expected to honour; for example, the DNS record may contain only an MX record identifying a mail server accepting e-mail for that domain (which may itself be an e-mail forwarding server) and an A record identifying a shared web hosting service only offering HTTP (which may itself be a URL redirection service). As well as being easily remembered, vanity domains (especially when registered at the highest level allowed by the registrar) offer the advantage of personal mobility; they continue to be associated with a person even when that person switches service providers.  Use of top-level domains  A top- level domain does not refer to the cost of a website domain. It means how appropriate your domain is for your website or website topic. A top-level domain can become part of a vanity URL.

It was released in 1974. In 2003, the album was ranked number 138 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and 139 in a 2012 revised list. Background The Meters cut their first three mostly instrumental albums with Josie Records, before signing with Reprise and recording 1972's Cabbage Alley, their first album to feature mostly vocal songs and arrangements. Rejuvenation is the follow-up album. It was produced by Allen Toussaint and recorded at his brand new Sea-Saint Studios in New Orleans. Some of the songs on the album include horn section arrangements by Toussaint.

Reception Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic called it \\"a first-class funk album\\" and noted the album's rock influences and its hard-edged funk. Robert Christgau had a positive view and singles out the two tracks \\"It Ain't No Use\\" and \\"Just Kissed My Baby\\" as highlights. Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone called the album \\"a high point of 1970s funk\\". He noted the sparse spacing of the music and stylistic influences from Mardi Gras, gospel, R&B; and country. Daryl Easlea of BBC Music called the music a \\"merger of funk and swamp rock\\" and said the album is \\"the epitome of groove-laden, hook-rich, in-your-face funk.\\" He singled out \\"Africa\\" and \\"It Ain't No Use\\" as highlights.

It is the sixth entry in the Gamera film series, following Gamera vs. Guiron, which was released one year prior. Gamera vs. Jiger stars Tsutomu Takakuwa, Kelly Varis, Katherine Murphy, and Kon Ohmura, and features the fictional giant flying turtle monster Gamera. The film was released theatrically in Japan on 21 March 1970, and did not receive a theatrical release in the United States, instead being released directly to television by American International Television in 1970 under the title Gamera vs. Monster X. The film was followed by Gamera vs. Zigra the following year. Plot Japan is preparing for Expo '70, to be held in Osaka. Construction of the various buildings and pavilions is well under way. On Wester Island in the Pacific Ocean, a large statue of mysterious origin (called the Devil's Whistle) is located by scientists. The removal of the statue is hampered first by a tribal member of the Wester Island people, then by the unexpected arrival of Gamera, who aggressively attempts to prevent the removal of the statue, only to be shot at by the crew instead. The statue is removed from the island successfully after a volcano erupts. Shortly after departing the island, members of the ship's crew begin to fall ill. The statue appears to be the source of the outbreak, as it makes a continuous piercing sound, driving many of the crew members insane. After the statue is removed, Jiger makes her first appearance and gets Gamera's immediate attention. The first of several fights ensues and Jiger wins by shooting projectile quills from her face. To make matters worse, Gamera is on his back and cannot move. He pulls himself up with his tail using a large rock, then removes the embedded quills from his limbs and is finally able to fly after Jiger. Meanwhile, Jiger is actively seeking the statue, because it is making a horrible ringing sound that is causing her tremendous pain. Scientists are beside themselves as Jiger displays another weapon: a heat ray that vaporizes not only flesh, but entire city blocks. The JSDF does make a token effort to kill the kaiju, but her quills knock down the F-104 Starfighters, ending that involvement. Gamera returns for round two as the fight is witnessed by several children. Gamera knocks Jiger around and has the upper hand, until Jiger pulls Gamera to her. Jiger extends a stinger from her tail and inserts the barb into Gamera's chest, laying an egg inside his lung. Gamera staggers away, roaring in agony. Finally, he barely makes it to the bay and his body turns a chalky white color, almost like ice. Gamera is presumed to have been killed at this point, as Jiger heads straight to Expo '70. Jiger finally obtains the statue and throws it into the ocean, ending the painful noise. The children convince them to do a medical exam on the comatose Gamera, where it is discovered that there is a dark spot on one of his lungs. One of the scientists served as a zoo director and realises that the spot might not be a fast-spreading cancer, but actually a parasitic infant Jiger growing inside Gamera. An operation is needed to remove the threat, so the children take the initiative by taking a walkie-talkie and a mini-sub. Communication is established with the kids and they enter Gamera through his open mouth, and after almost going into his stomach, they arrive at the problem lung. The children are able to exit the sub and walk around in the lung. There, they discover the baby. The baby looks like a tiny version of its mother, except that instead of shooting quills, it squirts a sticky goo. The baby attacks them, but it has a weakness just like its mother: white noise. The kids discover that this is actually a fatal weakness and manage to kill the baby, using static from their walkie-talkie. They leave Gamera's body and report their findings to the scientists. They rig up large speakers to keep Jiger at bay, as well as figure out that power would have to also be run into Gamera, who seemingly cannot recover on his own. The children make a final trip inside Gamera to hook up a set of power lines directly to his heart. Jiger is kept immobile by the speakers playing the white noise. It is not enough to kill her, but buys enough time for the other plan to get started. Gamera is subjected to high voltage shock before the electrical grid overloads. It is enough that Gamera does revive on his own. Gamera flies over to the World's Fair for the final battle. Jiger tries every weapon she has got, but Gamera has learned from his previous battles with her. After her spears fail to affect him, Jiger then uses her heat ray, the one weapon she has yet to use on him. It does not affect Gamera's shell or even his skin (likely due to Gamera's resistance to heat), but the sound it generates threatens to rupture his eardrums. Luckily, Gamera is able to put telephone poles into his ears to protect them from the sound. After trying all her other attacks, Jiger resorts to her tail stinger again, but Gamera is prepared for it this time and uses a building to smash her tail and destroy the stinger. Gamera body-slams Jiger several times from great heights, but Jiger is not affected. However, it buys Gamera the time needed to go into the ocean and retrieve the statue from the ocean floor. Jiger, enraged by the statue's return, attempts to catch the flying Gamera. Gamera taunts Jiger with the statue, who tries in vain to catch Gamera and retrieve it. Gamera finally ends the fight by throwing the statue at Jiger, which embeds itself in Jiger's skull, killing her. Gamera then returns the devil beast's carcass to Wester Island. Cast Production Gamera vs. Jiger was the sixth film in the Gamera series. The American version of the film includes stock footage from Gamera vs. Guiron and Gamera vs. Barugon. Release Gamera vs. Jiger was released in Japan 21 March 1970. The film was never released theatrically in the United States. It was released directly to television by American International Television in 1970 as Gamera vs. Monster X. Home video Shout!

The total number of civilians who were killed during the battle of Manila was about 100,000. The Manila massacre was one of several major war crimes committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as judged by the postwar military tribunal. The Japanese commanding general, Tomoyuki Yamashita, and his chief of staff Akira Mutō, were held responsible for the massacre and other war crimes in a trial which started in October 1945. Yamashita was executed on 23 February 1946 and Mutō on 23 December 1948. Description =Massacre= Before the battle, deciding that he would be unable to defend Manila with the forces available to him, and to preserve as large a force as possible in the rural mountain Luzon region of the Philippines, General Tomoyuki Yamashita had insisted on a complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from Manila in January 1945. However, Yamashita's order was ignored by about 10,000 Japanese marines under Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi who chose to remain in Manila. About 4,000 Japanese army personnel were unable to leave the city due to the advance of the American and Filipino forces. In the Battle of Manila from February to March 1945, the United States Army advanced into the city of Manila in order to drive the Japanese out. During lulls in the battle for control of the city, Japanese troops took their anger and frustration out on the civilians in the city. Violent mutilations, rapes, and massacres occurred in schools, hospitals and convents, including San Juan de Dios Hospital, Santa Rosa College, Santo Domingo Church, Manila Cathedral, Paco Church, St. Paul's Convent, and St. Vincent de Paul Church.Connaughton, R., Pimlott, J., and Anderson, D., 1995, The Battle for Manila, London: Bloomsbury Publishing, Dr Antonio Gisbert told of the murder of his father and brother at the Palacio del Gobernador, saying, \\"I am one of those few survivors, not more than 50 in all out of more than 3000 men herded into Fort Santiago and, two days later, massacred. The Japanese forced Filipino women and children to be used as human shields into the front lines to protect Japanese positions. Those who survived were then murdered by the Japanese. =Mop-up operations= The Japanese conducted mop- up operations to clear north Manila of guerrillas, executing more than 54,000 Filipinos, including children, as they passed through towns.Werner Gruhl, 2017, Imperial Japan's World War Two: 1931–1945 Pregnant Filipino women were killed by having their bellies ripped open while the Japanese executed Filipino civilians trying to flee. =Mass rapes= The Bayview Hotel was used as a designated \\"rape center\\". According to testimony at the Yamashita war crimes trial, 400 women and girls were rounded up from Manila's wealthy Ermita district, and submitted to a selection board that picked out the 25 women who were considered most beautiful. These women and girls, many of them 12 to 14 years old, were then taken to the hotel, where Japanese enlisted men and officers took turns raping them. Despite many allied Germans held refuge in a German club, Japanese soldiers entered in and bayoneted infants and children of mothers pleading mercy and raped women seeking refuge. At least 20 Japanese soldiers raped a young girl before slicing her breasts off after which a Japanese soldier placed her mutilated breasts on his chest to mimic a woman while the other Japanese soldiers laughed. The Japanese then doused the young girl and two other women who were raped to death in gasoline and set them all on fire. The Japanese went on setting the entire club on fire killing many of its inhabitants. Women who were escaping out the building from the fire were caught and raped by the Japanese. 28-year-old Julia Lopez had her breasts sliced off, was raped by Japanese soldiers and had her hair set on fire. Another woman was partially decapitated after attempting to defend herself and raped by a Japanese soldier. The combined death toll of civilians for the battle of Manila was about 100,000, most of which was attributed to massacres by Japanese forces. Some historians, citing a higher civilian casualty rate for the entire battle, suggest that 100,000 to 500,000 died as a result of the Manila massacre on its own, exclusive of other causes.At least 4 of the 5 cited sources do not mention a figure > 100,000.Brines, Russell, \\"Sixty Priests, Women, Children Massacred by Japs in College,\\" Evening Star, Washington DC, 19 February 1945, Page A-6 General Yamashita's role in the massacre Even though it was Admiral Iwabuchi whose marines committed the atrocities, and even though General Yamashita had earlier ordered him to evacuate Manila as he had, it was Yamashita who was convicted as a war criminal for the Manila massacre. Former war-crimes prosecutor and author Allan Ryan argues that there was no evidence that Yamashita committed crimes there, ordered others to do so, was in a position to prevent them, or even suspected they were about to happen. General MacArthur, five other generals, and the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately held Yamashita responsible simply because he was in command of all Japanese troops in the Philippines at the time. A group of American military lawyers attempted to defend General Yamashita by appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the appeal failed, 5 votes to 2. As a result, Yamashita was sentenced to death by hanging. He was hanged on 23 February 1946 in Manila. The two dissenting Supreme Court Justices called the entire trial a miscarriage of justice, an exercise in vengeance, and a denial of human rights.

Through an annealing heat treatment, the brittle structure as first cast is transformed into the malleable form. Carbon agglomerates into small roughly spherical aggregates of graphite leaving a matrix of ferrite or pearlite according to the exact heat treatment used. Three basic types of malleable iron are recognized within the casting industry: blackheart malleable iron, whiteheart malleable iron and pearlitic malleable iron.  History  Malleable iron was used as early as the 4th century BCE, and malleable iron artifacts have been discovered by archaeologists between 4th century BCE and 9th century CE in China. By the Tang Dynasty, the use of malleable iron in China waned, although there are malleable iron artifacts dating to the 9th century. Malleable iron is mentioned in England in a patent dating to the 1670s. Réaumur conducted extensive research on malleable iron in 1720. He discovered that iron castings which were too hard to be worked could be softened by packing them into iron ore or hammer slag and exposing them to high temperature for a number of days. Creating malleable iron began in the United States in 1826 when Seth Boyden started a foundry for the production of harness hardware and other small castings.  Castability, heat treating and post-casting operations  Like similar irons with the carbon formed into spherical or nodular shapes, malleable iron exhibits good ductility. Incorrectly considered by some to be an \\"old\\" or \\"dead\\" material, malleable iron still has a legitimate place in the design engineer's toolbox. Malleable iron is a good choice for small castings or castings with thin cross sections (less than 0.25 inch, 6.35 mm). Other nodular irons produced with graphite in the spherical shape can be difficult to produce in these applications, due to the formation of carbides from the rapid cooling. Malleable iron also exhibits better fracture toughness properties in low temperature environments than other nodular irons, due to its lower silicon content. The ductile to brittle transition temperature is lower than many other ductile iron alloys. In order to properly form the spherical-shaped nodules of graphite (called temper graphite nodules or temper carbon nodules) in the annealing process, care must be taken to ensure that the iron casting will solidify with an entirely white iron cross section. Thicker sections of a casting will cool slowly, allowing some primary graphite to form. This graphite forms random flake-like structures and will not transform to carbide during heat treatment. When stress is applied to such a casting in application, the fracture strength will be lower than expected for white iron. Such iron is said to have a 'mottled' appearance. Some countermeasures can be applied to enhance the formation of the all white structure, but malleable iron foundries often avoid producing heavy sections. After the casting and heat treatment processes, malleable iron can be shaped through cold working, such as stamping for straightening, bending or coining operations. This is possible due to malleable iron's desirable property of being less strain rate sensitive than other materials.  Applications  It is often used for small castings requiring good tensile strength and the ability to flex without breaking (ductility). Uses include electrical fittings, hand tools, pipe fittings, washers, brackets, fence fittings, power line hardware, farm equipment, mining hardware, and machine parts. Before the widespread use of malleable iron in everyday items, heavy- duty bench vises were made from cast steel. The use of cast steel has rapidly declined in most application due to its poor castability, and hence high- quality cast vises (as opposed to forged ones), among other tools and machine elements, are now almost exclusively made of malleable iron.

A cattle prod, also called a stock prod or a hot stick, is a handheld device commonly used to make cattle or other livestock move by striking or poking them. An electric cattle prod is a stick with electrodes on the end which is used to make cattle move through a relatively high-voltage, low-current electric shock. The electric cattle prod is said to have been invented by Texas cattle baron Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. of the King Ranch around 1930, although versions were sold as early as 1917.  Terminology differences  An ad for an electric cattle prod in 1917 magazine Ranchers and farmers typically use the term \\"cattle prods\\" mainly to refer to simple non-electrified fiberglass or metal goads used to physically encourage cattle into motion; the majority of people living outside of rural areas use the term 'cattle prod' exclusively for the electrified variant. Most ranchers and farmers refer to electric cattle prods as \\"hotshots\\" (this is an example of a genericized trademark; one of the most prominent brands of electric prod is Hot-Shot). In an electric cattle prod, which is the precursor to the modern day stun gun, dual surface electrodes produce a very high voltage/very low current electric arc between them, which, when pressed against conductive skin, produces a painful but superficial electric shock which stimulates the target to cease their current activity and move in the direction opposite the source of the pain. With higher current, the cattle prod is the equivalent of a stun gun and functions exactly the same way. Cattle prods are the precursor to direct contact electric stun guns used against humans, and their basic operating principles are the same. The major differences are primarily in the matter of size and power: cattle prods tend to have a higher electric current and a longer handle than stun guns, which is helpful when dealing with very large, powerful animals.  Regular prods  Regular cattle prods can actually be anything from a baton (goad) or piece of pipe properly wired, to a manufactured fiberglass rod with a rubber handle or even a rectangular-shaped device similar to today's stun guns, which also feature batons. Most prods use two metal tips, but some are rubberized for herding stubborn animals. A Wiffleball bat is also often used as an effective prod because the hollow plastic bat makes a sharp ringing sound when slapped against the skin. Unlike hotshots, which produce high voltage and can be effective on humans, regular cattle prods used on animals are simply used to tap, strike, or poke an animal (usually on the flanks), depending on how stubborn the animal is. Sometimes, a prod can be used as a sort of \\"extended fence\\", allowing one to simply intimidate skittish animals away from open gates or downed fences without having to touch them.  Electric prods  Electric cattle prod A hotshot is typically cylindrical, and can carry an open electric current at the \\"shock end\\" when activated. The electric current at the shock end runs through two metal electrodes. Anything that touches the electric current receives a high- voltage low-current shock, not strong enough to kill a human or a large animal such as a cow or sheep from short-term exposure, but strong enough to cause significant pain. The electric cattle prod is designed to inflict a painful shock to cattle, and thus \\"prod\\" them along; the pain stimulates movement. Some higher-voltage prods can interfere with radio and CB radio reception when activated. There are various designs of electric cattle prods. Their shape is often subject to guidelines of what can easily be used and handled. They range in length from six inches (usually of a more encased rectangular prism design like a stun gun), to up to six feet. As the precursor of stun guns, cattle prods also have a wide range of voltage with enough current to operate in the same manner as a stun gun does against humans. A stun gun is nothing more than a beefed up cattle prod and both can be used on humans or animals by design. Whether it is called a cattle prod or a stun gun, both units are shaped for easy carry and function in the same manner against animals or humans. Most are simple designs powered by 9-volt or a combination of other types of batteries. Anything out of that range is usually too heavy and unwieldy for practical use. Another typical design is a box containing a large battery (or battery pack) at the handle end and wires embedded in a fibreglass rod, ending with two electrodes in a rubber tip. This design is well-suited for use as a regular cattle prod. The use of electric cattle prods has been debated by many people.Book: The Welfare of Cattle, By Jeffrey Rushen, Anne Maria De Passille, Marina A. G. von Keyserlingk, Daniel M.

The electric cattle prod is a humane device when properly used. Friendsofrodeo.com = Usage on people in policing and torture = Chinese torture victim Gao Rongrong showing scars incurred from an electric baton. Cattle prods today are designed with a high range of voltages and currents. If more powerful prods are applied continuously to the skin, the current eventually causes heating, searing, burning, and scarring of skin at the contact point. Electric prods have found favour with torturers. Prior to the development of stun batons and the taser, electric cattle prods were also used on people in varying degrees. Their first common usage on people occurred during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s; prods were first adopted by police officers in Alabama to use on protesters and agencies elsewhere followed; Hotshot later developed an electric police baton. The picana is an electric prod based originally on the cattle prod but designed specifically for human torture. It works at very high voltage and low current so as to maximize pain and minimize the physical marks left on the victim. Among its advantages over other torture devices is that it is portable, easy to use, and allows the torturer to localize the electric shocks to the most sensitive places on the body, where they cause intense pain that can be repeated many times. Electric shock devices, including cattle prods, have been used as a means of coercive control on autistic and mentally handicapped people. Famous proponent of this practice include Matthew Israel and Ivar Lovaas. The use of electric shocks in this way has been condemned as torture by the United Nations special rapporteur, and the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a ban on all such electric shock devices in 2020. On August 14, 2013 in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, gang leader Mendel Epstein told two undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation agents that he used a cattle prod to coerce Jewish husbands to grant religious divorces to their wives, leading the press to nickname him \\"The Prodfather\\". The cattle prod had been favored as a torture device by Epstein due to its effectiveness when used on cattle.Marsh, Julia and Fears, Danika (April 6, 2016) \\"Rabbi Used Electric Cattle Prod to Force Husbands into Religious Divorces\\", New York Post He was convicted of conspiring to commit kidnapping, and sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Alternatives  Cattle can be difficult to move and direct for a variety of reasons. Prods can be useful for moving stubborn or aggressive animals, but often cattle will not move forward when they are fearful of something they see, hear, or smell. Removal of these distractions or hiding them, such as with solid wall partitions, can greatly reduce animal handling problems,Link to Temple Grandin's website page, discussing common distractions that prevent animal movement through chutes and gates, with pictures of the distractions from the animal's viewpoint, grandin.com however, cattle handlers cannot completely overcome the animal's decision not to move forward. By studying the psychology of the animals and redesigning the working environment it is possible to handle the animals without the need for brute force and causing pain and suffering to the animal in many, but not all, cases. Significant work in this regard has been done by Colorado State University professor Temple Grandin to study how cattle perceive the environment around them and to design better livestock slaughterhouse handling systems that do not induce fear into the animal.Grandin, T. \\"Best Practices for Animal Handling and Stunning\\", Meat & Poultry, April 2000, pg. 76, grandin.com  In popular culture  In the Martin Scorsese film Casino, a cheating gambler is shocked with a cattle prod by a security guard, which is passed off as a heart attack. As an example of \\"cheater's justice,\\" he is threatened with a circular saw and has his fingers broken with a hammer. In Fargo, a television crime series based on the film of the same name, a cattle prod is used on numerous occasions as a weapon against humans in season 2. In the 1991 PBS American Experience episode on Coney Island, in the early 20th century, guests were subjected to a dwarf clown who would shock guests with an electric cattle prod. In Pretty Little Liars, a popular television series, a cattle prod was used to torture one of the leading characters Hanna Marin. In Ridley Scott's 1979 horror film Alien, Ellen Ripley and her crew attempt to capture an escaped Xenomorph with the help of a cattle prod. In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale and the 2017 Hulu TV series adaptation, cattle prods are used by the Aunts to control the Handmaids, a class of fertile women who serve as surrogates for the ruling Commanders. In the early 90s, WWE wrestler The Mountie would use a cattle prod aka shock stick on opponents. In WCW, wrestler Scott Hall would use a cattle prod on wrestler Bill Goldberg in his match against Kevin Nash in Starrcade 1998. In Bottom, a British television sitcom, in Season 3 Episode 2 (Terror), a homemade cattle prod device is used to convince people to hand over money during Halloween. Cattle prods feature as usable weapons in the video games Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas, the latter themed around agricultural society in the American Southwest In the 2017 film The Shape of Water, a cattle prod features prominently. It is the weapon of choice used by the primary antagonist, Col. Strickland, who carries it with him constantly. Strickland uses the cattle prod to torture both a captive amphibian man and a Soviet spy.

CEO has also been cited as an example of an executive information system and as a decision support system. It included a main program known as the Control Program which offered a menu driven interface on the assorted dumb terminals which existed at the time. The Control Program communicated with separate \\"Services\\" like the Mail Server, Calendar Server, File Server (for documents). There was also a Word Processor and a data management program which was also accessible from the Control Program. In 1985, DataGeneral announced a complementary product, TEO (Technical Electronic Office), focused on the office automation needs of engineering professionals. In later years, CEO offerings grew to include various products to connect to CEO from early personal computers. The first such product was called CEO Connection. Later a product named CEO Object Office shipped which repackaged HP NewWave (an object oriented graphical interface). CEO code was heavily dependent on the INFOS II database. When Data General moved from the Eclipse MV platform to the AViiON, CEO was not ported to the new platform as the cost would have been prohibitive. CEO was often compared with IBM's offering commonly called PROFS. CEO offered integration with DISOSS and SNADS. CEO also supported Xodiac, Data General's proprietary networking system. In 1989, Data General unveiled an email gateway product, Communications Server, which provided interoperability of CEO with X.400 email systems and X.500 directories. One early CEO site, Deutsche Credit in Chicago, first installed CEO while it was under beta in 1980, and by 1986 had 80 users of the product. Other users included the U.S. Forest Service, who installed CEO in 1983, and whose CEO system fell victim to a hacking attack in December 1984. CEO was also formerly used by Health and Welfare Canada as its departmental email system.

(1998) Sharing the Light \\"SUNY Press\\" p. 81. . She was known in the Chinese popular mindset more for her beauty than for the palace intrigue that she and her sister, the also beautiful Consort Zhao Hede engaged in, but unlike most of the famous beauties in Chinese history (such as the Four Beauties), she was often vilified by her own sisters. She was often compared and contrasted with Yang Guifei, the beautiful concubine of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, because she was known for her slender build while Yang was known for her full build. This led to the Chinese idiom huanfei yanshou (環肥燕瘦, literally \\"plump Huan, slender Fei\\"), which describes the range of the types of beauties, later also used as a figurative expression on literary styles that can be either verbose or sparse but both equally effective. Early life The actual birth date of Zhao Feiyan is not known but it is assumed to be 45 BC. According to historical accounts, her personal name might be Yi Zhu (宜主). According to historical accounts, she was a daughter of two hereditary servants of imperial princes or princesses. Those accounts also say that when she was born, her parents were so poor that they abandoned her, but they saw that she was still alive after three days, so they took her back in and raised her. After her father died she and her sister were adopted by a housekeeper to a rich family. Their adoptive father's name was Zhao Lin (趙臨) and they took his surname. When she grew up, she was assigned to the household of Princess Yang'a (陽阿公主), the sister of Emperor Cheng. She became a dancing girl there, and she received the name that she would become known for—Feiyan (literally, flying swallow) because she was so slender and so agile in dance that she was like a flying swallow. Imperial consort to Cheng Circa 19 BC, Emperor Cheng was visiting Princess Yang'a when he saw both her and her sister Hede, and he became enamored with them. He had both of them sent to his palace, and they became greatly favored imperial consorts, and they took his affection away from Empress Xu and Consort Ban. In 18 BC, they falsely accused Empress Xu and Consort Ban of witchcraft; Empress Xu was deposed, and while Consort Ban was able to successfully plead her case, she did not wish to return to the same environment and instead became a lady in waiting for Empress Dowager Wang. The Zhao sisters now dominated the palace.Chen, Shou (1999) Empresses and Consorts \\"University of Hawaii Press\\". p. 20. . Emperor Cheng wanted to make Feiyan the new empress, but Empress Dowager Wang complained about her low birth and prior occupation as a dance girl. In 16 BC, she finally capitulated to her son's wishes, and in preparation, Emperor Cheng first created Feiyan's father Zhao Lin the Marquess of Chengyang, so that she would no longer be viewed as coming from low birth. In the summer of that year, she was created empress. Empress The image is scanned from 《歷朝名媛詩詞》 After Feiyan was made empress, she began to lose favor from Emperor Cheng, while her sister Hede received the nearly exclusive affection of Emperor Cheng. While the sisters initially were jealous of each other, they later reconciled, and continued to dominate the palace together. However, neither of them would produce any children who could serve as imperial heir—something greatly troubling to Emperor Cheng (whose earlier favorites Empress Xu and Consort Ban were also childless, and no other consort of whom was known to have had children). It was alleged that Empress Zhao, with her sister covering for her, often engaged in adulterous acts with men who were known to have fathered many children, in hopes of becoming pregnant. Empress Zhao and her sister Hede would also be alleged to have been involved in something even more sinister around this period. Based on an investigative report later authored in 6 BC (after Emperor Cheng's death), Emperor Cheng had two sons—one born to Consort Cao in 12 BC and one born to Consort Xu (a relative of the deposed Empress Xu) in 11 BC. However, both of the sons were murdered in their infancy by orders of Consort Zhao Hede, with at least tacit agreement from Emperor Cheng; Consort Cao was forced to commit suicide after her son was murdered. The report further alleged that the Zhao sisters engaged in many tactics, such as forced abortions, assassinations, and poisonings, to make sure that no other concubine would bear an imperial heir. In 9 BC, still heirless, Emperor Cheng appeared to come to the resolution of making either his younger brother Prince Liu Xing of Zhongshan (中山王劉興) or his nephew Prince Liu Xin of Dingtao his heir. Emperor Cheng became convinced that Prince Xin was more capable, and at the same time, Prince Xin's grandmother Consort Fu was endearing herself to Empress Zhao, her sister Hede, and Emperor Cheng's uncle Wang Gen with lavish gifts, and so the Zhaos and Wang Gen both praised Prince Xin as well. Emperor Cheng made Prince Xin crown prince in 8 BC. Empress Dowager  Emperor Cheng died suddenly in 7 BC, apparently from a stroke (although historians also report the possibility of an overdosage of aphrodisiacs given to him by Consort Zhao Hede). Immediately there were many rumors that he had in fact had concubines who bore him sons, but that those sons and their mothers were murdered by Consort Zhao Hede (out of jealousy) and possibly Emperor Cheng himself. Grieving her husband and apparently fearful of appraisals, Consort Zhao Hede killed herself. Crown Prince Xin ascended the throne as Emperor Ai. Because the rumors largely centered around Hede and because of her role in Emperor Ai's becoming Emperor Cheng's heir, Empress Zhao was personally unscathed, and Emperor Ai honored her with the title of empress dowager. However, she would have little or no political influence during the reign of Emperor Ai. After the investigative report commissioned by Grand Empress Dowager Wang was published in 6 BC, accusing Consort Zhao Hede of the atrocities against the other imperial consorts and their children (and implicitly, although not directly, accusing Empress Dowager Zhao of the same thing), Empress Dowager Zhao's family was exiled, and the marquess titles granted to her brother and her nephew were removed. However, Empress Dowager Zhao herself was spared, particularly because she was on very friendly relations with Emperor Ai's domineering grandmother Consort Fu (who had now insisted on, and receiving, the title of grand empress dowager as well). Some of her relatives, instead of going into exile, were hidden by Grand Empress Dowager Wang's nephew Wang Ren (王仁), but after they were discovered, Wang was punished by being sent back to his march.  Death  In 1 BC, Emperor Ai died. In decisive action, Grand Empress Dowager Wang seized power back from Emperor Ai's favorite Dong Xian and made her nephew Wang Mang regent to the succeeding Emperor Ping. Wang Mang, who wanted to extinguish all dissent (and who previously bore a grudge against Emperor Ai for demoting him and extended that grudge to those who supported Emperor Ai) had Empress Dowager Zhao demoted from her position as empress dowager to the title of Empress Xiaocheng. A few months later, she was further demoted to a commoner and ordered to guard her husband's tomb. That day, she committed suicide.

It was founded in 1966 and is named after the 28th Sultan of Brunei, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III.  Location  The school is located on Jalan Muara, close to the Brunei International Airport, commercial areas and two other educational institutions - Berakas Secondary School and the Sultan Saiful Rijal Campus of the Institute of Brunei Technical Education. History Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Science College began as (First Malay Secondary School) in the then Brunei Town in 1966. Upper secondary level (Form 4) was introduced in the school in 1967 while sixth form was introduced two years later. In 1969, the school moved from Brunei Town to an area along Jalan Muara. On 23 September 1971 the school was officially renamed as (Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Malay College). It was inaugurated by the late Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the 28th Sultan of Brunei and the father of the current Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. Bilingual education policy was implemented in 1974 and English medium classes were introduced. Two years later science education was started. The school was then again renamed as (Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Malay College/Science School). In 1985, the status of the school was upgraded to a college to acknowledge the inclusion of the sixth form and the school finally adopted the current name. In 1994, the college moved to a new campus in the Rimba area on the outskirts of Bandar Seri Begawan. After renovations of the old Muara campus was completed, the college moved back to it on 2 April 2005. The Rimba campus was turned into the Rimba Secondary School. Starting from 2007, classes for Form 1 (now known as Year 7) students were scheduled in the afternoon due to a shortage of classrooms. In 2008, Year 8 students were also scheduled in the afternoon session. Year 7 students in 2008 were the first batch to try out the scheme of work for SPN21 (Sistem Pendidikan Negara Abad Ke-21). Enrolment and structure Entry to the college requires grade \\"A\\" in all five subjects (hence more commonly known as \\"5 'A's\\") of the Primary School Assessment ( or '), the national examination taken at the end of Year 6 in primary school. The school operates in a two sub-school structure. The secondary school caters for students in years 7 to 10, whilst the Sixth Form Centre caters for students in Lower and Upper Six. The school enrolls students only for Year 7 every year, prohibiting entries for other years. Only current enrolled Year 7 students are allowed to proceed to upper levels. The size of classes vary each year, depending on the entrance quotas. Uniform The school uniform for boys consists of purple pants for years 7 to 10 and grey pants for sixth form students, white MIB shirt with embroidered school logo and a black songkok. Girls' uniforms are long white and lavender checkered skirt for years 7 to 10 and long grey skirt for sixth form students, white dress and a school embroidered square tudong. Members of the student councils wear the same uniform with the exception of the colour of their pants and long skirts, which are navy blue. A different uniform applies for physical education classes. Extracurricular activities Aside from academics, the school provides a wide range of extracurricular activities for its students. These include: Debate (Gavel Club), Da Vinci, Drama and Theatre, Environmental Club and more. This is along with Swimming, Basketball, Football, Netball, Badminton, Table Tennis, Track and Field, Golf, Rugby, Hiking and Hockey. The school takes part in interschool competitions including Science, Mathematics, Computing, Debate, Hadrah and Nasyid competitions. The school is also known for their notable Choir, Netball, Hockey, Track and Field team, winning several titles each year. In 2013, the unofficial school team, consisting of sixth form girls, MS Rebels came second in the First National Women's Rugby Tournament. During the early years in 1978-1980 the hockey teams and netball teams were very competitive and went to national competitions. This trend still continues today. The school has also been known to be active in extracurricular activities including a drug awareness team. The school also has an Environmental Club to encourage students on natural awareness and for class research purposes. The college has a house system for the purpose of the annual inter-house competitions in sports (track and field, football and netball) and arts (debate and drama). There are four houses and they are colour-coded, which consist of (yellow), (blue), (red) and (green); they are named after the Malay traditional military ranks which mean 'Commander', 'Admiral', 'General' and 'Warrior' respectively. Notable Alumni Several members of Brunei's royal family attended the College including the Crown Prince of Brunei, Al-Muhtadee Billah, and his wife, Pengiran Anak Sarah, Prince Abdul Mateen, Princess Majeedah Nuruul Bolkiah, Princess Hafizah Sururul Bolkiah, Princess Azemah Ni'matul Bolkiah, and other members of Brunei's royal family attended the college including, Pengiran Muda ‘Abdul Qawi, Pengiran Muda Omar ‘Ali, Pengiran Muda ‘Abdul Muqtadir and Pengiran Anak Khalilah Khalilat ul-Bolkiah, sons and daughter of Prince Mohammed Bolkiah, the Pengiran Anak Hajjah Siti Radhiah Bolkiah, daughter of Princess Norain Bolkiah and Pengiran Anak Muhammad ‘Abdul Hafiz, Pengiran Anak Muhammad ‘Abdul Qayyum and Pengiran Anak Nurul-Amal Ni’matullah Athirah, and Pengiran Anak Nurul-Amal Munjiat ul-Athirah, sons and daughters of Princess Amal Jefriah Bolkiah . The Science College is also known to produce most of Brunei's prominent lawyers, doctors, educators, high ranking government officers, and armed personnel.

It is a length of cord with knots at regular intervals. They were eventually replaced by surveyor's chains, which being made of metal were less prone to stretching and thus were more accurate and consistent. Knotted cords were used by many ancient cultures. The Greek schoenus is referred to as a rope used to measure land. Ropes generally became cables and chains with Pythagoras making the Greek agros a chain of 10 stadia equal to a nautical mile c 540 BC. The Romans used a waxed cord for measuring distances. A knotted cord 12 lengths long (the units do not matter) closed into a loop can be used to lay out a right angle by forming the loop of cord into a 3–4–5 triangle. This could be used for laying out the corner of a field or a building foundation, for instance. Ancient Egypt Knotted cords were used by rope stretchers, royal surveyors who measured out the sides of fields (Egyptian 3ht). The knotted cords (Egyptian ht) were 100 royal cubits in length, with a knot every hayt or 10 royal cubits. The rope stretchers stretched the rope in order to take the sag out it, as well as to keep the measures uniform. Since land in ancient Egypt was measured using several different units, there would have been knotted cords with the knots spaced in each unit. Among these were the mh t3 or land cubits, remen royal cubits, rods or ha3t, generally the lengths in multiples of 100 units. The longest measured length listed in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is a circumference of about a Roman mile with a diameter of 9 khet. Despite many popular claims, there is no reliable evidence that the 3-4-5 triangle, and by implication the Pythagoras' theorem, was used in Ancient Egypt to lay out right angles, such as for the pyramids. The historian Moritz Cantor first made the conjecture in 1882. Right angles were certainly laid out accurately in Ancient Egypt; their surveyors did use knotted cords for measurement; Plutarch recorded in Isis and Osiris (around 100 AD) that the Egyptians admired the 3-4-5 triangle; and the Berlin Papyrus 6619 from the Middle Kingdom (before 1700 BC) made statements that suggest knowledge of Pythagoras' theorem. However, no Egyptian text before 300 BC actually mentions the use of the theorem to find the length of a triangle's sides, and the historian of mathematics Roger Cooke notes that there are simpler ways to construct a right angle. He guesses that the Ancient Egyptians probably did know the Pythagorean theorem, but concludes that \\"there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles\\".

Henry Ford Allegiance Radiation Oncology offers cancer care as part of the Henry Ford Cancer Institute.  History  Henry Ford Allegiance Health was founded in 1918 as W.A. Foote Memorial Hospital when a local citizen, Mrs. Ida Foote, donated land for construction of the new hospital in honor of her late husband, W.A. Foote. Mercy Hospital opened in 1918. Sister Hynes was one of its founders, serving as its first mother superior. She belonged to the Sisters of Mercy, a Catholic order of nuns dedicated to the sick and needy. In its heyday, the hospital held 213 beds and 40 bassinets. In 1975, it was purchased by Foote Hospital for $2.5 million, and changed its name to Foote West. Foote West closed in 1984 after a new hospital was built on E. Michigan Avenue. The Lansing Avenue building was demolished in 1989, and a memorial was erected in 1997. The property was given to Jackson County in 1998. It is the current site of the Jackson County Medical Care Facility that opened November 2002. Jackson Osteopathic Hospital served Jackson and its surrounding communities as a short-term acute care hospital From June 1943 to 1988. With the addition of MDs to the staff; Jackson Osteopathic Hospital became Doctors Hospital in 1988. In the late 1990s, the hospital became part of Borgess and remained a short-term acute care hospital until 2003. It was then converted into a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) called CareLink of Jackson as a joint venture of Borgess and Foote Health System. In 2010, Allegiance Health (Formally Foote Health System) purchased Burgess's share to become the sole owner. The current hospital facility was completed in 1983 and is located near the site of the original hospital. The former hospital, now named the Charles Anderson Building, is used for specialized practices such as sleep disorders, behavioral health, and volunteer services. In July 2008, Foote Health System was renamed Allegiance Health. The system was later renamed Henry Ford Allegiance Health on April 5, 2016.  Acquisition  In December 2013, Allegiance Health and the University of Michigan Health System announced that they had signed a letter of intent for Allegiance to become absorbed by the University of Michigan. It was expected that the arrangement would take 18 months to finalize. By November 2014, Allegiance announced they were not able to come to an agreement and would be looking for other partner organizations. On November 10, 2015 Allegiance announced an agreement to join the Henry Ford Health System The acquisition completed on April 1, 2016.

They are best known for their 1980 song \\"This Beat Goes On/Switchin' To Glide\\", which was a hit in the United States and Canada. Recording history The Kings were formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Oakville, Ontario in the late 1970s. The original lineup included David Diamond, bass, lead vocals; Mister Zero (listed as Aryan Zero in the original \\"Kings Are Here\\" LP liner notes), guitar; Sonny Keyes, keyboards and vocals; and Max Styles (drums), with Zero and Diamond serving as the main songwriters with contributions from Keyes. The Kings were originally known as WhistleKing and rehearsed, performed club gigs, and wrote a considerable number of songs for more than three years. In early 1980, the band went into Nimbus 9 Studio in Toronto to record their first album. While recording, renowned producer Bob Ezrin visited the studio, listened to the band, and liked what he heard. Together they created the album The Kings Are Here with the songs \\"This Beat Goes On\\" and \\"Switchin' To Glide\\", The double-A side single spent 23 weeks on the U.S. charts, peaking at #43 on the Billboard Hot 100. Billboard On superstation WLS-AM in Chicago, the song peaked at number nine during January 1981. It reached #59 in Canada. Two other singles followed and the band began touring extensively with Bob Seger, Jeff Beck, The Beach Boys and Eric Clapton. During 1980, their rising commercial fortunes culminated in an appearance on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, and the closing spot at the major Heatwave festival in August. Amazon Beach, the 1981 follow-up to The Kings Are Here, produced little in the way of sales, and the band was soon dropped from their label, Elektra Records. The Kings soldiered on and released the EP R.S.V.P and the live album Party Live '85 on their own Dizzy label, while continuing to tour Canada and the US throughout the remainder of the 1980s. Max Styles left the band in approximately 1982. Comebacks The late 1980s were a difficult period for The Kings as they lost their drummer and their record label. As it was, the group was on the verge of a major revival as the single \\"This Beat Goes On\\" and \\"Switchin' To Glide\\" became a huge radio hit in Chicago once again, getting major play on all of the main rock stations: Classic rock WCKG, Alternative rock WXRT, and Mainstream Rock WLUP, as well as Top 40 powerhouse WLS-AM. The unavailability of the Kings records led Chicago DJ Bob Stroud of WLUP to record his own version of the single with his band Rockestra. Elektra Records unfortunately remained unaware of the burgeoning hit and never reissued the single or album. The single \\"Parting of the Ways\\" appeared on Bullseye Records compilation Unsigned, Sealed and Delivered in 1991. This comeback prompted The Kings to return to the studio to record Unstoppable produced by John Punter, David Diamond and Mister Zero in 1993. Unstoppable produced several hits in Canada including \\"Lesson To Learn\\", \\"Shoulda Been Me\\", \\"Tonight I Got You\\", \\"Parting Of The Ways\\", and the title track \\"Unstoppable\\". A phone call in 1999 from Mister Zero to Alan Fletcher at Warner Canada led to the green light needed for Warner to re-issue The Kings Are Here...and More which allowed fans to get their songs \\"This Beat Goes On\\" and \\"Switchin' to Glide\\" on CD, which was fully remastered from the original 2 track tapes by Zero. ...and More also contained a few re-mixed tracks from Unstoppable and two previously unreleased tracks - \\"If the Stars Come Out Tonight\\" and \\"Right to the Top\\". A remixed and more mature version of \\"If the Stars Come Out Tonight\\" appeared on Because Of You released in 2003 on Bullseye Records. Combined original sales and CD sales have passed the platinum mark in Canada but no certification is allowed because of the bonus tracks on the CD, which are the only way the band makes money from that project. Throughout the remainder of the 1990s, The Kings continued to tour and play live shows around Toronto, but Sonny Keyes' role with The Kings diminished and only Mister Zero and David Diamond remain as permanent members from the original lineup. However, Sonny Keyes continued to contribute when called upon by Zero and Diamond. Drummer Atilla Turi and keyboard players Peter Nunn and Rich Roxborough joined Mister Zero and David Diamond on the abovementioned Because of You album (Josh Broadbent - Diamond's son - was also recruited into The Kings to contribute his vocals). Because of You would be The Kings' strongest effort to date, with Harry Hess recording alongside producers Zero and Diamond. A video was made for the title track, \\"It's Up to You\\" and \\"The Fools Are in Love,\\" the last of which was remixed from the original version that appeared on the Amazon Beach release. Sonny Keyes co- wrote \\"A Way You'll Never Be\\" with Mister Zero. A reunion of the original lineup of The Kings occurred in the winter of 2001 with Max Styles and Sonny Keyes joining their old mates for Alan Frew's (Glass Tiger) children's benefit concert for Camp Trillium in Toronto. They played the benefit concert again in 2002. In late 2005, The Kings had a full length reunion concert in Toronto which was filmed for inclusion in the DVD documentary being assembled by Mister Zero. The first part of this film to be seen is the video for \\"This Beat Goes On\\" and \\"Switchin' to Glide,\\" released in October 2006. Another focus for The Kings was to put as many songs as possible on iTunes, thus having the catalog available worldwide instantly. The album The Kings Anthology One is the latest addition, 12 songs from different eras including never before heard songs from the band's WhistleKing days. The Kings continue to play live shows across southern Ontario and, from time to time, the northern United States. They released a documentary about their career, more specifically about \\"This Beat Goes On / Switchin' to Glide\\" on YouTube in November, 2017. In popular culture In 2017, Milwaukee sports radio station 105.7 FM The Fan began using \\"Switching to Glide\\" for the Milwaukee Baseball Post Game Show. Host Tim Allen began playing the song starting in May when the Brewers got off to a hot start. After every win Allen played the chorus of \\"This Beat Goes On\\" as the team's unofficial anthem. In 2020, American band the Cherry Poppin' Daddies released a cover of \\"Switchin' to Glide\\" as a standalone single, accompanied by a music video.

Hook was born in L'Anse, Michigan and graduated from L'Anse High School in 1912. He attended the College of Law of the University of Detroit and graduated from the law department of Valparaiso University in 1918. He served in the United States Army Infantry during World War I from July 1918 until February 1919. After the war, he was employed in lumber woods and as an iron ore miner and also as a law clerk at Wakefield, Michigan, 1919-1924. He was a member of the board of supervisors of Gogebic County, 1921-1923. He was admitted to the bar in 1924 and commenced practice in Wakefield. He was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court in 1936. He served as city commissioner of Wakefield, 1921-1923 and as municipal judge of Wakefield in 1924 and 1925. Hook moved to Ironwood in 1925 and continued the practice of law. He was president of WJMS Radio Station in Ironwood, 1930-1933 and was a delegate to Democratic National Conventions in 1936, 1940, 1944, and 1948. In 1934, Hook was the Democratic Party candidate from Michigan's 12th congressional district for the U.S. House of Representatives. Hook defeated incumbent Republican W. Frank James in the general election to be elected to the 74th Congress and to the three succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1935 to January 3, 1943. In 1942, Hook lost in the general election to Republican John B. Bennett (having previously defeated him in 1938 and 1940). In 1944, Hook defeated Bennett to reclaim the seat in the 79th Congress, serving from January 3, 1945 to January 3, 1947. He lost the seat again to Bennett in 1946. In 1948, he made an unsuccessful bid to be elected the United States Senate, losing to Republican Homer Ferguson. Hook served under Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. He voted to declare war upon Japan, when Congress was convened upon the attack on Pearl Harbor. Hook was instrumental in the establishment of Social Security and the minimum wage -- part of Roosevelt's New Deal. He also proposed a bill to establish the Isle Royale National Park, located in Lake Superior and had the honor of dedicating it in August 1946. In 1940, Hook alleged in Congress that Martin Dies had ties to William Dudley Pelley, the leader of a fascist organization, the Silver Legion of America. However, unbeknownst to him, the documents Hook used to make his case turned out to be forgeries. Hook's moniker \\"Fightin' Frank,\\" earned from high school days, was reinforced once again during an infamous bout on the floor of Congress. His nemesis, John Rankin of Mississippi, drew his ire, but could not cull a punch, as Hook was later quoted, \\"A gentleman cannot strike an old man.\\" The wrassling match was physically initiated by Rankin jumping on Hook's back on Washington's birthday in 1945, during the session. The skirmish was the end result of a verbal exchange between Hook & Rankin concerning the former's support and the latter's denouncement of the C.I.O. Rankin hollered shouts of \\"communism!\\" while Hook defended the integrity of the organization. As to the disruption, Hook later recited a 3-minute apology, while Rankin maintained his own innocence. When Hook offered to resign if Rankin would also \\"...for the good of the country,\\" Rankin \\"held his tongue\\" and the controversial exchange faded into obscurity. Hook was a member of the President's Fair Employment Practices Committee in 1943 and 1944 and was appointed a member of Motor Carrier Claims Commission October 1, 1949, serving until his resignation August 22, 1950. He made several unsuccessful attempts to reclaim a seat in the U.S. House from the 12th district, losing in 1954 to Bennett in the general election, losing in 1956 and 1958 to Joseph S. Mack in the Democratic primary elections. In 1966, he lost to incumbent Raymond F. Clevenger in the Democratic primary for the 11th district. He resumed the practice of law in Detroit and in 1953 moved to Ironwood where he reestablished his law practice. He was admitted to the Wisconsin bar in 1962 and was a resident of Edina, Minnesota, at the time of his death. He is interred in Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Structures Their chemical structures feature a large ring of atoms (in essence, a cyclic ester ring) containing multiple conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds (hence polyene) on one side of the ring and multiple hydroxyl groups bonded to the other side of the ring. Their structures also often have a d-mycosamine (a type of amino- glycoside) group bonded to the molecule. The series of conjugated double bonds typically absorbs strongly in the ultraviolet-visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, often resulting in the polyene antibiotics having a yellow color. Chemical structure of Amphotericin B. Amphotericin B is an example of a yellow polyene antimycotic agent. Note the alternating double and single bonds in the center and the mycosamine group in the bottom-right corner. Chemical structure of Nystatin.

Oak Alley Plantation is a historic plantation located on the west bank of the Mississippi River, in the community of Vacherie, St. James Parish, Louisiana, U.S. Oak Alley is named for its distinguishing visual feature, an alley (French allée) or canopied path, created by a double row of southern live oak trees about 800 feet (240 meters) long, planted in the early 18th century -- long before the present house was build. The allée or tree avenue runs between the home and the River. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark for its architecture and landscaping, and for the agricultural innovation of grafting pecan trees, performed there in 1846–47 by an enslaved gardener. History =Jacques and Celina Roman= The Bon Séjour plantation, as Oak Alley was originally named, was established to grow sugarcane, by the French Creole Valcour Aime when he purchased the land in 1830. Aime, known as the \\"King of Sugar,\\" was one of the wealthiest men in the South. In 1836, Valcour Aime exchanged this piece of property with his brother-in-law Jacques Télesphore Roman for a plantation owned by Roman. The following year Jacques Roman began building the present mansion under the oversight of George Swainy and entirely with enslaved labor. The mansion was completed in 1839. Roman's father-in-law, Joseph Pilié, was an architect and probably designed the house.Cabanocey: The History, Customs and Folklore of St. James Parish, Bourgeois, Lillian, 1957 The most noted slave who lived at Oak Alley Plantation was named Antoine. He was listed as \\"Antoine, 38, Creole Negro gardener/expert grafter of pecan trees,\\" with a value of $1,000 in the inventory of the estate conducted upon J.T. Roman's death. Antoine was a master of the techniques of grafting, and after trial with several trees, succeeded in the winter of 1846 in producing a variety of pecan that could be cracked with one's bare hands; the shell was so thin it was dubbed the \\"paper shell\\" pecan. It was later named the Centennial Variety when entered in competition at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, where it won a prize. The trees may be found throughout southern Louisiana, where the pecan was once a considerable cash crop. Although Antoine's original trees were cleared for more sugar cane fields after the Civil War, a commercial grove had been planted at nearby Anita Plantation. Unfortunately, the Anita Crevasse (river break) of 1990 washed away Anita Plantation and all remains of the original Centennial pecans.Historical researchers at Oak Alley Foundation Roman Family tombstone Jacques Roman died in 1848 of tuberculosis and the estate began to be managed by his wife, Marie Therese Josephine Celina Pilié Roman (1816–1866). Celina did not have a skill for managing a sugar plantation and her heavy spending nearly bankrupted the estate. In 1859 her son, Henri, took control of the estate and tried to turn things around. The plantation was not physically damaged during the American Civil War, but the economic dislocations of the war and the end of slavery made it no longer economically viable; Henri became severely in debt, mainly to his family. In 1866, his uncle, Valcour Aime and his sisters, Octavie and Louise, put the plantation up for auction and it was sold for $32,800 to John Armstrong. =Andrew and Josephine Stewart= Successive owners could not afford the cost of upkeep and by the 1920s the buildings had fallen into disrepair. In 1925 the property was acquired by Andrew Stewart as a gift to his wife, Josephine, who commissioned architect Richard Koch to supervise extensive restoration and modernize the house. As a virus had wiped out the sugarcane industry in the early 1900s, the Stewarts ran Oak Alley Plantation as a cattle ranch. Josephine had grown up on a cattle ranch in Texas and was familiar with this type of industry. Sugar cane cultivation was reintroduced at the plantation in the 1960s. The Stewarts were the last owners to live in residence. Josephine Stewart left the historic house and grounds to the Oak Alley Foundation when she died in 1972, which opened them to the public. Mansion and grounds =Architecture= The design is Greek Revival architecture. The mansion has a square floor plan, organized around a central hall that runs from the front to the rear on both floors. The rooms feature high ceilings and large windows. The exterior features a free-standing colonnade of 28 Doric columns on all four sides that correspond to the 28 oak trees in the alley. Oak trees such as these are a common feature of antebellum mansions of the Mississippi River Valley. Constructed of bricks made on the site, the 16\\" walls are finished with stucco on the exterior and painted white to resemble marble, and the interior is plastered. The roof is made of slate and originally had four dormers, one on each side of the hipped roof. During the restoration in the 1920s, rooms at the first floor rear were partitioned and adapted as a kitchen. Also, the staircase was moved from the southwest corner to the central hall, and the black and white marble floors were replaced with wood floors. Finally, the number of dormers on the roof was increased to three on each side. =Grounds= Garden on the left side of the house The grounds include a formal garden, that was installed by Josephine Stewart, that separate the mansion from the old garage. The old car garage is the temporary site for the sugarcane Theater, where the history of sugarcane cultivation is explained through a video and exhibits. A blacksmith shop and the Stewart graveyard are also on the grounds.

It was first released in May 1969 on the self- titled album, Crosby, Stills and Nash, and released on a 45-RPM single in July of the same year, with another CSN song, \\"Helplessly Hoping,\\" as its backing side. The single reached No. 28 on the Billboard Hot 100 on August 23, 1969. It reached the same position on the Easy Listening chart. Composition \\"Marrakesh Express\\" was written and composed by Graham Nash during his final years as a member of the English rock band The Hollies, of which he was a member from its formation in 1962 till 1968. The band rejected the song as not commercial enough, but it found a home with Nash's new band Crosby, Stills and Nash.Zimmer, Dave. Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Authorized Biography. Da Capo Press, 2000. Nash recalled his inspiration for the song occurring during a Moroccan vacation he took in 1966. On the trip, Nash traveled by train from Casablanca to Marrakesh. He began the journey in First Class, surrounded by people he found to be uninteresting—as he described it, they were all \\"ladies with blue hair.\\" He decided the compartment was \\"completely fucking boring,\\" so left his seat to explore the other train carriages, and was fascinated by what he saw. The song mentions \\"ducks and pigs and chickens,\\" which he saw on the train, and recalled the ride by commenting: \\"It's literally the song as it is—what happened to me.\\" Musical structure The instrumentation of the song seeks to embody Nash's lyrics through an Eastern vibe and a \\"buoyant\\" flow carried by Jim Gordon's drumming, to resemble a train ride. Stephen Stills was responsible for much of the creative musicianship, adding a distinctive, unique sounding riff played on two overdubbed electric guitars. He also added Hammond B3 organ, piano and bass. The song was rounded out by Nash's acoustic guitar, and the group's trademark three-part vocal harmony on the choruses. First concert performance The first public appearanceFricke, David. \\"David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash & Neil Young.\\" Rolling Stone no. 838 (April 13, 2000): 92. of \\"Marrakesh Express\\" was at the Woodstock Music Festival. Between 3 am and 4 am on August 18, 1969, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young came together as a band for the second time in public and performed a set that included what Graham Nash called \\"a medley of our hit,\\" referring to this song, the first single from their debut album. (Neil Young did not play during the acoustic part of their set which included \\"Marrakesh Express\\".) Reception and current appeal The song has gained attention throughout the years and has remained popular since its release in 1969. Throughout the decades of touring done by Crosby, Stills and Nash, and the sometimes Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, \\"Marrakesh Express\\" is the ninth most-played song by them, and has been performed over 450 times. A Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young tribute band is named \\"Marrakesh Express: A Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young Experience.\\" The song has also gained negative attention, most notably by the Stooges's singer, Iggy Pop. In a 2003 Rolling Stone article, Iggy Pop mentions the band in response to a discussion of the band's creation acting as a counter against the \\"hippie movement.\\" He exclaims, \\"I mean, 'Marrakesh Express?' It may be the worst song ever written.\\" Cover versions In 2012, the song was recorded by the band The Gypsy Queens for their eponymous album The Gypsy Queens, featuring Nash himself and produced by Larry Klein. It was recorded at Jim Henson Studios in Los Angeles, (Jim Henson Company). The Album reached #46 in the English charts.

Disch, programmed by Kevin Bentley, and published by Electronic Arts in 1986 for IBM PC compatibles (as a self-booting disk) and Apple II. A Commodore 64 version was released in 1987. Disch's ironic, rich writing style, is in distinct contrast to the functional or tongue-in-cheek tone of most text adventures. Over half of Disch's novel-length manuscript had to be cut from the published version due to the storage limitations 5¼\\" floppy disks. Gameplay The game begins as the player's character awakens in a midtown Manhattan hotel room with absolutely no memory. He has no clothes and no money, and doesn't even remember what he looks like. The player soon discovers he is engaged to a woman he cannot remember, a strange man is trying to kill him, and the state of Texas wants him for murder. From here, the player must unravel the events in his life that led him to this point . In addition to being a text adventure, the game simulates life in Manhattan. Disch's model covered every block and street corner south of 110th Street. A hard-copy map of the streets and subways of Manhattan is included in the packaging. Players move from place to place on foot, and have to reach destinations at the correct time of day to initiate plot developments. Stores open and close at the correct times, street lights turn on, and other aspects of New York City life are simulated. Almost 4000 separate Manhattan locations, including 650 streets, are part of the game. Development Programmer Kevin Bentley implemented the game using the King Edward Adventure game authoring system, which was developed by James Terry. The game was acquired and produced by Don Daglow. Reception Scorpia of Computer Gaming World described the game as being \\"too much like a novel\\", giving as example the need to answer the phone in the hotel room. The review also noted the main character would collapse after an unrealistically short amount of time if he didn't eat or sleep frequently. Charles Ardai called Amnesia \\"a brilliant, witty, and intriguing story\\", however, and stated that \\"the text is so rich and the story so interesting that one hardly notices that this is probably the least interactive piece of interactive fiction ever made\\". Compute! stated that the combination of Disch's writing and Electronic Arts' software \\"makes Amnesia a text adventure well worth exploring\\". Legacy One of the last major text-based games published by a major games company other than Infocom, Amnesia is also the only all-text adventure ever published by EA. Disch wrote a screenplay based on the game's characters and story line and it was optioned to one of the major Hollywood studios, but the film was never made.

There are numerous move orders that reach the Scheveningen; a common one is: :1. e4 c5 :2. Nf3 d6 :3. d4 cxd4 :4. Nxd4 Nf6 :5. Nc3 e6 The seemingly modest d6–e6 pawn centre affords Black a solid defensive barrier, control of the critical d5 and e5 squares, and retains flexibility to break in the centre with either ...e5 or ...d5. Black can proceed with rapid , and the opening provides sound counterchances and considerable scope for creativity. The line has been championed by Garry Kasparov, among many other distinguished grandmasters. Origin The variation first came to international attention during the 1923 chess tournament in the village Scheveningen at the North Sea coast near The Hague. During the tournament the variation was played several times by several players, including Euwe playing it against Maróczy. Keres Attack: 6.g4  White has several different attacking schemes available, but the one considered most dangerous is the Keres Attack, named after GM Paul Keres, which continues 6. g4. This move takes advantage of the fact that 5...e6 cuts off the black bishop's control of g4, and plans to force the knight on f6, Black's only developed piece, to retreat and force Black into passivity. This also launches White into a attack. Black usually continues with 6... h6 to stop White's expansion. Previously moves like 6...Nc6 or 6...a6 were also recommended for Black but practical tests have shown that White's offensive is too dangerous to be ignored. 7. h4 is strongest and the most popular. 7.g5 hxg5 8.Bxg5 Nc6 9.Qd2 Qb6 10.Nb3 a6 11.0-0-0 Bd7 12.h4 gives White an equal game at best. 7... Nc6 8. Rg1 (diagram) and here Black has two main lines to choose from: *8... d5 9.Bb5 Bd7 10.exd5 Nxd5 11.Nxd5 exd5 12.Qe2+ Be7 13.Nf5 Bxf5 14.gxf5 Kf8 15.Be3 Qa5+ *8... h5 9.gxh5 Nxh5 10.Bg5 Nf6 11.Qd2 both of which may give White a slight edge. Classical Variation: 6.Be2  Another very popular variation is the Classical (also known as Maroczy Variation) which is initiated by 6. Be2. Used to great effect by Anatoly Karpov, among other distinguished grandmasters, this methodical approach has gained many followers. The main line continues 6... a6 7. Be7 8. Be3 9. f4 Qc7 10. a4 Nc6 11. Kh1 Re8 12. Bf3 (diagram) reaching one of the main tabiyas of the Classical Scheveningen . White's plans here are to build up a kingside attack, typically by means of g2–g4–g5, Qd1–e1–h4, Bg2, Qh5, Rf3–h3, etc. Black will aim for a diversion on the via the semi-open c-file, or strike in the centre. Positional pawn sacrifices abound for both sides and the theory is very highly developed, thanks to decades of research by the most elite players such as Garry Kasparov, Vasily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, Viswanathan Anand, Veselin Topalov, Boris Gelfand and many others. English Attack: 6.Be3  The combative \\"English Attack\\" is modeled after the Yugoslav (Rauzer) Attack in the Sicilian Dragon. White starts an aggressive pawn storm on the kingside with f2–f3, g2–g4, h2–h4, and often g4–g5. White castles long and a very sharp game is often the result. Black, however, does not have to acquiesce to passive defence and has at least as many attacking threats. The main line continues 6. Be3 a6 7. f3 b5 8. g4 h6 9. Qd2 Nbd7 10. 0-0-0 Bb7 (diagram). White's plans are to force g4–g5 and open the kingside files to his advantage. The first player may also exert considerable pressure on the d-file. Black will often consider an exchange sacrifice or at least a pawn sacrifice to open the queenside files for the heavy pieces. Time is of the essence and new ideas are discovered each year. Many elite players including Alexander Morozevich, Peter Leko, and Alexei Shirov have poured many hours of study into this critical variation. Other variations =Fischer–Sozin Attack: 6.Bc4 = With the Fischer–Sozin Attack 6. Bc4, White tries to pressure the d5-square directly. Viable Black responses in the centre include variations of Nb8–c6–a5 or Nb8–d7–c5, supplemented by a7–a6 and b7–b5–b4 on the queenside. A possible line is 6...Be7 7.Bb3 0-0 8.Be3 Na6 (aiming for the c5-square; note that in case 8...Nbd7, then 9.Bxe6!? fxe6 10.Nxe6 Qa5 11.Nxf8 Bxf8, and White sacrifices two pieces for a rook) 9.Qe2 Nc5 10.f3. The ensuing position is balanced, with Black ready to counter White's g2–g4–g5 with a7–a6 and b7–b5–b4 on the other flank. =Tal Variation: 6.f4 = After 6. f4, (known as Tal Variation) in one of the main lines, 6... Nc6 7. Be3 Be7 8. Qf3, White seeks to castle queenside placing his rook on the half-open d-file, and support the g-pawn's advance with the queen. =Minor lines= 6\\\\. g3; 6. Bb5, etc. These moves are less difficult to meet and are not theoretically challenging to Black. Question of move orders and the Najdorf Variation The Keres Attack puts Black into a rather defensive and potentially dangerous position. For this reason, many advocates of this defense tend to play the Najdorf Variation move order and then play 6...e6, transposing into the Scheveningen. The most prominent example of such a preference for the Najdorf move order was seen in World Chess Championship 1984, where after game one when Kasparov had difficulties in the opening, he never allowed the Keres Attack and finally switched to the Najdorf move order. The Najdorf move order, while eliminating 6.g4, allows white additional options such as 6. Bg5, and g4 is still a possible move after. Basically the Najdorf move order delays g4 by one move making the attack vastly less powerful, meanwhile the Scheveningen move order speeds up kingside development making 6. Bg5 much less powerful. As the Keres' attack is feared more than 6. Bg5 the Najdorf move order is seen more at the highest level today. Because Najdorf's original intention was to play e5 all in one go and the history of the move order,openings beginning with 5. ...a6 are often put in the Scheveningen category if e6 is played immediately after. Much modern analysis of the Scheveningen is under the rubric of the Najdorf. In fact, many books exploring the Scheveningen today have Najdorf in the title. This, continuing the line of thinking in the English section above, is technically the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian defense with the very popular English Attack. Note that the \\"Modern\\" Scheveningen only covers lines without an early ...a6 from Black. The \\"Classical\\" Scheveningen includes the early ...a6. This distinction is important in choosing books to study, as titles covering recent games will often leave out the ...a6 early line, which can still become quite interesting and complex, and still advantageous for Black, even with the powerful English Attack. Many modern chess software programs, such as HIARCS, still play ...a6 early on, despite the fact that \\"modern\\" often precludes the line in definitive analysis, depending on the book. Vlastimil Jansa has advocated this variation.

It was home to many Asian Americans, specifically a large Filipino American population. Around 1954, the I-Hotel also famously housed in its basement Enrico Banduccci's original \\"hungry i\\" nightclub. During the late 60s, real estate corporations proposed plans to demolish the hotel, which would necessitate displacing all of the I-Hotel's elderly tenants. In response, housing activists, students, community members, and tenants united to protest and resist eviction. All the tenants were evicted on August 4, 1977 and the hotel was demolished in 1981. After the site was purchased by the International Hotel Senior Housing Inc., it was rebuilt and opened in 2005. It now shares spaces with St. Mary's School and Manilatown Center. History = Residential hotel = The I-Hotel, originally established as a luxury location for travelers in 1854, relocated to Kearny Street in 1873 and was rebuilt in 1907 after the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fire. During the 1920s and 1930s, thousands of seasonal Asian laborers came to reside at the I-Hotel. The communities and building around the I-Hotel grew into a 10-block Filipino American enclave along Kearny Street known as Manilatown, the Manilatown section of San Francisco. During the 1960s, residents were able to rent a room in the hotel for less than $50 a month. =Urban renewal = During the urban renewal and redevelopment movement of the mid-1960s, the International Hotel was targeted for demolition. This \\"urban renewal\\" that occurred in response to the end of World War II had destroyed the heart of the Fillmore District, San Francisco, and hundreds of homes and thousands of residents were displaced due to the city's plans to expand the downtown business sector. In 1968, Milton Meyer & Co., a real-estate company, issued eviction notices to the I-Hotel tenants, with plans to demolish and replace the I-Hotel with a parking garage. This demolition would happen concurrently with the destruction of ten blocks of low-cost housing, restaurants, barber shops, markets, clubs and other Filipino community businesses. In October 1973, the Thailand-based Four Seas Investment Corporation bought the I-Hotel with the similar intentions to replace it with more profitable building or structure. =Resistance and Eviction = For years after the first eviction notices were served in 1968, many individuals were involved in the long fight that took place on the streets, in courtrooms, and in the everyday lives of the I-Hotel Manilatown residents. In 1969, tenants and activists successfully negotiated an extended lease from Milton Meyer & Co. To finance this lease, Asian American art workshops Kearny Street Workshop and Jackson Street Gallery, as well as other rent-paying cultural organizations and businesses such as Everybody's Bookstore, moved into the basement of the I-Hotel. However, in 1974, tenants received eviction notices from Four Seas Investment Corporation, forcing community organizers to revise their plans to resist eviction. Community poet and historian Al Robles played a key role in organizing the broad coalition of protesters, as did International Hotel Tenant Association chairperson Emil deGuzman and tenants Wahat Tampao and Felix Ayson.Manilatown Heritage Foundation, \\"We Must Say No.\\" Letter to City of San Francisco, October 31, 2013. https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3autlqqpc0xypi/Manilatown_DeclineLetter.docx Ed Lee volunteered for the cause by working through the terms of various anti- eviction agreements as an attorney for the Asian Legal Caucus. Asian American student activists from nearby University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco State University also joined the protests, volunteering to repair and repaint the I-Hotel so that it remained habitable for tenants even as the Four Seas Investment Corporation failed to maintain basic utilities. Jim Jones in front of the l-Hotel in January 1977 Controversial Peoples Temple leader Jim Jones also became involved in the fight for the I-Hotel. After Jones was appointed as Chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission, the Housing Authority voted to acquire the building using $1.3 million in federal funds and then to turn it over to tenants rights groups.Reiterman, Tim, and John Jacobs. Raven: The Untold Story of Rev. Jim Jones and His People. Dutton, 1982. . page 282–3. When a court rejected that plan and ordered evictions in January 1977, the Peoples Temple provided two thousand of the five thousand people that surrounded the building, barricaded the doors and chanted \\"No, no, no evictions!\\" Sheriff Richard Hongisto, a political ally of Jones, refused to execute the eviction order, which resulted in Hongisto being held in contempt of court and serving five days in his own jail. In the early morning of August 4, 1977, 400 San Francisco riot police began to physically remove tenants from homes despite the 3,000 protesters attempting to surround and barricade the I-Hotel. Within six hours, all 55 remaining tenants had been evicted. In total, 197 tenants were evicted. Protestors in front of the I-Hotel on August 4,1977 San Francisco Police Department entering the I-Hotel's by ladder International Hotel Manilatown Center In 1994, real estate company Pan- Magna sold the I-Hotel land to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco.The I-Hotel rises again, San Francisco Chronicle, July 22, 2005 Subsequently, an $8.3 million grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development was awarded to facilitate development of low- income housing. The Chinatown Community Development Center was chosen to steward this grant. In 2003, construction began on the new I-Hotel, and the building was completed on August 26, 2005. The new building contains 105 apartments of senior housing. A lottery was held to determine priority for occupancy, with the remaining living residents of the original I-Hotel given priority. Occupancy started in October 2005, and the new building also contains a ground-floor community center and a historical display commemorating the original I-Hotel. Additionally, a new mural on the site of the new building by Johanna Poethig features Robles, Etta Moon, Bill Sorro, and other tenant activists, commemorating their struggle to preserve affordable housing in San Francisco.

It probably owed its origin to Marcus Valerius Messalla, censor in 154 BC. It ran first up the Anio valley past Varia, and then, abandoning it at the 36th mile, where the Via Sublacensis diverged, ascended to Carsoli, and then again to the lofty pass of Monte Bove, whence it descended again to the valley in Roman times occupied by the Lake Fucino. It is doubtful whether Via Valeria ran farther than the eastern point of the territory of the Marsi at Cerfennia, to the northeast of Lake Fucino, before the time of Claudius. Strabo states that in his day it went as far as Corfinium, and this important place must have been in some way accessible from Rome, but probably, beyond Cerfennia, only by a track. Ashby cites E. Albertini in Mélanges de l’École française de Rome (1907), 463 sqq. The difficult route from Cerfennia to the valley of the Aternus, a drop of nearly 300 m, involving too the crossing of the main ridge of the Apennines by the modern Forca Caruso was, however, probably not made into a highroad until Claudius' reign: one of his milestones (Corp. Inscr. Lat. IX. 5973) states that in 48-49 AD, he made the Via Claudia Valeria from Cerfennia to the mouth of the Aternus (the site of modern Pescara). He also constructed a road, the Via Claudia Nova, connecting the Via Salaria, which it left at Foruli (modern Civitatomassa, near Amiternum) with the Via Valeria near the modern Popoli. This road was continued south (we do not know by whom or when) to Isernia. From Popoli the road followed the valley of the Aternus to its mouth, and there joined the coast-road at Pescara. The modern railway from Rome to Castellammare Adriatico follows closely the line of the Via Valeria. The lost tomb of Perseus, last king of Macedon, was discovered by televised excavations in the Via Valeria in 2005. A second Via Valeria, the Via Valeria of Sicily, connected Messina and Siracusa. Hardly widened or improved until the nineteenth century, it remained the backbone of the Ionian drainage basin of Sicily, favoring the development of cities along it: Messina, Taormina, Giardini-Naxos, Giarre, Acireale, Catania, Augusta, Siracusa. Today, Route 114 follows it in part.  Roman bridges  :For an overview of the location of Roman bridges, see List of Roman bridges.

An anime convention is an event or gathering with a primary focus on anime, manga and Japanese culture. Commonly, anime conventions are multi-day events hosted at convention centers, hotels or college campuses. They feature a wide variety of activities and panels, with a larger number of attendees participating in cosplay than most other types of fan conventions. Anime conventions are also used as a vehicle for industry, in which studios, distributors, and publishers represent their anime related releases. Comic Frontier, an anime convention held in Jakarta, Indonesia. History Anime conventions have a long and varied worldwide history. The original Comiket, mostly based on fan published manga called dōjinshi, started in 1975 with around 700 people in Tokyo. In recent years, Comiket has attracted over a half million people. Conventions in Japan are heavily sponsored by studios or publishing companies and are used as platforms for new releases. In addition to Japan, convention officials at venues such as AnimeJapan have been trying to reach out to overseas manga otaku. Anime conventions started showing up in the United States in the early 1980s. Project A-Kon first started in 1990, and is considered to be the first anime convention in the country, but this is disputed. It is also claimed that YamatoCon, a convention \\"devoted to Japanese animation\\" was first held in 1983 in Dallas Texas. Since then, multiple anime conventions have appeared in numerous states. Since the first anime convention which brought in a few hundred people, anime conventions have exploded in popularity. AnimeCon which was held in San Jose, California in 1991 is notable for being the first convention to break the 1,000 attendance mark. It was also the first convention to receive support from American and Japanese production studios. Anime Expo which has been held in California since 1992 is the largest anime convention in North America and attracted approximately 90,500 people in 2015. Anime conventions in other locations, such as Europe began to take off in the Mid-1990s. AUKcon was a one-day anime convention held in London, England in 1994, and was chaired by Helen McCarthy. Salón del Manga de Barcelona, first held in Barcelona, Spain in 1995 is also one of the largest European conventions. Japan Expo in Paris is the largest convention in Europe, and in the world outside Japan.Japan Expo 2012Japan Expo Paris 2013 Anime conventions later spread to Australia in the late 1990s with Manifest, first held in 1998. Guests Anime conventions typically feature a guest list as part of their makeup. A guest can be an industry figure, some notable examples include director Hiroyuki Kanbe, author Tsukasa Fushimi, and Kazuma Miki from Ascii Media Works. In 2013 they screened for the first time the final three episodes from the second season of Oreimo. Guests can also include artists and performers, some notable examples of these include Kazuki Takahashi, creator of Yu-Gi-Oh!. An anime convention represents an opportunity to interact with such individuals that may not be possible outside the event. Anime convention events A rave at an Anime convention Anime conventions often have panels, which are open ended discussions involving some pre-determined topic, usually related in at least some way to anime. Panels usually come in two segments, the host puts on a presentation or does an interview with a guest, and then the fans are asked to give questions. The topic scope for panels is varied and can include things from manga to upcoming announcements by an industry. There are also workshops that are like panels but are more geared towards instructions through a major or specific task such as how to draw manga, make computer animation, or how to become a voice actor. Another event at most anime conventions include screenings of actual anime shows that can last through the day. Anime conventions can also include contests. Contests can focus around costumes (or cosplay), art works (drawn, sculpted, painted), anime-related music videos, video games, dice games, card games, and many other activities. In some cases, tangible prizes have been offered as winnings in these contests. An Exhibit Hall or Dealers' Room is also popular at anime conventions. Publishing companies, distributors, and other proprietors often arrive to exhibit and/or sell their newest products to fans. Wares can include graphic novels, manga, anime media, action figures, apparel or pre-made costumes, music CDs, software, decorations, toys, art books, specialty foods, and many more. There are also art shows at anime conventions. The shows are similar to those at a traditional museum or gallery. Artwork of all kind is put on display for inspection, and in some cases for purchase/auction bidding, by the viewer. Entry is usually only restricted by space available & registration with the convention. The artist can choose to be present to display, discuss, or take commission in a variation of the art show known as the Artists' Alley. Artists may also include crafts, drawn art, self-published books or video, fanzines, and more.

He is best known for his exploration of the west and east African coasts, discovery of the Seaflower Channel off the coast of Sumatra and for surveying the Canadian Great Lakes. The illegitimate son of Captain William Owen he was orphaned at the age of four, however, his father’s friend Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Rich, kept an eye on both William and his elder brother Edward, in 1788 at age 13 he embarked as a midshipman in Rich’s ship, , and from that time the Royal Navy was his life. Self-willed and boisterous, he had not infrequent difficulties early in his naval career. He served at home and on ships in the East Indies. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1797. In 1801 he took command of the fireship . In late 1801 the hired armed cutter King George, under the command of a Mr. Yawkins, served under Nelson at his failed attack on Boulogne. On 25 August Nelson came aboard King George to conduct a reconnaissance of the French fleet. In October Nelson gave Owen command over the King George as well, with secret instructions to launch a burning Nancy at the French fleet. The fire attack did not occur and Nancy was sold in December. After the resumption of war with France in 1803, Owen was given command of the 16-gun brig , which sailed to the East Indies. There he served under Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew, Commander-in-Chief East Indies. He explored the Maldive Islands in 1806, and in the same year discovered the Seaflower Channel, between the islands of Siberut and Sipora off the west coast of Sumatra. He fought the Dutch in the East Indies, but in on 28 September 1808 the French frigate Manche captured Seaflower. The French held Owen from 1808 to 1810 in Mauritius, during which time he was promoted to commander. After his release Owen was promoted to post captain in May 1811, before returning to England in 1813. From 1815 to 1816, he surveyed the upper Canadian Great Lakes with Lieutenant Henry Wolsey Bayfield, naming an inlet in southern Georgian Bay \\"Owen's Sound\\" in honour of his elder brother, Admiral Sir Edward William Campbell Rich Owen. Between 26 October 1815 and 31 May 1816 he was the senior Royal Navy Officer on the Great Lakes. Owen mapped the entire east African coast from the Cape to the Horn of Africa between 1821 and 1826 in the sloop Leven and in company with the brig . During this period, Owen established a one-man protectorate of Mombasa with the aim of disrupting the 'hellish trade' in slaves; but Owen was forced to shut down under orders from the Crown after only three years. When he returned in 1826, with 300 new charts, covering some 30,000 miles of coastline, over half of his original crew had been killed by tropical diseases. In 1827 he was in charge of settling a colony at Fernando Po. During the first year, he was joined by Lieutenant James Holman who was famous in his time as \\"the Blind Traveller\\". In the mid-1830s, having little hope of further naval appointment, he removed with his family to New Brunswick. He secured title to Campobello Island, which had been granted to his father and was lord proprietor of the same as well being involved in other investments in New Brunswick. From 1841 he served as a justice of the peace as well as concurrently as judge of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. Between 1837 and 1842 he was a very visible member of the New Brunswick House of Assembly for Charlotte County. Following his defeat for reelection, he was appointed in December 1843 to the New Brunswick Legislative Council of which he was an active member through 1851. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1844. In the final action of his naval career, between September 1842 and December 1847, he conducted the definitive survey of the Bay of Fundy for the Admiralty. Indeed, some charts of the area are still based upon his surveys. Family Vice Admiral Owen was twice married: first in January 1818 to Martha Evans with whom he had two daughters (see Captain John James Robinson-Owen), secondly 11 December 1852 in Saint John, New Brunswick to Amy (née Vernon) Nicholson widow of Captain Thomas L. Nicholson (see William Johnstone Ritchie). Owen was promoted Rear Admiral in 1841 and Vice Admiral in 1854. He died on 3 November 1857 at St. John, New Brunswick.

The firm's website stated that its service was used by schools in all 50 U.S. states and had been featured in publications such as Newsweek. The firm had acquired the earlier-established competitive products of Jackson Software, the makers of GradeQuick, and Orbis Software, the makers of Easy Grade Pro.  Usage  Edline was used in many schools aiming to have paperless classes and homework, thereby cutting costs. The instructor/teacher could upload such material as upcoming tests, projects, homework, class expectations, and progress reports. The website mainly helped parents see if students have missed any homework. Parents or students could even e-mail teachers if any kind of help is needed. Different schools may have uploaded varying amounts of data and information, depending on teacher preference and school requirements. For instance, it could have been used as a companion website to classroom instruction or textbooks. It could also serve as an online class platform where it would have been possible for students to learn remotely, particularly from their home. Edline worked with other emerging technologies and this could be demonstrated in the way that schools used it with social networks and applications such as Google Apps for Education.

The series stars Charles S. Dutton as Baltimore garbage collector Roc Emerson and Ella Joyce as his wife Eleanor, a nurse. Overview =Early episodes= Roc began life as a traditional television sitcom, chronicling the ups and downs of Baltimore garbage collector Charles \\"Roc\\" Emerson (Charles S. Dutton), a tightwad who constantly brought home \\"perks\\" (i.e. items thrown away by residents on his route); his wife Eleanor (Ella Joyce), a registered nurse; his womanizing younger brother Joey (Rocky Carroll), a ne'er-do-well musician who had recently returned to the neighborhood; and his father Andrew (Carl Gordon), a retired Pullman porter. A much-played scene during the series' promotion featured Roc greeting his returning brother with a casual glance and a tired \\"Hey, Joey.\\" When Eleanor suggests that he should have more to say, Roc agrees, and follows up with \\"Hey, Joey, where's my money?\\" =Live performances= The four principal cast members were all accomplished stage actors, and had become acquainted with each other while appearing in various August Wilson plays on Broadway. Three of the four leads were fresh from appearing in The Piano Lesson. In fact, Charles S. Dutton wanted all four of The Piano Lesson leads to be on the show.\\"Charles Dutton and Ella Joyce Bring Zest to TV's 'Roc'\\", JET, Oct. 7, 1991, at pp. 59–61. After a successful live episode (guest-starring Dutton's then-wife Debbi Morgan) was broadcast in February 1992, the producers and the Fox network agreed to air each episode of the second season as a live performance. Virtually every episode from season two began with a prologue in which one of the cast members directly addressed the home viewers for a few minutes. A current events item from the past week, or even that very day, would be mentioned to prove that (East Coast) viewers were indeed watching a live performance, and current events from the previous week were frequently incorporated into the dialogue. One episode dealt with the 1992 Presidential Election, and aired the Sunday before the election. As the Emersons await the results, the director interrupts the program to mention that the results are unknown, causing \\"dismay\\" amongst the characters. Roc was the first prime time scripted American series since the late 1950s to broadcast each episode of an entire season live, a feat which wasn't repeated until the entire third season of NBC's Undateable was broadcast live in 2015. A Fox executive reportedly said that Roc \\"didn't feel live\\" to audiences because \\"those actors were so good, they never made a mistake.\\" After the live format received only a limited ratings boost, the show returned to its original pre-taped format for season 3. =Social commentaries= As it progressed, the series adopted a more dramatic tone, with several installments featuring social commentaries on gang activities, violence among youths, the consequences of drug use on childbirth, and the plight of African-Americans in the United States. One of the central problems around town was the arrival of a powerful drug dealer named Andre, whose efforts throughout the community were met with counter- movements from Roc and others. This began with a brief showdown at Roc's home in which an angered Roc eventually grabbed hold of Andre and warned him that his actions would not go unchallenged. This soon gave rise to several new characters, including a vigilante named Ronnie (played by rapper Tone Lōc) and Calvin, a co-worker and friend of Roc (played by rapper Heavy D). As the story line progressed, victories were back-and-forth between the two sides, with Andre taking one of Joey's young friends under his influence, taunting Roc, and eventually being shot on-screen by an unseen assailant. Roc became a quick police suspect but was exonerated, with the shooter soon revealed to be Calvin. As Calvin began his prison sentence, Roc and Eleanor agreed to raise his teenage daughter Sheila (Alexis Fields). Once recovered, Andre was eventually confronted by Joey, Ronnie, and several of their friends about his continuing to trouble the community. After later expressing a measure of respect toward Roc, Andre would soon begin steps toward reformation. The series moved on, continuing to mix humor and occasional drama.

It is intended to replace MS-DOS boot disks and can be booted via USB flash drive, PXE, iPXE, CD-ROM, or hard disk. Traditionally used by large corporations and OEMs (to preinstall Windows client operating systems on PCs during manufacturing), it is now widely available free of charge via Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (WADK) (formerly Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK)).  Overview  WinPE was originally intended to be used only as a pre-installation platform for deploying Microsoft Windows operating systems, specifically to replace MS-DOS in this respect. WinPE has the following uses: * Deployment of workstations and servers in large corporations as well as pre- installation by system builders of workstations and servers to be sold to end users. * Recovery platform to run 32-bit or 64-bit recovery tools such as Winternals ERD Commander or Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE). * Platform for running third-party 32-bit or 64-bit disk cloning utilities. The package can be used for developer testing or as a recovery CD/DVD for system administrators. Many customized WinPE boot CDs packaged with third-party applications for different uses are now available from volunteers via the Internet. The package can also be used as the base of a forensics investigation to either capture a disk image or run analysis tools without mounting any available disks and thus changing state. Version 2.0 introduced a number of improvements and extended the availability of WinPE to all customers, not just corporate enterprise customers by downloading and installing Microsoft's Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK). It was originally designed and built by a small team of engineers in Microsoft's Windows Deployment team, including Vijay Jayaseelan, Ryan Burkhardt, and Richard Bond.

This version differs from the other versions since it doesn't need the disc to load all the files. This means that the download is now 992 MB in size instead of 60 MB from the previous versions. It's possible to modify the default startup disc to have access to a few plug-ins like Windows Management Instrumentation, Windows Scripting Host, additional drivers and other 32-bit applications (or 64-bit applications for 64-bit versions).

Windows RE is installed along with Windows Vista and later, and may be booted from hard disks, optical media (such as an operating system installation disc) and PXE (e.g. Windows Deployment Services). A copy of Windows RE is included in the installation media of the aforementioned operating systems. It is a successor to Recovery Console.  Features  Windows RE features include: *Automatic Repair: Automatically finds and fixes boot errors in the Windows Vista Startup Process caused by issues such as corruption of the following components: Boot Configuration Data, disk and file system metadata, Master Boot Record, or Windows Registry, and issues caused by missing or damaged boot and system files, incompatible drivers, or damaged hardware. Prior to Windows 8, this mode was known as \\"Startup Repair.\\" The executable image for Automatic Repair is \`startrep.exe\` *System Restore: Same as the System Restore that is included in Windows, it allows a system's settings to be restored to those of a previous state. *System Image Recovery: Same as the Backup and Restore component of Windows, it allows restoring a previously created disk image. *Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool: Analyses the computer memory (RAM) for defects (not available on Windows 8 and later). The program does not run inside WinRE, but instead reboots the system and executes \`memtest.exe\` instead of loading the operating system. \`memtest.exe\` cannot be run inside Windows. *Windows Command Prompt: Gives command-line access to the file system, volumes and files. It can be used to run System File Checker (\`sfc /scannow\`) against an offline Windows installation and repair missing or corrupt files. Tools like \`robocopy\`, \`diskpart\` and \`DISM\` can be used to perform various system tasks like recovering or backing up files, managing partitions, and fix servicing-related issues respectively. In order to use the command prompt, the user must sign into an administrator account. Starting with Windows Server 2012/Windows 8, the following additional options are added: * \\"Refresh\\" or \\"Reset\\": Both re-install Windows from a copy of the operating system on the hard drive. The \\"Refresh\\" operation maintains files, settings, and Windows Store apps (but not other programs), while \\"Reset\\" performs a factory reset of Windows, optionally formatting the hard drive and performing disk wiping. The Reset function does not perform a full reinstall; it merely performs a factory reset from a WIM image inside a hidden recovery partition. It is possible to create a custom WIM image based on which a Reset is performed. * Startup Settings: Enforces a series of safe settings during the startup. Windows 10 adds the following: *Restore factory settings: Allows users who upgraded to Windows 10 to revert to their original operating system. * Go back to the previous build: Windows 10 is an operating system for which Microsoft occasionally releases newer builds. In the event that installation of a new build of Windows 10 becomes problematic, this option allows the user to revert to the previous build. Only appears if the previous build's files are not deleted. Volumes encrypted with Bitlocker can be mounted if a recovery key is available. Windows Recovery Environment can also be installed to a hard drive partition by OEMs, and customized with additional tools such as a separate system recovery tool for restoring the computer back to its original state. As of Windows Vista SP1, users can create their own bootable CD containing the recovery environment.  REAgentC  Windows includes the \`REAgentC\` command which is used to configure a Windows RE boot image and a push-button reset recovery image. It allows administration of recovery options and various customizations. The \`REAgentC\` tool can either be used on an offline Windows image or on a running Windows system.REAgentC command-line options  Microsoft Docs The command requires administrator privileges.How to enable Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) on Windows 10  Windows Central = Microsoft DaRT = Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT), sold as a part of Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack, is yet another toolset based on Windows PE that performs diagnostic and recovery on an offline copy of Windows. It can manage files, edit Windows Registry, uninstall previously installed Windows updates, scan system for malware and restore deleted files.

Burrows and Mike Wallace devote a chapter, \\"White, Green and Black\\", of Gotham: a history of New York City to 1898, 1999: pp. 542-62 to the riots (pp. 556-59) and their causes. lay in the combination of nativism and abolitionism among Protestants who had controlled the booming city since the American Revolutionary War, and fear and resentment of blacks among the growing underclass of Irish immigrants and their kin. In 1827, the UK repealed legislation controlling and restricting emigration from Ireland, and 20,000 Irish emigrated; by 1835 over 30,000 Irish arrived in New York annually. In May and June 1834, the silk merchants and ardent abolitionists Arthur Tappan and his brother Lewis stepped up their agitation for the abolition of slavery by underwriting the formation in New York of a female anti-slavery society. Arthur Tappan drew particular attention by sitting in his pew (at Samuel Cox's Laight Street Church) with Samuel Cornish, a mixed-race clergyman of his acquaintance. By June, lurid rumors were being circulated by the champion of the American Colonization Society's James Watson Webb, through his newspaper Courier and Enquirer: abolitionists had told their daughters to marry blacks, black dandies in search of white wives were promenading Broadway on horseback, and Arthur Tappan had divorced his wife and married a black woman.Burrows and Wallace 1999, pg. 556. Reports appearing in London in The Times, taken from American newspapers, cite as the triggering cause a disturbance following a misunderstanding at the Chatham Street Chapel, a former theater converted with money from Arthur Tappan for the ministry of Charles Grandison Finney. Edwin G. Burrows and Mike WallaceBurrows and Wallace 1999, pg. 556f. note that on July 4, an integrated group that had convened at the chapel to celebrate New York's emancipation (in 1827) of its remaining slaves was dispersed by angry spectators. The celebration was rescheduled for July 7. According to The Times, the secretary of the New York Sacred Music Society, which leased the chapel on Monday and Thursday evenings, gave a black congregation leave to use it on July 7 to hold a church service. This service was in progress when members of the society who were unaware of the arrangement arrived and demanded to use the facility. Although one member of the congregation called for the chapel to be vacated, most refused. A fracas ensued \\"which resulted in the usual number of broken heads and benches\\". Burrows and Wallace note that constables arrived and arrested six blacks. Webb's paper described the event as a Negro riot resulting from \\"Arthur Tappan's mad impertinence\\", and the Commercial Advertiser reported that gangs of blacks were preparing to set the city ablaze.Burrows and Wallace 1999, pg. 557. Riots erupt On Wednesday evening, July 9, three interconnected riots erupted. Several thousand whites gathered at the Chatham Street Chapel; their object was to break up a planned anti-slavery meeting. When the abolitionists, alerted, did not appear, the crowd broke in and held a counter-meeting, with preaching in mock-Negro style and calling for deportation of blacks to Africa.\\"Rationalised deportation\\" under \\"humane circumstances\\" was the purpose of the American Colonization Society. Concurrently, the Rose Street home of Arthur's evangelist brother Lewis (who had already fled with his family) was targeted; his furniture was thrown from windows and set ablaze in the street. Mayor Lawrence arrived with the watch but was shouted down with three cheers for Webb, and the police were driven from the scene. Four thousand rioters descended on the Bowery Theatre to avenge an anti-American remark made by George P. Farren, the theatre's English-born stage managerCockrell calls him George P. Farren; Lott calls him George Farren. Wilmeth and Bigsby confuse him with William Farren, the noted English actor, who was then appearing in London: The Times, July 7, 1834, pg. 4; Issue 15523; col A (advt for William Farren's appearance in 'Hamlet' at the Theatre-royal, Haymarket). and an abolitionist: \\"Damn the Yankees; they are a damn set of jackasses and fit to be gulled.\\"Quoted in Wilmeth and Bigsby 361. He had also fired an American actor.The Times, Friday, August 8, 1834; pg. 2; Issue 15551; col D. Pro- slavery activists had posted handbills around New York that recounted Farren's actions. A production of Metamora was in progress as part of a benefit for Farren. Manager Thomas S. Hamblin and actor Edwin Forrest tried to calm the rioters, who demanded Farren's apology and called for the deportation of blacks. The riot was apparently quelled when Farren had the American flag displayed, and blackface performer George Washington Dixon performed \\"Yankee Doodle\\" and the minstrel song \\"Zip Coon\\", which made fun of a Northern black dandy.Diary of Philip Hone, July 10, 1864: > 'Our city last evening was the scene of disgraceful riots.

Its studios are located on Colorado Boulevard in Glendale, and the transmitter is located on Mt. Morrison. History The station began broadcasting in 1956 with the call letters KTGM with a MOR/Beautiful Music format, under the ownership of Good Music Associates. The station was acquired by Sound Corporation of Colorado in 1968, and changed call letters to KADX that same year. As KADX, the station had a MOR format that continued until it was sold to Columbine Broadcasting in 1973, who then flipped it to Jazz that same year. By 1978, it was sold again to Welcome Radio, but kept the Jazz format intact. By 1981, Great Empire Broadcasting added KADX to its portfolio, but would flip the station to Country in 1982 and take the call letters KBRQ, simulcasting its AM sister at 1280. During its tenure and through its numerous ownerships, the station, formats, signal, and its ratings, went unnoticed. On July 3, 1987, KBRQ would switch formats to Oldies and changed call letters to KXKL under the ownership of Shamrock Communications.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-07-10.pdf The format was also simulcast for the next 9 years on 1280 AM.

Some Michelines were built in the United States by the Budd Company. Most Michelines were self-propelled, but a number of locomotive-hauled trainsets were also produced. Michelines offered unprecedented ride smoothness, but they soon proved to be problematic because the low load that the wheels could bear limited railcar sizes and demanded a high number of tyres (up to 20) per car. Furthermore, they were subject to flat tyres, unlike cars with steel wheels. Eventually, the Michelines gave way to rubber-tyred metros, pioneered by the RATP (Paris transit authority) which introduced them for their superior acceleration characteristics, in order to increase the capacity of their subway lines. However, as time went by, the extra complexity of rubber-tyred rolling stock meant that they were superseded by conventional steel-wheel rolling stock.

History In 1988, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to United Nations Peacekeepers, in recognition of their efforts over more than 50 years to establish and maintain peace. This act inspired the creation of the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal, its purpose being to recognize all Canadians, including serving and former members of the Canadian Forces, members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, other police services, and Canadian civilians, who contributed to peace on certain missions. Some time was involved in getting the medal to the presentation stage, but, as with the creation of any major honour or award, the approval of this award involved consultation with a large number of interested individuals. Design The Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal was designed by Bruce W. Beatty and is in the form of a diameter disc with, on the obverse, the words PEACEKEEPING • SERVICE DE LA PAIX, separated by maple leaves, surrounding a rendition of the three Canadian Peacekeeper figures that top the Peacekeeping Monument in Ottawa; one is an unarmed United Nations Military Observer, holding binoculars, the second, a woman, shoulders a radio, while the third stands guard with a rifle, and above them is a dove, the international symbol of peace. The medal's reverse shows the word CANADA below a maple leaf surrounded by a laurel wreath and bearing the Royal Cypher of Queen Elizabeth II, symbolizing her roles as both fount of honour and Commander-in-Chief of her various forces. A single-toe claw attaches the top of the medal to the centre of a slotted bar on which is another maple leaf. This medallion is worn at the left chest, suspended on a 31.8mm wide ribbon coloured with vertical stripes in the shade of blue used by the United Nations, green (representing service), and Canada's official colours: red (also indicitave of blood shed in the service of peace), and white (also the colour of peace). Eligibility The Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal recognizes Canadian Peacekeepers deployed outside Canada for a minimum of 30 days, which includes members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, other police officers, and civilians who served with the forces on peacekeeping missions.

Shoreline Amphitheatre is an outdoor amphitheater located in Mountain View, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. The venue has a capacity of 22,500, with 6,500 reserved seats and 16,000 general admission on the lawn. When the parking lot is utilized for festival stages, the total capacity of the venue can reach 30,000. History The amphitheatre was built in 1985–1986 by the city of Mountain View, in cooperation with local promoter Bill Graham, as part of the Shoreline Park project. Graham designed the amphitheatre to resemble The Grateful Dead's \\"steal your face\\" logo. The premiere season was during the summer of 1986, it was planned to open with a concert by The Grateful Dead, who had to cancel as a result of Jerry Garcia's coma. The first performance at the amphitheater was comedienne Rosanne Barr, opening for Julio Iglesias on June 29, 1986. Built on a landfill In its opening year, a fan attending a Steve Winwood concert flicked a cigarette lighter and ignited methane that had been leaking from a landfill beneath the theatre. Several small fires were reported that season. After those incidents, the city of Mountain View commissioned methane testing studies to define the location of methane vapors emanating from the soil within the amphitheater.Methane testing in the vicinity of landfill environs, EMI prepared for the City of Mountain View, Ca., 1986-87 These tests were used in developing a design for improved methane monitoring and more efficient methane extraction to ensure the amphitheater became safe as an outdoor venue. Ultimately, the lawn was removed, a gas barrier and methane removal equipment were installed, and then the lawn was re-installed.

History  Davis Polk traces its origin to a one-man practice in Manhattan opened by a 21-year-old lawyer, Francis N. Bangs. The firm changed its name several times to account for new partners, using names such as Bangs & Stetson; Bangs, Stetson, Tracey & MacVeagh, and Stetson, Jennings & Russell. Towards the end of the 19th century, John Pierpont Morgan hired Francis Stetson, then name partner of the firm, as his chief counsel. During Stetson's tenure, the firm helped Morgan to restructure the Pennsylvania Railroad as well as create General Electric. The modern incarnations of Morgan's business, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, have remained key clients of the firm. Among other high-profile lawyers, President Grover Cleveland served as a member of the firm during the interval between his two non-consecutive presidential terms.Allan Nevins, Grover Cleveland: A Study in Courage, p.450. The firm was located at 15 Broad Street from around 1889 to 1962, and then at One Chase Manhattan Plaza until 1992. The firm voted in 1967 to take its current name from three of the firm's most influential partners from the early-to-mid 20th century: John W. Davis, Frank Polk, and Allen Wardwell. In 1935, In response to the Glass–Steagall Act of 1932, the firm performed the legal work to spin off the investment banking arm of J.P. Morgan & Co., which became known as Morgan Stanley. In 1938, the firm represented Erie Railroad in the landmark case Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), in which Justice Louis Brandeis introduced the Erie doctrine. In 1952, John W. Davis represented U.S. Steel and successfully challenged the constitutionality of President Harry S. Truman's attempted takeover of the company in a famous case that has been referenced by most legal scholars today to assess executive power (see Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)). In 1962, the firm opened its first overseas office in Paris. In 1971, Lydia Kess was the first woman to be promoted to partner, becoming the second female partner at a major Wall Street law firm. In 1981, the firm played an important role in negotiating the financial aspects of the resolution of the Iranian hostage crisis. In 1998, the firm advised Exxon on its $81 billion merger with Mobil, the largest merger in history at the time. In 2000, the firm advised its long-term client, J.P. Morgan & Co., on its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank to form JPMorgan Chase. From 1999 to 2010, the firm worked on the initial public offerings of United Parcel Service, AT&T; Wireless, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Visa Inc., General Motors and Agricultural Bank of China, some of the largest IPOs in history. During the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the firm represented many government clients, including the United States Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the firm had important roles in the AIG, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and Citigroup matters, as well as in the drafting of the Dodd–Frank Act. In 2009, to bolster its financial regulatory practice, the firm hired three former Securities and Exchange Commission officials: Commissioner Annette Nazareth, Director of Enforcement Linda Chatman Thomsen, and Deputy Director of Trading and Markets Robert Colby—as well as former White House Staff Secretary Raul Yanes and former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation General Counsel John Douglas. Controversy about race relations John W. Davis's legal career is most remembered for his final appearance before the Supreme Court, in which he unsuccessfully defended the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine in Briggs v. Elliott, a companion case to Brown v. Board of Education. Davis, as a defender of racial segregation and state control of education, argued that South Carolina had shown good faith in attempting to eliminate any inequality between black and white schools and should be allowed to continue to do so without judicial intervention.

Vinson. After the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against his client's position, he returned the $25,000 (equivalent to $ in ), that he had received from South Carolina, although he was not required to do so, but kept a silver tea service that had been presented to him. It has also been reported that he never charged South Carolina in the first place. He declined to participate further in the case, as he did not wish to be involved in the drafting of decrees to implement the Court's decision. In Guinn v United States, as Solicitor General, while he argued against the legality of the “grandfather clause”, he conceded the legality of the literacy tests, which was used to disenfranchise African Americans and others.Joe Patrice E Davis Polk Is Named After A Segregationist… Perhaps It’s Time To Consider A New Name 17 January 2020 https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/davis-polk-is-named-after-a-segregationist- perhaps-its-time-to-consider-a-new-name/ Lisa G.

Little Cacapon is located at the mouth of the Little Cacapon River on the Potomac, east of Okonoko. Okonoko-Little Cacapon Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 2/7) and Spring Gap-Neals Run Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 2) converge south of Little Cacapon. Because of its key location at the mouth of the Little Cacapon and on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Little Cacapon played important roles in both the French and Indian and American Civil Wars. Generally pronounced . Sometimes, despite the current spelling of the word (derived from local Native American for \\"medicine water\\") some locals say .  Fort Cox  On April 4, 1765, a settler by the name of Balzar Stoker received a land grant of 232 acres (940,000 m²) from Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron along the Little Cacapon River and its mouth on the Potomac. Prior to receiving his land grant from Lord Fairfax, Stoker had also purchased 30 acres (120,000 m²) from John Cox. Located on these lands at the Little Cacapon's mouth was \\"Coxes Ferry,\\" which crossed the Potomac to Maryland. It was at the river's mouth (referred to as \\"Ferry Field\\") that a relative of John Cox, Friend Cox, had constructed a stockade. Cox's Fort was erected prior to 1750 for the purposes of protecting and defending both the Potomac River and the Little Cacapon valley. George Washington had previously surveyed a tract of 240 acres (970,000 m²) of land at the Little Cacapon's mouth for Nicholas Friend on April 25, 1750. Cox's fort and ferry later served as a means of transportation for General Edward Braddock and his soldiers en route to Cumberland from Winchester during the French and Indian War. Civil War skirmishes  By 1842, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had been completed from Baltimore to Cumberland along the Potomac River through Green Spring, Okonoko, and Little Cacapon. With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad became a contested mode of transportation between the Union and the Confederacy. Once again, the mouth of the Little Cacapon became a vital location of defense of both the railroad and the Little Cacapon valley. On November 30, 1861, a skirmish occurred near the river in defense of the Little Cacapon railroad bridge that resulted in the wounding of three Union soldiers. The 54th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment's Company K, under the leadership of Captain Edmond R. Newhard, was assigned to guard duty at the Baltimore and Ohio's railroad bridge over the Little Cacapon until January 1863. On October 4, 1862, a skirmish between Company K and Confederate soldiers under the command of General John D. Imboden resulted in the capture of 54 Company K men (including Captain Newhard and Lieutenant Wagner).

The film is a mixture of youthful relationships set in the intense world of professional Supercross. Plot synopsis K.C. Carlyle (Howey) and Trip (Vogel) are brothers who compete in a supercross, a race involving off-the-road motorcycles on an artificial dirt track. K.C. accepts a lucrative deal to race on a factory team and leaves behind his brother to fund his own racing. When an accident disables Trip, K.C. resolves his differences with him, and Trip helps coach K.C. to win the supercross championship. Cast * Steve Howey as K.C.

The director of photography for the dramatic segments was William Wages. Talk is that he was asked to re- create a sort of \\"olden times\\" look to the movie, by purposely overexposing the acting segment footage. The grainy and at times thin film is in contrast with the deep and clear cycle racing photography. Among the very finest action film makers are to be credited with the high quality look during actual motorcycle race events, that features the work of a sky train cinema camera helped along by top notch film production experts. Corporate teamwork created for the movie some of the best imagery that Clear Channel has to offer. Also, Steve Boyum excelled during his strong points of motorcycle race and stunt work photography. To make the filming story line, actors and actor double cycle racers David Castillo and Rich Taylor had to qualify for the cycle racing competition events up through and including the World Supercross Championship final race. During the finals, there was also a ten-minute break between the racing events, so that the stunt doubles could complete some work needed to film specific contest action during the movie's final minutes. Modeled sound effects mix it up with an IMAX style combination of extreme close-up and fine focus film footage during most of the actual Motocross and Supercross live action events. The Las Vegas Supercross final events live action filmed using an over-the-stadium cable camera, brings a new dimension to motorcycle racing cinematography.

The second book in the \\"Trilogy of the Rat\\" series, it is preceded by Hear the Wind Sing (1979) and followed by A Wild Sheep Chase (1982), and is the second novel written by Murakami. All three books in the Trilogy of the Rat have been translated into English, but Pinball, 1973, and Hear The Wind Sing, the first two books in the trilogy, were only printed as English translations in Japan by Kodansha under their Kodansha English Library branding, and both only as A6-sized pocket editions. Before being reprinted in 2009, these novels were difficult to locate and quite expensive, especially outside Japan. Murakami is alleged to have said that he did not intend these novels to be published outside Japan. Whether or not this is true, both novels are much shorter than those that follow and make up the bulk of his work, and are less evolved stylistically. The title reflects that of the well-known Oe Kenzaburo novel, The Silent Cry, which in the original Japanese is titled . An omnibus English edition of Murakami's first two novels (Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973), under the title Wind/Pinball, with translations by Prof. Ted Goossen of York University, was released in the United States in August, 2015. Plot introduction Despite being an early work, Pinball shares many elements with Murakami's later novels. It describes itself in the text as \\"a novel about pinball,\\" but also explores themes of loneliness and companionship, purposelessness, and destiny. As with the other books in the \\"Trilogy of the Rat\\" series, three of the characters include the protagonist, a nameless first-person narrator, his friend The Rat, and J, the owner of the bar where they often spend time. Plot summary The plot centers on the narrator's brief but intense obsession with pinball, his life as a freelance translator, and his later efforts to reunite with the old pinball machine that he used to play. He describes living with a pair of identical unnamed female twins, who mysteriously appear in his apartment one morning, and disappear at the end of the book. Interspersed with the narrative are his memories of the Japanese student movement, and of his old girlfriend Naoko, who hanged herself. The plot alternates between describing the life of the narrator and that of his friend, Rat. Many familiar elements from Murakami's later novels are present. Wells, which are mentioned often in Murakami's novels and play a prominent role in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, occur several times in Pinball. There is also a brief discussion of the abuse of a cat, a plot element which recurs elsewhere in Murakami's fiction, especially in Kafka on the Shore and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (in which the search for a missing cat is an important plotline). Rain and the sea are also prominent motifs. Major themes Similar to many of Murakami's other novels, the narrator is a detached, apathetic character whose deadpan demeanor stands either in union or, more often, starkly in contrast with the attitudes of other characters. The narrative, detached from the tangible world and highly introspective, sets a surreal tone for the novel, in which the narrator seems to find little unusual about such things as living with twins whom he cannot distinguish and whose names he does not know, or performing a funeral for a telephone circuit box. The novel also hints vaguely at supernatural occurrences (which often appear in Murakami's fiction).

At a fraternity party, Buffy and Riley are compelled to have sex by a mystical influence. The party is held in a house which was formerly a home for wayward children, that is haunted by the angry ghosts of children who were physically and emotionally abused by the Christian fundamentalist who managed the home. Plot synopsis Buffy and Riley fight a vampire and a demon in the cemetery, finally disposing of both of them. While they intend to go tell Giles about the odd pairing of demon and vampire, they opt instead for sex at Riley's dorm at Lowell House. Riley gets up in the middle of the night, acting as if he hears something from the restroom. All he finds is a dripping faucet in the tub. Xander's driving an ice cream truck for his new job, and Anya rides along with him to complain about their diminishing relationship. Trying to convince her that there is nothing wrong with him or their relationship, Xander suggests they have sex right there in the truck. He doesn't realize that there is a group of kids waiting outside for their ice cream. The gang talks about patrol the night before, and they realize that Adam is bringing the races of demons together. Buffy and Riley escape for some alone time, which is no secret to the rest of the gang. The two continue their sex romp through the night. While the rest of the house is freezing cold, Buffy and Riley continue to keep occupied, and warm. An initiative agent is badly burned when a fire in a fireplace bursts forth into the room. The next night, Spike jumps out at Anya in the streets, trying to scare her into giving him her money. At the party, Buffy and Riley are making eyes at each other from across the room while their friends attempt to talk to them. Spike and Anya bond over a couple beers at the Bronze, complaining about what it's like to be without their harmful demon powers. A guy is talking to a girl, when he places his hand on a wall and suddenly gets very excited. Xander flirts with a girl named Julie. Riley and Buffy escape upstairs to resume their own private party. Willow and Tara talk about horses, but Willow had a bad experience with them and she's very afraid of them. Willow touches Tara's knee, but Tara backs away, inexplicably disgusted with the gesture. Anya and Spike then arrive at the frat party and the two verbally gang up on Xander. A group is playing spin the bottle and Xander joins in. On Xander's turn, the bottle lands on Julie, and he kisses her on the cheek. She suddenly jumps him and starts kissing him aggressively. After she runs away, Xander follows and finds her in the closet cutting off her hair. Willow goes to the restroom looking for Tara and instead finds a ghost of a young boy drowning in the bathtub. When she reaches for him, he disappears and reappears behind her, scaring her. All this time, Buffy and Riley have barely come up for air, not even stopping when they hear Willow scream or the gang calling for them outside the door. Vines begin to cover the internal walls, the house shakes violently and Spike is strapped to a chair. Forrest tries to warn Graham, but he responds by speaking in a strange yet religious manner. They run downstairs for instructions from their commanding officers. A ghost of a young girl runs straight through Anya and disappears. Spike breaks free of his bonds and everyone escapes outside. The gang goes to Giles for help and find him singing and playing the guitar at the Espresso Bar. He's surprisingly very good, which Willow, Tara, and Anya all find appealing. Research leads them to information about the Lowell building, which used to be the old Lowell Home for Children. They find the woman, Genevieve Holt, who ran the children's home and she confesses that she rewarded the children when they were good and punished them when they were dirty. She'd cut off the hair of the girls who would preen their hair in the mirror in order to \\"remove the temptation\\" of vanity and \\"baptized\\" them by holding their bodies underwater in a bathtub. After leaving Ms. Holt's place, they conclude that a group of poltergeists is now releasing their pent up sexual energy thanks to the repetitive acts of sex by Buffy and Riley. When Buffy and Riley are drained of all their strength, they will die. Willow, Tara, and Giles perform a spell to stop the ghosts, but when they perform a seance, ghostly children appear, a strong wind blows through the air and a table is thrown across the room. Xander and Anya hack their way through the vines and try to reach Buffy and Riley. Anya is knocked across the house while Xander is dragged into the bathroom and held underwater, only to be watched by the ghost children. Anya makes her way upstairs to save Xander and they fight against the vines and finally open Riley's dorm. The next day, the gang talks about Giles's \\"mid- life crisis\\" and the consequences of Buffy and Riley's endless sex. Unconvincingly, Buffy and Riley say how horrible the experience was. Production * This episode marks the first time in the series that Anthony Stewart Head displays his singing talents. Giles will sing on screen again in three more episodes: in his apartment in \\"The Yoko Factor\\", during his dream sequence in \\"Restless\\", and the musical episode \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". *Anthony Stewart Head sings \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" but it is John King who plays guitar. Later, in the episode \\"The Yoko Factor\\", Head will both sing and play \\"Free Bird\\". * Roy, the boy who first touched the enchanted wall, played by Bryan Cuprill, was also one of the students who turned into a caveman in the episode \\"Beer Bad\\". * When Anya and Xander are alone in the house fighting through the vines to get to Buffy and Riley, a pair of arms from off camera entangle Anya with the vines.

He worked at the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology from 1888 to 1892 and was editor of the journal American Anthropologist. Biography =Early life= Henry Henshaw was born to William and Sarah Holden Wetherbee. He studied at Cambridge High School where he met William Brewster. In 1869 he was forced to give up school due to ill health, and went on a collecting trip to Louisiana. This marked the start of his career as a field naturalist. In 1870 Henshaw traveled to Florida with naturalist Charles Johnson Maynard and artist Edwin Lord Weeks. In the same year he found the first Baird's sandpiper east of the Mississippi River, in Boston. It was through this discovery that Henshaw became known to the secretary of the Smithsonian, Spencer Baird. In 1872 he went to Utah as natural history collector on the Wheeler Survey, continuing until it merged with the United States Geological Survey in 1879. =Out West= In 1872 Henshaw went to Salt Lake City on the Wheeler Survey as a naturalist, and in 1874 had his most successful field expedition, going from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Gila River and south-western Arizona. There he met with the native Apaches, and caught specimens for the Smithsonian. In 1875, he returned to Washington, and was approached by John Wesley Powell of the Bureau of Ethnology.http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/10/25/henry-henshaw- the-national-geographic-founder-who-helped-save-americas-birds/ Along with C. Hart Merriam and Grove Karl Gilbert, Henshaw set out West on the United States Geological Survey, where in addition to his ornithological work, Henshaw worked on linguistics and anthropology, eventually compiling two volume book titled Handbook of North American Indians North of Mexico. =Hawaii= In 1894, in ill health after a severe attack of influenza that left him hospitalized, Henshaw moved to Hawaii with the express intent of becoming a citizen of the island nation, and in search of better health. There, he picked up photography. As his health returned, he returned to ornithology, especially related to birds of the Hilo area, where he lived, as well as those in the drier, higher elevations around Mauna Kea. He collected and preserved hundreds of specimens and published two works on Hawaiian birds. Viewing the mass extinction of birds in Hawaii would later make Henshaw a conservationist. He left Hawaii in 1904 to return to Washington, D.C. =Conservation= In 1910, Henshaw replaced his old friend C. Hart Merriam as the head of the U.S. Biological Survey. With new-found zeal, Henshaw began working for bird conservation, publishing Fifty Common Birds of Farm and Orchard, which sold 200,000 copies, in 1913. This publication caused Henshaw to be approached by Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor, who asked Henshaw if Fifty Common Birds of Farm and Orchard could be printed in the National Geographic Magazine. The end result of that publication was the National Geographic Field Guide to Birds of North America. While not working with the National Geographic, Henshaw lobbied, along with George Shiras, to pass the Weeks-McLean Act, otherwise known as the Migratory Bird Law. Henshaw handed Woodrow Wilson the pen with which Wilson signed the Act into law in 1913. =Later life= Henshaw retired in 1916, and lived in Washington, D.C. unmarried until the end of his days. In his old age he began studying algae. Henshaw died on August 1, 1930, aged 81. Organizations Henshaw was one of the founders of the Nuttall Ornithological Club in 1873, the American Ornithologists' Union in 1883, and the National Geographic Society in 1888.

The genus was later divided, with its species distributed amongst three genera: Neoshirakia, Shirakiopsis , and Triadica. Neoshirakia contains only one known species, Neoshirakia japonica, known as tallow tree, native to China, Korea, and Japan (including Nansei-shotō).

J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, California Jean-Baptiste Le Prince (September 17, 1734 – September 30, 1781) was an important French etcher and painter. Le Prince first studied painting techniques in his native Metz. He then travelled to Paris around 1750 and became a leading student of the great painter, François Boucher (1703–1770). Le Prince's early paintings in both theme and style are comparable to his master's rococo techniques. In 1758 Le Prince journeyed to Russia to work for Catherine the Great at the Imperial Palace, St. Petersburg. He remained in Russia for five years and also travelled extensively throughout Finland, Lithuania and even Siberia. When Le Prince returned to Paris in December, 1763, he brought with him an extensive collection of drawings which he employed as the basis for a number of fine paintings and etchings. J. B. Le Prince was elected a full member of the Académie de peinture et de sculpture in 1765. Le Prince's graphic art of Russia and its peoples is significant in that he based his compositions entirely upon his own designs, lending a much more realistic portrayal to his views than other eighteenth century contemporaries. He is also credited with being the first artist (in 1768) to introduce aquatint into his etched and engraved plates. He may even have been the inventor of aquatint, the tonal graphic art that would later be so skillfully used by such masters as Goya, Louis-Philibert Debucourt, Delacroix and Thomas Rowlandson.

It was created as Lake County in 1861 as one of the original nine counties of Nevada. The name Lake County was chosen due to the many lakes in the area, including Honey Lake, Pyramid Lake, and Winnemucca Lake. History In March 1861, Congress created the official Territory of Nevada, with the Honey Lake Valley and the area to its north included within its provisional bounds. When this occurred, the border between Nevada and California was poorly defined in Nevada's Organic Act. Later in 1861, Lake County was established in northwestern Nevada, creating a boundary dispute with California. In 1862 Lake County was renamed Roop County after Isaac Roop, governor of the unofficial \\"Provisional Territorial Government of Nevada Territory,\\" which had previously existed in the same area. Much of Roop County, including Susanville (which was named for Roop's daughter), was claimed by California as part of Plumas County. This has been called the Roop County War, the War of Injunctions, or the Sagebrush War. This resulted in the appointment of a joint California–Nevada boundary survey, with Surveyor- General J.F. Houghton acting for the State of California and Butler Ives, for the Territory of Nevada. The final surveyors report, accepted by California on April 4, 1864, and by Nevada on February 7, 1865, proved that the Honey Lake area and virtually all the population of Roop County was in California.

Oz returns to Sunnydale after learning to control his werewolf instincts. However, he loses control when he suspects Tara and Willow's relationship, and is subsequently caught by the Initiative. The episode is notable for the main character Willow coming out as lesbian. Plot synopsis Willow and Tara walk around the school grounds holding hands and talk about Tara getting a cat as a pet. At the Scooby Gang meeting, Buffy explains that there is little going on, but as usual, Giles knows that means trouble. Riley indicates The Initiative is very busy rounding up more demons than ever. As the meeting ends, Oz shows up in the doorway, shocking everyone into silence. Oz arranges to talk with Willow later, and after Oz leaves, Tara also leaves the incredibly uncomfortable situation. Buffy and Riley talk about how bad Willow and Oz's break-up really was, and Buffy accidentally mentions that Oz is a werewolf. Buffy goes off on him when he negatively comments on Willow dating a werewolf (he says that Willow seems smarter than to date a dangerous guy, unknowingly drawing a parallel between Willow and Oz and Buffy and Angel), accusing him of being a bigot and being unable to see past the 'humans versus demons' ideal he's been living. Oz takes Willow for a walk outside during a full moon, showing her that he's not in werewolf mode. While in Tibet, with the help of herbs, charms, chanting, and meditation, he's learned to control the wolf inside. Oz wants to get back together with Willow, but she is reluctant. Graham patrols with a team and they are all attacked by a four-legged demon, closely resembling a werewolf. Willow and Oz talk all night about their lives while they were apart. Tara comes by in the morning while Willow is away, and upon having Oz answer the door she gets nervous and leaves. Buffy wakes up at Riley's, but she's very distant from him. They talk about the night before in the graveyard and Riley's reaction to Oz, then Riley leaves after hearing news about Graham getting hurt. Willow shocks Buffy with the news about Oz being able to control the wolf. Buffy is even more shocked as Willow subtly explains that her relationship with Tara is now serious and that complicates things with Oz. Adam goes to Spike for his help in exchange for getting the chip out of Spike's head. Willow tells Tara that she and Oz only talked the night before, and then they hug. Oz and Tara have a confrontation and after smelling Willow on Tara, Oz concludes that the two are romantically involved. He loses control, and starts to change into a werewolf. Werewolf Oz chases Tara into a classroom, and then Riley and the Initiative guys take Oz away. The gang meets up and makes a plan to free Oz. Oz is kept caged at the Initiative and just as Riley is about to shoot him dead, he changes back into his human form. Despite Riley's attempts to help, the scientists start performing tests on Oz. Spike shows up at Giles' place and offers to lead Buffy and the gang into the Initiative. Riley sneaks in, gives Oz some clothes and tries to help him escape. On the way out, they get caught. Colonel McNamara lectures Riley about betraying the Initiative on so many levels and how he will be court-martialed. Dressed as commandos and scientists, Spike and the gang sneak into the Initiative through a back door. Adam secretly helps them by running operations through a computer and helping them shut down the power for most of the city. Holding the Colonel hostage, Buffy gets Riley and Oz free, Riley leaving the Initiative for good. Now that his life is in danger, Riley camps out at the remains of Sunnydale High with Buffy at his side. He confesses that he was wrong about Oz and that he was a bigot when thinking about Willow and Oz's relationship and couldn't see past the 'humans good, demons bad' idea, but Buffy reassures him he wasn't being a bigot but was just shocked when faced with an unconventional relationship (due to the fact she had a similar reaction when finding out about Willow and Tara). Buffy then volunteers to tell him about her past, and warns him that it's not stuff he's going to like. In Oz's van, Oz notes that he worked hard so he could return to Willow, and now she is the only thing that he can't be around without losing control of the wolf and now he needs to leave town again to escape her and the Initiative. Willow and Oz say their sad goodbyes accepting they will always be an important part of each other before Oz leaves Sunnydale forever. Later that night Willow takes a candle to Tara's room, where Tara tells Willow that she should be with the person she loves, and Willow replies that she is. Tara blows out the candle. Continuity * When Buffy is in Riley's room, she is wearing the same thing that Faith (in Buffy's body) wore at his place in Who Are You. Arc significance * Willow finally reveals to Buffy that she is dating Tara. * This is Oz's last appearance in person, though he will appear once again in Willow's dream in the season finale. * In this episode, Spike joins up with Adam, a match-up which will seriously affect the rest of the season. * Riley deserts the Initiative upon discovering the extent of its corruption.

Research The major theme of Patricia Crone's scholarly life was the fundamental questioning of the historicity of Islamic sources which concern the beginnings of Islam. Her two best-known works concentrate on this topic: Hagarism and Meccan Trade. Three decades after Hagarism, Fred Donner called Crone's work a \\"milestone\\" in the field of Orientalist study of Islam. Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, Vol. 40, No. 2 (December 2006), pp. 197-199 In their book Hagarism (1977), Crone and her associate Michael Cook, both then working at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, provided a new analysis of early Islamic history. They fundamentally questioned the historicity of the Islamic traditions about the beginnings of Islam. They tried to produce a picture of Islam's beginnings only from non-Arabic sources. By studying the only surviving contemporary accounts of the rise of Islam, which were written in Armenian, Greek, Aramaic, and Syriac by actual witnesses, they reconstructed a story of Islam's beginnings that differs from the story told by Islamic traditions. Crone and Cook claimed to be able to explain exactly how Islam came into being by the fusion of various Near Eastern civilizations under Arabic leadership.Patricia Crone: Hagarism, 1977; pp. 106, 120 ff., and others Later, Crone refrained from this attempt of a detailed reconstruction of Islam's beginnings. Toby Lester: What is the Koran, in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999 Yet she continued to maintain the basic results of her work: * The historicity of Islamic sources on Islam's beginnings has to be fundamentally questioned. * Islam has deep roots in Judaism, and Arabs and Jews were allies. * Not Mecca but a different place in northwestern Arabia was the cradle of Islam. The book came under immediate attack from Muslim and non- Muslim scholars alike for its heavy reliance on hostile sources, inauthenticity and superficiality and the authors have later dismissed their revisionist claims. In Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam (1987), Crone argued that the importance of the pre-Islamic Meccan trade had been grossly exaggerated. Furthermore, she found that Mecca was never part of any of the major ancient trade routes. She also suggested that while Muhammad never traveled much beyond the Hijaz, internal evidence in the Qur'an, such as its description of his opponents as \\"olive growers\\", might indicate that the events surrounding Muhammed took place nearer the Mediterranean than in Mecca.Patricia Crone: Hagarism, 1977; p. 24 (Was judged a \\"devastating critique of a commonplace of current historiographical accounts of the rise of Islam\\" in THE JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES review by Frederick S. Paxton.) Both Patricia Crone and Michael Cook have later suggested that the central thesis of their book \\"Hagarism\\" was mistaken because the evidence they had to support the thesis was not sufficient or internally consistent enough. Patricia Crone has suggested that the book was “a graduate essay\\" and \\"a hypothesis,\\" not \\"a conclusive finding.” Though she began as a scholar of broader military and economic history of the Near and Middle East, Crone's later career focused mainly on \\"the Qur’an and the cultural and religious traditions of Iraq, Iran, and the formerly Iranian part of Central Asia\\".\\"Patricia Crone\\", Institute for Advanced Study Bibliography =Coauthor= * with Michael Cook, Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, first published in 1977; Free online version at archive.org * with Martin Hinds, God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam (first published 1986); * with Shmuel Moreh, The Book of Strangers: Medieval Arabic Graffiti on the Theme of Nostalgia (1999) Princeton Series on the Middle-East; *with Fritz Zimmermann, The epistle of Sālim ibn Dhakwān (2001) Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press; .Custers, Martin H.

He was known mainly as a fearsome right-arm fast bowler but he also achieved a batting average of 36.50 and 1146 runs including two centuries, batting left-handed and gloveless. He also batted without a box. His best bowling was 7/69 in an innings and 8/101 in a match at the 1920/21 Test against England at the MCG. At the Johannesburg Test in 1921 he scored a century from 67 balls in 70 minutes, which was at the time the fastest hundred in terms of both balls faced and minutes taken in the history of Test cricket. The record stood until 1985 when Viv Richards managed the feat with 56 balls but it remains the record for the fastest hundred in terms of minutes.

He was murdered by Idi Amin's regime in 1972. Biography A member of the Baganda ethnic group, Kiwanuka was born in Kisabwa to Kaketo-Namugera (father) and was a member of the Roman Catholic Church. He was admitted to the bar association at Gray's Inn in February 1956. As a result of the September 1961 Uganda Constitutional Conference held in London, Uganda achieved internal self-government on 1 March 1962. Kiwanuka became Uganda's first prime minister in the new National Assembly. New elections, however, were held in April 1962, with Kiwanuka's party losing to the alliance of Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress and the Buganda traditionalist party, Kabaka Yekka. In addition, Kiwanuka's Catholicism made him unpopular with his fellow Buganda, a mainly Protestant people. Uganda achieved independence on 9 October 1962, with Obote as the first prime minister of a fully independent Uganda. Kiwanuka was imprisoned in 1969 by Obote's government, but was one of 55 political detainees released by Idi Amin immediately after the coup that brought Amin to power.Martin, General Amin, p. 140 Amin appointed him as chief justice of Uganda on 27 June 1971. Kiwanuka soon came into confrontation with Amin's disregard for the rule of law. In the immediate aftermath of Obote's abortive counter coup of 1972, Kiwanuka was arrested at gunpoint by Amin's men as he presided over a session of the High Court.David Martin, General Amin, London: Faber and Faber, 1974, p. 211 As well as countermanding from the bench some of Amin's more draconian orders, Kiwanuka had also secretly agreed to support Obote's return to power, with the proviso that Kiwanuka would be involved in constitutional reform.Martin, General Amin, p. 212 Kiwanuka was killed by Amin's forces on 22 September at Makindye Military Prison in a prolonged execution which, according to eyewitnesses, involved Kiwanuka ears, nose, lips, and arms being severed, a disembowelling, and castration before he was finally immolated. Kiwanuka's death was not acknowledged as an execution, with Amin instead publicly blaming it on Obote's supporters and even launching a police investigation. Kiwanuka's killing was the first of a series directed against leading figures in the Baganda and Ankole tribes, aimed at curbing their power.Martin, General Amin, p. 213 Kiwanuka's grandson, Mathias Kiwanuka, played defensive end for Boston College's American football team from 2001 to 2005 and was the New York Giants' first round pick in the 2006 NFL Draft.Kiwanuka Goes Home, but His Heart Is Far Away  References  Category:1922 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Assassinated Ugandan politicians Category:British colonial army soldiers Category:Democratic Party (Uganda) politicians Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:People murdered in Uganda Category:Prime Ministers of Uganda Category:Ugandan judges Category:Ugandan Roman Catholics Category:20th-century Ugandan lawyers Category:Chief Justices of Uganda ","title":"Benedicto Kiwanuka"},{"id":"2551181","text":"趙合德于《百美新詠圖傳》 Zhao Hede (; died 7 BC) was an imperial consort of the rank zhaoyi (昭儀) during the Han dynasty. She was a consort to Emperor Cheng and sister of the empress Zhao Feiyan. Background It is not known when Zhao Hede was born, but it is clear she was younger than her sister Feiyan. According to historical accounts, she was a daughter of two hereditary servants of imperial princes or princesses. Her father's name was Zhao Lin (趙臨). She was probably later assigned to the household of Princess Yang'a (陽阿公主), with her sister Zhao Feiyan, but that is not clear. What is clear is that when Emperor Cheng became enamored with her sister circa 19 BC, he took not only her sister, but also her, as imperial consorts, and they became highly favored, over Empress Xu and Consort Ban. Imperial Consort In 18 BC, they falsely accused Empress Xu and Consort Ban of witchcraft; Empress Xu was deposed, and while Consort Ban was able to successfully plead her case, she did not wish to return to the same environment and instead became a lady in waiting for Empress Dowager Wang. The Zhao sisters now dominated the palace. Feiyan was created empress in 16 BC. After Feiyan was created empress, she began to lose favor from Emperor Cheng, while her sister Hede received the nearly exclusive affection of Emperor Cheng. While the sisters initially were jealous of each other, they later reconciled, and continued to dominate the palace together. However, neither of them would produce any children who could serve as imperial heir -- something greatly troubling to Emperor Cheng (whose earlier favorites Empress Xu and Consort Ban were also childless, and no other consort of whom was known to have had children). Emperor Cheng so loved Consort Zhao that the palace she lived in, Zhaoyang Palace (昭陽宮), was described in this way in the Book of Han: :The atrium of the palace was painted entirely scarlet red, while the bedchambers were painted black. The thresholds were made of copper, and were covered with gold. The steps were carved from white jade, and the edge of the walls were largely trimmed with gold, and the palace was decorated with jade produced in Lantian (藍田, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), pearls, and feather-like crystallized jade. Ever since there were imperial palaces, there has never been one so luxurious. Consort Zhao was also described to have been so perfect in her beauty that when she arrived at the palace, every person who saw her could not stop praising her beauty. A senior lady in waiting to Emperor Cheng's grandfather Emperor Xuan named Chuofang Cheng (淖方成), however, commented: \\"She is water of disaster, and will surely put out the fire!\\" (A symbol of Han Dynasty is fire, so Chuofang was expressing her belief that Consort Zhao would lead to the destruction of the Han Dynasty. The term that Chuofang used, huoshui (禍水), later became idiomatic to describe a woman who would lead to disaster, and is often extended to a longer form hongyan huoshui (红颜禍水) to describe women who were, fairly or not, viewed as the cause of their dynasties' destruction.) Palace Intrigues Consort Zhao and her sister Empress Zhao would also be alleged to have been involved in something even more sinister around this period. Based on an investigative report later authored in 6 BC (after the deaths of Emperor Cheng and Consort Zhao herself), Emperor Cheng had two sons -- one born to Consort Cao in 12 BC and one born to Consort Xu (a relative of the deposed Empress Xu) in 11 BC. However, both of the sons were murdered in their infancy by orders of Consort Zhao, with at least tacit agreement from Emperor Cheng; Consort Cao was forced to commit suicide after her son was murdered. The report further alleged that the Zhao sisters engaged in many tactics, such as forced abortions, assassinations, and poisonings, to make sure that no other concubine would bear an imperial heir. Emperor Cheng died suddenly in 7 BC, apparently from a stroke (although historians also report the possibility of an overdosage of aphrodisiacs given to him by Consort Zhao). Immediately there were many rumors that he had in fact had concubines who bore him sons, but that those sons and their mothers were murdered by Consort Zhao (out of jealousy) and possibly Emperor Cheng himself. Grieving her husband and apparently fearful of reprisal, Consort Zhao Hede killed herself.  References  * Book of Han, vol. 97, part 2. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 31, 32, 33.

They inhabited the region known as Zyx, which is on the northern slopes of the Western Caucasus. To the east were the Avars. To the north was Sarmatian territory, and to the south lay the part of Colchis inhabited by the Svans (Soanes of Strabo and Pliny the Elder). Initially, Zyx (Italian: Sychia, Georgian: Jiqeti) in Greek literature referred to a people inhabiting the area between Gagra and Tuapse, who later expanded up to the estuary of the Kuban and the neighbouring region of historical Tmutarakan.Kadir I. Natho S. 59 This tribe also features in several ancient and medieval works, notably in Pliny (Zichoi), Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, medieval Georgian chroniclers (Jikebi), Marco Polo, and Johannes de Galonifontibus, who, in his Libellus de notitia orbis, speaks of \\"Zikia or Circassia\\" and their language, perhaps the earliest reference to the Northwest Caucasian languages.Glanville Price (1998), Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe, p. 60.

Greg Chappell said he was one of only two players he knew who would kill to get into the Australian Test team, the other being Rod Marsh.Greg Chappell, \\"Old Hands Showed The Way\\", Test Series Official Book 1986–87, The Clashes For The Ashes, Australia vs England, Playbill Sport Publication, 1986. Career Educated at Geelong College, Redpath played first-class cricket for Victoria in 92 matches scoring 6,103 runs with a highest score of 261 made in only his tenth first-class innings, scored in February 1962 against a Queensland attack including Wes Hall. He made his test debut on New Year’s Day at Melbourne in the second test of the 1963–64 series against South Africa. Opening the batting with Bill Lawry, the pair added 219 before Redpath was bowled on 97. Redpath was the last Australian Test cricketer to play as an amateur. He declined the match fee in his early tests in order not to jeopardise his amateur football career.Lavelle, A. (2008) \\"It's My Birthday\\", Sunday Age, 11 May 2008 With his lean, gangly body and long neck, Redpath attracted the early nickname \\"Gandhi\\" among his teammates. However, when some concerns about this were expressed by local fans on the Australian tour of India in 1964–65, his colleagues permanently reverted to the simpler \\"Redders\\". Originally a sweet striker of the ball, Redpath turned into something of a stonewaller, with impressive powers of concentration and a sound technique. He matured late. It would not be until the Sydney test of February 1969 against the West Indies that he reached his maiden test century. In that same series, at Adelaide, he was infamously run out backing up at the bowler's end by Charlie Griffith, without any warning from the bowler. Having broken through with a big score, Redpath flourished and proceeded to score seven Test centuries in the second half of his career, including five in his final 15 Tests, and three in his final test series in 1975–76 whilst opening the batting against a vaunted West Indian fast bowling attack featuring Michael Holding and Andy Roberts. It was not until his penultimate test that he struck his first six, advancing down the wicket to loft Lance Gibbs over the fence. Having done so, he promptly hit another six in the same innings. Considered the most correct batsman in the world by Trevor Goddard in 1966–67, in his maturity, he was a fine player of spin bowling. =Vice-captaincy= He was Australian vice captain to Ian Chappell in 1974–75, and to Greg Chappell in 1975–76. He was batting when the young Greg Chappell made a century on debut against England in 1970–71, who later wrote > My first innings in Test cricket was, as you might expect, a trying > experience, but proved to be one of the best cricket lessons of my career, > thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 > to join \\"Redders\\", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other > end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them > through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of > our partnership. \\"Snowy\\" concentrated his attack short of a length on > \\"Redders\\" off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for > good measure.

Redpath made his highest Test score of 171 before he was caught and bowled by Ray Illingworth. He and the younger Chappell put on 219 for the sixth wicket. Redpath made 497 runs (49.70) in the series and the England fast bowler John Snow wrote \\"I liked bowling to him least of all\\" and added that he was \\"a real nuisance batsman\\".p109, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 At Auckland in 1973–74, he carried his bat for 159* out of a total of 346 against New Zealand. Redpath shared a first-wicket century stand in Tests with four different partners – Bill Lawry, Keith Stackpole, Rick McCosker and Alan Turner. Redpath was widely regarded as an affable individual. However, during player payment negotiations in 1974–75, despite record takings at the gate, the Australian Cricket Board refused any thought of a player pay rise. When Australian Cricket Board administrator Alan Barnes told a dressing room of Australian cricketers that there were 50,000 others who would be prepared to play for Australia for nothing, the normally mild mannered Redpath reacted. According to Ian Chappell, Redpath grabbed Barnes around the throat and had him up against a wall, saying \\"You bloody idiot. Of course there are 500,000 out there who would play for nothing. But how bloody good would the Australian team be?\\" Previously, when then captain Bill Lawry drafted a stinging letter to the board critical of the arrangements that players had been forced to endure on the combined tours of India and South Africa in 1969–70, Redpath proposed that all the players should sign it. Lawry demurred, signing it only in his own name. This sealed the fate of Lawry’s career. Redpath was one of the few to survive that disastrous tour of South Africa with a reputation intact, averaging 47.17 in the four Tests. During an innings on tour of 152 against Orange Free State at Bloemfontein, he scored 32 runs off a six-ball over, which remains a record for any Australian in first class cricket. An outstanding fieldsman in the slips or at short leg, Redpath took 83 Test catches. His bowling was undistinguished; he was once called for throwing against Glamorgan in 1964. =World Series Cricket= Redpath retired from Test cricket in order to devote himself full-time to proprietorship of an antique business in Geelong. He had already declined the 1975 Ashes tour to tend to this neglected enterprise. However his absence from top cricket was brief. After a season out of the game, he signed for World Series Cricket, lured by a personal visit to Geelong by Kerry Packer’s lieutenant Austin Robertson, and despite Packer’s initial reluctance to contract the Victorian. As with many of his colleagues, the personal costs of supporting the rebel entrepreneur were significant; after two decades of service to the South Melbourne Cricket Club, Redpath was made persona non grata. In an early world series match at Kardinia Park, Geelong in 1977–78, Redpath snapped his Achilles tendon, an injury that ruled him out for the season. Packer declared that Redpath would be paid for the duration. The Victorian repaid the loyalty by returning again for 1978–79, playing mainly in World Series country cup games. He was recalled for international duties once more, playing two supertests at the age of 37. At Sydney, against the by then fearsome West Indies XI attack, he took blow after blow on the body, holding out for 143 minutes to make 9, and adding 71 critical runs with David Hookes which contributed to an improbable 10 wicket victory for the Australian XI. He remains among Victoria's top ten run-makers of all time. Years after his WSC days, Redpath was accepted back into the Victorian fold and appointed as the coach of Victoria. Later life He was awarded an MBE in 1975. He wrote his cricketing memoirs, Always Reddy, with Neill Phillipson in 1976. After retiring from playing, he coached Victoria. He is now retired from the antique business, but remains active at the Geelong Cricket Club.

Although the term is still used today as a reference to the systems and output of the major studios, historically the term refers to the practice of large motion picture studios between the 1920s and 1960s of (a) producing movies primarily on their own filmmaking lots with creative personnel under often long-term contract, and (b) dominating exhibition through vertical integration, i.e., the ownership or effective control of distributors and exhibition, guaranteeing additional sales of films through manipulative booking techniques such as block booking. The studio system was challenged under the antitrust laws in a 1948 Supreme Court ruling which sought to separate production from the distribution and exhibition and ended such practices, thereby hastening the end of the studio system. By 1954, with television competing for audience and the last of the operational links between a major production studio and theater chain broken, the historic era of the studio system was over. The period stretching from the introduction of sound to the beginning of the demise of the studio system, 1927–1948, is referred to by some film historians as the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Golden Age is a purely technical distinction and not to be confused with the style in film criticism known as Classical Hollywood cinema, a style of American film which developed from 1917 to 1963 and characterizes it to this day. During the so-called Golden Age, eight companies constituted the major studios that promulgated the Hollywood studio system. Of these eight, five were fully integrated conglomerates, combining ownership of a production studio, distribution division, and substantial theater chain, and contracting with performers and filmmaking personnel: Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century Fox), Loew’s Incorporated (owner of America's largest theater circuit and parent company to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), Paramount Pictures, RKO Radio Pictures, and Warner Bros. Two majors—Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures—were similarly organized, though they never owned more than small theater circuits. The eighth of the Golden Age majors, United Artists, owned a few theaters and had access to two production facilities owned by members of its controlling partnership group, but it functioned primarily as a backer-distributor, loaning money to independent producers and releasing their films.  Sound and the Big Five  The years 1927 and 1928 are generally seen as the beginning of Hollywood's Golden Age and the final major steps in establishing studio system control of the American film business. The success of 1927's The Jazz Singer, the first feature-length \\"talkie\\" (in fact, the majority of its scenes did not have live-recorded sound) gave a big boost to the then midsized Warner Bros. studio. The following year saw both the general introduction of sound throughout the industry and two more smashes for Warners: The Singing Fool, The Jazz Singer's even more profitable follow-up, and Hollywood's first \\"all-talking\\" feature, Lights of New York. Just as significant were a number of offscreen developments. Warner Bros., now flush with income, acquired the extensive Stanley theater chain in September 1928. One month later, it purchased a controlling interest in the First National production company, more prominent than Warners itself not long before. With the First National acquisition came not only a studio and backlot but another large string of movie theaters. Warners had hit the big time. The last of the \\"Big Five\\" Hollywood conglomerates of the Golden Age emerged in 1928: RKO. The Radio Corporation of America (RCA), led by David Sarnoff, was looking for ways to exploit the cinema sound patents, newly trademarked RCA Photophone, owned by its parent company, General Electric. As the leading film production companies were all preparing to sign exclusive agreements with Western Electric for their technology, RCA got into the movie business itself. In January, General Electric acquired a sizable interest in Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), a distributor and small production company owned by Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future president John F. Kennedy. In October, through a set of stock transfers, RCA gained control of both FBO and the Keith-Albee-Orpheum theater chain; merging them into a single venture, it created the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation, Sarnoff chairing the board. With RKO and Warner Bros. (soon to become Warner Bros.–First National) joining Fox, Paramount, and Loew's/MGM as major players, the Big Five that would remain for thirty years were now in place. Although RKO was an exception, the heads of studios on the west coast, the 'movie moguls', had mostly been in place for some years: Louis B. Mayer at MGM, Jack L. Warner at Warner Bros., Adolph Zukor at Paramount, Darryl F. Zanuck (at 20th Century Fox from 1935), Carl Laemmle at Universal, and Harry Cohn at Columbia.  Reign of the majors and the first decline  The ranking of the Big Five in terms of profitability (closely related to market share) was largely consistent during the Golden Age: MGM was number one eleven years running, 1931–41. Paramount, the most profitable studio of the early sound era (1928–30), faded for the better part of the subsequent decade, and Fox was number two for most of MGM's reign. Paramount began a steady climb in 1940, finally edging past MGM two years later; from then until its reorganization in 1949 it was again the most financially successful of the Big Five. With the exception of 1932—when all the companies but MGM lost money, and RKO lost somewhat less than its competitors—RKO was next to last or (usually) last every year of the Golden Age, with Warner generally hanging alongside at the back of the pack. Of the smaller majors, the Little Three, United Artists reliably held up the rear, with Columbia strongest in the 1930s and Universal ahead for most of the 1940s.Financial analysis based on Finler (1988), pp. 286–287. Hollywood's success grew during the Great Depression, possibly because films helped audiences escape their personal difficulties. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said of Shirley Temple, \\"When the spirit of the people is lower than at any other time during this Depression, it is a splendid thing that for just fifteen cents an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles\\".\\"Shirley Temple, iconic child star, dies at 85\\", Associated Press (February 11, 2014). By 1939 there were 15,000 movie theaters in the United States, more than banks; the number of theaters per capita was twice that of the mid-1980s. The cinema industry was larger than that for office machines. While only the 14th largest by revenue, it was second in the percentage of profits that its executives received. Top stars such as Bing Crosby and Claudette Colbert were paid more than $400,000 a year ($ today).  The end of the system and the death of RKO  One of the techniques used to support the studio system was block booking, a system of selling multiple films to a theater as a unit. Such a unit—five films was the standard practice for most of the 1940s—typically included only one particularly outstanding film, the rest a mix of A-budget pictures of lesser quality and B movies.See Schatz (1999), pp. 19–21, 45, 72. As Life magazine wrote in 1957 in a retrospective on the studio system, \\"It wasn't good entertainment and it wasn't art, and most of the movies produced had a uniform mediocrity, but they were also uniformly profitable ... The million- dollar mediocrity was the very backbone of Hollywood.\\" On May 4, 1948, in a federal antitrust suit known as the Paramount case brought against the entire Big Five, the U.S. Supreme Court specifically outlawed block booking. Holding that the conglomerates were indeed in violation of antitrust, the justices refrained from making a final decision as to how that fault should be remedied, but the case was sent back to the lower court from which it had come with language that suggested divorcement—the complete separation of exhibition interests from producer-distributor operations—was the answer. The Big Five, though, seemed united in their determination to fight on and drag out legal proceedings for years as they had already proven adept at—after all, the Paramount suit had originally been filed on July 20, 1938. However, behind the scenes at RKO, long the financially shakiest of the conglomerates, the court ruling came to be looked at as a development that could be used to the studio's advantage. The same month that the decision was handed down, multimillionaire Howard Hughes acquired a controlling interest in the company. As RKO controlled the fewest theaters of any of the Big Five, Hughes decided that starting a divorcement domino effect could actually help put his studio on a more equal footing with his competitors. Hughes signaled his willingness to the federal government to enter into a consent decree obliging the breakup of his movie business. Under the agreement, Hughes would split his studio into two entities, RKO Pictures Corporation and RKO Theatres Corporation, and commit to selling off his stake in one or the other by a certain date. Hughes's decision to concede to divorcement terminally undermined the argument by lawyers for the rest of the Big Five that such breakups were unfeasible. While many today point to the May court ruling, it is actually Hughes's agreement with the federal government—signed November 8, 1948—that was truly the death knell for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Paramount soon capitulated, entering into a similar consent decree the following February. The studio, which had fought against divorcement for so long, became the first of the majors to break up, ahead of schedule, finalizing divestiture on December 31, 1949. By this time, there were 19,000 movie theaters in the United States.[Harris, Warren G. Lucy and Desi. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1991. p.149] Through Hughes's deal with the federal authorities, and those by the other studios that soon followed, the studio system lingered on for another half-decade. The major studio that adapted to the new circumstances with the most immediate success was the smallest, United Artists; under a new management team that took over in 1951, overhead was cut by terminating its lease arrangement with the Pickford-Fairbanks production facility and new relationships with independent producers, now often involving direct investment, were forged—a business model that Hollywood would increasingly emulate in coming years. The studio system around which the industry had been organized for three decades finally expired in 1954, when Loew's, the last holdout, severed all operational ties with MGM. Hughes's gambit helped break the studio system, but it did little for RKO. His disruptive leadership—coupled with the draining away of audiences to television that was affecting the entire industry—took a toll on the studio that was evident to Hollywood observers. When Hughes sought to bail out of his RKO interest in 1952, he had to turn to a Chicago-based syndicate led by shady dealers without motion picture experience. The deal fell through, so Hughes was back in charge when the RKO theater chain was finally sold off as mandated in 1953. That year, General Tire and Rubber Company, which was expanding its small, decade- old broadcasting division, approached Hughes concerning the availability of RKO's film library for programming. Hughes acquired near-complete ownership of RKO Pictures in December 1954 and consummated a sale with General Tire for the entire studio the following summer. The new owners quickly made some of their money back by selling the TV rights for the library they treasured to C&C; Television Corp., a beverage company subsidiary. (RKO retained the rights for the few TV stations General Tire had brought along.) Under the deal, the films were stripped of their RKO identity before being sent by C&C; to local stations; the famous opening logo, with its globe and radio tower, was removed, as were the studio's other trademarks. Back in Hollywood, RKO's new owners were encountering little success in the moviemaking business and by 1957 General Tire shut down production and sold the main RKO facilities to Desilu, the production company of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Just like United Artists, the studio now no longer had a studio; unlike UA, it barely owned its old movies and saw no profit in the making of new ones. In 1959 it abandoned the movie business entirely.  In Europe and Asia  While the studio system is largely identified as an American phenomenon, film production companies in other countries did at times achieve and maintain full integration in a manner similar to Hollywood's Big Five. As historian James Chapman describes, > In Britain, only two companies ever achieved full vertical integration (the > Rank Organization and the Associated British Picture Corporation). Other > countries where some level of vertical integration occurred were Germany > during the 1920s (Universum Film Aktiengesellschaft, or Ufa), France during > the 1930s (Gaumont-Franco-Film-Aubert and Pathé-Natan) and Japan (Nikkatsu, > Shochiku and Toho). In Hong Kong, Shaw Brothers adopted the studio system > for its wuxia films throughout the 1950s-'60s. India, which represents > perhaps the only serious rival to the U.S. film industry due to its > dominance of both its own and the Asian diasporic markets, has, in contrast, > never achieved any degree of vertical integration.Chapman (2003), p. 49. For instance, in 1929 nearly 75 percent of Japanese movie theaters were connected with either Nikkatsu or Shochiku, the two biggest studios at the time.Freiberg (2000), \\"The Film Industry.\\"  After the system  = Star- driven system = In the 1950s Hollywood faced three great challenges: The Paramount case ending the studio system, the new popularity of television, and post-World War II consumer spending providing its audience with many other leisure options. The scale of both box office successes and flops grew, with a \\"dangerous middle\\" consisting of films that in the previous era would have made money. A filmmaker stated in 1957 that \\"[t]he one absolute disaster today is to make a million-dollar mediocrity. One of these you can lose not only your total investment but your total shirt.\\" By that year Hollywood was only making about 300 feature films a year, compared to about 700 during the 1920s. Darryl F. Zanuck, head of 20th Century Fox, had no direct involvement with the studio from 1956 to 1962,Douglas Martin \\"Richard Zanuck, Producer of Blockbusters, Dies at 77\\", New York Times, 13 July 2012 and Louis B. Mayer, sacked in 1951 from MGM, died in 1957.Leo Verswijver (ed.) Movies Were Always Magical: Interviews With 19 Actors, Directors, and Producers from the Hollywood of the 1930s Through the 1950s, Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2003, p.60, n.1 Harry Cohn of Columbia, who died the following year,Bernard F. Dick Columbia Pictures: Portrait of a Studio, University of Kentucky Press, p.2 informed investors in the studio's annual report of 1957 that: Most actors became freelancers after the end of the studio system. Financial backers increasingly demanded star actors, directors, and writers for projects to reduce risk of failure. The growing importance of the overseas market—40 to 50% of Hollywood's total revenue by 1957—also emphasized stars' names as box- office attractions. With their new power, \\"working for nothing\\"—receiving a percentage of profit instead of a salary—became a status symbol for stars. A top actor could expect 50% of profit, with a minimum guarantee, or 10% of gross revenue. Cary Grant, for example, received more than $700,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) from his 10% of the gross for To Catch a Thief (1955), while director and producer Alfred Hitchcock received less than $50,000. In one extreme case, Paramount promised Marlon Brando 75% of the profit of what became One-Eyed Jacks (1961). (Because of Hollywood accounting, studios still received much of the revenue before any profit sharing; thus, they preferred 50% of profit to 10% of gross.) The larger paychecks also increased the power of talent agents such as Lew Wasserman of MCA, whose office was now nicknamed \\"Fort Knox\\". By 1957, independent producers made 50% of full-length American films. Beyond working for others, top actors such as Gregory Peck and Frank Sinatra created their own production companies and purchased scripts. Top independent directors George Stevens, Billy Wilder, and William Wyler also saw their paychecks increase, in part because their involvement attracted star actors. Studios increasingly provided funding and facilities to independent producers as opposed to making their own films, or just like United Artists, they focused on distribution. While television had damaged Hollywood, TV production companies such as Desilu and the film studios' own TV divisions helped save the industry by using otherwise-unused facilities. = Syndication, television, recession, and conglomerate Hollywood = At the beginning of the 1960s the major studios began to reissue older films for syndication and transformed into mainly producing telefilms and b-movies to supply TV's demand for programming. Between 1969 and 1971 the industry underwent a severe recession, due in part to big-budget flops, but soon recovered artistically with such films as The Godfather (1972) and Chinatown (1974). The onset of George Lucas's Star Wars (1977) became the prototype for the modern blockbuster. The release of films at hundreds of venues became the norm with hits such as the sequels to Lucas's Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Spielberg's back-to-back successes with Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and the development of home-video and cable television. Meanwhile, the uncontrolled budget of Heaven's Gate (1980), and its limited box-office revenue, led to the sale of United Artists. From 1990 to 1995, New Hollywood turned into more of a conglomerate Hollywood and quickly dominating the entire global entertainment industry. Today, three of the Golden Age majors continue to exist as major Hollywood studio entities, all of which are now owned by a larger media conglomerate: Paramount (owned by National Amusements via ViacomCBS), Warner Bros. (owned by AT&T; via WarnerMedia), and Universal (owned by Comcast via NBCUniversal). Furthermore to date, Sony Pictures (owned by Sony) was formed by the merger of Columbia and Tri-Star while the Walt Disney Studios (owned by Disney) has emerged as a major, which resulted in a \\"Big Six\\" until the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disney announced in late 2017 was completed in early 2019, becoming a \\"Big Five\\" once again. Not including Walt Disney, all of these so-called major studios are essentially based on the model not of the classic Big Five, but of the old United Artists: that is, they are primarily backer-distributors (and physical studio leasers) rather than actual production companies. Sony, in addition to the ownership of its namesake studio, also has effective control of the relatively small latter-day incarnation of MGM and its subsidiary UA; under the Sony umbrella, MGM/UA operates as a \\"mini-major,\\" nominally independent of but closely associated with Columbia and TriStar. In 1996, Time Warner acquired the once-independent New Line Cinema via its purchase of Turner Broadcasting System. In 2008, New Line was merged into Warner Bros., where it continues to exist as a subsidiary. Each of today's Big Five controls quasi-independent \\"arthouse\\" divisions, such as Paramount Vantage. Miramax Films (which originally was an independent studio) was owned by Disney until 2010. Most also have divisions that focus on genre movies, B movies either literally by virtue of their low budgets, or spiritually—for instance, Sony's Screen Gems. One so-called indie division, Universal's Focus Features, releases arthouse films under that primary brand. Both Focus and Fox's arthouse division, Fox Searchlight, are large enough to qualify as mini-majors. Two large independent firms also qualify as mini-majors, Lionsgate and The Weinstein Company. They stand somewhere between latter-day versions of the old \\"major-minor\\"—just like Columbia and Universal were in the 1930s and 1940s, except Lionsgate and The W.C. have about half their market share—and leading Golden Age independent production outfits such as Samuel Goldwyn Inc. and the companies of David O. Selznick. = Independent era and the beginning of the second decline= In the mid-2010s, major studios shifted towards producing mainstream films that appeal to the audience (genre films, sequels, 3-D, and superhero films). As these films risk losing money at the box-office (and some, in fact, have), an opportunity opened up for independent companies to produce films that in recent years have upset other major studio films for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (which produces the annual Academy Awards) generally award Best Picture Oscars to films of substance and high quality rather than the popular mainstream film. In recent years, the multiple award wins for independent films such as Spotlight (Open Road, 2015), Moonlight (A24, 2016), and Parasite, (Neon, 2019) had a major impact on box-office intake of other major studio films, and possibly the fate of major studios themselves, and even so today with the latest wave of independent films. This continuing dominance of the independent film is proof that its success is not dependent on any film format, whether it be 3-D, CinemaScope, or any large-format such as IMAX. The recent outcomes of the Cannes Film Festival and the lack of American films winning these awards may also have affected the dominance of independent film.

While the singles charts were dominated by boy bands and girl groups, British soul and Indian-based music also enjoyed their greatest level of mainstream success to date, and the rise of World music helped revitalise the popularity of folk music. Electronic rock bands like The Prodigy and Chemical Brothers began to achieve a high profile. Alternative rock reached the mainstream, emerging from the Madchester scene to produce dream pop, shoegazing, post rock and indie pop, which led to the commercial success of Britpop bands like Blur and Oasis; followed by a stream of post-Britpop bands like Travis and Feeder. Rock =Madchester= Happy Mondays in concert in 2006 The independent rock scene that had developed in Manchester in the second half of the 1980s, based in The Haçienda nightclub and around Factory Records, dubbed Madchester, came to national prominence at the end of the decade, with the Happy Mondays, the Inspiral Carpets, and Stone Roses charting late in 1989.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), pp. 1346–7. The scene became the centre of media attention for independent rock in the early 1990s, with bands like World of Twist, New Fast Automatic Daffodils, The High, Northside, Paris Angels, and Intastella also gaining national attention. The period of dominance was relatively short lived with The Stone Roses beginning to retreat from public performance while engaged in contractual disputes, the Happy Mondays having difficulty in producing a second album and Factory Records going bankrupt in 1992. Local bands catching the tail-end of Madchester, such as The Mock Turtles, became part of a wider baggy scene. The music press in the UK began to place more focus on shoegazing bands from the south of England and bands emerging through US grunge. =Dream pop and shoegazing= Dream pop had developed out of the indie rock scene of the 1980s, when bands like Cocteau Twins, The Chameleons, The Passions, Dif Juz, Lowlife and A.R. Kane began fusing post-punk and ethereal experiments with bittersweet pop melodies into sensual, sonically ambitious soundscapes.\\"Dream pop\\", All music guides, retrieved 15 July 2009. The 4AD record label is the one most associated with dream pop, though others such as Creation, Projekt, Fontana, Bedazzled, Vernon Yard, and Slumberland also released significant records in the genre. A louder, more aggressive strain of dream pop came to be known as shoegazing; key bands of this style were Lush, Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine, Alison's Halo, Chapterhouse, Curve and Levitation. These bands kept the atmospheric qualities of dream pop, but added the intensity of post-punk-influenced bands such as The Chameleons and Sonic Youth.\\"Shoegaze\\", All music guides, retrieved 15 July 2009. =Indie pop= Belle & Sebastian Initially dubbed 'C86' after the 1986 NME tape, and also known as \\"cutie\\", \\"shambling bands\\" and later as \\"twee pop\\",N. Abebe, \\"Twee as Fuck: The Story of Indie Pop\\", Pitchfork Media, 24 Oct 2005, retrieved 28 January 2010. indie pop was characterised by jangling guitars, a love of sixties pop and often fey, innocent lyrics. It was inspired by the DIY scene of punk, with a thriving fanzine, label and club and gig circuit, but tended to eschew punk's nihilism and aggression.[ \\"Indie pop\\"], All Music, retrieved 28 January 2010. Early bands included The Pastels, Talulah Gosh and Primal Scream, and among the most commercially successful were Belle and Sebastian. =Post rock= Post rock originated in the release of Talk Talk's album Laughing Stock and US band Slint's Spiderland, both in 1991, which produced experimental work influenced by sources as varied as electronica, jazz, and minimalist classical music, often abandoning the traditional song format in favour of instrumental and ambient music.\\"Post rock\\", All Music guides, retrieved 16 July 2009. The term was first used to describe the band Bark Psychosis and their album Hex (1994), but was soon employed for bands such as Stereolab, Laika, Disco Inferno and Pram and other acts in America and Canada. Scottish group Mogwai were among some of the influential post-rock groups to arise at the turn of the 21st century.S. Taylor, A to X of Alternative Music (Continuum, 2006), pp. 154–5. =Britpop= Oasis is considered to be the most commercially successful British rock act of the decade. Britpop emerged from the British indie scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands influenced by British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s. The movement developed as a reaction against various musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the grunge phenomenon from the United States. New British groups such as Suede and Blur launched the movement by positioning themselves as opposing musical forces, referencing British guitar music of the past and writing about uniquely British topics and concerns. These bands were soon joined by others including Oasis, Pulp, Supergrass and Elastica. Britpop groups brought British indie rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement called Cool Britannia.W. Osgerby, Youth Media (London: Routledge, 2004), pp. 92–6. Although its more popular bands were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement largely fell apart by the end of the decade. =Post-Britpop= By 1999, as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia, and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it.J. Harris, Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock (Da Capo Press, 2004), , pp. 369–70.S. Borthwick and R. Moy, Popular Music Genres: an Introduction (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), p. 188, . Many of these bands tended to mix elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock),[ \\"British Trad Rock\\"], All Music, retrieved 3 January 2010. particularly the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Small Faces,A. Petridis, \\"Roll over Britpop ... it's the rebirth of art rock\\", The Guardian, 14 February 2004, retrieved 2 January 2010. with American influences, including post-grunge.[ \\"You Gotta Go There to Come Back, Stereophonics\\"], All music, retrieved 3 January 2010.[ \\"Travis\\"], All music, retrieved 3 January 2010. Post-Britpop bands like The Verve, Radiohead, Travis, Stereophonics and Feeder, achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s.M. Roach, This is it-: the first biography of the Strokes (Omnibus Press, 2003), pp. 42 and 45.[ \\"Stereophonics\\"], All Music, retrieved 3 January 2010.[ \\"Coldplay\\"], All music, retrieved 3 December 2010. Pop Spice Girls one of the biggest British pop acts of the 1990s. They had a #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit with Wannabe The success of American boy band New Kids on the Block from about 1989, led to replica acts in the UK, including Nigel Martin-Smith's Take That and East 17, competing with Irish bands Westlife and Boyzone.P. Shapiro, Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2006), pp. 288–9. Soon after, girl groups began to reappear, like the R&B; act Eternal, who achieved a string of international hits from 1993.D. Sinclair, Wannabe: How the Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fame (Omnibus Press, 2004), pp. 71–2. The most successful and influential act of the genre were the Spice Girls, who added well-aimed publicity and the ideology of girl power to their pop careers. They had nine number 1 singles in the UK and US, including \\"Wannabe\\", \\"2 Become 1\\" and \\"Spice Up Your Life\\" from 1996. They were followed by British groups like All Saints, who had five number 1 hits in the UK and two multi-platinum albums. By the end of the century the grip of boy bands on the charts was faltering, but proved the basis for solo careers like that of Robbie Williams, formerly of Take That, who achieved seven Number One singles in the UK between 1998 and 2012.N. Warwick, T. Brown, J. Kutner, The complete book of the British charts: singles & albums (Omnibus Press, 3rd edn., 2004), pp. 21–4. Electronic music =House music= =UK garage= UK garage originated from England, particularly in London in the early 1990s and emerged from styles such as garage house, R&B;, jungle, and dance-pop, and usually features a distinctive 4/4 percussive rhythm with syncopated hi-hats, cymbals and snares, and sometimes includes irregular kick drum patterns. Garage tracks also commonly feature 'chopped up' and time-stretched or pitch-shifted vocal samples complementing the underlying rhythmic structure at a tempo usually around 130 BPM. UK garage gave rise to subgenres such as speed garage and 2-step, and was then largely subsumed into other styles of music and production in the mid-2000s, including grime, bassline and dubstep. The decline of UK garage during the mid-2000s saw the birth of UK funky, which is closely related. =Drum and bass= Drum and bass emerged from the London breakbeat hardcore and rave scene of the late 1980s.[ \\"Jungle/Drum'n'bass\\"], Allmusic, retrieved 9 May 2010.S. Reynolds, Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture (Abingdon: Routledge, 1999), , pp. 251–69. Originally known as jungle, it was a pop-created fusion of hardcore, house and techno which was usually instrumental, using extremely fast polyrhythms and breakbeats and incorporating elements from dancehall, electro, funk, hip hop, house, jazz, heavy metal. Pioneered by figures like Club Rage DJs Fabio and Grooverider,F. W. Hoffmann, Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound, Volume 1 (New York, NY: CRC Press, 2nd edn., 2004), , p. 334. in the mid-1990s the genre expanded from an underground and pirate radio scene to form subgenres including the intelligent drum and bass pioneered by LTJ Bukem, and the ambient jungle of Goldie's crossover debut Timeless (1995) and the jazzstep of Roni Size's Mercury Award-winning New Forms (1997). Subsequent artists included Shy FX, Ed Rush, 4 Hero and DJ Rap, some fusing drum and bass with influences from jazz, film music, ambient and trip-hop.S. Reynolds, Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture (Abingdon: Routledge, 1999), , p. 335. =Trip hop= The Chemical Brothers performing live, 2005. In the early 1990s, dance music saw more exposure at rock music festivals like Glastonbury and Reading. Raves, many illegal, continued to be organised and the tension caused by police attention, new putative legislation aimed at organisers, and the increase of harder music, led many dance music fans to return to legal night clubs, where rave music had given way to progressive house.N. South, Drugs: culture, controls, and everyday life (SAGE, 1999), p. 30. Other clubs emerged to play the ever-splintering genres associated with the house music and rave scene, including hardcore techno, downtempo and trance, drum and bass and happy hardcore.J. A. Kotarba, P. Vannini, Understanding Society Through Popular Music (London: Taylor & Francis, 2008), , p. 47. The Bristol scene saw the development of trip hop, which mixed house and hip hop producing successful bands such as Massive Attack and Portishead.D. Helmsmondhalgh and C. Melville, \\"Urban Breakbeat culture: repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom\\" in A. Mitchell, ed., Global noise: rap and hip-hop outside the USA (Wesleyan University Press, 2001), pp. 86–110. The 1990s also saw the development and refinement of IDM (Intelligent Dance Music), which borrowed from forms such as techno, drum and bass, and acid house music and introduced more abstract elements, including heavy use of digital signal processing.J. Shepher and D. Laing, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World (Continuum, 2003), p. 179. Among the most commercially successful products of these scenes were acts like The Prodigy, Chemical Brothers and Fat Boy Slim.M. Gelfand, \\"Fat Boy Slim explains electronic dance music\\", in T. Cateforis, ed., The Rock History Reader (CRC Press, 2007), , p. 309. Metal Extreme metal bands were rarely covered in mainstream media and rarely appeared on television. Part of what separated the British metal music of the 1990s was a sense of a humor and irony that was not as nearly widespread as the European and American metal groups of the era. Even among the more 'serious' British groups such as Carcass or Gorerotted have displayed a tongue-in-cheek attitude. The British extreme metal scene produced bands of worldside significance and popularity such as Cradle of Filth. Other metal oriented media that originated in the United Kingdom included magazines such as Terrorizer which have a reputation worldwide. Hip hop Stereo MCs at the Orange Music Experience Festival, Haifa, 2005 By the early 1990s the British hip hop seemed to be thriving, with flourishing scenes in London, Bristol and Nottingham. British rap became more assured of its identity, abandoning American accents and developing a more distinctive sound. However, the anticipated mainstream success was not achieved, with the British hip hop scene particularly affected by the record industry clamping down on sampling. The result was the development of the breakbeat culture, searching out obscure recordings and the creation of original music, with bands like Stereo MCs beginning to playing instruments and sampling their own tunes.P. Buckley, The rough guide to rock (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 28. Arguably this led to a creative renaissance, with British hip hop shifting from the hardcore American template and moving into more melodic territory. Soul After Soul II Soul's breakthrough R&B; hits \\"Keep on Movin'\\" and \\"Back to Life\\" in 1989, existing black soul acts, including Omar and acid jazz bands Incognito, Jamiroquai, and Brand New Heavies, were now able to pursue mainstream recording careers.G. Wald, \\"Soul's Revival: White Soul, Nostalgia and the Culturally Constructed Past\\", M. Guillory and R. C. Green, Soul: Black power, politics, and pleasure (New York University Press, 1997), pp. 139–58. Particularly noticeable was the proliferation of British female black singers including Mica Paris, Caron Wheeler, Gabrielle and Heather Small.A. Donnell, ed., Companion to contemporary Black British culture (London: Taylor & Francis, 2002), pp. 285–6. Folk resurgence Kate Rusby on stage. Traditional folk music, having been in a slow decline from mainstream popularity since the 1970s, began to enjoy a resurgence in the 1990s, benefiting from the more general interest in World music.D. Else, J. Attwooll, C. Beech, L. Clapton, O. Berry, and F. Davenport, Great Britain (London, Lonely Planet, 2007), p. 75. The arrival, and sometimes mainstream success, of acts like Kate Rusby, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Eliza Carthy, Runrig and Capercaillie, all largely concerned with acoustic performance of traditional material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of British folk music. This was reflected in the adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000 and the profile for folk music was as high as it had been for over thirty years. Post-Bhangra After the establishment of thriving south Asian music scenes in the 1980s, the 1990s saw Indian music reach the mainstream, particularly through a series of \\"post- Bhangra\\" fusions.A. Donnell, Companion to contemporary Black British culture (London: Taylor & Francis, 2002), p. 242. A mix of Bhangra and reggae beats helped make Apache Indian the first British south Asian pop star, reaching number 5 in the UK singles charts with \\"Boom Shack-A-Lak\\" in 1990 and becoming the first south Asian DJ on a major national station in 1994.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham, R. Trillo, O. Duane, and V. Dowell, World Music: The Rough Guide (London: Rough Guides, 1999), pp. 83–8. The album Migration (1994) by Nitin Sawhney fused flamenco and other genres with Bhangra. By 1997 Indian music artists such as Talvin Singh had become mainstream stars in the UK. In 1998 Cornershop, reached number 1 in the singles charts with a version of \\"Brimful of Asha\\" remixed by Fatboy Slim.  Declining American popularity and increasing divergence with US styles  By the latter half of the decade, British music was declining in popularity in the United States.The End of the British Invasion Slate May 3, 2002 Oasis and Blur were not considered phenomenons but one-hit wonders stateside. Various Electronica styles were less well received in America then at home while genres that were popular in the United States such as nu metal were not picked up by UK artists. British \\"quirkiness\\" and regional sensibilities that once were considered strengths there were now considered weakness by the increasingly oligarchic American music industry that was interested in marketing to young teens.

The canonicity of the various audio adventures has not been confirmed. While it is a question that has vexed fans, it appears that, broadly, the BBC care little about the matter, as Doctor Who has no official canon. The first season of the new television series made no explicit references to the audio adventures, partly to keep the programme accessible to a wide audience, and partly in obedience to BBC guidelines about the relationship between public broadcasting and commercially licensed material. However, by 2013, the BBC Red Button minisode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" referenced the Eighth Doctor's companions from the audio plays — namely Charley Pollard, C'rizz, Lucie Miller, Tamsin Drew and Molly O'Sullivan. Audios featuring the Doctor The first Doctor Who audio production, released on LP record in 1976, was a children's adventure entitled Doctor Who and the Pescatons by Victor Pemberton. Around this time an audio version of the televised serial Genesis of the Daleks was released on record, with specially recorded narration by Tom Baker. Both of these early releases have since been reissued on CD. The same year, Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen reprised their roles in an episode of the BBC Schools radio play Exploration Earth: The Time Machine. In 1985, during a period when the series was on a sabbatical at the BBC, BBC Radio hired Colin Baker and his TV companion Nicola Bryant to reprise their TV roles for a new production called Slipback, broadcast as part of the Radio 4 children's magazine Pirate Radio Four, which received quite a bit of press fanfare, though it did not receive good reviews. It too was later released on audio tape and CD. Doctor Who audio adventures diversified somewhat in the 1990s, when the BBC began issuing the soundtracks of 1960s-era serials on cassette and compact disc, some with added narration. These releases were usually derived from serials that were incomplete in the BBC vaults, thereby making this the only format in which fans could enjoy the entire story. BBC Radio, meanwhile, attempted to get a new series of Doctor Who stories made for radio. Although more were planned, only two were ever completed: The Paradise of Death (1993) and The Ghosts of N-Space (1996), both written by Barry Letts and featuring Jon Pertwee, (in two of his final performances as the Third Doctor), Elisabeth Sladen and Nicholas Courtney. The Paradise of Death was broadcast on Radio 5, and after that station's re-launch as a news and sport network in 1994 it seemed that there would be no home for any sequels. However, a repeat broadcast of The Paradise of Death that year on Radio 2 proved popular — despite episode four accidentally being broadcast twice in place of episode five, necessitating episode five being delayed by a week — and the station was happy to commission the sequel, The Ghosts of N-Space, for itself. In 1994, BBC Radio 4 in part of the series \\"Whatever Happened to ..?\\" broadcast a comedy drama entitled Whatever Happened to Susan Foreman? featuring Jane Asher as Susan Foreman and Andrew Sachs as Temmosus the Thal. Several of the Target novelisations have been made into audiobooks narrated by actors who have appeared in the television series. For example, Peter Davison read the novelisation of Kinda. In 1998, the Doctor Who Appreciation Society produced a collection of audio adventures entitled Cosmic Fugue 2 in aid of charity. The stories were read by Doctor Who actors Colin Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Caroline John, Wendy Padbury and Louise Jameson and the writers included Barry Letts and Gary Russell, the latter of whom went on to produce Doctor Who audio dramas for Big Finish Productions. The BBC released a collection of audio versions of short stories featured in the book Short Trips, along with an original story, all read by Sophie Aldred and Nicholas Courtney. Following this, another two collections of audio versions of stories featured in Short Trips and More Short Trips, along with an original story on each, were released - Earth and Beyond read by Paul McGann and Out of the Darkness read by Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant. Beginning in 1999, Big Finish Productions, under licence from the BBC, began a range of audio plays on compact disc, with one released every month starring one of the surviving actors to play the Doctor, namely the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with the Eighth Doctor following them in 2001. The Doctors are frequently joined in the audio plays by companions from the television series and new companions created for the audio range. Stories in the ongoing Eighth Doctor series were originally released in \\"seasons\\" of between four and six consecutive releases, but this pattern ceased after Doctor Who returned to television in 2005. In 2009, Tom Baker agreed to appear in five new audio stories for the BBC called Hornets' Nest. A second five-CD series, Demon Quest, followed in 2010, and the series Serpent Crest followed that in 2011. Also in 2011, Baker began appearing in audio plays as the Fourth Doctor for Big Finish, starting with The Fourth Doctor Boxset, a box set containing the \\"lost stories\\" submitted during Baker's time on television, \\"The Foe from the Future\\" and \\"The Valley of Death\\". CD box sets featuring the War Doctor were released between 2015 and shortly after John Hurt's death in 2017, and audio releases with the Tenth Doctor began from 2016. Big Finish have also produced a limited series, titled Doctor Who Unbound, which explores possibilities contrary to the established mythos (for instance, \\"What if the Doctor had never left Gallifrey?\\"). The format of the Unbound series allows well-known actors such as Derek Jacobi and David Warner to play alternative versions of the Doctor. Bernice Summerfield, the Doctor's companion from the Virgin New Adventures novels, also features in her own series of audio plays; the character is voiced by Lisa Bowerman. The BBC has extended Big Finish's licence to produce the audios until June 2025, and Big Finish's licence includes characters and storylines up to and including \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013). In 2005, six of the Eighth Doctor audio dramas were broadcast on the digital radio station BBC Radio 7 — these were Storm Warning, Sword of Orion, The Stones of Venice, Invaders from Mars, Shada (originally recorded for an animated webcast on the BBC's online service), and The Chimes of Midnight. A new series of original Eighth Doctor dramas aired on BBC7 starting on New Year's Eve 2006, and lasted eight weeks. They were subsequently released on CD by Big Finish. These are Blood of the Daleks, Horror of Glam Rock, Immortal Beloved, Phobos, No More Lies and Human Resources. A second series of eight Eighth Doctor audios, from Dead London to Vengeance of Morbius, were released by Big Finish in 2008 and subsequently aired on BBC Radio 7; two more series in this line were released on CD, but have not aired on BBC7. Non-Doctor audios There have been licensed audio productions featuring characters and situations created for Doctor Who, but using characters other than the Doctor. These include, from Big Finish: * Dalek Empire, Dalek Empire II: Dalek War, Dalek Empire III, Dalek Empire IV: The Fearless and Cyberman, epic space operas about the Doctor's foes written and directed by Nicholas Briggs; * Sarah Jane Smith, modern-day suspense stories starring Elisabeth Sladen as the intrepid journalist and former companion of the Doctor; * Gallifrey, with Lalla Ward, Mary Tamm, Louise Jameson and John Leeson reprising their roles as Romanas I and II, Leela and K-9, respectively; * UNIT, with a new UNIT crew, and guest-starring Nicholas Courtney as the now- retired General Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart in some audios. Non-Big Finish audio productions include: * the Kaldor City series, produced by Magic Bullet Productions, which expands on the setting and characters created for the serial The Robots of Death and also ties in with the BBC television series Blake's 7; and * the Faction Paradox series, about the rebel crime syndicate/voodoo cult introduced to the Doctor Who novel line by author Lawrence Miles. The first six Faction audios were published by BBV under the title The Faction Paradox Protocols. Subsequently, Magic Bullet took over the series, using the title The True History of Faction Paradox.

Life Like his greater contemporary, Pomponazzi, he was a lecturer on medicine at Pisa (1546–1552), and in later life gave up purely scientific study for speculation on the nature of man. His philosophic theory was identical with that of Pomponazzi, whose De immortalitate animi he defended and amplified in a treatise De mente humana. There is told of him a story which illustrates the temper of the early humanistic revival in Italy. When he was beginning his first lecture at Pisa he opened the meteorological treatises of Aristotle. The audience, composed of students and townspeople, interrupted him with the cry Quid de anima (We would hear about the soul), and Porzio was constrained to change the subject of his lecture. He professed the most open materialism, denied immortality in all forms and taught that the soul of man is homogeneous with the soul of animals and plants, material in origin and incapable of separate existence.

It occurs most often in infants and young children but also has been reported in adults. In a retrospective review of 204 children with lung tumors, pleuropulmonary blastoma and carcinoid tumor were the most common primary tumors (83% of the 204 children had secondary tumors spread from cancers elsewhere in the body). Pleuropulmonary blastoma is regarded as malignant. The male:female ratio is approximately one. Signs and symptoms Symptoms may include coughing, an upper respiratory tract infection, shortness of breath, and chest pain. These symptoms are very non-specific, and can be caused by other types of tumor in the lung or mediastinum more generally, and by other conditions. Imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI) may be used to determine the presence and precise location of a tumor, but not a specific diagnosis of PPB or other tumor. Doctors are unable to tell if a child has PPB right away, and not upper respiratory tract infection, until more test are taken and they show that there is no infection. Another symptom is pneumothorax. Genetics A number of PPBs have shown trisomy 8 (17 out of 23 cases studied per the PPB registry). Trisomy 2 and p53 mutations/deletions have also been described. An association with mutations in the DICER1 gene has been reported.Cai S, Wang X, Zhao W, Fu L, Ma X, Peng X (2017) DICER1 mutations in twelve Chinese patients with pleuropulmonary blastoma. Sci China Life Sci doi: 10.1007/s11427-017-9081-x Mutations in this gene are found in 2/3 cases. Diagnosis The most common way to test someone for PPB is to take a biopsy. Other tests like x-rays, CAT scans, and MRI's can suggest that cancer is present, but only an examination of a piece of the tumor can make a definite diagnosis. =Types= Pleuropulmonary blastoma is classified into 3 types: * Type I is multicystic * Type II shows thickening areas (nodules) within this cystic lesion * Type III shows solid masses. Type I PPB is made up of mostly cysts, and may be hard to distinguish from benign lung cysts, and there is some evidence that not all type I PPB will progress to types II and III. Types II and III are aggressive, and cerebral metastasis is more frequent in PPB than in other childhood sarcomas. Treatment Treating PPB depends on the size and location of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread, and the child's overall health. Surgery is the main treatment for PPB. The main goal of surgery is to remove the tumor. If the tumor is too large to be completely removed, or if it's not possible to completely remove the tumor, surgery may be performed after chemotherapy. Because PPB can return after treatment, regular screening for possible recurrence should continue for 48 to 60 months, after diagnosis. History Pleuropulmonary blastoma was first described in 1988. An international registry has been established. To find out more information PPB Registry has the biggest information section on Pleuropulmonary Blastoma in the world.

He went on to become a cricket commentator on radio. His father, Keith Stackpole Sr. also played first-class cricket and was a noted Australian rules footballer for Collingwood and Fitzroy. Stackpole was a big, heavy batsman in the Colin Milburn mould and quite capable of hitting the ball all over the ground. He made his Test debut against England in the Fourth Test in Adelaide in 1965–66, where he took a great catch to dismiss Jim Parks, made 43 batting at number 8 and took the wickets of the England captain M.J.K. Smith and his vice-captain Colin Cowdrey with his leg spin, his 2/33 remaining his best Test figures. Australia won by an innings to square the series. Against England in 1970–71 he was the main Australian runmaker with 627 runs (52.25). In the First Test Stackpole should have been run out for 18 as Geoff Boycott threw down the wicket at the bowler's end, but the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt by Lou Rowan. The Australian papers carried photographs the next day showing that he was clearly out and labelled the decision \\"one of the worst in cricket history\\".John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976, p98-99 It probably cost England victory as Stackpole took advantage of his escape to pile up 207 – his highest Test score – in Australia's 433. Faced with an impossible 469 runs to win in the Sixth Test Stackpole made a powerful 136 with 16 boundaries to save the game, adding 202 for the second wicket with Ian Chappell (104) as Australia made 328–3 on the last day. In the Seventh and last Test Australia needed 223 to win and save the Ashes. Stackpole hit 2 sixes and 6 fours in his 67, but received little support from the rest of the team and they were all out for 160. On the Ashes tour of England in 1972 he was Ian Chappell's vice- captain and made 485 runs (52.88), topping the Australian batting averages for the second series in a row and being named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1973.

Schizophyllan is a β-1,3 beta- glucan with β-1,6 branching. Schizophyllan is also known as sizofiran. Schizophyllan has a molecular weight of 450,000 Da, and a specific rotation in water of +18-24°. A chemically analogous polysaccharide, scleroglucan, is formed by the fungus Athelia rolfsii. Both polysaccharides share the chemical structure of the backbone with curdlan. It is known for several things, including its ability to stimulate the immune system, carry metals in water, aid in delivering drugs, and use in some nanofibers. Safety Schizophyllan, classified as a beta-glucan and extracted from the fungus Schizophyllum commune, showed no quantifiable adverse reactions through independent scientific procedures. With its classification as a beta-glucan, schizophyllan is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the United States FDA. While no distinction has been made specifically for schizophyllan, schizophyllan and other β-glucans have been orally administered safely in a variety of vertebrate species showing immunomodulation: mice, canines, horses, and humans. More specifically, in 2012, mushroom-derived beta-glucans were deemed GRAS by direct FDA review. A March 2017 further demonstrates the safety of schizophyllan in horses. Processing and efficacy The ability for schizophyllan to produce a physiological response is directly correlated with the extraction process and subsequent processing the compound endures. This theory also coincides with that of other beta-glucans. High doses of schizophyllan are not the primary determinant of an immunological response. Studies have validated that 10 mg (or less) of a high quality, adequately processed chemically similar beta-glucan is a sufficient dose to elicit a measurable effect on immune cells. In addition, small particle beta-glucans modified to prevent re-aggregation during digestion have the most positive effects on immune potentiation. Ninety percent of horses with active ulceration treated with ta schizophyllan-containing polysaccharide blend showed complete resolution and/or improvement in ulcerative areas, increased appetite, weight gain, and positive behavioral changes.

A spherometer is an instrument for the precise measurement of the radius of curvature of a sphere or a curved surface. Originally, these instruments were primarily used by opticians to measure the curvature of the surface of a lens. Background The usual form consists of a fine screw moving in a nut carried on the center of a 3 small legged table or frame; the feet forming the vertices of a triangle. The lower end of the screw and those of the table legs are finely tapered and terminate in hemispheres, so that each rests on a point. If the screw has two turns of the thread to the milli metre the head is usually divided into 50 equal parts, so that differences of 0.01 millimeter may be measured without using a vernier. A lens, however, may be fitted, in order to magnify the scale divisions. A vertical scale fastened to the table indicates the number of whole turns of the screw and serves as an index for reading the divisions on the head. A contact-lever, delicate level or electric contact arrangement may be attached to the spherometer in order to indicate the moment of touching more precisely than is possible by the sense of touch. To measure the radius of a sphere—e.g. the curvature of a lens—the spherometer is leveled and read, then placed on the sphere, adjusted until the four points exert equal pressure, and read again. The difference gives the thickness of that portion of the sphere cut off by a plane passing through the three feet. Principles of operation The spherometer directly measure a sagittal, h. Using the mean length between two outer legs, a, the spherical radius R is given by the formula: :::R = (h/2) + (a^2/6h) Using different spherometer without legs and with circle cup and dial gauge, D is the diameter of circle cup, the spherical radius R is given by the formula: :::R = (h/2) + (D^2/8h) ::: Number of divisions on the circular scale = 100 . :Distance moved by the screw in 10 complete reactions = 10mm . :PITCH = Distance moved / Number of complete rotations . :LEAST COUNT = Pitch / Number of divisions on head scale . :=1/100=0.01 mm. A spherometer basically is a precision instrument to measure very small lengths. Its name reflects the way it is used to measure the radii of curvature of spherical surfaces. It is based on the principle of screw. In general the spherometer consists of: *A base circle of three outer legs, a ring, or the equivalent, having a known radius of the base circle. (The outer legs of some spherometers can be moved to a set of inner holes in order to accommodate a smaller surface.) *A central leg, which can be raised or lowered. *A reading device for measuring the distance the central leg is moved. On the new spherometer, the vertical scale is marked off in units of 0.5 mm. One complete turn of the dial also corresponds to 0.5 mm and each small graduation on this dial represents 0.005 mm. The small graduations on the old spherometer are 0.001 mm. Alternative uses Since the spherometer is essentially a type of micrometer, it can be employed for purposes other than measuring the curvature of a spherical surface. For example, it can be used to measure the thickness of a thin plate. To do so, the instrument is placed on a perfectly level plane surface and the screw turned until the point just touches; the exact instant when it does so is defined by a sudden diminution of resistance succeeded by a considerable increase. The divided head and scale are read; the screw is raised; the thin plate slipped under it; and the process is repeated. The difference between the two readings gives the required thickness. Similarly, the instrument can measure the depression in an otherwise flat plate. The method would be as for measuring the thickness of a plate, except that the micrometer portion is placed over the depression and the measurement is taken below the surface instead of above. This type of instrument is commonly used in inspections of oil field tool pipe for metal surface pits, fractures, and roundness before being shipped to drilling sites for exploratory wells. The process of inspections are designed to remove weakened drill pipe, so that pipe will not fracture during drilling. Tool pipe with thicker than 1\\" walls for a 4\\" diameter tube of hardened steel, fitted with tapered thread collars are re- used after drilling is complete, and thinner-walled tubular oil-well casing is in place. Electronic instrumentation similar to the spherometer in design are modified at inspection plants for casing, tubing, and drill pipe. The equivalent measurements in optics would be for a cylinder, or lens with a cylindrical component having an optical axis, where a plane through the lens would produce an oval circumference. An alternate approach using coordinate geometry was developed recently. This approach reproduces the well-known result for the spherometer and also leads to a scheme to study aspherical surfaces. A related device is the Cylindrometer (also known as Cylindro- Spherometer and Sphero-Cylindrometer), which can additionally measure the radius of curvature of a right-circular cylinder See also *Lapidary *Lens clock *Lens (optics) *Lensometer References External links *Sameen Ahmed Khan, Cylindro-Spherometer Bulletin of the IAPT, 26(1), 4-6 (January 2009) (Publication of the Indian Association of Physics Teachers). *Sameen Ahmed Khan, Cylindrometer, The Physics Teacher, Volume 48, Issue 9, pp. 607 (December 2010) (Publication of the American Association of Physics Teacher). *Sameen Ahmed Khan,Coordinate Geometric Approach to Spherometer, Bulletin of the IAPT, Volume 5, No. 6, 139-142 (June 2013).

Porfirius has been identified with Publilius Optatianus Porphyrius, who was praefectus urbi in 329 and 333. For some reason he had been banished, but having addressed a panegyric to the Emperor Constantine I, he was allowed to return.  Works  Twenty-eight poems are extant under his name, of which twenty were included in the panegyric. The content of the poetry is rather trivial. However, the form of the works can be regarded as a specimens of perverted ingenuity. Some of them are squares (the number of letters in each line being equal), certain letters being rubricated so as to form a pattern or figure, and at the same time special verses or maxims. Others represent various objects (a syrinx, an organ, an altar). Others have special peculiarities in each line (number of words or letters) while the eighth poem (the versus anacyclici) may be read backwards without any effect upon sense or metre. A complimentary letter from the emperor and letter of thanks from the author are also extant. The manuscript tradition attributes to Optatianus an extensive, but uneven, body of work, which includes poems written at various times and using different techniques. Despite the presence of poems composed well before his fall from grace, the central core of the work is still made up of the panegyric sent to Constantine in the hope of obtaining forgiveness. The central theme of the Panegyricus is the emperor, but with infrequent references to contemporary historical facts. The main feature of the poems, however, lies not so much in their content, as in the technique with which they are made. Optatianus was the first author known to write versus intexti (literally \\"twisted verses\\"), a special form of picture poem. The picture poem is that in which the lines are arranged so as to form a precise stylized drawing (an altar, a bagpipe ...). This compositional technique, used by influential poets such as Theocritus, had come to Rome between the second and first centuries BC, with the Erotopaegnia of Laevius. Optatianus's novel use of this technique involved constructing an acrostic, so that within the composition, by a specified path, arises a second or third text relating to the first. The composition of such a poem was done in phases: *the sheet (and not the roll of papyrus ) was first divided into squares; *inside the squares were inserted letters of the verses that followed different paths; *completing the previous verses, the rest of the page was filled by placing letters in the boxes that, together with those already present, formed sensible verses. The technique used by Optatianus reveals his predilection for difficulties and technical virtuosity, as the compositions of the Panegyrics become even more complicated, for example, with the construction of verses in the form of palindromes (as in the poem XXVIII) or verses metrically identical when read from right to left. Optatianus was inspired by Lucan and Silius Italicus, but especially by Ovid, who is the main touchstone for the author, especially because of their mutual experience of exile. Purely by way of example you can consider the poem VIII of the collection. In this poem the versus intexti form the monogram of Christ and the name \\"Iesus\\". { width=\\"90%\\" border=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" center; font-size:90%; font- family:monospace;\\"  width=\\"21\\"   width=\\"5\\"   width=\\"10\\" bgcolor=\\"#FFFF00\\"  A  width=\\"10\\"  C  width=\\"10\\"  C  width=\\"10\\"  I  width=\\"10\\"  P  width=\\"10\\"  E  width=\\"10\\"  P  width=\\"10\\"  I  width=\\"10\\"  C  width=\\"10\\"  T  width=\\"10\\"  A  width=\\"10\\" bgcolor=\\"#FFFF00\\"  N  width=\\"10\\"  O  width=\\"10\\"  V  width=\\"10\\"  I  width=\\"10\\"  S  width=\\"10\\"  E  width=\\"10\\"  L  width=\\"10\\"  E  width=\\"10\\"  G  width=\\"10\\"  I  width=\\"10\\" bgcolor=\\"#FFFF00\\"  S  width=\\"10\\" bgcolor=\\"#FFFF00\\"  L  width=\\"10\\" bgcolor=\\"#FFFF00\\"  V  width=\\"10\\"  X  width=\\"10\\"  A  width=\\"10\\"  V  width=\\"10\\"  R  width=\\"10\\"  E  width=\\"10\\"  A  width=\\"10\\"  M  width=\\"10\\"  V  width=\\"10\\"  N  width=\\"10\\"  D  width=\\"10\\" bgcolor=\\"#FFFF00\\"  I -

Since her debut in 1983, Hamada has been known as the \\"Heavy Metal Queen\\" of Japan. Throughout her career, she has released 25 singles and 23 studio albums.  Biography  = Early history = Mari Hamada started singing when she joined a choir at elementary school and participated in recording TV commercial jingles while in junior high. While at Musashigaoka High School, she formed a punk rock band called \\"Mari Band\\". During her tenure at Aoyama Gakuin University, Hamada was a backing vocalist for the band \\"Hamachan\\" and the lead vocalist of the all-female rock band \\"Misty Cats\\"; the latter having recorded the demo song \\"Misty Blue\\" for the various artists album Kichijōji Yamaha Studio Take-1 Presents: 7th One Way Contest in 1982. = 1980s = In 1983, Hamada released her debut album Lunatic Doll ~ Ansatsu Keikoku, which was produced by Daiko Nagato and Loudness drummer Munetaka Higuchi and released by Victor Entertainment under the \\"Invitation\\" label. She gained some attention when Shigesato Itoi wrote: . The album made her the flag bearer for Japanese female rock vocalists, which was a small and unusual market at the time. A year later, Hamada released the album Misty Lady, which began her career as a songwriter. In 1985, Hamada released Blue Revolution, with the title track becoming her first career single. It was also her first self-produced album. For her 1987 album In the Precious Age, Hamada flew to Los Angeles to work with producer Mike Clink and record with artists such as Toto's Mike Porcaro and Jeff Porcaro. From that point on, she changed her musical style to a more mainstream pop rock sound. In 1988, Hamada released the song \\"Heart and Soul\\", which was used by NHK on their coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. The song peaked at No. 7 on Oricon's singles chart. Hamada was invited to perform on the 39th Kōhaku Uta Gassen, but she declined the offer. In 1989, Hamada's ninth album Return to Myself topped Oricon's albums chart and went Platinum. In addition, the title track \\"Return to Myself ~Shinai, Shinai, Natsu.\\" hit No. 1 on Oricon's singles chart.Note: Readers unfamiliar with Japan should note that Oricon is essentially the Japanese equivalent of the Billboard charts seen in the United States. Oricon is an English word, a compound of \\"original confidence\\" and they rank sales of much more than records and albums, they provide charts for sales of films on DVD, computer games, books, magazines, television programs and commercials, and even lists for computers and consumer electronics. = 1990s = Hamada's 1990 album Colors reached No. 2 and was certified Gold. A year later, she switched labels to MCA Victor, with Tomorrow also peaking at No. 2, but going Platinum. Hamada's 10th anniversary album Anti-Heroine topped the albums chart in 1993. That year, she participated in the charity group \\"Used to Be a Child\\", concept similar to Band Aid where performers donate earnings from a single to charitable causes; in this case the money went to Imabari City's Islet Organization. Hamada also went global with the international release Introducing... Mari Hamada, which consists of original English-language songs and some of her hits reworked in English. The album was released in Asia on May 30, 1993. She made her European debut in 1994 with a re-arranged version of the album and participated at that year's Midem in France. Hamada also released the follow-up album All My Heart in Asian markets that year. The album features \\"Fixing a Broken Heart\\", a duet with Australian band Indecent Obsession. In 1996, Hamada's album Persona hit No. 2 on Oricon's albums chart. During this time, she put her touring activities on hold to focus on songwriting and recording. Two years later, Universal Music Japan transferred her to the Polydor label. Her two albums under the label, Philosophia and Blanche, failed to crack the top-10. = 2000s = In 2002, Hamada signed with Tokuma Japan Communications and released Marigold. She also resumed live touring that year when she performed at the Akasaka Blitz just before it was completely demolished and rebuilt. Since then, Hamada would release a new album and tour every two years. Her album sales, however, were not of the same level as the decade before, with each album barely hovering within the top-100. = 2010s = In 2010, Hamada returned to her heavy metal roots with Aestetica, which received heavy airplay. The album sparked a resurgence in her career, reaching No. 35 on Oricon's albums chart. Her live video Mari Hamada Live in Tokyo \\"Aestetica\\", which was filmed at the Nakano Sun Plaza, peaked at No. 2 on Oricon's DVD chart. Hamada followed up the success with her 2012 album Legenda. Hamada kicked off her 30th anniversary celebration in 2013 with the compilation album Inclination III and an extensive national tour. In 2014, she released the boxed set Mari Hamada Complete Single Collection. At the same time, her former and current labels reissued her past albums in Super High Material CD (SHM-CD) format. In April, Hamada performed an extended concert in Tokyo, which was filmed for WOWOW. The concert was aired on Japanese television on July 20, 2014, including two interviews with Mari, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray in January 2015. On August 16, Hamada performed live at the Summer Sonic Festival, an annual two-day rock festival held at two venues simultaneously with bands switching venues for the second day. On August 31, September 3 and 7, 2014, she performed concerts with a symphony orchestra titled \\"Rock Queen Orchestra\\". On October 11, 2015, Hamada performed live at the Loud Park Festival, with Loudness guitarist Akira Takasaki as a special guest. On January 13, 2016, Hamada released the album Mission, which peaked at No. 11 on Oricon's albums chart. The last show of the Mission tour was filmed and released on DVD and Blu-ray as Mari Hamada Live Tour 2016 \\"Mission\\" on February 22, 2017. To celebrate her 35th anniversary, Hamada returned to Victor Entertainment in April 2018. She released Gracia on August 1; the album went all the way to No. 6 on Oricon's albums chart, becoming her first top-10 album since Persona. A year later, she released the compilation album Light for the Ages -35th Anniversary Best～Fan's Selection-. She also performed at the Nippon Budokan for the first time in 25 years on April 19. The concert was released on DVD and Blu-ray as Mari Hamada 35th Anniversary Live \\"Gracia\\" at Budokan on December 18. = 2020s = In 2020, Hamada became the first Japanese vocalist to win the reader's popularity vote on Burrn! magazine's 36th Heavy Metal Championship for 2019. She is scheduled to perform at Knotfest Japan 2020, which has been rescheduled to January 10–11, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Personal life  Hamada's younger sister tours with her band as a backing vocalist. In a 2014 interview with Japanese media website Natalie, Hamada stated that she does not do Twitter or blogs because she is not good at using social media. She did, however, open her official Twitter account in February 2017. She also does not follow other artists and prefers to listen to anything different from her genre, such as Celtic music or world music.

It was founded in the 17th century after the Hollandsche Compagnie (Company from Holland) bought the land to harvest its peat. It was initially named Hollandsche Veld (Field of the Hollandsche Compagnie) which was later combined into just Hollandscheveld. In 2004, 3287 inhabitants lived in the village and 969 lived in the rural area around it. During the Second World War, three notorious war criminals lived in Hollandscheveld: Auke Pattist, Dirk Hoogendam and Martinus Johannes van Oort. These men tortured arrested resistance warriors and Jews in a local school. Dirk Hoogendam was sentenced to death after the war, but managed to escape to Germany where he died in 2003. Known resistance heroes Marinus and Johannes Post were born in Hollandscheveld. They were both executed by the Germans in 1944. Hollandscheveld became the focus of national attention in 1963 during the Boerenopstand (Farmer's uprising). Thousands of so-called Free Farmers descended on Hollandscheveld when three families were removed from their farms after refusing to pay a levy to the Landbouwschap. After several days of fighting between farmers and armed police, one of the homesteads was burned to the ground. The leader of the uprising was Hendrik Koekoek who was nicknamed Boer Koekoek (Farmer Koekoek).

On the lower Snake River in southeastern Washington, it bridges Whitman and Garfield counties. Opened in 1975, the dam is located south of Colfax and north of Pomeroy. Lower Granite Dam is part of the Columbia River Basin system of dams, built and operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers; power generated is distributed by the Bonneville Power Administration. Behind the dam, Lower Granite Lake extends east to Lewiston, Idaho, and allowed the city to become a port. The first barge to Portland on the navigation route was loaded with wheat and departed Lewiston on August 9, 1975. Lake Bryan, formed from Little Goose Dam, runs downstream from the base of the dam. Construction Construction began in July 1965, but was halted less than two years later due to lack of funding. Work restarted in 1970, concrete was first poured in 1971, and the main structure and three generators were completed in 1975, with dedication ceremonies on June 19. An additional three generators were finished in May bringing the generating capacity to 810 megawatts, with an overload capacity of 932 MW. The spillway has eight gates and is in length. An navigation lock was also included in construction. Just downstream of the dam, Boyer Park was constructed by the Corps of Engineers and opened in April 1973. Fishery Lower Granite Dam is the most upstream dam in the Snake River system that has a fish ladder to allow adult salmon and steelhead to migrate upstream. The Columbia River treaty tribes, along with some environmental groups, have recommended that this dam along with the other three lower Snake River dams be decommissioned and/or removed because of their impact on threatened and endangered chinook (threatened) and sockeye salmon (endangered) and steelhead (threatened) populations., The Corps of Engineers recognized in 1971 that the dam would have a detrimental impact on wildlife. A significant increase in the Sockeye Salmon return to the Columbia River in 2008 proved a pleasant surprise and raised hopes for increased salmon runs across the Lower Granite. Wildlife officials were not certain of the reason for the increased salmon return (Idaho Statesman, June 28, 2008). The Corps of Engineers has installed new devices, such as removable spillway weirs, in an attempt to make the dam less harmful to juvenile salmon. There is also a juvenile bypass/collection facility that collects juvenile migrating salmon and steelhead so they can be transported downstream by barge. ; Navigation lock: * Single-lift * Width: * Length: Lower Granite Dam with the lock in the center, the power generation on the south side of the river, and spillway in the middle of the dam, between the powerhouse and the lock. Asotin Dam Authorized by Congress in 1962, a fifth dam on the lower Snake River was proposed several miles upstream (south) of Lewiston. Concerns over its environmental and recreational impact stalled the Asotin Dam project, and it was ultimately canceled in 1980. The Asotin County public utilities district attempted to revive the project in 1988, but it was quickly blocked by Congress, and a law banning future dams was signed into law by President Reagan on November 17. Other proposed dams further upstream were not built either: the High Mountain Sheep Dam above the confluence with the Salmon River, and the Nez Perce Dam, just below it. Road closed Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the road across the Lower Granite Dam was closed for over six years; it reopened for weekend traffic in May 2008. The sand dune area downstream on the south shore (), accessed over the dam, was popular with local college students from Washington State University and the University of Idaho.

Vocabulary Some of the vocabulary used in Western Australia is unique, within both Australia and the wider world.Maureen Brooks and Joan Ritchie, Words from the West: A Glossary of Western Australian Terms. Oxford University Press (1994). Rhonda Oliver, Graham McKay and Judith Rochecouste, \\"Lexical Variation among Western Australian Primary School Children\\", Australian Journal of Linguistics, vol. 22, no. 2 (1 October 2002) pp. 207 - 229. Several terms of British origin have survived which are rarely used in other parts of Australia. One example is verge, meaning the area between a road and a paved footpath, which is known by the term nature strip in the rest of Australia. Another is brook, for a small stream. Some words have been shortened, for example, the term bathers is commonly used in place of bathing suit or togs as used in other parts of Australia. Some original terms have also been invented in WA, and have since found their way into common usage. An example of this is the term home open, describing a house on the market which is open for public inspection. Altogether, about 750 words are estimated to be used differently in WA than they are in the eastern states. There are also many unique, invented slang words, such as ding, referring to an Australian immigrant of Italian descent (this word is often considered derogatory and/or offensive). Cursive may also often be called running writing in Western Australian primary schools.. A glass of beer is referred to as a middy only in WA and New South Wales. Many words from Indigenous Australian languages have found their way into Western Australian English. Examples include gidgee (or gidgie), a Noongar word for spear, as used in modern spear fishing; and gilgie (or jilgie), the Noongar name for a small freshwater crayfish of the South West. Crayfish often found in the Perth Hills area may be called yabbies. Another word of likely Aboriginal origin is boondy (pronounced with ʊ, like the vowel in bull), which means a rock, boulder, or small stone. Among Western Australians, the term sand-boondy or more commonly boondy is well-recognised as referring to a small lump of sand (with the granules stuck together), often thrown at one another by children in playgrounds or building sites. Other Aboriginal words that have been included more widely into relatively common regional Western Australian parlance include \\"wongi\\" (talk) and \\"milli-milli\\" (paper). Phonology Most Western Australians speak with either a general Australian accent or a broad Australian accent. Those who grew up in suburban Perth typically speak with a general Australian accent, and those from regional areas (\\"from the country\\") speak with a broad accent. =Centring diphthongs= Centring diphthongs are the vowels that occur in words like ear, beard, air and sheer. In Western Australia, there is a tendency for centering diphthongs to be pronounced as full diphthongs. Those in the eastern states will tend to pronounce \\"fear\\" and \\"beer\\" without any jaw movement, while Western Australians tend pronounce them more like \\"fe-ah\\" and \\"be-ah\\", respectively. =L-vocalisation= As also found in South Australian English, the tendency for some sounds to become vowels (/l/ vocalisation) is more common than other states. \\"Hurled\\", for example, in Western Australia has a vocalised , leading to the pronunciation , whereas in other states the is pronounced as a consonant . The is vocalised; for example, \\"milk\\" sounds like \\"miuwk\\" and \\"hill\\" sounds like \\"hiw\\" , which can also be similar in dialect with South African English but in a different vocabulary compared to New Zealand English. =Pronunciation of individual words= Some pronunciations also differ from those used in the rest of Australia.

He was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland by King Henry VII of England in 1492. Rowland FitzEustace, 1st Baron Portlester was Lord Chancellor and Lord Treasurer of Ireland before Plunket. The offices were split between Alexander Plunket and Sir James Ormond, who became Lord Treasurer of Ireland. Ireland was in great conflict at this time, as Henry VII tried to get the Irish to pledge loyalty to him, instead of their own Kings and Princes. O'FlanaganO'Flanagan, J. Roderick Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland 2 Volumes London 1870 states that it is impossible to form any opinion on his career as Lord Chancellor, since no record of any of his judgments exist. Biography He was born at Rathmore in County Meath, son of Sir Thomas Fitz-Christopher Plunket, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland and his second wife Marion Cruce (or Cruise); he was a first cousin of another Sir Thomas Plunket who became Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas,Ball, F Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 both being grandsons of Christopher Plunket, 1st Baron Killeen. He married firstly Anne Marward, daughter of the titular Baron Skryne; secondly Margaret Butler, sister of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormonde, and thirdly a close relative (possibly a daughter) of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare.Lodge, John and Archdall, Mervyn Peerage of Ireland Dublin 1789 Vol. 6 pp.187-8 He had children by all three marriages, nine sons and two daughters in all. Through his second and third marriages he was connected to the families of both the Earl of Kildare and the Earl of Ormonde; his political loyalties at first were with the Kildare faction, but he later quarreled with Kildare. He was a companion of the Brotherhood of Saint George, a short-lived military guild charged with the defence of the Pale. He served as High Sheriff of Meath in 1482. So long as the House of York held power he appears to have been a loyal enough Yorkist; he was at Court in 1479, and in 1484 received a letter from Richard III thanking him for his services. After the downfall of the Yorkist dynasty, and its replacement by the Tudor dynasty, the new King Henry VII trusted him enough to make him Lord Chancellor; this was apparently an effort to curb the power of the Kildare faction, with whom Plunket had quarreled.Ball Judges in Ireland He left office in 1494 and died in 1503. His estates passed to his eldest son Sir Christopher Plunket, and on Christopher's death without issue to the next surviving son Edward.Lodge and Archdall p.189  References  Category:Lord Chancellors of Ireland Category:15th-century Irish politicians Category:1503 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Alexander Plunket"},{"id":"2551704","text":"Abbey Road in London Street sign in Munich, Germany A bilingual sign in Macau with street name in both Chinese and Portuguese Illuminated street signs in Windhoek at \\"President´s Corner\\" A street or road name or odonym is an identifying name given to a street. The street name usually forms part of the address (though addresses in some parts of the world, notably most of Japan, make no reference to street names). Buildings are often given numbers along the street to further help identify them. Names are often given in a two-part form: an individual name known as the specific, and an indicator of the type of street, known as the generic. Examples are \\"Main Road\\", \\"Fleet Street\\" and \\"Park Avenue\\". The type of street stated, however, can sometimes be misleading: a street named \\"Park Avenue\\" need not have the characteristics of an avenue in the generic sense. Some street names have only one element, such as \\"The Mall\\" or \\"The Beeches\\". A street name can also include a direction (the cardinal points east, west, north, south, or the quadrants NW, NE, SW, SE) especially in cities with a grid-numbering system. Examples include \\"E Roosevelt Boulevard\\" and \\"14th Street NW\\". These directions are often (though not always) used to differentiate two sections of a street. Other qualifiers may be used for that purpose as well. Examples: upper/lower, old/new, or adding \\"extension\\". \\"Main Street\\" and \\"High Street\\" are common names for the major street in the middle of a shopping area in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. The most common street name in the US is \\"2nd\\" or \\"Second\\". Etymologies Streets are normally named, and properties on them numbered, by decision of the local authority, which may adopt a detailed policy. For instance the city of Leeds, UK, provides that:https://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Street%20naming%20and%20numbering%20policy.pdf * property developers should consult with councillors, historic groups etc. Names should relate to the history of the area or reflect the local landscape and population; * no living person's names can be used, and the consent of the family is required to use those of the recently deceased; * no initial 'the', numbers, punctuation or abbreviations are allowed, except St for Saint; * no name my be changed without the consent of all affected property owners; * properties shall be numbered from the start of a street, wit odd numbers on the left and even numbers on the right; * individual doors must have their own numbers; for sub-divisions with a shared entrance, flats should always be numbered or lettered but should not be described or suffixed (i.e. Flat 1, 36; or Flat A, 36 but not 36A or First Floor Flat, 36). Flat numbers should start at the main entrance of each floor and go clockwise; * 'alias names' can be approved along with the number, but these must not be business names; * the Royal Mail will only register properties which have their own secure letter box. The etymology of a street name is sometimes very obvious, but at other times it might be obscure or even forgotten. In the United States, most streets are named after numbers, landscapes, trees (a combination of trees and landscapes such as \\"Oakhill\\" is used often in residential areas), or the surname of an important individual (in some instances, it is just a commonly held surname such as Smith). Some streets, such as Elm Street in East Machias, Maine, have been renamed due to features changing. Elm Street's new name, Jacksonville Road, was chosen because it leads to the village of Jacksonville. Its former name was chosen because of elm trees; it was renamed when all of the trees along the street succumbed to Dutch elm disease. The Shambles, derived from the Anglo-Saxon term fleshammels (\\"meat shelves\\" in butchers' stalls), is a historical street name which still exists in various cities and towns around England. The best-known example is in York.\\"The Shambles\\" at Britain Express. Accessed 27 August 2005. The unusual etymologies of quite a few street names in the United Kingdom are documented in Rude Britain, complete with photographs of local signage. =Type of commerce or industry= Smith Street/La Rue des Forges refers to the blacksmiths' forges that were formerly situated in this street in Guernsey In the past, many streets were named for the type of commerce or industry found there. This rarely happens in modern times, but many such older names are still common. Examples are London's Haymarket; Barcelona's Carrer de Moles (Millstone Street), where the stonecutters used to have their shops; and Cannery Row in Monterey, California. =Landmarks= Some streets are named for landmarks that were in the street, or nearby, when it was built. Such names are often retained after the landmark disappears. Barcelona's La Rambla is officially a series of streets. The Rambla de Canaletes is named after a fountain that still stands, but the Rambla dels Estudis is named after the Estudis Generals, a university building demolished in 1843, and the Rambla de Sant Josep, the Rambla dels Caputxins, and the Rambla de Santa Monica are each named after former convents. Only the convent of Santa Monica survives as a building, and it has been converted to a museum. Orchard Road, Singapore, was named for the orchards that formerly lined the road Sometimes a street is named after a landmark that was destroyed to build that very street. For example, New York's Canal Street takes its name from a canal that was filled in to build it. New Orleans' Canal Street was named for the canal that was to be built in its right-of-way. =Self-descriptive names= While names such as Long Road or Nine Mile Ride have an obvious meaning, some road names' etymologies are less clear. The various Stone Streets, for example, were named at a time when the art of building paved (stone) Roman roads had been lost. The main road through Old Windsor, UK, is called \\"Straight Road\\", and it is straight where it carries that name. Many streets with regular nouns rather than proper nouns, are somehow related to that noun. For example, Station Street or Station Road, do connect to a railway station, and many \\"Railway Streets\\" or similar do end at, cross or parallel a railway. =Destination= Many roads are given the name of the place to which they lead. However, there are also many examples of streets named after a city that is many miles away and has no obvious link to the street. When the roads do still make it to their stated destination, the names are often changed when they get closer to the destination. Hartford Avenue in Wethersfield, Connecticut, becomes Wethersfield Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut, for example. A road can switch names multiple times as local opinion changes regarding its destination: for example, the road between Oxford and Banbury changes name five times from the Banbury Road to the Oxford Road and back again as it passes through villages. Some streets are named after the areas that the street connects. For example, Clarcona Ocoee Road links the communities of Clarcona and Ocoee in Orlando, Florida, and Jindivick–Neerim South Road links the towns of Jindivick and Neerim South in Victoria, Australia. Some roads are named after their general direction, such as \\"Great North Road\\". Bypasses are often named after the town they route traffic around, for example the Newbury bypass. =Distinguished or famous individuals= This street in Rome commemorates the physicist Enrico Fermi Some streets are named after famous or distinguished individuals, sometimes people directly associated with the street, usually after their deaths. Bucharest's Şoseaua Kiseleff was named after the Russian reformer Pavel Kiselyov who had the road built while Russian troops were occupying the city in the 1830s; its Strada Dr. Iuliu Barasch is named after a locally famous physician whose clinic was located there. Naming a street after oneself as a bid for immortality has a long pedigree: Jermyn Street in London was named by Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, who developed the St. James's area for Charles II of England. Perhaps to dissuade such posterity-seeking, many jurisdictions only allow naming for persons after their death, occasionally with a waiting period of ten years or more. A dozen streets in San Francisco, California's North Beach neighborhood were renamed in 1988 after local writers; in 1994, the city broke with tradition, honoring Lawrence Ferlinghetti by renaming an alley after the poet within his own lifetime.Adair Lara, Literary light: City Lights Bookstore, at 50, is showing few signs of aging, San Francisco Chronicle, June 5, 2003. Accessed on line December 22, 2006. Naming a street for a person is very common in many countries, often in the honorand's birthplace. However, it is also the most controversial type of naming, especially in cases of renaming. Two main reasons streets are renamed are: (1) to commemorate a person who lived or worked in that area (for example, Avenue Victor Hugo in Paris, where he resided); or (2) to associate a prominent street in a city after an admired major historical figure even with no specific connection to the locale (for example, René Lévesque Boulevard in Montreal, formerly Dorchester Boulevard). Similarly, hundreds of roads in the United States were named with variations of Martin Luther King Jr., in the years after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Conversely, renaming can be a way to eliminate a name that proves too controversial. For example, Hamburg Avenue in Brooklyn, New York became Wilson Avenue after the United States entered World War I against Germany (see below). In Riverside, California, a short, one-way street named Wong Way was renamed to a more respectful Wong Street, as well as spelled out in Chinese characters to honor the historical Chinatown that once occupied the area.Los Angeles Times, / Right Street, Wrong Way, The Los Angeles Times, June 12, 2009. Accessed on line September 9, 2019. In a case of a street named after a living person becoming controversial, Lech Walesa Street in San Francisco was renamed to Dr. Tom Waddell Place in 2014 after Walesa made a public remark against gay people holding major public office.Bay City News Service, San Francisco renames Lech Walesa Street in wake of Polish leader’s anti-gay remarks, The Mercury News, July 30, 2014. Accessed on line May 27, 2017. =Themes= Groups of streets in one area are sometimes named using a particular theme. One example is Philadelphia, where the major east-west streets in William Penn's original plan for the city carry the names of trees: from north to south, these were Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, High (not a tree), Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard and Cedar. (Sassafras, Mulberry, High and Cedar have since been renamed to Race, Arch, Market [the main east-west street downtown] and South.) Other examples of themed streets: *In Washington, D.C., each of the 50 U.S. states has a street named after it (such as Pennsylvania Avenue, which runs from the Capitol to the White House). Most of the \\"state avenues\\" cross diagonally through the alphabetic and numbered streets in Washington's grid (see grid systems below). *In an area of northwest Portland, Oregon, streets are in alphabetical order and are named after important local businessmen and pioneers. The names date back to 1892 when they replaced an alphabetical lettering system.http://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/58828accessdate=June 4, 2013 A portion of the area, known as the Alphabet Historic District, is zoned for historic preservation and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. *In the area of Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires, Argentina, streets are named after important women. *Themed street names are very common in Guadalajara, Mexico with names including: ** Constellations and astronomers in La Calma and Arboledas. ** Rivers and mountain ranges in Las Águilas (Sierra de Pihuamo, Río Verde...) ** Aztec places, people and gods in Ciudad del Sol (Axayácatl, Cuauhtémoc, Popocatépetl, Anáhuac...) ** World cities in Providencia. ** Hispanic writers and intellectuals in Ladrón de Guevara and nearby areas. ** Flowers in downhill Bugambilias, animals uphill. ** Classical artists in La Estancia (Hector Berlioz, Rafael Sanzio, Johann Sebastian Bach...) ** International writers in Jardines Vallarta. ** Mexican isles near El Sauz. ** Countries in Colonia Moderna (Francia, España, Alemania...) *Tucson, Arizona has streets and avenues, but roads that run diagonally are called \\"Stravenues\\". *Denver, Colorado's north-south streets alternate names in alphabetical order throughout the entire city; for example Albion-Ash- Bellaire-Birch-Clermont-Cherry-Dexter-Dahlia going west-east on the city's east side. (In this double alphabet grouping, the first alphabet is Scottish- themed and the second alphabet is botanically-themed.) Alternately, going east-west has the same effect; for example Acoma-Bannock-Cherokee-Delaware- Elati-Fox etc. (Exceptions do exist.) Other themes exist in the city, such as university names (Yale and Dartmouth Avenues) and presidential names (Garfield and Washington Streets). These two common themes are found in many other cities as well, such as Hemet, California, and Torrance, California, respectively. * Redondo Beach, California, has a series of approximately alphabetical gemstone names (Beryl, Carnelian, Diamond, etc.) for streets crossing Pacific Coast Highway. *Two Florida cities have streets named after American presidents: Hollywood, and Cape Canaveral. Bourbon Street in New Orleans *In New Orleans, Louisiana, some streets of the historic French Quarter are named for royal houses of France. Many who visit this neighborhood mistake Bourbon Street to be named after the beverage that many of the street's famous revelers are drinking, while it is actually named after the House of Bourbon, the ruling dynasty of France when the city was built. Similarly, Burgundy Street was named for the House of Burgundy and not the wine. Other streets named for royalties include Dumaine, Toulouse, Conti, Dauphine and Chartres. *The Toxteth area of Liverpool has 'Welsh Streets', a series of streets named after Welsh places, including Rhiwlas St, Gwydir St, Powis St and Madryn Street, where Beatles drummer Ringo Starr grew up. These streets were refurbished during 2017. *Worcester has a Canadian themed area with streets named after large cities, provinces, and other locations. Leicester has one area named after nuts; Filbert Street was the home of Leicester City F.C. between 1891 and 2002. *Leicester also has a series of terraced streets with the names Hawthorne, Alma, Rowan, Ruby, Ivanhoe, Sylvan, Oban, and Newport - the first letter making the name \\"Harrison\\" - after the builder. The streets all run into Beatrice Road - named for the builder's wife. *In Brossard, Quebec, Red Deer, Alberta and Brampton, Ontario, different sections of the town all have streets starting with the same letter; in Brampton, the alphabetical order reflects chronology. Laval, Quebec has an area named for birds; Kirkland, Quebec has an area named after wines. Mississauga, Ontario, Markham, Ontario, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina all have areas named for the characters in Robin Hood. *Themed names are popular in suburban subdivisions. The subdivision or suburban town may itself give the name of the theme, such as Anjou, Quebec (ex: main street named for René of Anjou, king of Naples) and Lorraine, Quebec (streets all named for towns in eastern France, main street named for Charles de Gaulle, who resided in that part of France). *In the Philippines, streets in the South Triangle district of Quezon City were named to commemorate the Boy Scouts that were among the casualties on United Arab Airlines Flight 869 (1963) on their way to the 11th World Scout Jamboree. Streets in Sampaloc, Manila are named after the various books and characters in the works of Jose Rizal. *Street names in Canberra typically follow a particular theme: the streets of Duffy are named after Australian dams and weirs, the streets of Page are named after biologists and naturalists, and the streets of Gowrie are named after Australian recipients of the Victoria Cross. Latham, named for John Greig Latham, a High Court Justice, has streets named for prominent Australian high court judges. Florey, named for Howard Florey who refined the use of penicillin, has streets named for scientists and physicians. *Almere in the Netherlands, a planned city founded in 1976, is separated into themed sections. Streets in the city's business district are named for occupations (merchant, poet, real estate agent). Streets in other neighborhoods are named for musical instruments, actors, film directors, islands, months of the year, days of the week, rock stars (Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix), fruits, electronics (transistor, microphone, television), and even Dutch comic-book characters. Themed street names are also very common in all other Dutch towns and cities. It is rare to find non-themed neighborhoods built after 1900 in the Netherlands. *Nearly all of the streets in Leeton, Australia, were named after plants. *The neighborhood of Cerak Vinogradi in Belgrade, Serbia, has streets named exclusively by the tree species that lines the street: Ash, Linden, Cedar, etc. The only non-tree place name is that of the central green space, \\"Trg (Square of) S.C. Babovic\\", though it lacks any signs with the name. *Street names in Iceland usually have a second element in common throughout a neighborhood. Examples include neighborhoods where the themes are the names of early settlers, ending with –gata (street); and then more nature-oriented ones where the second part is –smári (clover) or –gerði (hedge) with the first part being chosen for alphabetic order. * San Francisco has five partial alphabets of parallel streets. Three of these series form the grid in the Bayview district (the series Griffith ... Upton crosses the double series Arthur ... Yosemite, Armstrong ... Meade). Another (Anza ... Yorba) crosses the numbered Avenues in the Richmond and Sunset districts, which together are sometimes called \\"The Avenues\\". The fourth is the north-south streets of the Sunnyside district (Acadia ... Genesee). San Francisco also has a series of numbered Streets in the Mission and South-of-Market districts. * Grantham, England: one estate in the northeast of the town has most of its streets named after famous golf courses of the British Isles. The estate itself is named after the middle section of a golf hole. *The west side of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, has avenues that go from A to Z, although the majority of Avenue A was renamed to Idylwyld Drive. Although it was not officially named, Witney Avenue in the Meadowgreen and Mount Royal neighborhoods has been unofficially dubbed Avenue Z since it is the last street which runs parallel to Avenue Y. *In Gander, Newfoundland, every street is named after a pilot, honoring the town's aviation history. *Downtown Memphis, Tennessee, has five main avenues named after the first five presidents: Washington (northernmost), Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Monroe (southernmost). These streets were laid out in the original plan of Memphis in the early 1820s, shortly after the election of the sixth president John Quincy Adams. (The series was not continued with a second Adams Avenue.) *Downtown of Ljubljana, Slovenia, has a grid system of roads and Ljubljanica river banks named after famous Slovenian writers, poems or artists, such as France Prešeren and Ivan Cankar. A neighbourhood named Murgle (in Southern Vič district) contains a street naming system based on names of trees planted on sides of the streets, e.g. Under Maples, Under Oaks and Under Willows. *In Palo Alto, California, streets in the College Terrace neighborhood (which borders the Stanford University campus) are named after distinguished colleges and universities. The streets running north-south start at the westernmost end of the neighborhood alphabetically: Amherst, Bowdoin, Columbia, and Dartmouth. After Dartmouth, the streets do not follow the alphabet (except for the last streets, Wellesley, Williams, and Yale): Hanover, Harvard, Oberlin, Princeton, and Cornell. The backbone of the neighborhood running west-east is College Avenue, and the northernmost street, Stanford Avenue also runs west-east. *In Garfield Heights, Ohio, there is a tree theme with streets named Oak Park Drive, Shady Oak Blvd, Woodward Blvd, Eastwood Blvd, Oakview Blvd, and Maple Leaf Drive. *Streets in the suburb of Chapelford in Warrington, England take their names from US place names, centering on Boston Boulevard and including Michigan Place, Orlando Drive and Portland Road. This theme was chosen as this suburb has been built over most of the former RAF Burtonwood site and the surrounding area. This airbase was used extensively by the USAAF during the Second World War and was once the largest airfield in Europe. * In Palm Coast, Florida, nearly the entire city is divided into \\"alphabet letter\\" neighborhoods. The northernmost neighborhood has all \\"L\\" street names, whether the street runs north-south or east-west (Ex. Lakeview Blvd, Lancelot Drive, Lancaster Lane, Linnet Way). Other neighborhoods consist of only \\"B\\" (Bird of Paradise Dr, Belle Terre Pkwy, Bickwick Ln), \\"F\\" (Fellowship Dr, Forest Grove Dr, Fircrest Ln), \\"C\\" (Curry Ct, Colorado Dr, Colechester Ln), \\"P\\" (Parkview Dr, Prairie Ln, Pacific Dr), \\"W\\" (Wellington Dr, Williams Dr, Waters Ct), and \\"R\\" (Rymfire Dr, Ravenwood Dr, Royal Tern Ln) street names. *In Warley, Brentwood, Essex, a fairly recent development has street names themed around English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams; the main road running through the development aptly named \\"Vaughan Williams Way\\", with examples of smaller roads on the estate named \\"Lark Close\\" and \\"Tallis Way\\" after the composer's works \\"The Lark Ascending\\" and \\"Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis\\", respectively. *In Austin, Texas, the North to South Streets were named for major Texas rivers following the order as they generally appeared on Texas maps in the 1830s, with the exception being Congress that runs up to the Texas State Capital, and additional streets being named for smaller rivers. Streets running East to West are actually shown as either numbered streets, trees found in the state, or sometimes both, on various maps from the cities founding up into the mid 20th century. There is no good historical information as to why eventually the tree names were dropped in favor of numbered streets, but the tree names live on in various festivals, business names, and landmarks. https://www.statesman.com/news/20171101/austin-answered-why-did-tree-named- streets-switch-to-numbered-names. Another interesting anomaly is there is another street numbering scheme south of Ladybird Lake that instead runs North to South. These count up from Congress Ave going West stopping at Lamar Blvd, and are differentiated from the other numbered streets with the prefix \\"South,\\" e.g. S. 1st St. =Grid-based naming systems= Fifth Avenue and E 57th Street in New York In many cities laid out on a grid plan, the streets are named to indicate their location on a Cartesian coordinate plane. For example, the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 for Manhattan provided for numbered streets running parallel to the minor axis of the island and numbered and lettered avenues running parallel to the long axis of the island, although many of the avenues have since been assigned names for at least part of their courses. In the city plan for Washington, D.C., north-south streets were numbered away from the United States Capitol in both directions, while east- west streets were lettered away from the Capitol in both directions and diagonal streets were named after various States of the Union. As the city grew, east-west streets past W Street were given two-syllable names in alphabetical order, then three-syllable names in alphabetical order, and finally names relating to flowers and shrubs in alphabetical order. Even in communities not laid out on a grid, such as Arlington County, Virginia, a grid-based naming system is still sometimes used to give a semblance of order. Often, the numbered streets run east-west and the numbered avenues north- south, following the style adopted in Manhattan, although this is not always observed. In some cases, streets in \\"half-blocks\\" in between two consecutive numbered streets have a different designator, such as Court or Terrace, often in an organized system where courts are always between streets and terraces between avenues. Sometimes yet another designator (such as \\"Way\\", \\"Place\\", or \\"Circle\\") is used for streets which go at a diagonal or curve around, and hence do not fit easily in the grid. In many cases, the block numbers correspond to the numbered cross streets; for instance, an address of 1600 may be near 16th Street or 16th Avenue. In a city with both lettered and numbered streets, such as Washington, D.C., the 400 block may be between 4th and 5th streets or between D and E streets, depending on the direction in which the street in question runs. However, addresses in Manhattan have no obvious relationship to cross streets or avenues, although various tables and formulas are often found on maps and travel guides to assist in finding addresses. Examples of : *In Denver, Colorado, all roads running east/west are given \\"Avenue\\" designations, while those running north/south are given \\"Street\\" designations. Sometimes, additional designations are given based on physical characteristics of the road (for example, 6th Avenue Parkway and Monaco Street Parkway both contain large medians consisting of trees and walkways). Denver carries numbered Avenues north of Ellsworth, the center of the address system in Denver. Broadway carries alphabetical streets east and west. For example, 100 North Broadway is at First Avenue and Broadway. Alternately, 100 West Ellsworth is at Ellsworth and Acoma Street. *In Salt Lake City, Utah, the road system is generally based on the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Salt Lake City is also known to have a number-based naming system. For example, one may find the address of a local store at 4570 South 4000 West, where 4000 West (or 40th West) is the name of the street and 4570 is the number on the building. This means the store is approximately 45 blocks south of the LDS temple, and 40 blocks west of the LDS temple. Similar cartesian coordinate systems are used in other Utah cities and towns. Some towns in Indiana follow the same practice, as do many cities and towns in eastern Idaho. *The Chicago, Illinois, grid system extends throughout the entire city and into some of its suburbs. It divides the city into four quadrants, with the zero point being the intersection of State Street(0 E/W) and Madison Street(0 N/S) in the \\"Loop\\". All streets bear a directional prefix indicating their position relative to State and Madison, which is never omitted when writing an address (and rarely in speech). \\"Blocks\\", which have a range of 100 numbers, are approximately 1/8 mile long (except between Madison and 31st Streets, where blocks are slightly shorter, given a three-mile distance between the streets). Many neighborhoods have intermediate blocks at 1/16 mile intervals as well. The most important streets occur every mile (i.e. every 800 numbers), with secondary streets at half-mile intervals. North-south streets are always named, while east-west streets are named on the North Side and numbered on the South Side. Most City of Chicago residents know at least a few of the major streets and their grid positions (i.e. North Avenue = 1600 N, Cicero Avenue = 4800 W). Thus addresses in Chicago are commonly given two ways: in Cartesian coordinates (3400 North, 2800 West) or as number and name (3324 North California), with the expectation that the nearest cross street, or at least the distance from State Street or Madison Streets can be appropriately deduced from the address number (i.e. 3324 N = slightly more than 4 miles north of State and Madison Streets). Diagonal streets are given directional suffixes based on whether their angle is more vertical or more horizontal, and their numbering corresponds with the rest of the grid. *In Detroit, Michigan, and the suburbs to the north, major roads were generally built every mile, and many of the east-west roads are numbered in the Mile Road System based on their distance from the start of Michigan Avenue. These roads are named with \\"Mile Road\\", from 5 Mile to 37 Mile. Addresses in much of the area are counted from the beginning of Woodward Avenue in Detroit, with roughly 2000 addresses assigned per mile, not coinciding with the Mile Road numbers; for instance, 8 Mile is the 20700 block, not 800 or 8000. *In Melbourne's Central Business District, the streets were laid out in what has become known as the Hoddle Grid. It is 1.6 km long by half a mile wide .80 km (1 mile by .5 miles.) The major streets are 1.5 chains wide (30m) and halfway between the city's major thoroughfares that run parallel to the Yarra River are the \\"little\\" streets. These streets share the same name as the major street to the south (Flinders St, Flinders Lane; Collins Street, Little Collins Street; Bourke Street, Little Bourke Street; Lonsdale Street, Little Lonsdale Street; and finally La Trobe Street) and are only half a chain wide. This means that in modern times they are only one way streets, but they allow each city block to be exactly 10 chains square. Many Melbournians are able to recite the 19 streets that make up the Hoddle Grid in order. Grammar In languages that have grammatical cases, the specific part of a road name is typically in the possessive or genitive case, meaning \\"the road of [Name]\\". Where the specific is an adjective (as in \\"High Street\\"), however, it is inflected to match the generic. Street renaming political purposes. A Belgrade street that began as \\"Two White Doves\\" in 1872 was renamed Svetogorska in 1896, Bitoljska in 1922, for Georges Clemenceau in 1930, Svetogorska again in 1943, for Lola Ribar in 1946, and Svetogorska again in 1997. Street names can usually be changed relatively easily by municipal authorities for various reasons. Sometimes streets are renamed to reflect a changing or previously unrecognized ethnic community or to honour politicians or local heroes. In towns such as Geneva,https://www.thelocal.ch/20170309/geneva-agrees-to-name-more-streets- after-women Brussels,https://brussels-express.eu/city-of-brussels-wants-to- increase-the-number-of-public-places-with-womens-names/ Namurhttps://www.thebulletin.be/namur-name-more-streets-after-women and Poznańhttps://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/urbact-genderequalcities-edition- pages-web.pdf, pp. 17, 49 initiatives have recently been taken to name or rename more streets and other public spaces after women. A changed political regime can trigger widespread changes in street names - many place names in Zimbabwe changed following their independence in 1980, with streets named after British colonists being changed to those of Zimbabwean nationalist leaders. After Ukraine's pro-Western revolution in 2014, a street named after Patrice Lumumba in Kiev was renamed the street of John Paul II. City council renamed the Moscow square and avenue Reunion, Ukrayinska Pravda (6 October 2016) In Portugal, both the Republican Revolution in 1910 and the Carnation Revolution in 1974 triggered widespread changes in street names to replace references to the deposed regimes (the Monarchy and Estado Novo respectively) with references to the revolutions themselves, as well as to figures and concepts associated with them. In response to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, Israel renamed streets called \\"UN Avenue\\" in Haifa, Jerusalem, and Tel Aviv to \\"Zionism Avenue\\". Some international causes célèbres can attract cities around the world to rename streets in solidarity; for example a number of streets with South African embassies were renamed honouring Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment. Street names can also be changed to avoid negative associations, like Malbone Street in Brooklyn, New York City, renamed Empire Boulevard after the deadly Malbone Street Wreck; Cadieux Street in Montreal renamed De Bullion because the original name became infamous by the former presence of many bordellos; and several streets in the German Village area of Columbus, Ohio which were renamed with more \\"American\\" sounding names around World War I due to popular anti-German sentiments. Similarly, Hamburg Avenue in Brooklyn was renamed Wilson Avenue during World War I. Street names also can change due to a change in official language. After the death of Francisco Franco, the Spanish transition to democracy gave Catalonia the status of an autonomous community, with Catalan as a co-official language. While some street names in Catalonia were changed entirely, most were merely given the Catalan translations of their previous Castilian names; for example, Calle San Pablo (Saint Paul Street) in Barcelona became Carrer Sant Pau. In some cases, this was a reversion to Catalan names from decades earlier. In a similar way, English street names were changed to French in Quebec during the 1970s, after French was declared the sole language for outdoor signage. This was met with hurt and anger by many of the province's Anglophones, who wished to retain their traditional placenames. The government body responsible for overseeing the enacting of the Charter of the French Language continues to press English-majority communities to further gallicise (francize) their street names (for example, what was once \\"Lakeshore Road\\" was changed to \\" Lakeshore\\" in the 1970s, with the Office québécois de la langue française pressuring a further change to \\"\\"). reformed German spelling Sometimes, when communities are consolidated, the streets are renamed according to a uniform system. For example, when the community of Georgetown ceased to have even a nominal existence independent of Washington, D.C., the streets in Georgetown were renamed as an extension of Washington's street- naming convention. Also, when leaders of Arlington County, Virginia, asked the United States Post Office Department to place the entire county in the \\"Arlington, Virginia\\" postal area, the Post Office refused to do so until the county adopted a uniform addressing and street-naming system, which the county did in 1932. In 1906, Cleveland, Ohio renamed streets to a numbered system. For an example Erie Street became East 9th Street, Bond Street became East 6th Street, and so forth. In Cleveland and its suburbs, all north-south streets are numbered from Cleveland's Public Square and east-west streets are numbered from the northernmost point in Cuyahoga County, which is in the City of Euclid. Bedford, Berea, and Chagrin Falls do not adhere to the grid rules of Cleveland. After World War I, Cleveland renamed a numbered street to Liberty Boulevard, to commemorate Cleveland area soldiers who had been killed in the Great War; in 1981, this street was renamed to List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.#OhioMartin Luther King Jr. Drive]. In the borough of Queens, New York, a huge street renaming campaign began in the early 20th century, changing almost all of the street names into numbers, in accordance with the adoption of a new unified house numbering scheme. A confusing aspect of this massive transformation was that some of the local subway stations retained their names, instead of changing with their corresponding street(s); a few examples survive even today. A curious example is that of 23rd Street - Ely Avenue Station; Ely Avenue was renamed 23rd Street long before the subway station was even constructed. Pre- (top) and post-1993 (bottom) street signs in Bucharest, showing the two different Romanian spellings of the same name Sometimes street renaming can be controversial, because of antipathy toward the new name, the overturning of a respected traditional name, or confusion from the altering of a familiar name useful in navigation. A proposal in 2005 to rename 16th Street, N.W., in Washington, D.C., \\"Ronald Reagan Boulevard\\" exemplified all three. Issues of familiarity and confusion can be addressed by the street sign showing the current name and, in smaller writing, the old name. One compromise when the issue is more political can be \\"co-naming\\", when the old name is fully retained but the street is also given a second subsidiary name, which may be indicated by a smaller sign underneath the 'main' name. (See section below on \\"Multiple names for a single street\\".) It is also controversial because it is seen by many as a way to rewrite history, even if the original name is not well-liked but nevertheless traditional or convenient. It can be used to erase the presence of a cultural group or previous political regime, whether positive or negative, and to show the supremacy of a new cultural group or political regime. A prime example of this type of name change was the renaming of Montreal's Dorchester Boulevard, the nexus of the financial and business district, named for governor Lord Dorchester, to René Lévesque Boulevard, after a French-language reformist premier of Quebec. City officials rushed the name change, without waiting the required one-year mourning period after Lévesque's death. Many Anglophones were outspoken in their opposition to the name change, and the majority English-speaking city of Westmount retained Dorchester as the name of their portion of the street in protest. Another example is that of a street in Paris called '; the street's name was changed to ' after the eponymous Russian city changed its name in 1914. The Parisian street had its name changed again to ' in 1945, shortly after the liberation of Paris, and reverted to its original name after the fall of the Soviet regime in Russia in 1991. After most of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State in 1922, many streets had their names changed, with the names of English monarchs, nobility and administrators replaced with Irish patriots. Dublin's main thoroughfare was known as Sackville Street (named after Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset), becoming O'Connell Street in 1924. Similarly, Limerick's George's Street (named after George III) was renamed O'Connell Street. Great Britain Street, Dublin became Parnell Street (after Charles Stewart Parnell). Limerick's Brunswick Street (named after the House of Brunswick) became Sarsfield Street. Cork's George's Street (after George I) became Oliver Plunkett Street, after the Catholic martyr Oliver Plunkett. Many streets with royal and colonial names still remain in the Republic of Ireland, and local councils occasionally debate their removal. In 2019, Cork City Councillor Diarmaid Ó Cadhla painted over the name of \\"Victoria Road\\" and several others, and was charged with criminal damage. He said that there were \\"about 80 or 90 streets named after criminals and aristocrats in our city, and in Victoria’s case a genocidal queen responsible for the murder and displacement of two million Irish people,\\" referring to the Great Famine. Multiple names for a single street The section of St. Joseph Street running through Toronto's University of St. Michael's College is co-named Marshall McLuhan Way. Karlemagnelaan and Karl de Grotelaan street signs, Brussels, 31 January 2018 Waterloose of Waterlose While it is very common for what is effectively a single street to have different names for different portions of the street, it is less common for a portion of a street to have two equally acceptable legal names. There are several cases of the latter in New York City: Sixth Avenue in Manhattan was renamed as Avenue of the Americas in 1945, but the name never really stuck; the city now considers both names equally acceptable, and both appear on street signs. Manhattan street signs now also designate a portion of Seventh Avenue as Fashion Avenue, and Avenue C is also Loisaida Avenue, from a Spanglish pronunciation of Lower East Side. Cairo's Muizz Li-Din Allah Street changes its name as one walks through. It may variously be referred to by locals as Souq Al-Nahhasin (\\"Coppersmith Bazaar\\") or Souq Al-Attarin (\\"Spices Bazaar\\") or Souq Al-Sagha (\\"Goldsmith and Jeweler Bazaar\\"), according to historical uses, as in \\"Type of commerce or industry\\" above. (For a tourist, that might be misleading. These Cairene names identify both a \\"segment\\" within the street, and \\"sub-areas\\" in the city.)Daniel Lanier, Bazaar of the Tentmakers , Shopping around Egypt, accessed 12 March 2006. Some major roads may have two names of different types, such as the Hume Highway/Sydney Road in outer northern Melbourne, which is exclusively Sydney Road closer to the city and exclusively the Hume Highway outside Melbourne, or the Hoddle Highway which is better known as Hoddle Street north of Bridge Road and Punt Road south of it. Where a street crosses or forms (straddles) a boundary, its two sides sometimes have different names. Examples include Seton Avenue (Bronx) / Mundy Lane (Mount Vernon, New York); Station Road (Portslade) / Boundary Road (Hove, East Sussex); Lackman Road (Lenexa) / Black Bob Road (Olathe, Kansas). Streets can have multiple names because of multilingualism. Streets in Brussels often have a Dutch name and a French name, both languages being official: for example \\"\\" (Dutch) and \\"\\" (French), both meaning \\"Mountain Street\\". While the older streets were originally named in Dutch, some more recent ones, conceived in French, have been retranslated. For instance Boulevard Charlemagne was retranslated from Karlemagnelaan to Karel de Grotelaan, and Rue du Beau Site in Ixelles from the literal Schoonzichtstraat to the more idiomatic Welgelegenstraat. Occasionally there is confusion over which is the best translation, as is the case with the Chaussée de Waterloo in St-Gilles, Brussels, whicb is variously rendered as Waterlosesteenweg and Waterloosesteenweg. Similarly, the name may change when the street lies on or across a border between areas with different languages: (Kerkrade, Netherlands) / (Herzogenrath, Germany), both names meaning \\"New Street\\". In Zaandam, Netherlands, streets in the Russiche Buurt (Russian Neighbourhood) are named after Russians, commemorating Tsar Peter I's visit in 1697. These are named bilingually, for instance Tolstoistraat/Улица Толстого. Multiple streets sharing the same name Pike and Pike, Seattle In many cases, more than one street in a locality will have the same name: for example, Bordesley Green and Bordesley Green Road, both in the Bordesley Green section of Birmingham, England, and the fifteen separate Abbey Roads in London. The city of Boston has five Washington Streets. Atlanta famously has many streets that share the name Peachtree: Peachtree Street, Drive, Plaza, Circle, Way, Walk, and many other variations that include \\"Peachtree\\" in the name, such as West Peachtree Street. Occasionally, these streets actually intersect each other, as with Pike Place and Pike Street, and Ravenna Boulevard and Ravenna Avenue in Seattle, Washington. Kansas City, Missouri, has a Gillham Road, Gillham Street, and Gillham Plaza all running parallel to each other. In many cities in Alberta, new developments have only a few common street names, which are followed by variant types such as Boulevard, Drive, Crescent and Place. The western suburbs of Philadelphia near Conshohocken contain a number of roads named Gulph, including Gulph Road, Upper Gulph Road, New Gulph Road, Old Gulph Road, Gulph Creek Road, Gulph Lane, Gulph Hills Road, North Gulph Road, and South Gulph Road. In some cases, these roads intersect each other multiple times, creating confusion for those unfamiliar with the local geography. Some cities (such as Fresno, California) may use the same street name and suffix (street, ave, road, etc.) for several stretches of road. As a rule, these streets are usually in direct line with each other, but with a several block break in between sections. The breaks are usually caused by limited access (one or two entrance) housing subdivisions, or other multi block land uses (schools, parks, industrial plants, and even farm fields in the outskirts of towns). For example, a street may end in the 500 block and restart in the 900 block. Thus there will be no addresses in the 600, 700 or 800 block. St. Clair Avenue in Toronto is an example of this. Streets without names Roads between cities, and especially highways, are rarely named; they are often numbered instead, but in Graan voor Visch, a district of Hoofddorp, streets have no names. The houses there are instead uniquely numbered with very high numbers, starting with 13000. In the central district of Mannheim (Germany), it is the blocks which are numbered rather than the streets. Nicknames and shorthands Some streets are known equally or better by a name other than their official name. Seattle's University Way NE is almost universally known to locals as \\"The Ave\\".Paul Dorpat, \\"Seattle Neighborhoods: University District -- Thumbnail History\\", HistoryLink, June 18, 2001 (updated May 2002), accessed 12 March 2006. Buffalo, New York's Delaware Avenue acquired the nickname of \\"Presidents Avenue\\", being where Millard Fillmore lived, William McKinley died, and Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in as president. The best- known segment of South Las Vegas Boulevard is called the Las Vegas Strip, or just \\"The Strip\\". It is also common in some places to shorten the official name of streets which have long names. For example, many streets named for Massachusetts are often referred to as \\"Mass Ave\\"; Boston's Commonwealth Avenue is often called \\"Comm Ave\\"; Manhattan's Lexington Avenue is often simply called \\"Lex\\" and Madison Avenue, \\"Mad\\"; Charlottesville, Virginia's Jefferson Park Avenue is simply \\"JPA\\"; in Williamsburg, Virginia, Duke of Gloucester Street is often referred to as \\"DOG Street\\". In Chicago, Lake Shore Drive is commonly abbreviated to \\"LSD\\". In Portland, Oregon, the Martin Luther King, Junior Boulevard is abbreviated to \\"MLK Jr. Blvd.\\", while people in Chicago often refer to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive as \\"King Drive\\". Oregonians, when referring to the Tualatin Valley Highway west of Portland, often say and write \\"TV Highway\\". In Toronto, the Don Valley Parkway is commonly referred to as the \\"DVP\\" (and jocularly the Don Valley Parking Lot due to high congestion). In Columbus, Ohio, Chittenden Avenue near the Ohio State University is often informally referred to as \\"Chit\\", reflected in local event names such as \\"ChitShow\\" and \\"ChitFest\\". In rare cases, highway numbers may be used as shorthand for streets that have (or once had) such a designation. An example of this form of shortening is the common reference of Hurontario Street in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga, as \\"Highway 10\\". In Paris, Boulevard Saint-Michel is affectionately known as \\"Boul'Mich\\". North Michigan Avenue, Chicago's most famous shopping street, is also occasionally referred to by that name, but is more commonly called the Magnificent Mile. In Berlin, is also well known as Ku-Damm, while Automobil-Verkehrs- und Übungsstraße, a highway formerly used as a race track, is normally shortened to \\"AVUS\\". Symbolism Some street names in large cities can become metonyms, and stand for whole types of businesses or ways of life. \\"Fleet Street\\" in London still represents the British press, and \\"Wall Street\\" in New York City stands for American finance, though the former does not serve its respective industry any more. Also, if a theatrical performance makes it to \\"Broadway\\" it is supposed to be a very good show. \\"Broadway\\" represents the 41 professional theaters with 500 or more seats located in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. In London, a top surgeon with a private practice is liable to be referred to as a Harley Street surgeon even if she or he does not actually maintain an office in Harley Street. Also Savile Row is a world-known metonym for a good tailor, while Jermyn Street is associated with high-quality shirtmaking. The cachet of streets like Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue can prove effective branding, as for the Buick Park Avenue luxury car, and Saks Department Store being always known as \\"Saks Fifth Avenue\\". In the opposite way, 42nd Street still symbolizes a street of pleasure, but also sin and decadence. Like Wall Street, Toronto's Bay Street represented Canadian finance and still serves it today. Much as streets are often named after the neighborhoods they run through, the reverse process also takes place, with a neighborhood taking its name from a street or an intersection: for example, Wall Street in Manhattan, Knightsbridge in London, Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, and Jane and Finch in Toronto. Street type designations Drakewood Drive in Cincinnati. A \\"drive\\" denoting private, residential road Streets can be divided into various types, each with its own general style of construction and purpose. However, the difference between streets, roads, avenues and the like is often blurred and is not a good indicator of the size, design, or content of the area. Many transportation facilities have a suffix which designates it a \\"street\\", \\"road\\", \\"court\\", etc., and these designations may or may not have any meaning or pattern in the particular jurisdiction. In the United Kingdom many towns will refer to their main thoroughfare as the High Street, and many of the ways leading off it will be suffixed \\"Road\\". In some other English-speaking countries, such as New Zealand and Australia, cities are often divided by a main \\"Road\\", with \\"Streets\\" leading from this \\"Road\\", or are divided by thoroughfares known as \\"Streets\\" or \\"Roads\\" with no apparent differentiation between the two. In Auckland, for example, the main shopping precinct is around Queen Street and Karangahape Road, and the main urban thoroughfare connecting the south of the city to the city centre is Dominion Road. In Australia and New Zealand, some streets are called parades. Parade: A public promenade or roadway with good pedestrian facilities along the side. Examples: Peace Celebration Parade, Marine Parade, King Edward Parade, Oriental Parade and dozens more. However, this term is not used in North America (with the exception of Marine Parade in Santa Cruz, California). Houndsditch, an example of a street name with no suffix in the City of London In the City of London, according to tradition, there are no \\"Roads\\"; all the streets there are called \\"Street\\", \\"Lane\\", \\"Court\\", \\"Hill\\", \\"Row\\" or \\"Alley\\", or have no suffix (e.g. Cheapside). However, since 1994, part of Goswell Road now lies in the City of London, making this a unique anomaly. In Manhattan and the south side of Minneapolis and Seattle, east-west streets are \\"Streets\\" whereas North-South streets are \\"Avenues\\". Yet in St. Petersburg, Florida and Memphis, Tennessee, all of the east-west streets are \\"Avenues\\" and the North-South streets are \\"Streets\\" (Memphis has one exception—the historic Beale Street runs east- west). On the north and northeast side of Minneapolis, the street grids vary. In North Minneapolis, numbered avenues run east-west (33rd Avenue N) and numbered streets run north-south (6th Street N) but named avenues run north- south (Washburn Avenue N). In Northeast Minneapolis, avenues run east-west (15th Avenue NE) and streets run north-south (Taylor Street NE), except for the major east-west artery Broadway Street and the major north-south avenues Central and University. In rural Ontario, numbered concession roads form grids oriented to lakes and rivers. Usually each axis of the grid has its own suffix, for example \\"Roads\\" for east-west roads and \\"Lines\\" for north-south roads. Some townships have roads with two numbers, e.g. \\"15/16 Sideroad\\", which refer to the lot numbers on both sides of the roads. On sprawling military reservations with tank schools such as Fort Knox Military Reservation and Fort Benning there are dedicated \\"Tank Roads\\" and \\"Cut-offs\\". In Montreal, \\"avenue\\" (used for major streets in other cities) generally indicates a small, tree-lined, low-traffic residential street. Exceptions exist, such as Park Avenue and Pine Avenue. Both are major thoroughfares in the city. In older British cities, names such as \\"vale\\", normally associated with smaller roads, may become attached to major thoroughfares as roads are upgraded (e.g. Roehampton Vale in London). In the Netherlands in the 1970s and 1980sCüsters, J: \\"Straatnaamcommissie piekert zich suf\\", Binnenlands Bestuur, 25 September 1998. there was a trend to not use the street type suffix at all, resulting in street names like (translated) \\"North Sea\\" and \\"Tuba\\". The word \\"street\\" is omitted on the sign for Kearny Street in San Francisco; throughout the city, all street names are unique (except on military forts). In some cities in the United States (San Francisco, Houston, Detroit, Cleveland, Memphis), streets have official suffixes, but they are not generally given on street signs or used in postal addresses. In Chicago, suffixes are given on street signs but often ignored in popular speech and in postal addresses. The name \\"Terrace\\" is sometimes associated with gated communities. Street type designations include: *Major roads **Highway ***Autobahn ***Auto-estrada ***Autoroute ***Autostrada ***Autostrasse ***Bypass ***Expressway ***Freeway ***Motorway ***Pike/Turnpike **Avenue **Boulevard **Parade **Road **Street *Small roads **Arcade **Alley **Bay **Branch **Brook **Burg **Byway **Camp **Center **Club **Common **Corner **Course **Dale **Divide **Drive **Estate **Flat **Forge **Fork **Fort **Gardens **Gate **Gateway **Glen **Green **Grove **Harbor **Haven **Heights **Highlands **Hollow **Key **Knoll **Landing **Lane **Light **Loaf **Lock **Lodge **Manor **Meadow **Mews **Mill **Mission **Neck **Orchard **Passage **Path **Pathway **Ranch **Rapid **Rest **Route **Row **Rue **Run **Station **Terrace **Throughway **Trace **Track **Trafficway **Trail **Trailer **Union **Vale **View **Village **Villas **Ville **Vista **Walk **Wall **Way **Well **Wynd *Cul-de-sac **Close **Court **Place **Cove *Named for their shape **Bend **Circle **Crescent **Diagonal **Loop **Oval **Quadrant **Radial **Square *Named for geographical attributes **Bayou **Beach **Bluff **Bottom **Canyon **Cape **Cay **Causeway **Cliff **Creek **Crest **Curve **Fall **Field **Ford **Forest **Grade **Hill **Inlet **Island **Isle **Lake **Land **Mount **Mountain **Park **Parkway **Pass **Pine **Plain **Point **Prairie **Ridge **River **Shoal **Shore **Spring **Stream **Summit **Valley *Named for their function **Annex **Approach **Bridge **Bypass **Crossing **Crossroad **Dam **Esplanade **Extension **Ferry **Frontage road **Junction **Mall **Overpass **Parade **Park **Plaza **Port **Promenade **Quay **Ramp **Skyway **Spur **Stravenue **Tunnel **Underpass **Viaduct Numbering Some major roads, particularly motorways and freeways, are given road numbers rather than, or in addition to, names. Examples include the E5, M1 and Interstate 5. Many roads in Britain are numbered as part of the Great Britain road numbering scheme, and the same applies in many other countries. The same is also common in the United States; for example, in Washington, D.C., much of New York Avenue is U.S. Route 50. In York Region, Ontario, the former provincial Highway 7 (currently signed as York Regional Road 7) is still referred to as Highway 7 on road signs and in everyday use, even though the road has not been part of Ontario's provincial highway system since 1998. In the western United States, parts of the old U.S. Route 99 were taken over and added into the respective states' highway system and numbered \\"99\\" in the 3 states that the U.S. Route use to run through California, Oregon, and Washington. This is true for several other historic U.S. Routes, such as Route 66. The opposite is true in Las Vegas, Nevada. The western loop of the Bruce Woodbury Beltway (between the two Interstate 15 connectors) have been numbered Clark County Route 215. This is in anticipation of the route being renumbered Interstate 215 Some jurisdictions may use internal numbers to track county or city roads which display no number on signs. In most cities, attempts were made to match addresses with the areas between numbered street. For example, addresses on Main street, between 3rd and 4th street would be in the 300's Signage Most streets have a street name sign at each intersection to indicate the name of the road. The design and style of the sign is usually common to the district in which it appears. The sign has the street name and sometimes other information, such as the block number or the name of the London borough in which the street is located. Such signs are often the target of simple vandalism, and signs on unusually or famously named streets are especially liable to street sign theft. Usually, the colour scheme used on the sign just reflects the local standard (white on a green background in many U.S. jurisdictions, for example). However, in some cases, the colour of a sign can provide information, as well. One example can be found in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Within city limits, all major arterial roads use a blue sign, north-south roads use a green sign, and east-west roads use a brown sign. In New York, historical districts use white lettering on brown signs. Other places sometimes use blue or white signs to indicate private roads. Statistics The most common street names in the United States, as of 1993, are: #Second or 2nd (10,866) #Third (10,131) #First (9,898) #Fourth (9,190) #Park (8,926) #Fifth (8,186) #Main (7,644) #Sixth (7,283) #Oak (6,946) #Seventh (6,377) #Pine (6,170) #Maple (6,103) #Cedar (5,644) #Eighth (5,524) #Elm (5,233) #View (5,202) #Washington (4,974) #Ninth (4,908) #Lake (4,901) #Hill (4,877) The reason for \\"Second\\" and \\"Third\\" streets being more common than \\"First\\" is that some cities do not have \\"First\\" streets — naming them \\"Main\\" or \\"Front\\" (in communities with river, lake or railroad line frontage) instead, or renaming them after historical figures.

Dept. of Public Works ","title":"Street or road name"},{"id":"2551717","text":"In relativistic classical field theories of gravitation, particularly general relativity, an energy condition is one of various alternative conditions that can be applied to the matter content of the theory when it is either not possible or desirable to specify this content explicitly. The hope is then that any reasonable matter theory will satisfy this condition or at least will preserve the condition if it is satisfied by the starting conditions. Energy conditions are not physical constraints , but are rather mathematically imposed boundary conditions that attempt to capture a belief that \\"energy should be positive\\". Many energy conditions are known to not correspond to physical reality—for example, the observable effects of dark energy are well- known to violate the strong energy condition. In general relativity, energy conditions are often used (and required) in proofs of various important theorems about black holes, such as the no hair theorem or the laws of black hole thermodynamics. Motivation In general relativity and allied theories, the distribution of the mass, momentum, and stress due to matter and to any non-gravitational fields is described by the energy–momentum tensor (or matter tensor) T^{ab}. However, the Einstein field equation is not very choosy about what kinds of states of matter or non-gravitational fields are admissible in a spacetime model. This is both a strength, since a good general theory of gravitation should be maximally independent of any assumptions concerning non- gravitational physics, and a weakness, because without some further criterion the Einstein field equation admits putative solutions with properties most physicists regard as unphysical, i.e. too weird to resemble anything in the real universe even approximately. The energy conditions represent such criteria. Roughly speaking, they crudely describe properties common to all (or almost all) states of matter and all non-gravitational fields that are well- established in physics while being sufficiently strong to rule out many unphysical \\"solutions\\" of the Einstein field equation. Mathematically speaking, the most apparent distinguishing feature of the energy conditions is that they are essentially restrictions on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matter tensor. A more subtle but no less important feature is that they are imposed eventwise, at the level of tangent spaces. Therefore, they have no hope of ruling out objectionable global features, such as closed timelike curves. Some observable quantities In order to understand the statements of the various energy conditions, one must be familiar with the physical interpretation of some scalar and vector quantities constructed from arbitrary timelike or null vectors and the matter tensor. First, a unit timelike vector field \\\\vec{X} can be interpreted as defining the world lines of some family of (possibly noninertial) ideal observers. Then the scalar field : \\\\rho = T_{ab} X^a X^b can be interpreted as the total mass-energy density (matter plus field energy of any non-gravitational fields) measured by the observer from our family (at each event on his world line). Similarly, the vector field with components -{T^a}_b X^b represents (after a projection) the momentum measured by our observers. Second, given an arbitrary null vector field \\\\vec{k}, the scalar field : u = T_{ab} k^a k^b can be considered a kind of limiting case of the mass-energy density. Third, in the case of general relativity, given an arbitrary timelike vector field \\\\vec{X}, again interpreted as describing the motion of a family of ideal observers, the Raychaudhuri scalar is the scalar field obtained by taking the trace of the tidal tensor corresponding to those observers at each event: : {E[\\\\vec{X}]^m}_m = R_{ab} X^a X^b This quantity plays a crucial role in Raychaudhuri's equation. Then from Einstein field equation we immediately obtain : \\\\frac{1}{8 \\\\pi} {E[\\\\vec{X}]^m}_m = \\\\frac{1}{8 \\\\pi} R_{ab} X^a X^b = \\\\left( T_{ab} - \\\\frac{1}{2} T g_{ab} \\\\right) X^a X^b, where T = {T^m}_m is the trace of the matter tensor. Mathematical statement There are several alternative energy conditions in common use: =Null energy condition= The null energy condition stipulates that for every future-pointing null vector field \\\\vec{k}, : u = T_{ab} k^a k^b \\\\ge 0. Each of these has an averaged version, in which the properties noted above are to hold only on average along the flowlines of the appropriate vector fields. Otherwise, the Casimir effect leads to exceptions. For example, the averaged null energy condition states that for every flowline (integral curve) C of the null vector field \\\\vec{k}, we must have : \\\\int_C T_{ab} k^a k^b d\\\\lambda \\\\ge 0. =Weak energy condition= The weak energy condition stipulates that for every timelike vector field \\\\vec{X}, the matter density observed by the corresponding observers is always non-negative: :\\\\rho = T_{ab} X^a X^b \\\\ge 0. =Dominant energy condition= The dominant energy condition stipulates that, in addition to the weak energy condition holding true, for every future- pointing causal vector field (either timelike or null) \\\\vec{Y}, the vector field -{T^a}_b Y^b must be a future-pointing causal vector. That is, mass–energy can never be observed to be flowing faster than light. =Strong energy condition= The strong energy condition stipulates that for every timelike vector field \\\\vec{X}, the trace of the tidal tensor measured by the corresponding observers is always non-negative: :\\\\left( T_{ab} - \\\\frac{1}{2} T g_{ab} \\\\right) X^a X^b \\\\ge 0 There are many classical matter configurations which violate the strong energy condition, at least from a mathematical perspective. For instance, a scalar field with a positive potential can violate this condition. Moreover, observations of dark energy/cosmological constant show that the strong energy condition fails to describe our universe, even when averaged across cosmological scales. Furthermore, it is strongly violated in any cosmological inflationary process (even one not driven by a scalar field). Perfect fluids Implications among some energy conditions, in the case of a perfect fluid. Perfect fluids possess a matter tensor of form : T^{ab} = \\\\rho u^a u^b + p h^{ab}, where \\\\vec{u} is the four-velocity of the matter particles and where h^{ab}\\\\equiv g^{ab} + u^{a}u^{b} is the projection tensor onto the spatial hyperplane elements orthogonal to the four-velocity, at each event. (Notice that these hyperplane elements will not form a spatial hyperslice unless the velocity is vorticity-free, that is, irrotational.) With respect to a frame aligned with the motion of the matter particles, the components of the matter tensor take the diagonal form : T^{\\\\hat{a} \\\\hat{b}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\rho& 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & p & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & p & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & p \\\\end{bmatrix}. Here, \\\\rho is the energy density and p is the pressure. The energy conditions can then be reformulated in terms of these eigenvalues: *The null energy condition stipulates that \\\\rho + p \\\\ge 0. *The weak energy condition stipulates that \\\\rho \\\\ge 0, \\\\; \\\\; \\\\rho + p \\\\ge 0. *The dominant energy condition stipulates that \\\\rho \\\\ge p. *The strong energy condition stipulates that \\\\rho + p \\\\ge 0, \\\\; \\\\; \\\\rho + 3 p \\\\ge 0. The implications among these conditions are indicated in the figure at right. Note that some of these conditions allow negative pressure. Also, note that despite the names the strong energy condition does not imply the weak energy condition even in the context of perfect fluids. Attempts at falsifying the energy conditions While the intent of the energy conditions is to provide simple criteria that rule out many unphysical situations while admitting any physically reasonable situation, in fact, at least when one introduces an effective field modeling some quantum mechanical effects, some possible matter tensors which are known to be physically reasonable and even realistic because they have been experimentally verified to actually fail various energy conditions. In particular, in the Casimir effect, in the region between two conducting plates held parallel at a very small separation d, there is a negative energy density : \\\\varepsilon = \\\\frac{-\\\\pi^2}{720} \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{d^4} between the plates. (Be mindful, though, that the Casimir effect is topological, in that the sign of the vacuum energy depends on both the geometry and topology of the configuration. Being negative for parallel plates, the vacuum energy is positive for a conducting sphere.) However, various quantum inequalities suggest that a suitable averaged energy condition may be satisfied in such cases. In particular, the averaged null energy condition is satisfied in the Casimir effect. Indeed, for energy–momentum tensors arising from effective field theories on Minkowski spacetime, the averaged null energy condition holds for everyday quantum fields. Extending these results is an open problem. The strong energy condition is obeyed by all normal/Newtonian matter, but a false vacuum can violate it. Consider the linear barotropic equation state :p = w\\\\rho, where \\\\rho is the matter energy density, p is the matter pressure, and w is a constant. Then the strong energy condition requires w \\\\ge -1/3; but for the state known as a false vacuum, we have w = -1.

An American, William Walker, briefly invaded Nicaragua in 1855 with a small army. He seized control of the country by 1856, but was ousted the following year.  Background  Nicaragua’s independence from Spain, Mexico, and then from the United Provinces of Central America in 1838 did not free it from foreign interference. The 1850s California Gold Rush created interest in the United States in finding a quicker route between the American east and west coasts. However, Great Britain had long been present on the coast of Nicaragua, which created tension between the two countries. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty was signed in 1850, in which both sides \\"agreed that neither would claim exclusive power over a future canal in Central America nor gain exclusive control over any part of the region.\\" Many Nicaraguans originally welcomed this treaty because of the potential financial benefits a canal could bring. After Nicaraguan independence came a continuous conflict over power between the Nicaraguan cities of León and Granada, and their political parties (León housed the liberals and Granada the conservatives). Initial stages In 1854, a civil war erupted in Nicaragua between the Legitimist party (also called the Conservative party), and the Democratic party (also called the Liberal party). The liberal elite of León was losing the struggle to unseat the conservative elite of Granada and turned for help to a San Francisco-based soldier of fortune named William Walker. Walker was known as an adventurer who sought to take control of Latin American countries with the purpose of making them a part of the United States. To circumvent American neutrality laws, Walker obtained a contract from Democratic president Francisco Castellón to bring as many as three hundred \\"colonists\\" to Nicaragua. Walker sailed from San Francisco on May 3, 1855, with approximately 60 men. Upon landing, the force was reinforced by 170 locals and about 100 Americans.Museo Juan Santamaría: Cronología histórica relacionada con la Guerra Nacional Centroamericana contra los Filibusteros Museo Juan Santamaría: Cronología histórica relacionada con la Guerra Nacional Centroamericana contra los Filibusteros =Establishment of Walker= President Walker's house in Granada, Nicaragua.

Walker's flag of 19th century American-occupied Nicaragua With Castellón's consent, Walker attacked the Legitimists in the town of Rivas, near the trans-isthmian route. He was driven off, but not without inflicting heavy casualties. On September 4, during the Battle of La Virgen, Walker defeated the Legitimist army. On October 13, he conquered the Legitimist capital of Granada and took effective control of the country. Initially, as commander of the army, Walker ruled Nicaragua through puppet President Patricio Rivas. U.S. President Franklin Pierce recognized Walker's regime as the legitimate government of Nicaragua on May 20, 1856. Walker declared himself president, re-instituted slavery, and made English the official language. =Central American counterattack= Walker had scared his neighbors with talk of further military conquests in Central America. Juan Rafael Mora, President of Costa Rica, rejected Walker's diplomatic overtures and instead declared war on his regime. Walker sent Colonel Schlessinger to invade Costa Rica in a preemptive action, but his forces were defeated at the Battle of Santa Rosa in March 1856. In April 1856, Costa Rican troops penetrated into Nicaraguan territory and inflicted a defeat on Walker's men at the Second Battle of Rivas, in which Juan Santamaría, later to be recognized as one of Costa Rica's national heroes by burning the place where the Filibusters were staying. Walker set himself up as President of Nicaragua, after conducting an uncontested election. He was inaugurated on July 12, 1856, and soon launched an Americanization program, reinstating slavery, declaring English an official language and reorganizing currency and fiscal policy to encourage immigration from the United States of America. Meanwhile, government representatives from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala signed in the City of Guatemala a Treaty of Alliance on July 18, 1856, for \\"defense of its sovereignty and independence\\" also recognized Patricio Rivas as president of Nicaragua. Costa Rica could not attend at that time to the alliance because of the havoc that cholera disease had caused in their troops, but would resume actions later. Also, democratic and loyalist factions allied to Patricio Rivas, signed on 12 September, a \\"Providential Pact\\" declaring war against William Walker. For September 14, Septentrión Army (as the allied army was called) forces managed the first victory of the patriots Nicaraguans in the so-called Battle of San Jacinto. By the end of 1856, Walker ordered the destruction of Granada. The Costa Rican government resumed action in late 1856, and developed plans to take over the San Juan River in order to cut Walker's supply of weapons and new recruits. Cornelius Vanderbilt sent one of his agents, Sylvanus Spencer, to collaborate with the Costa Rican army in order to recover the possession of the Transit Company he had lost to Walker. Spencer arrives to San Jose in November 1856 and it is assigned to a company under Major Maximo Blanco to take over the steamers of the Transit Company. By January 1857, the Costa Rican army was in control of the San Juan River and all the steamers of the Transit Company. Meanwhile, Walker was expelled from Granada by the rest of the allied armies. Some reinforcements under the command of Lockridge and Titus tried to recover the control of the River from the Costa Ricans, unsuccessfully. By April 1857, Walker had taken Rivas again, and the allies had laid siege to the city, in what became known as the Third Battle of Rivas. Walker's surrender William Walker the self-proclaimed American President of Nicaragua, who conquered the Nicaraguans and occupied their country from 1855–1857 Costa Rica, Honduras, and other Central American countries united to drive Walker out in 1857. During this time, Granada was burned and thousands of Central Americans lost their lives. The final battle of what Nicaraguans called the \\"National War\\" (1856–57) took place in the spring of 1857 in the town of Rivas, near the Costa Rican border. Walker beat off the attacks, but the effort diminished the strength and morale of his forces and he soon succumbed. The National War made for the cooperation between the Liberal and Conservative parties, which had brought Walker to Nicaragua. On May 1, 1857, Walker surrendered to Commander Charles Henry Davis of the United States Navy and was repatriated. Upon disembarking in New York City, he was greeted as a hero, but he alienated public opinion when he blamed his defeat on the U.S. Navy.

Pseudorandomness is sufficient for many uses, such as statistics, hence the name statistical randomness. Global randomness and local randomness are different. Most philosophical conceptions of randomness are global--because they are based on the idea that \\"in the long run\\" a sequence looks truly random, even if certain sub-sequences would not look random. In a \\"truly\\" random sequence of numbers of sufficient length, for example, it is probable there would be long sequences of nothing but repeating numbers, though on the whole the sequence might be random. Local randomness refers to the idea that there can be minimum sequence lengths in which random distributions are approximated. Long stretches of the same numbers, even those generated by \\"truly\\" random processes, would diminish the \\"local randomness\\" of a sample (it might only be locally random for sequences of 10,000 numbers; taking sequences of less than 1,000 might not appear random at all, for example). A sequence exhibiting a pattern is not thereby proved not statistically random. According to principles of Ramsey theory, sufficiently large objects must necessarily contain a given substructure (\\"complete disorder is impossible\\"). Legislation concerning gambling imposes certain standards of statistical randomness to slot machines.  Tests  The first tests for random numbers were published by M.G. Kendall and Bernard Babington Smith in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society in 1938. They were built on statistical tools such as Pearson's chi-squared test that were developed to distinguish whether experimental phenomena matched their theoretical probabilities. Pearson developed his test originally by showing that a number of dice experiments by W.F.R. Weldon did not display \\"random\\" behavior. Kendall and Smith's original four tests were hypothesis tests, which took as their null hypothesis the idea that each number in a given random sequence had an equal chance of occurring, and that various other patterns in the data should be also distributed equiprobably. * The frequency test, was very basic: checking to make sure that there were roughly the same number of 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, etc. * The serial test, did the same thing but for sequences of two digits at a time (00, 01, 02, etc.), comparing their observed frequencies with their hypothetical predictions were they equally distributed. * The poker test, tested for certain sequences of five numbers at a time (AAAAA, AAAAB, AAABB, etc.) based on hands in the game poker. * The gap test, looked at the distances between zeroes (00 would be a distance of 0, 030 would be a distance of 1, 02250 would be a distance of 3, etc.). If a given sequence was able to pass all of these tests within a given degree of significance (generally 5%), then it was judged to be, in their words \\"locally random\\". Kendall and Smith differentiated \\"local randomness\\" from \\"true randomness\\" in that many sequences generated with truly random methods might not display \\"local randomness\\" to a given degree -- very large sequences might contain many rows of a single digit. This might be \\"random\\" on the scale of the entire sequence, but in a smaller block it would not be \\"random\\" (it would not pass their tests), and would be useless for a number of statistical applications. As random number sets became more and more common, more tests, of increasing sophistication were used. Some modern tests plot random digits as points on a three-dimensional plane, which can then be rotated to look for hidden patterns. In 1995, the statistician George Marsaglia created a set of tests known as the diehard tests, which he distributes with a CD-ROM of 5 billion pseudorandom numbers. In 2015, Yongge Wang distributed a Java software package Yongge Wang. Statistical Testing Techniques For Pseudorandom generation. http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/liltest/ for statistically distance based randomness testing. Pseudorandom number generators require tests as exclusive verifications for their \\"randomness,\\" as they are decidedly not produced by \\"truly random\\" processes, but rather by deterministic algorithms. Over the history of random number generation, many sources of numbers thought to appear \\"random\\" under testing have later been discovered to be very non-random when subjected to certain types of tests. The notion of quasi-random numbers was developed to circumvent some of these problems, though pseudorandom number generators are still extensively used in many applications (even ones known to be extremely \\"non-random\\"), as they are \\"good enough\\" for most applications. Other tests: * The Monobit test treats each output bit of the random number generator as a coin flip test, and determine if the observed number of heads and tails are close to the expected 50% frequency. The number of heads in a coin flip trail forms a binomial distribution. * The Wald–Wolfowitz runs test tests for the number of bit transitions between 0 bits, and 1 bits, comparing the observed frequencies with expected frequency of a random bit sequence. * Information entropy * Autocorrelation test * Kolmogorov–Smirnov test * Statistically distance based randomness test.

Size is 460 mm diameter x 1000 mm between centers A metal lathe or metalworking lathe is a large class of lathes designed for precisely machining relatively hard materials. They were originally designed to machine metals; however, with the advent of plastics and other materials, and with their inherent versatility, they are used in a wide range of applications, and a broad range of materials. In machining jargon, where the larger context is already understood, they are usually simply called lathes, or else referred to by more-specific subtype names (toolroom lathe, turret lathe, etc.). These rigid machine tools remove material from a rotating workpiece via the (typically linear) movements of various cutting tools, such as tool bits and drill bits. Construction The design of lathes can vary greatly depending on the intended application; however, basic features are common to most types. These machines consist of (at the least) a headstock, bed, carriage, and tailstock. Better machines are solidly constructed with broad bearing surfaces (slide-ways) for stability, and manufactured with great precision. This helps ensure the components manufactured on the machines can meet the required tolerances and repeatability. =Headstock= Headstock with legend, numbers and text within the description refer to those in the image The headstock (H1) houses the main spindle (H4), speed change mechanism (H2,H3), and change gears (H10). The headstock is required to be made as robust as possible due to the cutting forces involved, which can distort a lightly built housing, and induce harmonic vibrations that will transfer through to the workpiece, reducing the quality of the finished workpiece. The main spindle is generally hollow to allow long bars to extend through to the work area. This reduces preparation and waste of material. The spindle runs in precision bearings and is fitted with some means of attaching workholding devices such as chucks or faceplates. This end of the spindle usually also has an included taper, frequently a Morse taper, to allow the insertion of hollow tubular (Morse standard) tapers to reduce the size of the tapered hole, and permit use of centers. On older machines ('50s) the spindle was directly driven by a flat belt pulley with lower speeds available by manipulating the bull gear. Later machines use a gear box driven by a dedicated electric motor. A fully 'geared head' allows the operator to select suitable speeds entirely through the gearbox. =Beds= The bed is a robust base that connects to the headstock and permits the carriage and tailstock to be moved parallel with the axis of the spindle. This is facilitated by hardened and ground bedways which restrain the carriage and tailstock in a set track. The carriage travels by means of a rack and pinion system. The leadscrew of accurate pitch, drives the carriage holding the cutting tool via a gearbox driven from the headstock. Types of beds include inverted \\"V\\" beds, flat beds, and combination \\"V\\" and flat beds. \\"V\\" and combination beds are used for precision and light duty work, while flat beds are used for heavy duty work. When a lathe is installed, the first step is to level it, which refers to making sure the bed is not twisted or bowed. There is no need to make the machine exactly horizontal, but it must be entirely untwisted to achieve accurate cutting geometry. A precision level is a useful tool for identifying and removing any twist. It is advisable also to use such a level along the bed to detect bending, in the case of a lathe with more than four mounting points. In both instances the level is used as a comparator rather than an absolute reference. =Feed and lead screws= The feedscrew (H8) is a long driveshaft that allows a series of gears to drive the carriage mechanisms. These gears are located in the apron of the carriage. Both the feedscrew and leadscrew (H7) are driven by either the change gears (on the quadrant) or an intermediate gearbox known as a quick change gearbox (H6) or Norton gearbox. These intermediate gears allow the correct ratio and direction to be set for cutting threads or worm gears. Tumbler gears (operated by H5) are provided between the spindle and gear train along with a quadrant plate that enables a gear train of the correct ratio and direction to be introduced. This provides a constant relationship between the number of turns the spindle makes, to the number of turns the leadscrew makes. This ratio allows screwthreads to be cut on the workpiece without the aid of a die. Some lathes have only one leadscrew that serves all carriage-moving purposes. For screw cutting, a half nut is engaged to be driven by the leadscrew's thread; and for general power feed, a key engages with a keyway cut into the leadscrew to drive a pinion along a rack that is mounted along the lathe bed. The leadscrew will be manufactured to either imperial or metric standards and will require a conversion ratio to be introduced to create thread forms from a different family. To accurately convert from one thread form to the other requires a 127-tooth gear, or on lathes not large enough to mount one, an approximation may be used. Multiples of 3 and 7 giving a ratio of 63:1 can be used to cut fairly loose threads. This conversion ratio is often built into the quick change gearboxes. The precise ratio required to convert a lathe with an Imperial (inch) leadscrew to metric (millimeter) threading is 100 / 127 = 0.7874... . The best approximation with the fewest total teeth is very often 37 / 47 = 0.7872... . This transposition gives a constant -0.020 percent error over all customary and model-maker's metric pitches (0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 5.50 and 6.00 mm). =Carriage= thumbThe parts of a lathe carriage: 1. Toolpost 2. Compound/top-slide 3. Cross-slide 4. Saddle 5. Apron See text for more details. In its simplest form the carriage holds the tool bit and moves it longitudinally (turning) or perpendicularly (facing) under the control of the operator. The operator moves the carriage manually via the handwheel (5a) or automatically by engaging the feed shaft with the carriage feed mechanism (5c). This provides some relief for the operator as the movement of the carriage becomes power assisted. The handwheels (2a, 3b, 5a) on the carriage and its related slides are usually calibrated, both for ease of use and to assist in making reproducible cuts. The carriage typically comprises a top casting, known as the saddle (4), and a side casting, known as the apron (5). Cross-slide The cross-slide (3) rides on the carriage and has a feedscrew which travels at right angles to the main spindle axis. This permits facing operations to be performed, and the depth of cut to be adjusted. This feedscrew can be engaged, through a gear train, to the feed shaft (mentioned previously) to provide automated 'power feed' movement to the cross-slide. On most lathes, only one direction can be engaged at a time as an interlock mechanism will shut out the second gear train. Cross-slide handwheels are usually marked in terms of the part's diameter, so one graduation representing .001 inches of diameter corresponds to .0005 inches of cross-slide motion. Compound rest The compound rest (or top slide) (2) is usually where the tool post is mounted. It provides a smaller amount of movement (less than the cross-slide) along its axis via another feedscrew. The compound rest axis can be adjusted independently of the carriage or cross- slide. It is used for turning tapers, to control depth of cut when screwcutting or precision facing, or to obtain finer feeds (under manual control) than the feed shaft permits. Usually, the compound rest has a protractor marked in its base (2b), enabling the operator to adjust its axis to precise angles. The slide rest (as the earliest forms of carriage were known) can be traced to the fifteenth century. In 1718 the tool-supporting slide rest with a set of gears was introduced by a Russian inventor Andrey Nartov and had limited usage in the Russian industry.Nartov's biography The first fully documented, all-metal slide rest lathe was invented by Jacques de Vaucanson around 1751. It was described in the Encyclopédie a long time before Maudslay invented and perfected his version. It is likely that Maudslay was not aware of Vaucanson's work, since his first versions of the slide rest had many errors that were not present in the Vaucanson lathe. In the eighteenth century the slide rest was also used on French ornamental turning lathes. The suite of gun boring mills at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in the 1780s by the Verbruggan family also had slide rests. The story has long circulated that Henry Maudslay invented it, but he did not (and never claimed so). The legend that Maudslay invented the slide rest originated with James Nasmyth, who wrote ambiguously about it in his Remarks on the Introduction of the Slide Principle, 1841; later writers misunderstood, and propagated the error. However, Maudslay did help to disseminate the idea widely. It is highly probable that he saw it when he was working at the Arsenal as a boy. In 1794, whilst he was working for Joseph Bramah, he made one, and when he had his own workshop used it extensively in the lathes he made and sold there. Coupled with the network of engineers he trained, this ensured the slide rest became widely known and copied by other lathe makers, and so diffused throughout British engineering workshops. A practical and versatile screw-cutting lathe incorporating the trio of leadscrew, change gears, and slide rest was Maudslay's most important achievement. Toolpost The tool bit is mounted in the toolpost (1) which may be of the American lantern style, traditional four-sided square style, or a quick-change style such as the multifix arrangement pictured. The advantage of a quick change set-up is to allow an unlimited number of tools to be used (up to the number of holders available) rather than being limited to one tool with the lantern style, or to four tools with the four-sided type. Interchangeable tool holders allow all tools to be preset to a center height that does not change, even if the holder is removed from the machine. =Tailstock= Tailstock with legend, numbers and text within the description refer to those in the image The tailstock is a tool (drill), and center mount, opposite the headstock. The spindle (T5) does not rotate but does travel longitudinally under the action of a leadscrew and handwheel (T1). The spindle includes a taper to hold drill bits, centers and other tooling. The tailstock can be positioned along the bed and clamped (T6) in position as dictated by the work piece. There is also provision to offset the tailstock (T4) from the spindles axis, this is useful for turning small tapers, and when re-aligning the tailstock to the axis of the bed. The image shows a reduction gear box (T2) between the handwheel and spindle, where large drills may necessitate the extra leverage. The tool bit is normally made of HSS, cobalt steel or carbide. =Steady, follower and other rests= Long workpieces often need to be supported in the middle, as cutting tools can push (bend) the work piece away from where the centers can support them, because cutting metal produces tremendous forces that tend to vibrate or even bend the workpiece. This extra support can be provided by a steady rest (also called a steady, a fixed steady, a center rest, or sometimes, confusingly, a center). It stands stationary from a rigid mounting on the bed, and it supports the workpiece at the rest's center, typically with three contact points 120° apart. A follower rest (also called a follower or a travelling steady) is similar, but it is mounted to the carriage rather than the bed, which means that as the tool bit moves, the follower rest \\"follows along\\" (because they are both rigidly connected to the same moving carriage)., p. 118.Arthur R. Meyers,Thomas J. Slattery. Basic Machining Reference Handbook. Second Edition. - Industrial Press Inc., 2001, p. 58 Follower rests can provide support that directly counteracts the springing force of the tool bit, right at the region of the workpiece being cut at any moment. In this respect they are analogous to a box tool. Any rest transfers some workpiece geometry errors from base (bearing surface) to processing surface. It depends on the rest design. For minimum transfer rate correcting rests are used. Rest rollers typically cause some additional geometry errors on the processing surface.

Some variations are not all that obvious, and others are more a niche area. For example, a centering lathe is a dual head machine where the work remains fixed and the heads move towards the workpiece and machine a center drill hole into each end. The resulting workpiece may then be used \\"between centers\\" in another operation. The usage of the term metal lathe may also be considered somewhat outdated these days. Plastics and other composite materials are in wide use and, with appropriate modifications, the same principles and techniques may be applied to their machining as that used for metal. =Center lathe / engine lathe / bench lathe= A typical center lathe The terms center lathe, engine lathe, and bench lathe all refer to a basic type of lathe that may be considered the archetypical class of metalworking lathe most often used by the general machinist or machining hobbyist. The name bench lathe implies a version of this class small enough to be mounted on a workbench (but still full-featured, and larger than mini-lathes or micro- lathes). The construction of a center lathe is detailed above, but depending on the year of manufacture, size, price range or desired features, even these lathes can vary widely between models. Engine lathe is the name applied to a traditional late-19th-century or 20th-century lathe with automatic feed to the cutting tool, as opposed to early lathes which were used with hand-held tools, or lathes with manual feed only. The usage of \\"engine\\" here is in the mechanical-device sense, not the prime-mover sense, as in the steam engines which were the standard industrial power source for many years. The works would have one large steam engine which would provide power to all the machines via a line shaft system of belts. Therefore, early engine lathes were generally 'cone heads', in that the spindle usually had attached to it a multi-step pulley called a cone pulley designed to accept a flat belt. Different spindle speeds could be obtained by moving the flat belt to different steps on the cone pulley. Cone-head lathes usually had a countershaft (layshaft) on the back side of the cone which could be engaged to provide a lower set of speeds than was obtainable by direct belt drive. These gears were called back gears. Larger lathes sometimes had two-speed back gears which could be shifted to provide a still lower set of speeds. When electric motors started to become common in the early 20th century, many cone-head lathes were converted to electric power. At the same time the state of the art in gear and bearing practice was advancing to the point that manufacturers began to make fully geared headstocks, using gearboxes analogous to automobile transmissions to obtain various spindle speeds and feed rates while transmitting the higher amounts of power needed to take full advantage of high speed steel tools. Cutting tools evolved once again, with the introduction of man made carbides, and became widely introduced to general industry in the 1970s. Early carbides were attached to toolholders by brazing them into a machined 'nest' in the tool holders. Later designs allowed tips to be replaceable and multi faceted, allowing them to be reused. Carbides tolerate much higher machining speeds without wearing. This has led to machining times shortening, and therefore production growing. The demand for faster and more powerful lathes controlled the direction of lathe development. The availability of inexpensive electronics has again changed the way speed control may be applied by allowing continuously variable motor speed from the maximum down to almost zero RPM. This had been tried in the late 19th century but was not found satisfactory at the time. Subsequent improvements in electric circuitry have made it viable again. =Toolroom lathe= A toolroom lathe is a lathe optimized for toolroom work. It is essentially just a top-of- the-line center lathe, with all of the best optional features that may be omitted from less expensive models, such as a collet closer, taper attachment, and others. The bed of a toolroom lathe is generally wider than that of a standard center lathe. There has also been an implication over the years of selective assembly and extra fitting, with every care taken in the building of a toolroom model to make it the smoothest-running, most-accurate version of the machine that can be built. However, within one brand, the quality difference between a regular model and its corresponding toolroom model depends on the builder and in some cases has been partly marketing psychology. For name-brand machine tool builders who made only high-quality tools, there wasn't necessarily any lack of quality in the base-model product for the \\"luxury model\\" to improve upon. In other cases, especially when comparing different brands, the quality differential between (1) an entry-level center lathe built to compete on price, and (2) a toolroom lathe meant to compete only on quality and not on price, can be objectively demonstrated by measuring TIR, vibration, etc. In any case, because of their fully ticked-off option list and (real or implied) higher quality, toolroom lathes are more expensive than entry-level center lathes. =Turret lathe and capstan lathe= Turret lathes and capstan lathes are members of a class of lathes that are used for repetitive production of duplicate parts (which by the nature of their cutting process are usually interchangeable). It evolved from earlier lathes with the addition of the turret, which is an indexable toolholder that allows multiple cutting operations to be performed, each with a different cutting tool, in easy, rapid succession, with no need for the operator to perform setup tasks in between (such as installing or uninstalling tools) nor to control the toolpath. (The latter is due to the toolpath's being controlled by the machine, either in jig-like fashion [via the mechanical limits placed on it by the turret's slide and stops] or via IT-directed servomechanisms [on computer numerical controlled (CNC) lathes].)Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, p. 81, 123, Cypress, CA, 2013. . There is a tremendous variety of turret lathe and capstan lathe designs, reflecting the variety of work that they do. =Gang-tool lathe= A gang-tool lathe is one that has a row of tools set up on its cross-slide, which is long and flat and is similar to a milling machine table. The idea is essentially the same as with turret lathes: to set up multiple tools and then easily index between them for each part-cutting cycle. Instead of being rotary like a turret, the indexable tool group is linear. =Multispindle lathe= Multispindle lathes have more than one spindle and automated control (whether via cams or CNC). They are production machines specializing in high-volume production. The smaller types are usually called screw machines, while the larger variants are usually called automatic chucking machines, automatic chuckers, or simply chuckers. Screw machines usually work from bar stock, while chuckers automatically chuck up individual blanks from a magazine. Typical minimum profitable production lot size on a screw machine is in the thousands of parts due to the large setup time. Once set up, a screw machine can rapidly and efficiently produce thousands of parts on a continuous basis with high accuracy, low cycle time, and very little human intervention. (The latter two points drive down the unit cost per interchangeable part much lower than could be achieved without these machines.) =CNC lathe / CNC turning center= CNC lathe with milling capabilities An example turned vase and view of the tool turret Computer numerical controlled (CNC) lathes are rapidly replacing the older production lathes (multispindle, etc.) due to their ease of setting, operation, repeatability and accuracy. A CNC Turning Lathe is a Computer Controlled piece of machinery. It allows basic machining operations such as turning and drilling to be carried out as on a conventional lathe. They are designed to use modern carbide tooling and fully use modern processes. The part may be designed and the tool paths programmed by the CAD/CAM process or manually by the programmer, and the resulting file uploaded to the machine, and once set and trialled the machine will continue to turn out parts under the occasional supervision of an operator. The machine is controlled electronically via a computer menu style interface, the program may be modified and displayed at the machine, along with a simulated view of the process. The setter/operator needs a high level of skill to perform the process. However, the knowledge base is broader compared to the older production machines where intimate knowledge of each machine was considered essential. These machines are often set and operated by the same person, where the operator will supervise a small number of machines (cell). The design of a CNC lathe varies with different manufacturers, but they all have some common elements. The turret holds the tool holders and indexes them as needed, the spindle holds the workpiece and there are slides that let the turret move in multiple axes simultaneously. The machines are often totally enclosed, due in large part to occupational health and safety (OH&S;) issues. With rapid growth in this industry, different CNC lathe manufacturers use different user interfaces which sometimes makes it difficult for operators as they have to be acquainted with them. With the advent of cheap computers, free operating systems such as Linux, and open source CNC software, the entry price of CNC machines has plummeted. CNC Horizontal Milling CNC horizontal machining is performed using horizontally-configured lathes, machining centers, boring machines, or boring mills. The equipment used typically consists of rotating cylindrical cutters moving up and down along five axes. These machines are capable of producing a variety of shapes, slots, holes, and details on a three-dimensional part. CNC Vertical Milling Vertically- oriented CNC machines utilize cylindrical cutters on a vertical spindle axis to create plunge cuts and drilled holes, as well as custom shapes, slots, and details on three-dimensional parts. Equipment used in this type of milling includes vertical lathes, vertical machining centers, and 5-axis machines. =Swiss-style lathe / Swiss turning center = A view inside the enclosure of a CNC Swiss-style lathe/screw machine A Swiss-style lathe is a specific design of lathe providing extreme accuracy (sometimes holding tolerances as small as a few tenths of a thousandth of an inch--a few micrometers). A Swiss-style lathe holds the workpiece with both a collet and a guide bushing. The collet sits behind the guide bushing, and the tools sit in front of the guide bushing, holding stationary on the Z axis. To cut lengthwise along the part, the tools will move in and the material itself will move back and forth along the Z axis. This allows all the work to be done on the material near the guide bushing where it is more rigid, making them ideal for working on slender workpieces as the part is held firmly with little chance of deflection or vibration occurring. This style of lathe is commonly used under CNC control. Most CNC Swiss-style lathes today use one or two main spindles plus one or two back spindles (secondary spindles). The main spindle is used with the guide bushing for the main machining operations. The secondary spindle is located behind the part, aligned on the Z axis. In simple operation it picks up the part as it is cut off, and accepts it for second operations, then ejects it into a bin, eliminating the need to have an operator manually change each part, as is often the case with standard CNC turning centers. This makes them very efficient, as these machines are capable of fast cycle times, producing simple parts in one cycle (i.e., no need for a second machine to finish the part with second operations), in as little as 10–15 seconds. This makes them ideal for large production runs of small-diameter parts.  Swiss-style Lathes and Live Tooling  As many Swiss lathes incorporate a secondary spindle, or 'sub-spindle', they also incorporate 'live tooling'. Live tools are rotary cutting tools that are powered by a small motor independently of the spindle motor(s). Live tools increase the intricacy of components that can be manufactured by the Swiss lathe. For instance, automatically producing a part with a hole drilled perpendicular to the main axis (the axis of rotation of the spindles) is very economical with live tooling, and similarly uneconomical if done as a secondary operation after machining by the Swiss lathe is complete. A 'secondary operation' is a machining operation requiring a partially completed part to be secured in a second machine to complete the manufacturing process. Generally, advanced CAD/CAM software uses live tools in addition to the main spindles so that most parts that can be drawn by a CAD system can actually be manufactured by the machines that the CAD/CAM software support. =Combination lathe / 3-in-1 machine= A combination lathe, often known as a 3-in-1 machine, introduces drilling or milling operations into the design of the lathe. These machines have a milling column rising up above the lathe bed, and they utilize the carriage and topslide as the X and Y axes for the milling column. The 3-in-1 name comes from the idea of having a lathe, milling machine, and drill press all in one affordable machine tool. These are exclusive to the hobbyist and MRO markets, as they inevitably involve compromises in size, features, rigidity, and precision in order to remain affordable. Nevertheless, they meet the demand of their niche quite well, and are capable of high accuracy given enough time and skill. They may be found in smaller, non-machine-oriented businesses where the occasional small part must be machined, especially where the exacting tolerances of expensive toolroom machines, besides being unaffordable, would be overkill for the application from an engineering perspective. =Mini-lathe and micro-lathe= Mini-lathes and micro-lathes are miniature versions of a general-purpose center lathe (engine lathe). They typically only handle work of diameter (in other words, radius). They are small and affordable lathes for the home workshop or MRO shop. The same advantages and disadvantages apply to these machines as explained earlier regarding 3-in-1 machines. As found elsewhere in English- language orthography, there is variation in the styling of the prefixes in these machines' names. They are alternately styled as mini lathe, minilathe, and mini-lathe and as micro lathe, microlathe, and micro-lathe. =Brake lathe= A lathe specialized for the task of resurfacing brake drums and discs in automotive or truck garages. =Wheel lathe= Wheel lathes are machines used to manufacture and resurface the wheels of railway cars. When wheels become worn or compromised from excessive use, this tool can be used to re-cut and recondition the wheel of the train car. There are a number of different wheel lathes available including underfloor variations for resurfacing wheels that are still attached to the rail car, portable types that are easily transported for emergency wheel repairs, and CNC versions which utilize computer-based operating systems to complete the wheel repair. =Pit lathe= A lathe for large diameter, though short work, built over a recess in the floor to admit the lower part of the workpiece thus allowing the toolrest to stand at the turner's waist height. An example is on display at the London Science Museum, Kensington. =Vertical lathe= For even larger diameter and heavier work, such as pressure vessels or marine engines, the lathe is rotated so it takes the form of a turntable on which parts are placed. This orientation is less convenient for the operator, but makes it easier to support large parts. In the largest, the turntable is installed flush with the floor, with the headstock recessed below, to facilitate loading and unloading workpieces. Because operator access is less of an issue for them, CNC vertical turning machines are more popular than manual vertical lathes. =Oil country lathe= Specialised lathes for machining long workpieces such as segments of drill strings. Oil country lathes are equipped with large-bore hollow spindles, a second chuck on the opposite side of the headstock, and frequently outboard steadies for supporting long workpieces. Feed mechanisms Various feed mechanisms exist to feed material into a lathe at a defined rate. The aim of these mechanisms is to automate part of the production process with the end goal of improving productivity. = Bar feeder = A bar feeder feeds a single piece of bar stock into the cutting machine. As each part is machined, the cutting tool creates a final cut to separate the part from the bar stock, and the feeder continues to feed the bar for the next part, allowing for continual operation of the machine. There are two types of bar feeds used in lathe machining: Hydrodynamic bar feeds, which rest the bar stock in a series of channels whilst clamping down on the top and bottom of the bar, and hydrostatic bar feeds, which hold the bar stock in a feed tube using pressurized oil. = Bar loader = A bar loader is a variation on the bar feeder concept in that multiple pieces of bar stock may be fed into a hopper, and the loader feeds each piece as necessary.

This is speculative technology that has not been demonstrated in a documented fashion. Natural gills work because nearly all animals with gills are thermoconformers (cold-blooded), so they need much less oxygen than a thermoregulator (warm-blood) of the same size.Why don't people have gills? As a practical matter, therefore, it is unclear that a usable artificial gill could be created because of the large amount of oxygen a human would need extracted from the water. Methods Several potential methods exist for the development of artificial gills. One proposed method is the use of liquid breathing with a membrane oxygenator to solve the problem of carbon dioxide retention, the major limiting factor in liquid breathing. It is thought that a system such as this would allow for diving without risk of decompression sickness. They are generally thought to be unwieldy and bulky, because of the massive amount of water that would have to be processed to extract enough oxygen to supply an active diver, as an alternative to a scuba set. An average diver with a fully closed-circuit rebreather needs 1.5 liters of oxygen per minute while swimming or 0.64 liter per minute while resting. As a result, at least of sea water per minute would have to be passed through the system, and this system would not work in anoxic water. Seawater in tropical regions with abundant plant life contains 5–8 mg of oxygen per liter of water.Fundamentals of Environmental Measurement These calculations are based on the dissolved oxygen content of water.

Biography Yangel was the son of a Russian political prisoner who had been deported to Siberia. Yangel's career started as an aviation engineer, after graduating from Moscow Aviation Institute in 1937. He worked with famous aircraft designers Nikolai Polikarpov and later, Artem Mikoyan. Then he moved to the field of ballistic missiles, where he first was in charge of guidance systems. As Sergei Korolev’s associate, he set up a rocket propulsion centre in Dnipro in Ukraine which later formed the basis of his own OKB-586 design bureau in 1954. At first, Yangel’s facility served to mass-produce and further develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in which area Yangel was a pioneer of storeable hypergolic fuels. His bureau designed the R-12, R-16 and R-36, whose launch vehicle adaptations are known as Cosmos, Tsyklon and Dnepr respectively, which are still in use today. Yangel narrowly avoided death during the development of the R-16 in the 1960 Nedelin catastrophe. Yangel's bureau was part of the Ministry of General Machine Building headed by Sergey Afanasyev. For his outstanding work, Mikhail Yangel was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1960 and USSR State Prize in 1967. He was also awarded four Orders of Lenin, Order of the October Revolution, and numerous medals. He died in Moscow in 1971. Several notable places were named after Yangel: *A street in the Chertanovo neighborhood in Moscow *A Metro station Ulitsa Akademika Yangelya on the Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line (near the above street) *A street in Kiev *One of the two major streets in Baikonur (the other is in honor of his main rival Sergei Korolev) *The crater Yangel on the Moon.

In 2007, Tonedeff was featured on the QN5 released Asterisk: Four, and in 2008 the EP Baby Blue for Pink. During this time he also released two instrumental compilations of beats he produced, Deffinitions Vol. 1 and 2. He also executive produced many QN5 albums, including two critically acclaimed 2010 QN5 records, I F*cking Hate Rappers by PackFM and Robots & Dinosaurs by Kokayi. In the summer of 2011, Tonedeff began another resurgence. Similar to his release of the compilation record Underscore, Tonedeff released Cold.Killed.Collected in order to re-ignite the fan base and hype. The album included 46 total tracks, including interview snippets, some of his most popular collaborations since Archetype, unreleased tracks, and even some new material.http://tonedeff.bandcamp.com/album/cold- killed-collected-2005-2010 Later that summer, Tonedeff and the rest of the QN5 record label participated in the 2011 QN5 Megashow. = 2011–present Polymer and Demon = During 2012, Tonedeff incrementally released information on his next album, Polymer. On August 17 during a Livestream Q&A; with fans, Tonedeff officially revealed his plans for the new album. Polymer will be \\"a best-part composite\\" of four individually released EPs, with the final EP only being available with the fully mixed Polymer record.http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2014/11/tonedeffs_making_an_album_in_four_ep_steps.php This unique approach to releasing his album was influenced by his desire to showcase his versatility in styles and subject matter.http://www.88tillinfinity.com/3829/news-tonedeff-announces-project- polymer/ The first EP was announced to be titled Glutton, which was to be released in late 2012/early 2013. Tonedeff officially released his first of four EPs that make up Polymer, titled Glutton, on February 26, 2013. The album is a very introspective look at parts of Tonedeff's own psyche. These lyrics are partnered with electronic/house/dubstep influenced beats, with production done by Tonedeff and featured production from NumberNin6 and Chew Fu. Becky Cloonan created the cover art for the album. On December 10 of the same year, the second EP of Polymer, Demon, was released. It featured artwork by Becky Cloonan like Glutton. This 5-track EP focused on struggles with concepts like time and anxiety. According to the official description, \\"deals with the pressures and side-effects of anxiety, mortality and time-management over self-produced mid-tempo bounce tracks. Demon tackles an overwhelmed life a dazzling variety of tempos, flows genre-nods, such as the endurance- challenging title-track “Demon\\" in which Tonedeff attacks every 16th note for nearly 2 minutes straight in 6/8-time, tipping his hat at the trappings of modern Trap on \\"Use Me\\" and most notably, fans of Tonedeff's infamous triple- time flow will be delighted as Demon contains the long-awaited recorded version of \\"Crispy\\" where he essentially puts Fast Rap in a body-bag for everyone's benefit.\\"https://tonedeff.bandcamp.com/album/demon-ep The third piece of Polymer, titled Hunter, was released on September 23, 2014. This EP featured the most introspective tracks to date. A DVD documentary about the recording process of the four EPs will be released with the Polymer album. Polymer was officially released on July 8, 2016. Collaborations =Extended F@mm= In 2002, Tonedeff joined with QN5 artists Substantial, PackFM, and Session to form Extended F@mm, which released the album Happy Fuck You Songs. The group described the album as an exercise in \\"conceptual posse cuts\\" with songs ranging from the Tetris-themed \\"Line Drop\\" to bad cell phone connections in \\"Celly\\". Happy Fuck You Songs was well received by critics, garnering positive reviews from underground sites such as Rap Reviews and Urban Smarts. On the success of the Happy Fuck You Songs, Tonedeff made his first appearance in The Source with Extended Famm in 2003 and appeared in a commercial for Hip Hop Week on MTV. He has also been featured in magazines such as Mugshot, Rime and Scratch. On September 24, 2012, PackFM and Tonedeff announced that Extended F@mm would be returning to the studio in 2013 for a new album. They later confirmed that all original members, including Squijee, would make at least an appearance on the new record.http://qn5.com/discuss/viewthread/17281/ The album is currently being written. =Chico & The Man= One of the more long-awaited and anticipated Tonedeff projects is a joint-collaboration with the hip hop producer Kno (of CunninLynguists) titled Chico & The Man.http://abovegroundmagazine.com/news/music-news/album-release- date/09/12/tonedeff-and-cunninlynguistss-kno-announce-collaborative-album- chico-the-man-release-date/ On this project, Kno is expected to handle the entirety of the production duties with Tonedeff to focus on the rapping portions. The first song from the new project released to the public was \\"No Hope (f/ Deacon)\\", which was released on the QN5 Music mixtape Asterisk:Three in 2004. The solemn track is a dedication to a friend of both artists who was murdered in a store robbery in 2004 in Lexington, Kentucky. The duo released their second official song, \\"My Lady\\", on the Asterisk:Four mixtape in March 2007. Kno has said that the album has been pushed back to spring 2010 because of his participation in the CunninLynguists United States tour in late 2009 and because of paperwork for Tonedeff. At the QN5 Megashow 2011, Tonedeff announced that the album would come out on December 13, 2011; he also previewed the first video for the project. On November 5, 2011, Kno announced on the QN5 forum that Chico & the Man would be pushed back to an indefinite date. On December 7, 2019, Kno released a snippet from the Chico & the Man album on his Instagram, hinting at a release date in 2020. =Peter Anthony Red= In 2012, Tonedeff announced his plans for his upcoming projects under the new singer-songwriter moniker Peter Anthony Red. The first song released by Peter Anthony Red was an acoustic version of \\"Water\\", a track which will be released on the full length album. Peter Anthony Red's first official effort, a 5-track EP The Projectionist, was released for free on Bandcamp on June 26, 2012. The release was on a new Tony Rojas label, and sister label of QN5, Quintic. This EP was released as a preview for Peter Anthony Red's first full album, entitled Hyperrealism. In early 2013, Peter Anthony Red made his next appearances, except this time as a director and executive producer for two cover songs by Danish artist Fjer, and her new debut EP, A New Start. =Tacos and Chocolate Milk podcast= On March 7, 2005, Tonedeff's QN5 Music was the first hip hop label to release its own podcast.http://qn5.com/radio/show_01.htm It claims to be the first record label podcast ever, but there is some debate as to if major label Virgin beat them to the punch. The show, called WQN5, featured commentary from label artists Session, PackFM, Substantial and Tonedeff as well as guest appearances by artists like Wordsworth. Tonedeff and PackFM began a new conversational podcast on May 4, 2012, titled Tacos & Chocolate Milk. New episodes are generally released weekly, focusing on the lives of Tonedeff and PackFM, current events, the hip hop industry, and occasionally include special guests/friends such as Kno and Mr. Mecca. Some recurring segments include \\"Yo Pack!\\" and \\"Evil Tony\\". Support behind this endeavor grew very quickly, as Paste Magazine listed the show in their July \\"Ten Best Music Podcasts\\" article, and it was also featured in the iTunes New and Noteworthy section.http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2012/06/ten-great-music- podcasts.html As of Episode #24, the podcast has amassed over one million downloads.

The airline was established by Ewan Wilson and several associates. Wilson served as CEO and was later convicted on four counts of fraud. It was reported in March 2015 that he was looking at restarting an airline, under the name Kiwi Regional Airlines.http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato- times/business/66801770/kiwi-regional-airline-totally-different-to-failed- kiwi-air Charter services The airline began as Kiwi Travel Air Charters in July 1994, operating weekly charters between Hamilton, New Zealand and Brisbane, Australia, using a leased Air Nauru Boeing 737-400. In December 1994, charters were operated to Brisbane, Tonga and Western Samoa. The network was expanded in April 1995 to include Queensland coastal cities, including the Gold Coast, Cairns, Townsville and Rockhampton. The last charter flight was operated on 27 August 1995, following the commencement of scheduled services. Scheduled flights Following the issue of the necessary government permits, Kiwi Travel International Airlines commenced scheduled flights between Hamilton and Sydney using a leased Boeing 727-200 on 23 August 1995. The 727 aircraft was operated on behalf of Kiwi by AvAtlantic of the United States, who also held the air operator's certificate on behalf of the airline. Flights were operated from the New Zealand cities of Hamilton and Dunedin. Due to the short runways at these airports the aircraft could only take on limited fuel due to weight restrictions and needed to land in Auckland and Christchurch respectively to take on more fuel before making the trans-Tasman crossing. The airline offered full economy services as well as no frills \\"Peanuts and Cola\\"-class fares. Competition, route expansion and fleet changes By the end of 1995, Air New Zealand had established Freedom Air via its subsidiary Mount Cook Airline and operated in direct competition with Kiwi, offering the same routes and a similar fare structure. In early 1996, Kiwi replaced its Boeing 727 with a leased Boeing 757 from the UK-based company Air 2000, later replaced by a Boeing 737. Freedom Air also operated a Boeing 737. Kiwi added a second aircraft, an Airbus A320, and expanded its network to include Christchurch and the Australian city of Melbourne. By September 1996, trans- Tasman fares reached historic lows of $199 for return tickets between Melbourne/Christchurch and Melbourne/Hamilton. Both Kiwi and Freedom operated with ad hoc liveries based on those of their lessors; Kiwi used a stylised Kiwi bird, while Freedom Air used a stylised sun. Financial troubles and liquidation Following intense competition with Freedom Air and a series of financial difficulties, Kiwi Travel International Airlines went into voluntary liquidation on 9 September 1996. Passengers on both sides of the Tasman Sea were stranded. In Brisbane, the company's Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 were taken by Airservices Australia in lieu of unpaid aviation fees. They were eventually returned to their owners. Freedom Air ceased operations in March 2008, with its routes being taken over by its parent company, Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand stopped all international flights out of Hamilton and Palmerston North as of mid-April 2009. Flights from Dunedin have been reduced to a seasonal basis.

It had 1886 inhabitants as of 31 December 2017. A large industrial area extending into Saxony and including the site of a large power plant is known by the same name. On 26 May 2006, construction work started on the world's first -free coal power plant in the Schwarze Pumpe industrial district. The plant is based on a concept called carbon capture and storage, which means that carbon emissions will be captured and compressed to th their original volume, liquefying the gas. It will then be forced 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) below the soil into porous rock where it is believed that it will remain for thousands of years without exacerbating global warming. The project, which has cost some 70 million Euros, was funded entirely by the Swedish company Vattenfall AB and went into service on 9 September 2008. The power plant was a pilot project to serve as a prototype for future full-scale power plants.

She achieved fame throughout Latin America, and became known as \\"La Novia de América\\" (\\"The Sweetheart of the Americas\\"). By the time she died in 2000, she had appeared in 65 films (21 filmed in Argentina, 45 in Mexico and one in Spain) and six soap operas, had recorded over 800 songs and had made innumerable theatrical appearances. Biography Libertad Lamarque was born in Rosario, Santa Fe Province, Argentina to Gaudencio Lamarque (1874-1947), an Uruguayan of French descent, and a widow of Spanish origin, Josefa Bouza (1863-1932).Libertad Lamarque (Spanish) She was named Libertad (which means \\"Liberty\\") because at the time of her birth, her father, an anarchist, was imprisoned and pleading for release. =Early career= Libertad Lamarque and other actresses of her time at the Maipo Theater, 1933 At the age of 7, Lamarque won first prize in a stage competition, and participated with a group of street singers that made tours of nearby cities. In 1923, she appeared in her first professional role, the stage show Madre Tierra. Ad for the film ¡Tango! (1933) Her local acclaim convinced her parents that the family should relocate to Buenos Aires, where her chances of a career would be better. The family hung their hopes on a letter of introduction from a local journalist to the owner of the National Theatre, Pascual Carcavallo. It proved successful, as in 1926 Libertad was hired to sing in the choir and given a one-year contract. Her debut was in a play called La muchacha de Montmartre (The Girl from Montmartre) by José A. Saldías, where she sang as part of a trio with Olinda Bozán and Antonia Volpe, to the guitar accompaniment of Rafael Iriarte. Within a couple of months, she had begun singing on Radio Prieto, and was signed for record production with Victor Records, which released her first album, Gaucho Sol, on 26 September 1926, as well as the single Chilenito. In 1929, she began working in Alberto Vaccarezza's, El conventillo de la Paloma (\\"The Tenement of the Dove\\"), which was about the life of a girl Doce Pesos, living in an immigrant tenement house. After two years and 1,000 performances, Lamarque quit the show to focus on her music career. She traveled through several provinces of Argentina and through neighboring Paraguay accompanied by three. In 1930, following this tour she entered a competition held at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, won first prize for her performances of the tangos \\"La cumparsita\\" and \\"Tocaneando\\", and earned the title \\"Queen of Tango\\". She capped this cycle by performing Oscar Straus's Tres valses (Three Waltzes), an adaptation of the operetta, with Chilean singer Choly Mur. Libertad Lamarque and others actors in the film Argentina Ayúdame a vivir (1936). Lamarque in Adiós, Argentina (1930) In the mid-1930s Lamarque was accompanied by a trio of musicians including bandoneon player Héctor María Artola, violinist Antonio Rodio, and pianist, Alfredo Malerba, who would become her second husband. She shone in works that were painful and romantic, such as En esta tarde gris (In this gray afternoon), Sombras, nada más (Shadows, nothing else), Tristezas de la calle Corrientes (Sorrows of Corrientes Street) or Caserón de tejas (Mansion of Tiles), Canción desesperada (Desperate Song) and Sin palabras (Without words). Many of her best songs were by composer Enrique Santos Discepolo because they particularly suited her style. She filmed Adiós, Argentina, which was directed by Italian Mario Parpagnoli in 1929, which was released the following year, and the first Argentine film with sound ¡Tango! in 1932, which resulted in her being the first singer to be recorded for a sound film in Argentina. Lamarque was a light soprano with a vocal range from approximately middle C (C4) to \\"high A\\" (A5). After ¡Tango! 's release in 1933, a string of films followed, including El alma del bandoneon (1935), Ayúdame a vivir (1936), Besos brujos (1937), La ley que olvidaron (1937), Madreselva (1938), Puerta cerrada (1939), Caminito de la gloria (1939), La casa del recuerdo (1940), Cita en la frontera(1940), Una vez en la vida (1941), Yo conocí a esa mujer (1942), En el viejo Buenos Aires (1942), Eclipse de sol (1942), El fin de la noche (1944), La cabalgata del circo (1945) and many more. =Legendary rift with Eva Perón= Eva Perón and Libertad Lamarque in film La cabalgata del circo (1945) Legend has it that Lamarque left Argentina because she had been blacklisted by its First Lady Eva Perón. Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Frasier, authors of Evita: The Real Life of Eva Perón, however, contend this is unlikely. They argue that Lamarque moved to Mexico, where she was adored by the audiences because Mexican cinema was in a better state during the 1940s and 1950s than Argentine cinema. The authors add that Lamarque traveled freely between Argentina and Mexico during the lifetime of Eva Perón and beyond, which does not support the blacklisting legend. Lamarque denied during her lifetime certain aspects of the legend, especially the reports that she had slapped Eva on the set of La cabalgata del circo. In her 1986 autobiography, she flatly denied the allegations and explained that she was simply mortified by Eva's lack of discipline during production of the film. According to Lamarque, Eva refused to take her work seriously and always arrived late or stalled the filming for trivial or personal reasons. Complaints to either the producer or the director produced no result as they were giving Eva preferential treatment as the girlfriend of Juan Perón. By 1946, Eva and Juan Perón were ensconced in the Presidential Palace, rumors circulated that Evita had forbidden radio stations and film studios to play Lamarque's music or hire her, and Lamarque's films, music and publicity in Argentina seemed to have come to an end. =Relocation to Mexico= Poster for the film Cita en la frontera (1940) directed by Mario Soffici. Between January and February 1946, Lamarque appeared in her first tour of Cuba, which was listed as the artistic event of the season. On 7 January, she debuted in the Teatro América with a varied repertoire, but closed the show with \\"Facundo\\" by Cuban composer Eliseo Grenet to much applause. She performed shows daily, sometimes twice a day and on her final performance at Teatro América, 20 January, she held three performances. She performed at Camaguey, Ciego de Avila, Santa Clara, Holguin, and Santiago de Cuba; visited hospitals and schools; and her farewell performance at the Municipal Amphitheatre of Havana was said to have been attended by 20,000 fans. It was on this trip that the Cuban press first dubbed her America's Sweetheart. Just before the Cuban trip, Hollywood had offered Lamarque a seven-year contract but she refused it as she did not speak English and was afraid she would be taken advantage of. Despite her fears of working in the U.S., Lamarque sold out Carnegie Hall for a 1947 performance. When Mexico, on the other hand, offered her a picture deal to appear with legendary Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel, she agreed. and moved to Mexico in 1946. The picture, Gran Casino, co-starring Jorge Negrete was a flop, but other roles followed, such as Soledad (1947), La dama del velo (1948), Huellas de un pasado (1950), Mujeres sin lágrimas (1951), Nunca es tarde para amar (1952), Ansiedad (1952), and Rostros olvidados (1952). Some of her best work during this period was in Otra primavera, filmed in 1949, La loca (1951) and Cuando me vaya (1953); for each of these she was nominated for a Best actress Ariel Award in 1951, 1953, and 1955, respectively. Lamarque during her prime Some of her last movies included Bodas de oro (1955), Amor de sombra (1959), Yo pecador (1959), Rosas blancas para mi hermana negra (1969), with Cuban singer Eusebia Cosme and her last two Argentine films, La sonrisa de mamá (1972) and La mamá de la novia (1978). But as she wound down her movie career, she began touring with music again. In the late 1950s, she did a concert tour with Puerto Rican singer Jesús Quiñones Ledesma and worked in Chile, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and returned to Cuba to do theater and record several albums. She returned to Argentina after Evita's death and was the first person to bring a Spanish version of \\"Hello Dolly\\" to Latin audiences at a 1967 performance at the Teatro Nacional in Buenos Aires, which she also later performed in Mexico in 1968 staged by Manolo Fabregás. In 1982, she starred in the musical revue, Libertad Lamarque, ¿es una mujer de suerte? at the Teatro Lola Membrives in Buenos Aires. She wrote the script, which was adapted by Nicolás Carreras under the musical direction of Oscar Cardozo Ocampo. In 1988, Lamarque participated in the season at Mar del Plata's Teatro Opera with the musical A todo tango II under the direction of José Colángelo. In the 1960s she appeared in several episodes of a television show called \\"Saturday Circular\\" with Nicholas Mancera and in 1961, she filmed Así era mi madre, her only Spanish film. Her first venture into soap operas came in Venezuela, when she was offered a role in Esmeralda in 1972. That was followed by another Venezuelan production called Mamá. Lamarque in 1982 In 1980, she began the first of her Mexican telenovelas, Soledad, followed by her role in Carita de Angel at the age of 91 where she played a Mother superior. Her last role, as la abuela Piedad in La Usurpadora (The Usurper) was in 1998 – two years before her death. Lamarque received an award in 1978 from Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez for her contributions to Latin American culture and in 1980, and shared a Critic's Choice Award with María Félix. In 1985, she received the Konex Platinum Award for Best Tango Singer in Argentina. In 1988, she put her hand prints on the \\"Walk of Fame of the Hermitage Hotel\\". In 1989, she was honored at the Festival of San Sebastian, Spain, for her film achievements and was recognized by the Caesar Awards given by the Association of American theater to Latin American artists in Los Angeles. That same year, a tile bearing her name placed in the \\"Sidewalk of Latin Stars\\" in Miami and a tribute was held for her at the Autumn Festival of Paris. She was appointed \\"Illustrious citizen of the city of Buenos Aires\\" in 1990 and on 15 November 1991, a few days before her birthday, the Municipal Council of Rosario granted her a similar distinction. Lamarque was honored in 1993 by Celebrando Magazine, a Spanish-language publication which is nationally distributed in the U.S., for her 70 years in film, theater and music and her philanthropy. In 1998, she was appointed as Honorary Cultural Advisor and designated as a Cultural Legend in Buenos Aires. =Last years and death= Libertad Lamarque and her helper, Irene López Luque, on November 24 of 2000. In 1996 Libertad moved to the United States and settled in her Coral Gables home in Miami, Florida. She often flew to Mexico City and Buenos Aires to attend her professional appointments as well.

She died aged 92 on 12 December 2000 in Mexico City, Mexico from pneumonia. Her only daughter, Mirtha Libertad Lamarque Romero Deluca, died in 19 October 2014, aged 86. =Personal life= In 1926, Lamarque married Emilio Romero and had a daughter, Mirtha, with him before divorcing in 1945. Divorce was not possible at that time in Argentina and although the marriage was quickly over, it took 12 years to officially be ended. In 1935, she suffered several personal crises which led to a suicide attempt in Chile. She attempted to throw herself out of a hotel window, but an awning broke her fall. Shortly thereafter, her estranged husband kidnapped their daughter and took Mirtha to Uruguay. A group of friends, including Alfredo Malerba, and her attorney were able to help her regain custody. Lamarque's second husband was Alfredo Malerba, with whom she was married for nearly 50 years, until his death.

Prunus maritima is a deciduous shrub, in its natural sand dune habitat growing 1–2 m (40–80 inches) high, although it can grow larger, up to 4 m (160 inches or over 13 feet) tall, when cultivated in gardens. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, 3–7 cm (1.2–2.8 inches) long and 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 inches) broad, with a sharply toothed margin. They are green on top and pale below, becoming showy red or orange in the autumn. The flowers are 1–1.5 cm (0.4–0.6 inches) in diameter, with five white petals and large yellow anthers. The fruit is an edible drupe 1.5–2 cm (0.6–0.8 inches) in diameter in the wild plant, red, yellow, blue, or nearly black.Maine Department of Conservation Natural Areas Program: Prunus maritima (pdf file) Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . A plant with rounded leaves, of which only a single specimen has ever been found in the wild, has been described as Prunus maritima var. gravesii (Small) G.J.Anderson,Center for Plant Conservation: Prunus maritima var. gravesii though its taxonomic status is questionable, and it may be better considered a cultivar Prunus maritima 'Gravesii'.University of Connecticut: Prunus maritima 'Gravesii' The original plant, found in Connecticut, died in the wild in about 2000, but it is maintained in cultivation from rooted cuttings. The plant is salt-tolerant and cold-hardy. It prefers the full sun and well- drained soil. It spreads roots by putting out suckers but in coarse soil puts down a tap root. In dunes it is often partly buried in drifting sand. It blooms in mid-May and June. The fruit ripens in August and early September. The species is endangered in Maine, where it is in serious decline due to commercial development of its beach habitats. Cultivation and uses The species is grown commercially to make jam.Cornell University Department of Horticulture: Beach Plum Although it is bitter or sour it can be eaten out of hand. Beach plums are much smaller in size when compared to the longer cultivated Asian varieties found in the supermarket. A number of cultivars have been selected for larger and better flavored fruit, including Resigno, Eastham, Hancock and Squibnocket.University of Connecticut: Prunus maritima Natali Vineyards in Goshen, New Jersey produces a wine from beach plums.Preston, Marjorie. \\"To save coastal dunes, here’s a plum good idea\\" in Shore News Today (20 October 2010).

The parish church and Wallsworth Hall are Grade II* listed buildings. The River Severn is the border between Sandhurst and the neighbouring parish of Maisemore. The Severn Way long distance footpath follows the river on the eastern (Sandhurst) bank. There are only two roads out of Sandhurst, one towards Gloucester, and another towards Tewkesbury. As a result, the village is regularly used as a bypass by drivers hoping to avoid traffic along the A38.  History  = WWII bomb = In September 1998, an unexploded World War II German bomb was detonated by bomb disposal experts. The bomb had laid undiscovered for almost 57 years, but when the local parish council announced plans to build a children’s play area on the allotment site, local resident Tom Jones remembered a bomb falling on the site but never exploding. His fears led to a survey and the discovery of a 500 lb bomb embedded vertically into rock more than three metres below the surface of the ground. Initial letters were met with scepticism after an April fool's mail shot hoax, until the nature of the bomb was confirmed. Every home within a 500-metre radius was evacuated, and Jones himself had the pleasure of pushing the button. After the incident, the clerk to the local parish council at the time was criticised for sending a letter to the German embassy asking them if they would like to make a donation to help fund the construction of the play area. Although the German embassy sent a letter of support, no donation was made. = CSG = In October 2000 a chemical plant owned and run by CSG (Cleansing Service Group) was devastated by a series of explosions and a fire. Although the exact causes have never been determined, it is believed that incorrectly stored chemicals were to blame. On top of this, before the site could be cleaned up, the area was flooded, and the chemicals washed into many of the nearby houses. For many years the villagers of Sandhurst, and the nearby village of Maisemore, had been complaining of the smells coming from the plant, and this incident was the final straw. After a heated public meeting involving Ken Pee, the managing director of CSG, the company was taken to court and fined £250,000 plus £400,000 costs. The site has now been sold to Ronsons Reclamation. = 2007 summer floods = The village was essentially an island for several days in late July, the only way in or out was via boat or tractor. Water supplies were down for two weeks and the power supply was unreliable. = Abloads Court = Originally Ablodes Court, meaning the Abbots Lode Court. \\"The Abbots crossing for the River Seven\\", a property and site with a history dating back to the 13th century. During the 15th to 17th centuries, this area and what forms a large part of Sandhurst was known as the hamlet of Ablodes. There are many early historical references to the site held by the National Archives. It is now a private home and grounds owned by a publisher and children’s writer.

A window or opening high up on an outside wall supports a hoist above doors on the floors below. The original term refers to a dormer window, usually set into the middle of a roof although it can also apply to a facade lucarne, where the gable of the lucarne is aligned with the face of the wall. This general meaning is also preserved in British use, particularly for small windows into unoccupied attic or spire spaces. Nikolaus Pevsner gives its meaning as \\"a small gabled opening in a roof or a spire\\". alt=An early warehouse building, with loading doorways on three floors and a simple lucarne above formed merely by the roof projecting beyond the wall and supporting a single pulley The simplest lucarne is no more than the extension of a roof beyond a gable wall, with a ridge timber strong enough to support a hoist. A gin wheel on this beam can provide a simple rope hoist, sufficient to lift a sack of grain. Any greater weights than this are likely to need either a pulley block with multiple advantage, or a geared chain hoist. Some lucarnes are enclosed, and are often wooden-clad structures cantilevered out from the wall. For strength though, the hoist is often carried by a steel girder or reinforced concrete structure. These enclosed lucarnes may act as a loading dock for that floor, with a trapdoor beneath, or they may be simply weather housings for a hoist serving the floors beneath. They are commonly a small housing high in the eaves, above the main working floors. Redcliffe Wharf in Bristolalt=A large and complex reinforced concrete building with brick facing. Three large two-storey lucarnes in bare concrete extend from the wall above the harbour wharf. Mills may only require loading to a single floor, but warehouses will require access from each floor. Each hoist accesses all of the floors beneath it, through their prominent doors. These doors often provide a modern indication of an old warehouse building's original purpose. These doors sometimes have an iron fold-down flap outside them, as a short loading step, giving clearance for the hoist away from the wall. Some large examples are multi-storey. Where multiple vehicles could be alongside a building at once, there could be multiple closely spaced lucarnes in use simultaneously.

A gap is visible in the parapet above the column of loading doorways, where a lucarne has been removed. The doorways also have hinged iron flaps, restrained by chains, as loading extensions.

The lucarne is now superfluous and may be either preserved as a decorative feature, or (often for wooden examples in poor condition) removed. Some remain in a vestigial form, where they must still complete a roof, but the structure below has gone.

He rejected existing racial typologies that identified Mediterranean peoples as \\"dark whites\\" because they implied a Nordicist conception of Mediterranean peoples descending from whites who had become racially mixed with non-whites which he claimed was false. His concept of the Mediterranean race, identified Mediterranean peoples as being an autonomous brunet race and he claimed that the Nordic race was descended from the Mediterranean race whose skin had depigmented to a pale complexion after it moved north. This concept became important to the modelling of racial difference in the early twentieth century.  Life  Born in Messina, Sicily, Sergi first studied law and then linguistics and philosophy. At the age of 19 he took part in Garibaldi's expedition to Sicily.Obituary Nature 139, 495-496 (20 March 1937) He later took courses in physics and anatomy, finally specializing in racial anthropology as a student of Cesare Lombroso. In 1880 he was appointed as professor of anthropology at the University of Bologna. At this time the discipline of anthropology was still associated with the literature faculty. In the following years, thanks to the activity of his laboratory of anthropology and psychology, he helped establish the discipline on a more scientific basis. In 1884 he moved to the University of Rome where he developed a program of research into both anthropology and psychology. On 4 June 1893, the Sergi took the lead in founding the Roman Society of Anthropology (now the Italian Anthropological Institute (Istituto Italiano di Antropologia).Istituto Italiano di Antropologia.Aaron Gillette, Racial Theories in Fascist Italy, Routledge, 2002, pp.30-32 He also began the journal Atti della Società Romana di Antropologia (now the Journal of Anthropological Sciences). Both the society and journal were associated with the University. He was initially assigned temporary premises in the School of Application for Engineers in San Pietro in Vincoli but in 1887 moved to the old building of the Roman College, where Sergi dedicated part of the space to the creation of an anthropological museum. Internationally renowned for his contributions to anthropology, he also succeeded in establishing the International Conference of Psychology in Rome, 1905, under his presidency of the Society. He died at Rome in 1936. His son Sergio Sergi (1878–1972), also a noted anthropologist, developed his father's theories. Racial theories Sergi's initial contribution was to oppose the use of the cephalic index to model population ancestry, arguing that over all cranial morphology was more useful. However, Sergi's major theoretical achievement was his model of human ancestry, fully articulated in his books Human Variation (Varietà umane. Principio e metodo di classificazione) and The Mediterranean Race (1901), in which he argued that the earliest European peoples arose from original populations in the Horn of Africa, and were related to Hamitic peoples. This primal \\"Eurafrican race\\" split into three main groups, the Hamites, the Mediterranean race and the north European Nordic race. Semitic people were closely related to Mediterraneans but constituted a distinct \\"Afroasian\\" group. The four great branches of the Mediterranean stock were the Libyans or Berbers, the Ligurians, the Pelasgians and the Iberians. Ancient Egyptians were considered by Sergi as a branch of the Hamitic race. According to Sergi the Mediterranean race, the \\"greatest race in the world\\", was responsible for the great civilisations of ancient times, including those of Egypt, Carthage, Greece and Rome. These Mediterranean peoples were quite distinct from the peoples of northern Europe. Sergi argued that the Mediterraneans were more creative and imaginative than other peoples, which explained their ancient cultural and intellectual achievements, but that they were by nature volatile and unstable. In his book The Decline of the Latin Nations he argued that Northern Europeans had developed stoicism, tenacity and self-discipline due to the cold climate, and so were better adapted to succeed in modern civic cultures and economies. =Anti-Nordicism= These theories were developed in opposition to Nordicism, the claim that the Nordic race was of pure Aryan stock and naturally superior to other Europeans. Sergi ridiculed Nordicists who claimed that the leaders of ancient Greek and Roman civilization were Germanic in origin and argued that the Germanic invasions at the end of the Roman empire had produced \\"delinquency, vagabondage and ferocity\\". Sergi believed that the Aryans were originally \\"Eurasiatic\\" barbarians who migrated from the Hindu Kush into Europe. He argued that the Italians had originally spoken a Hamitic language before the Aryan (Indo-European) Italic language spread across the country. Some Aryan influence was detectable in Northern Italy, but, racially speaking, southern Italians were unaffected by Aryan migrants. Sergi expanded on these theories in later publications. Despite his denigration of Aryans and emphasis on Mediterranean racial identity, he denied that he was motivated by national pride, asserting that his works had the \\"goal of establishing the veracity of the facts without racial prejudice, without diminishing the value of one human type in order to exalt another one.\\" His last book, The Britons (1936) sought to trace the rise of the British Empire to the Mediterranean component of the British population. Theory of emotions Giuseppe Sergi, concurrent with William James and Carl Lange (the three independently), developed a theory of emotionsGiuseppe Sergi, (1858) L'origine dei fenomeni psichici e loro significazione biologica, , Milano, Fratelli DumolardGiuseppe Sergi, (1894) Principi di Psicologie: Dolore e Piacere; Storia Naturale dei Sentimenti\\", , Milano, Fratelli Dumolard according to which emotion is the mind's perception of physiological conditions that result from some stimulus.

The film stars Padmini, Raj Kapoor and Pran in lead roles. This was the first directorial venture of Karmakar, who had previously been cinematographer for many of Kapoor's films. The film was the last B&W; movie of Raj Kapoor. It was declared a \\"hit\\" at Box Office India. The team of Shankar Jaikishan composed the songs, lyrics by Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri, including \\"O Basanti Pawan Pagal\\", \\"Aa Ab Laut Chalen\\", and \\"Hothon Pe Sacchai Rehti Hai\\". The outdoor shooting with the marble rock background is done in Bhedaghat in Madhya Pradesh. Plot Raju (Raj Kapoor) is a poor, friendly orphan who wins his bread by singing songs. One day, he sees an injured man and helps him. Later, he is kidnapped by a few bandits who mistake him to be an undercover policeman. It then turns out that the injured man he helped is the leader (Sardar) of this gang. The Sardar takes good care of Raju and treats him with honour. Sardar's daughter Kammo (Padmini) falls in love with Raju. Kammo and Sardar convince Raju that they are good bandits who are making sure that wealth is equally distributed amongst people. On one of the lootings, Raju witnesses the murder of a newlywed couple. He decides to go to the police and leaves the gang. One of the bandits, Raka (Pran), kills the Sardar and takes over; he wishes to forcibly wed Kammo. When Raju tells all the truth to the police, they decide to confront and kill the bandits. Raj begs the police to not kill them but is shunned. Raju is then posed in a dilemma of what to do and finds himself helpless when he sees police stooping just as low to stop crime. This movie was inspired by initiatives of Vinoba Bhave And Jai Prakash Narayan, on their call, hundreds of dacoits surrendered to police and mainstreamed to the society at large.

The 100,000-watt station was also simulcasted on 105.5 WSRJ Honor/Traverse City. Throughout most of its operational life, it was best known as a CHR/Top 40-formatted station known as WKPK (\\"The Peak\\"). As owner Northern Broadcast is moving to sell all their stations , the transmitter on 106.7 was turned off sometime during December 2019. A sale of the station was announced in March 2020. History The station began in 1972 as WWRM \\"Warm 107\\", airing primarily beautiful music, evolving in 1977 into an easy listening format with a mixture of \\"B/EZ\\" instrumentals and vocal adult contemporary hits. The station was the brainchild of John DeGroot and Glen Catt, the founder of the Glen's Markets supermarket chain. The station's first studio was located on the second floor of the Glen's Market in Gaylord. DeGroot bought Catt out, however, and in 1984 he switched the format and changed the call letters from WWRM to WKPK in an attempt to go head-on with the highly successful WKHQ. The new station called itself \\"107 The Peak\\" (later modified to \\"106.7 The Peak\\" to reflect the increasing prevalence of radios with digital readout). Throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s, KHQ and The Peak would butt heads in the ratings, mainly due to the two being so close to each other on the dial. By the early 1990s, KHQ was the more-adult station while The Peak, with several countdown shows daily and \\"Peak It Or Plunge It\\", a voting show, was the hit for the younger crowd. The Peak frequently also played both alternative-rock and rhythmic tracks that few other CHR stations, even in major markets, would touch, while WKHQ stuck to the proven mainstream hits and played rap hits at night if at all. One memorable liner from this period stated, \\"If you stop at '106' [referring to the rounded-up dial position of WKHQ, then as now at 105.9 on the FM dial], you haven't reached 'The Peak.' The difference is .7.\\" During the 90s, there was a repeater for the station in Alpena at 102.3FM, that had no on air identifier other than the legal ID ending with \\"...and 102.3 Alpena.\\" In 1996, DeGroot retired from broadcasting and sold The Peak to Northern Broadcasting, the North Dakotan owners of AOR-formatted WKLT and what is now Classic Hits Music Radio The Fox FM. The ownership change allowed the station, to invest in new equipment, including a new studio. New automation equipment allowed the station to run 24/7 without the need of a night disc jockey, which stood in contrast to the operations of the early 1990s when the station would sign-off at 1 a.m. and return to the air at 5 a.m. The music mix also changed slightly, as The Peak became a somewhat more conventional and more mainstream CHR station, though still playing more rhythmic material and being faster on new music than WKHQ. Despite excellent ratings and the battle with 106 KHQ still in swing, the station's Grand Rapids-based management decided in 2000 to make the station Hot AC, dumping most of their rap/hip-hop tracks. In 2004, the station became a full-blown AC with the demise of heritage AC WLDR. The numerous changes to the music alienated listeners, and many continued to call The Peak \\"the rap station\\" even though they hadn't played a rap record in years. As a result, the station's Arbitron ratings tanked, and the station crashed to a 0.7 by 2009. Crew The Peak, being in the mid-sized Traverse City-Gaylord-Petoskey radio market, has seen both big market DJs in need of a gig and DJs just starting out. The station's alumni include Brent Carey (went on to WDRQ & WDVD Detroit, and PD of WIOG Saginaw, WTWR-FM Toledo, and KCIX/KXLT in Boise, ID), McConnell \\"Man @ Large\\" Adams (went on to WIOG, WDRQ, KKDA/K-104 (APD/Nights)Dallas Texas, My 103.9 and Wild 96.3 in Ft.

Jason Young hosted afternoons in mid to late 1990s and is now the morning show host(Racin Jacin)on northern Michigan's heritage rocker, WKLT. Changes In late Summer 2005, The Peak changed its call letters to WSRT, which stands for \\"Soft Rock and Talk\\". Northern Radio also consolidated their operations, moving the station from its long-time home in a converted Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses to their Traverse City studios. All the local jocks the station has are now based in the Traverse City area. When the station flipped to AC, they also trimmed their airstaff since mornings and nights/overnights were all satellite-fed by Bob and Sheri and Delilah respectively. In early 2007, the station dropped Bob and Sheri due to poor ratings. The station's current morning show (\\"Mary in the Morning\\") is hosted by local businesswoman Mary Rogers, who aims her morning show towards fellow businesswomen. WSRJ moved from 100.7 to its new frequency of 105.5 in September 2007. This frequency change fueled speculation that the WSRT/WSRJ simulcast would return to CHR, creating a \\"KHQ sandwich\\". However, the format remained AC, although the music mix began to skew back toward Hot AC in the fall of 2009, with the station beginning to identify with \\"Today's Best Hits\\" (the same slogan used by competing station 92.9 WJZQ \\"Z93\\"). WSRT/WSRJ rebranded as \\"106.7 YOU-FM\\" in early October 2008. Despite the move back toward a Hot AC direction, the station's basic setup remained in place, with Mary Rogers as morning host and Delilah at night. On May 3, 2010, WSRT/WSRJ switched from Adult Contemporary to a talk radio format becoming the first commercial FM talk station in Northern Michigan. The lineup includes local talk show “Mary in the Morning, Dial Global’s Stephanie Miller, Dave Ramsey, Dr. Laura Schlessinger and Talk Radio Network’s Jerry Doyle. In August 2012, the pair of stations flipped to sports talk, using programming from ESPN Radio. In addition to national programming and sports play-by-play, WSRT/WSRJ carries high school sports from around Northern Michigan, including four hours of coverage on Friday nights.

Biography In 1851 he made his debut at the Paris Salon and, while he tried to stay in the mainstream, his art was heralded by those who were looking for a change to more realism. In 1852 he married Marie-Isaure (d. 1860), the daughter of the director of the Brussels Observatory, and moved to Antwerp where he lived from 1852 to 1856; it was during this period that his fortunes began to improve. In 1856 he and his family moved to Brussels where he became a prolific artist, specializing in scenes along the Scheldt. He exhibited a number of works at the Exposition Universelelle of 1867 and the critic Burger-Thoré described him as one of the greatest marine painters of the time. In 1868 he became a member of the Société Libre des Beaux-Arts, a society founded on 1 March 1868 to help promote the works of artists who were interested in their individual interpretations of nature. He was a frequent exhibitor at the many exhibition halls in Europe and exhibited many pieces at the Paris Salon.  Overview of his work Belgian and French warships during the Rio Nuñez Incident by Paul Jean Clays He was one of the most esteemed marine painters of his time, and early in his career he substituted a sincere study of nature for the extravagant and artificial conventionality of most of his predecessors. He painted the peaceful life of rivers, the poetry of wide estuaries, the regulated stir of roadsteads and ports. And while he thus broke away from old traditions he also threw off the trammels imposed on him by his master, the marine painter Théodore Gudin (1802–1880). Endeavouring only to give truthful expression to the nature that delighted his eyes, he sought to render the limpid salt atmosphere, the weight of waters, the transparency of moist horizons, the gem-like sparkle of the sky. A Fleming in his feeling for colour, he set his palette with clean strong hues, and their powerful harmonies were in striking contrast with the rusty, smoky tones then in favour. If he was not a \\"luminist\\" in the modern use of the word, he deserves at any rate to be classed with the founders of the modern naturalistic school. This conscientious and healthy interpretation, to which the artist remained faithful, without any important change, to the end of an unusually long and laborious career, attracted those minds which aspired to be bold, and won over those which were moderate. Clays soon took his place among the most famous Belgian painters of his generation, and his pictures, sold at high prices, are to be seen in most public and private galleries.  Works  We may mention, among others, The Beach at Ault, Boats in a Dutch Port, and Dutch Boats in the Flushing Roads, the last in the National Gallery, London. In the Brussels gallery are The Port of Antwerp, Coast near Ostend, and a Calm on the Scheldt; in the Antwerp museum, The Meuse at Dordrecht; in the Pinakothek at Munich, The Open North Sea; in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, The Festival of the Freedom of the Scheldt at Antwerp in 1863; in the palace of the king of the Belgians, Arrival of Queen Victoria at Ostend in 1857; in the Bruges academy, Port of Feirugudo, Portugal. Clays was a member of several Academies, Belgian and foreign, and of the Order of Leopold (Belgium), the Legion of Honour, etc. See Camille Lemonnier, Histoire des Beaux-Arts (Brussels, 1887).

It depends of the Secretaría de Inteligencia, the main intelligence agency; and it is a depending suborganization of the National Intelligence System. History The School was created on January 24, 1967 by Executive Decree N° 17/1967. It was initially established in the fifth floor of a traditional building located on Diagonal Norte and San Martín avenues in Buenos Aires. On June 5th of that same year it instructed its first class to personnel of the Secretariat of Intelligence. In 1982, the school moved to the building on Ave. Libertad 1235, where it remains today. Since 1992, it has established students exchange with foreign countries, strengthening the links with many foreign intelligence agencies. Organization =Mission= Its mission is recruitment and instruction of Secretariat of Intelligence's personnel, with a specialized technical and humanistic formation, the analysis and study of the national intelligence doctrine and providing of online courses and long-distance teaching for agents who belong to the Secretariat and other Argentine intelligence or security organization. ENI graduates receive a title and diploma certified by the National University of La Plata, Buenos Aires. =Facilities= The School's main building, a big belle époque academic-style mansion, is located on Calle Libertad 1235 in Buenos Aires. Estimated to be worth about US$724,178, it was built in 1922 and a parking lot was added in 1970. It has small rooms and wooden floors, a street surface of 2,515 m2 and an internal surface of 3,775 m2. The ENI mansion is protected by a 5-tonne steel gate and a constant surveillance through a closed circuit television (CCTV) system that records all activity around the building. The School also has a library of 7,000 volumes, and through its webpage it offers online courses to all regions and provinces of Argentina. =Director= Mrs. Silvia Beatriz Cucovaz de Arroche is the current director; having a geographical sciences degree, is considered a highly experienced and valuable woman with a long history in the Secretaría de Inteligencia. Mrs. Cucovaz was also a professor at the Faculty of History and the Geographical Sciences School of the University of Salvador, at the Faculty of Business of the University of Buenos Aires, and at the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Mar de la Plata. Her previous jobs in SIDE included being the intelligence delegate in the Argentine Embassy in Germany (Bonn), the Director of Foreign Intelligence, the Chief of Strategic Affairs, the Advisor of the Secretary of Intelligence, and an ENI professor. She has participated in many conferences of international organizations, most notoriously serving as Chairman of arms and explosives experts at the United Nations disarmament area. In Argentina, she is also Counselor of the Council of International Relations (CARI) and member of its International Security Committee. Cucovaz wrote many dossiers and books such as \\"El rol de los servicios de Icia en el campo de la contraproliferación\\" and \\"Croatia as a stabilizing factor for peace in Europe; proceedings from an International Symposium\\". =Seal= The ENI seal (Escudo) is a Spanish-style coat of arms, composed of a chess board, symbol of strategy; a triangle, representing straightness; and a fox, which signifies the force of intelligence. The white colour represents the virtues of obedience and firmness; the black represents honesty; and the green symbolizes an oath to service. The ENI motto appears in Latin words: \\"De Omni Re Scibili\\", which means \\"From every knowable thing\\". =Staff and materials= During the 1960s, teachers in the ENI were mainly retired military officials who specialized in the intelligence service, or exceptionally, in the infantry branch. The materials taught were completely written in Argentina, usually by the military. =Recruitment and training= Citizens recruited for SIDE (see SIDE's recruitment procedures), are expected to go through the ENI's screening and training program before becoming a part of the organization. During the 1960s, basic courses included specific material that no agents hoping to pass could fail. Teachers taught normal subjects on the matter of espionage, such as abilities opening any kind of lock they could encounter using very basic tools. The basic curriculum included photography, distant following of subjects, infiltration, and even lip reading. Establishing a well known method used by the CIA and other intelligence agencies, agents who passed all their exams could move on to the final steps of their training, which included shooting practice, weapons handling, and personal defense. Students in the ENI, are not only taught basic theories, skills and techniques about intelligence and SIDE, but also the development of \\"instinct.\\" During \\"class\\", there are several \\"immediate reaction\\" tests. For example, these tests can be hidden in a simple routine, such as making students do a simple task, like working with a document. When the students least expects it, a simulation of a small fire break out begins, which helps evaluate students' response capabilities under spontaneous and stressful situations. Students must be fully aware and attentive to their teachers and the material being taught. Being attentive means remembering and analyzing any detail that could alter the routine of the classroom, such as a phone call received by a professor on their cellphone, or if the professor suddenly coughs. After the bell rings, without notice, students are usually interrogated about the previous circumstances, therefore evaluating a number of \\"correct answers\\". That is, seeing how attentive to details they were, and their capabilities to remember, analyze, and discern many kinds of information, acts, things said, etc. The second level of teaching is not reachable without first passing a whole set of psychological and physical examinations. Afterwards, the program becomes more complex, meaning that the assignments become more technical, with subjects like Electronic Intelligence, where students are submerged into the art of phone tapping and the other uses of electronics in the intelligence world. If a student gets good grades, they can become a part of SIDE. =Magazine= SIDE publishes every three months a magazine called \\"La Revista de la Escuela Nacional de Inteligencia\\" (\\"The Magazine of the National Intelligence School\\") about the studies and works of Argentines and foreigners on the subject of intelligence. Sofía Fijman incident Sofía Fijman was a 75-year-old, middle-class, Argentine woman who fed cats that inhabited the garden of the ENI building. On February 26th of 1998, she was killed by Ricardo Dáttoli (a SIDE agent who was in charge of the ENI's security) who closed the 5-tonne steel gate while she was feeding the cats through it. Fijman's hand became trapped in the gate, subsequently dragging her and causing a fatal injury to her head. Allegations by Fijman's domestic employee state that Dáttoli told her \\"We are going to kill you, and the cats\\", as he warned her not to feed the cats anymore. Ricardo Dáttoli, an agent who got paid 1,700 Argentine Pesos (US$1,700 at that time) for working six days a month doing a 36-hour surveillance shift and then resting for five days, claimed that he activated the door opening mechanism (when no car was going in or out, and Fijman was feeding the cats) because he fell and accidentally pushed the switch. He described the incident stating that he fell and accidentally activated the mechanism because his shoe laces were untied. When Dáttoli activated the gates to open, and trapped Fijman's hand by doing so, an Australian tourist couple was passing by Libertad Avenue. The man tried to stop the gate, he uses physical force and calls for help, but finally the gate overpowers him and kills the woman. During that time, Dáttoli did not activate the button to make the gate close and free the woman, even though there was a button for it. Even though Dáttoli could see what was happening through the video surveillance system, he did not do anything to avoid further damage to Fijman. The judicial investigation stated that the video of the incident has \\"edited parts\\", and that the part where Fijman receives the fatal wound has been erased. Since the incident, the ENI moved all its guards to other units or facilities and has changed its gate mechanism to a manual opening and closing procedure rather than a fully automatic one. The investigation reported that 8 cameras and 16 monitors were focused on the ENI's entrance. Dáttoli and his accomplices were watching from the inside of the Mansion, and did nothing to stop the incident. Dáttoli has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for premeditated murder.

In 1929, the Company President, Lord Stamp read a paper Scientific Research in Transport to the Institute of Transport, and, in 1930 he founded the Advisory Committee on Scientific Research for Railways. The Scientific Research Laboratory was formed by the Vice-President and Director of Scientific Research, Sir Harold Hartley. Purpose-built accommodation was provided on the west side of London Road, Derby which opened in December 1935. The various paint and varnish laboratories were amalgamated and brought there, joining the textile research from Calvert Street and the metallurgy and general engineering research in the locomotive works. In addition the laboratory liaised with various university departments, its remit covering all areas of railway operation. In 1936 an aerodynamics laboratory was formed, located in the locomotive works, using 1/24 scale models. It was involved in the design work for Stanier's Coronation locomotives, and went on to assess smoke deflectors, carriage ventilation and the effect of passing trains on structures and passengers in stations. This passed to the Derby College of Technology in 1960. The Rugby Testing Station was opened in 1948 as a joint venture with the LNER. Work continued into the nationalised era, when a decision was made to concentrate various headquarters functions, particularly that of the Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineer, in one national centre. This produced the Railway Technical Centre (RTC) on the opposite side of London Road, on a site which had formerly been part of the Way and Works sidings. Part of the RTC would be occupied by a new British Rail Research Division, reporting directly to the Board, under the Chief Civil Engineer's Department. This went on, in addition to its other work into all aspects of the railway, to design the experimental version of the Advanced Passenger Train (APT-E). The Scientific Research Laboratory was renamed Hartley House, and formed the Scientific Services department of the Research Division. Later, after British Rail privatisation and the sale of the Research Division to AEA Technology, the Scientific Services department was separately privatised to form the company \\"Scientifics Ltd\\".

Because of the uncertainty principle, an event in particle physics does not have quite the same meaning as it does in the theory of relativity, in which an \\"event\\" is a point in spacetime which can be known exactly, i.e. a spacetime coordinate. Overview In a typical particle physics event, the incoming particles are scattered or destroyed, and up to hundreds of particles can be produced, although few are likely to be new particles not discovered before. In the old bubble chambers and cloud chambers, \\"events\\" could be seen by observing charged particle tracks emerging from the region of the event before they curl due to the magnetic field through the chamber acting on the particles. At modern particle accelerators, events are the result of the interactions which occur from a beam crossing inside a particle detector. Physical quantities used to analyze events include the differential cross section, the flux of the beams (which in turn depends on the number density of the particles in the beam and their average velocity), and the rate and luminosity of the experiment. Individual particle physics events are modeled by scattering theory based on an underlying quantum field theory of the particles and their interactions. The S-matrix is used to characterize the probability of various event outgoing particle states given the incoming particle states. For suitable quantum field theories, the S-matrix may be calculated by a perturbative expansion in terms of Feynman diagrams. Events occur naturally in astrophysics and geophysics, such as subatomic particle showers produced from cosmic ray scattering events.

Breakthrough offers high-potential, under-served middle school students the opportunity to participate in rigorous academic enrichment programs throughout the summer and school year. Students make a commitment to participate in the program through middle school and high school and in turn, Breakthrough provides many services to students and their families, ranging from academic enrichment to one-on-one tutoring to high school and college preparation. Additionally, all Breakthrough classes are taught by talented, high-achieving high school and college students from around the country who are interested in the field of education. Through the teacher development program offered by Breakthrough, these young educators become potential candidates for professional teaching and educational leadership positions after college. Teaching at Breakthrough has been named a Top Ten Internship in America by the Princeton Review, as well as other prestigious national organizations, and a 1999 Stanford University report stated that \\"72% [of Breakthrough teachers] went on to work in other educationally related careers or internships after teaching at a Breakthrough site.\\" Breakthrough was founded in 1978 by Lois Loofbourrow at San Francisco University High School. Since then, numerous sites have opened, all in various sized urban areas. The sites are joined together under the umbrella organization, Breakthrough Collaborative, based in San Francisco. Sites function either through public-private partnerships with an independent educational institution or maintain their own 501(c)3 status. Since its inception in 1978, Breakthrough programs around the world have generated thousands of student and teacher alums. In 2003, the Summerbridge/Breakthrough Alumni Network or SBAN was formed through the efforts of alumni. SBAN is based out of Atlanta, but holds annual conferences around the United States. In March 2006, the 22 host schools of Breakthrough programs were awarded the Klingenstein Leadership Award by the Klingenstein Center at Teachers College, Columbia University. Breaking from the tradition of giving this prestigious award to an individual, 26 independent schools received the 2006 award. Past recipients include William Durden, Diane Ravitch, Robert Coles, and Howard Gardner. In 2007, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Summer Learning awarded Breakthrough Collaborative and its affiliate site in Pittsburgh, with the Excellence in Summer Learning Award for exemplary mission, performance, and infrastructure in out-of-school academic support. Breakthrough at Hong Kong is called Summerbridge Hong Kong. Summerbridge Hong Kong is the only site outside of the United States. A key difference is that at Summerbridge Hong Kong, teachers teach self-designed topics with support from the Dean of Faculty. A typical day for a Summerbridge Hong Kong student consists of morning all-school meeting (ASM), classes in the morning, lunch with teachers, and extracurricular time.

Life He was born in Baltimore, Maryland to George W. Sleeper and Georgianna Sleeper (née Clarke), and was educated for the law. In his boyhood he was a schoolmate of Edwin Booth who was born in the same year as he, and with whom he engaged in amateur dramatic readings as members of the Baltimore Thespian Club. He made his first appearance in Boston as Frank Hardy in Paul Pry in 1851, at the Howard Athenæum. The next year he went to Philadelphia. Clarke's first appearance in New York City was made at the Metropolitan Theatre – afterward called the Winter Garden – on May 15, 1855, as Dickory in The Spectre Bridegroom,The Spectre Bridegroom is a short story from Washington Irving's Sketch Book and has been adapted several times for the stage. but it was not until he returned in 1861–1862 to the same theatre that he made a conspicuous mark. In 1859 he became part of the Booth family when he married Asia Booth, daughter of Junius Brutus Booth, and sister of John Wilkes Booth. Clarke was associated with his brother-in-law Edwin Booth in the management of the Winter Garden Theatre in New York, the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia and the Boston Theatre. Following the 1865 assassination of US president Abraham Lincoln by Clarke's brother-in-law, John Wilkes Booth, Clarke came into the possession of two letters, from his wife, written by the assassin. He turned them over to the Philadelphia Inquirer, which printed one of the two letters. His actions led to his arrest and imprisonment in the Capitol Prison in Washington D.C. for a month. Once released, he notified his pregnant wife that they must divorce. He wanted to distance himself professionally from the name of Booth. She refused to divorce him, even as their relationship grew increasingly strained. However, they remained married in name only. \\"..He lives a free going bachelor life and does what he likes..\\" wrote Asia to her brother Edwin. She died May 16, 1888, at the age of 52. In August 1865, just months after the assassination, Asia gave birth to twins Creston and Lilian. In 1867, Clarke moved his family to London, where Asia became a poet and a writer. Clarke made his first appearance at the St James's Theatre as Major Wellington de Boots in Stirling Coyne's Everybody's Friend, rewritten for him and called The Widow's Hunt. At the Princess's in February 1868, he was Salem Scudder in a revival of The Octoroon, and later, at the Strand, was the first Young Gosling in Fox versus Goose. On July 26, 1869, he was the first Babington Jones in John Brougham's Among the Breakers. At the same house he also played Toodles, Dr. Pangloss in The Heir at Law, and other parts. His success was so great that he remained in England for the rest of his life, except for four visits to America. Among his favorite parts were Timothy Toodle in William E. Burton's The Toodles, which ran for 200 nights at the Strand Theatre, and two roles from plays by George Colman \\"the Younger\\": Dr. Pangloss in The Heir at Law, and Dr. Ollapod in The Poor Gentleman. At the beginning of his career Clarke wished to play tragedy, but he later turned to comic roles. He managed several London theatres, including the Haymarket, where he preceded the Bancrofts. He retired in 1889. Death and legacy Clarke died suddenly, in London, in his sixty-seventh year, on September 24, 1899. Four days later, his remains were interred at Teddington CemeteryTQ1571: Shacklegate Lane cemetery, Teddington from geograph.org.uk in what is now the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Among the mourners were Mr. and Mrs. Clement Scott, Charles Hawtrey, the staff of the Strand Theater, and Clarke's two sons, Creston and Wilfred. Many beautiful wreaths were placed upon the coffin. He and his wife Asia had nine children. Their sons Creston and Wilfred went on to become actors. Bibliography * Bell, Hamilton, \\"J.S. Clarke\\" in Matthews, Brander; Hutton, Lawrence.

A backyard railroad is a privately owned, outdoor railroad, most often in miniature, but large enough for one or several persons to ride on. The rail gauge can be anything from to or more. Smaller backyard or outdoor railroads that cannot be ridden are called garden railroads. Some backyard railroads use full-size rolling stock, such as the former narrow gauge Grizzly Flats Railroad owned by Disney animator Ward Kimball. Hundreds, even thousands of backyard railroads exist, especially in the United States and United Kingdom. Walt Disney's gauge ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad, located at his home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Holmby Hills, was a notable example. It inspired Disney to surround his planned Disneyland amusement park with the narrow gauge Disneyland Railroad. Track Tracks for the layout can be either portable (i.e. removable), or permanent. The former may be of fairly simple welded steel construction, but the latter are usually built from miniature steel or aluminium rails attached to wooden, plastic or even concrete sleepers (US: ties), and put on a proper foundation of crushed stone (\\"track ballast\\"), just as in full size. Turnouts (US: switches) are also fabricated from these basic materials. Usually, prototypical appearance is sought for, but some portable tracks may not closely resemble real railroad tracks. Locomotives and rolling stock Locomotives on a backyard railroad can be of different types; steam locomotives, gasoline or diesel engines, or even electrically operated, using rechargeable lead-acid batteries inside the locomotive. Miniature steam locomotives are an element of a related hobby known as live steam. One of the more well-known builders of backyard railroad trains was Bud Hurlbut, who also built and operated the mine train ride and log ride at Knott's Berry Farm.Williams, Carey, \\"The Hurlbut Amusement Company,\\" Large-Scale Railroading, pp.10-19, April–June 2009, Peoria, AZ.Merritt, Christopher and Lynxwiler, J. Eric, Knott's Preserved, pp. 92-105, Angel City Press, Santa Monica, CA 2010. Rolling stock is often modeled after real railroad equipment, as far as being painted with logos of past or existing railroads. Boxcars, flat cars, tank cars and cabooses are common. For passenger use, special cars are constructed, with a low center of gravity for safety.

The name means \\"deep song\\" in Spanish, with hondo (\\"deep\\") spelled with J () as a form of eye dialect, because traditional Andalusian pronunciation has retained an aspirated H lost in other forms of Spanish. It is generally considered that the common traditional classification of flamenco music is divided into three groups of which the deepest, most serious forms are known as cante jondo. Cultural references to cante jondo In 1922 the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla led in the organization of the Concurso de Cante Jondo for Granada. Many classical musicians, cultural and literary figures, including the young poet Federico García Lorca, participated in the program. The result was the memorable series of flamenco performances held at the Alhambra during June. Lorca had evidently used the title ' for a 1921 collection of poems, although he did not publish it for ten years. In 1931, García Lorca presented a conference devoted to keeping the rich tradition of the cante jondo alive. The following is translated from the conference notes by Lorca: > The cante jondo approaches the rhythm of the birds and the natural music of > the black poplar and the waves; it is simple in oldness and style. It is > also a rare example of primitive song, the oldest of all Europe, where the > ruins of history, the lyrical fragment eaten by the sand, appear live like > the first morning of its life. The illustrious Falla, who studied the > question attentively, affirms that the gypsy siguiriya is the song type of > the group cante jondo and declares that it is the only song on our continent > that has been conserved in its pure form, because of its composition and its > style and the qualities it has in itself, the primitive songs of the > oriental people.Paraphrased slightly from \\"Cante Jondo\\" by Federico García > Lorca, as translated on the Casa de la Guitarra Española site; the liberty > has been taken of correcting their mistakes in English spelling and usage.

He lives in the United States, where he is a Professor and writer in residence at Bard College. He left Romania in 1986 with a DAAD-Berlin Grant and in 1988 went to the US with a Fulbright Scholarship at the Catholic University in Washington DC. Manea's most acclaimed book, The Hooligan's Return (2003), is an original fictionalized memoir, encompassing a period of almost 80 years, from the pre-war period, through the Second World War, the communist and post-communist years to the present. Manea has been known and praised as an international important writer since the early 1990s, and his works have been translated into more than 20 languages.Manea's books have been reviewed in the American, British, French, Romanian, Italian, Spanish, German press. They can be found in New York Times, New York Times Book Review, New Republic, New York Review of Books, Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle (USA); Times Literary Supplement (UK); Le Monde, Figaro, Lire (France); El Pais, La Vanguardia (Spain); Stampa, La Repubblica, Corriere della Sera, 24 (Italy); FAZ, Die Welt, Süddeutsche Zeitung (Germany) etc. Essential references are to be found in: Neues Literatur Lexicon (1990, Germany), Literary Exile in the Twentieth Century: An Analysis and Biographical Dictionary (1991, USA), Contemporary Authors (Gale Group, 1995, 2008, USA), Who’s Who in America (Marquis, 1995–2010, USA), Dictionarul Esential al Scriitorilor Romani (2001, Romania), Dictionarul Analitic de Opere Literare (2001, Romania), Dictionarul Scriitorilor Romani (2001, Romania), Dictionary of Literary Biography, Twentieth Century Eastern European Writers, 2001, USA), Slovnik Rumunskych Spisovatelu (2001, Czech Republic), Enciclopedia Exilului Romanesc (2003, Romania), Dictionar Cronologic al Romanului Romanesc (2004, Romania), Dictionarul de literatura al Academiei Romane (2005, Romania), Enciclopedia della Letteratura (2008, Italy). See also The Obsession of Uncertainty : In Honorem Norman Manea, Polirom 2011 (Magris, Tabucchi, Roth, Molina, Aridjis, Krüger etc.). He has received more than 20 awards and honors. Early years Born in the neighborhood of Suceava (Bukovina, Romania), Manea was deported as a child, in 1941, by the Romanian fascist authorities, allied with Nazi Germany, to a concentration camp in Transnistria, together with his family. He returned to Romania in 1945 with the surviving members of his family and graduated with high honors from the high school (liceu) Stefan cel Mare in his home town, Suceava. He studied engineering at the Construction Institute in Bucharest and graduated with master's degree in hydro-technique in 1959, working afterwards in planning, fieldwork and research. He has devoted himself to writing since 1974. Literary career In 1966, his literary debut took place in Povestea Vorbii (The Story of Speech), an avant-garde and influential magazine that appeared in the early years of cultural liberalization in communist Romania and was suppressed after six issues. Until he was forced into exile (1986) he published ten volumes of short fiction essays and novels. His work was an irritant to the authorities because of the implied and overt social-political criticism and he faced a lot of trouble with the censors and the official press. At the same time that sustained efforts were made by the cultural authorities to suppress his work, it had the support and praise of the country's most important literary critics. After the collapse of the Ceaușescu dictatorship, several of his books started to be published in Romania. The publication in a Romanian translation of his essay Happy Guilt, which first appeared in The New Republic, led to a nationalist outcry in Romania, which he in turn has analysed in depth in his essay \\"Blasphemy and Carnival\\". Echoes of this scandal can still be found in some articles of the current Romanian cultural press. Meantime, in the United States and in European countries, Manea's writing was received with great acclaim. Over the past two decades he has been proposed as a candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature by literary and academic personalities and institutions in the United States, Sweden, Romania, Italy and France. Important contemporary writers expressed admiration of the author's literary work and his moral stand before and after the collapse of communism: the Nobel laureates Heinrich Böll, Günter Grass, Octavio Paz, Orhan Pamuk, as well as Philip Roth, Claudio Magris, Antonio Tabucchi, E. M. Cioran, Antonio Muñoz Molina, Cynthia Ozick, Louis Begley and others.

His music has also been in the EA Sports Madden NFL football video games and many football- related commercials. Biography Spence was born in San Francisco. A former University of Southern California music instructor living and working in Munich, Spence was hired in 1966 to score the mini-documentaries that conveyed National Football League highlights and personalities to fans in the network- television era. Spence's music cues combined with the voices of announcers Pat Summerall, Tom Brookshier, Charlie Jones, John Facenda, and Harry Kalas created the trademark style of sports highlights films of the NFL. Initially, Mahlon Merrick was asked to provide scores for NFL Films. A friend of Spence, Merrick asked Spence to help in the recording sessions. \\"Mahlon had written marches. Toward the end of that recording session, I stuck in a couple of different pieces—my own orchestral compositions with strings and woodwinds, more like a Hollywood film score. It turned out they were Ed Sabol's favorites and he offered me a three-year contract to write, conduct, and produce NFL Films' music.\\"Autumn Thunder: 40 Years of NFL Films Music liner notes. In Germany, Spence wrote several TV soundtracks with Hani Chamseddine, e.g., for the Francis Durbridge thriller '. After his retirement in 1990, he returned to Munich. He achieved unexpected fame in 1998 with the success of a CD compilation entitled The Power and the Glory: The Original Music & Voices Of NFL Films. Spence died at a Lewisville, Texas nursing center on February 6, 2016, at the age of 88. Discography * 1970: \\"\\" – Main theme for the Durbridge series on German network TV (Single, Kuckuck Schallplatten) * 1971: The Art of the Synthesizer – Interesting, Unusual and Melodic Moog Sounds (LP, Kuckuck Schallplatten) * 1972: Fantastic Sounds: TV Themes and Pop Covers (LP, Kuckuck Schallplatten) * 1998: The Power And The Glory: The Original Music & Voices of NFL Films * 2007: Sam Spence: Our Man in Munich (Allscore – Indigo) * 2009: Autumn Thunder: 40 Years of NFL Films Music Remake In 2005, Spence's music was remade by the hip hop music group Da Riffs, which can be heard on several NFL Network shows and found in the soundtrack of the game Madden NFL 06. Along with the urban remakes, the original songs still play in the game's soundtrack. His music was also included in Madden NFL 07, Madden NFL 08, and Madden NFL 09, being remixed again by Da Riffs. Later appearances Spence's music has been performed live several times, with the composer conducting guest residencies with regional orchestras. On June 14, 2008, he guest conducted a medley of his NFL Films hits with the Golden State Pops Orchestra in San Pedro, California, as part of the orchestra's \\"Pops for Pops\\" concert. In November 2010, a concert devoted almost entirely to his football scores was staged in Green Bay, Wisconsin. An audience of nearly 1,000 turned out at the historic Meyer Theater downtown for a program that featured three local ensembles—The Civic Symphony of Green Bay, the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay Wind Ensemble, and a big band jazz ensemble—performing a wide range of Spence's football scores, from symphonic to jazz to pop. Criticism One of the hallmarks of Spence's music is its intangible familiarity. Two film score enthusiasts have pointed out the similarity of his more popular themes to several contemporary film scores; one has criticized them of \\"get[ting] too close to their obvious film inspiration\\".Lukas Kendall, \\"CD Review: NFL Films: The Power and the Glory\\", Film Score Monthly, November 1998. They have lauded some of his compositions as \\"cool homage[s]\\", while describing others as \\"barely disguised\\" \\"knock-offs\\".Jeff Bond, \\"CD Review: Autumn Thunder: 40 Years of NFL Films Music\\", Film Score Monthly, July 2005. NFL music Over his three-decade career, Spence composed hundreds of short sound-track scores for NFL Films. Some songs in this list are: * \\"Magnificent Eleven\\" * \\"Round Up\\" * \\"Forearm Shiver\\" * \\"Macho Theme\\" * \\"A Chilling Championship\\" * \\"Sunday Afternoon Fever\\" * \\"Ramblin' Man from Gramblin'\\" * \\"The Equalizer\\" * \\"Raider Might\\" * \\"The Over the Hill Gang\\" * \\"Classic Battle\\" * \\"West Side Rumble\\" * \\"Lombardi Trophy Theme\\" * \\"Golden Boy\\" * \\"Final Quest\\" * \\"Game Plan For Sudden Death\\" * \\"Industrial Giant\\" * \\"Torpedo\\" * \\"Police Car\\" * \\"The Pony Soldiers\\" Performance rights controversy with NFL Films Spence had long been involved in a controversial situation with the NFL regarding the rights to perform or use his music in any media outlets. The case was first reported by musicologist Alexander Klein in a 2013 article published by Film Score Monthly magazine.Alexander Klein, \\"The Sam Spence Case: The shocking truth about production companies and royalties\\", Film Score Monthly, April 2013. Through personal conversations with the composer, Klein reported that Spence was convinced to sign a contract that relinquished all of the rights to his music to NFL Films under the promise that the enterprise would return the document to the composer. According to Spence, \\"I received a phone call, in which NFL Films claimed my music had been 'stolen' and used in a pornographic film called Deep Throat (released on June 12, 1972 in the U.S.). They would send me a paper to sign to the effect that NFL Films was empowered to protect the music in a court of law. In all sincerity, I did not see a possible 'plot' here at all. However, I unwittingly 'punctured their balloon' by explaining that they didn't have to bother with this at all because GEMA (a German state- authorized performance rights organization) would protect my music and legally proceed after anyone who used it without permission.\\" As Klein reported, \\"soon afterwards, GEMA sent Spence a video copy of the film and asked him to make a list of \\"where and how long\\" his music appeared in it. Thus, the composer dutifully watched the film in order to find possible fragments of his music in it. Yet, the outcome was unexpected.\\" In Spence's own words: \\"I was surprised to find not one note of my music in the film. Naïve, trusting person that I was, it never dawned on me it could possibly be a hoax to get me to sign a forthcoming document.\\" According to Spence, \\"the next 'trick' came several months later. I received a phone call in which I was told that NFL Films had a court case in two days against someone who had illegally used some of my music. Their lawyer had sent me a paper via Federal Express, which they said would be arriving shortly (in that same afternoon) for my signature. After signed, the FedEx courier would immediately send it back to them so they would have it in time for the court case.\\" According to Klein's report, the composer received the paper in the afternoon and read it but, in Spence's words, \\"after reading the paper, I called them and said that I could not sign a document with that wording. But they assured me that as soon as the case was over, they would send it back to me.\\" Still unsuspecting, and trusting in the company's words, Spence signed the document and sent it to NFL Films. He never got the paper back and, to this day, the late composer's family is not receiving royalties for the many uses of Spence's music in American television shows and commercials.

It treats all but the highest-energy gluons as field lines, which are attracted to each other due to the gluon self-interaction and so form a narrow tube (or string) of strong color field. Compared to electric or magnetic field lines, which are spread out because the carrier of the electromagnetic force, the photon, does not interact with itself. String fragmentation is one of the parton fragmentation models used in the PYTHIA/Jetset and UCLA event generators, and explains many features of hadronization quite well. In particular, the model predicts that in addition to the particle jets formed along the original paths of two separating quarks, there will be a spray of hadrons produced between the jets by the string itself--which is precisely what is observed.

It is produced by Ford Gum & Machine Co. The history of the company goes back to 1913, when Ford Mason leased 102 machines and placed them in stores and shops in New York City. The gumballs, while they are covered with different flavors, all have the same flavor under the surface. Ford Gum is also available in a square \\"chiclet\\" shape, with the same colors/flavors as the gumballs. In 1962, Thomas E. Conner, a Ford Gum manager, became acquainted with Nancy Reagan's family. In meeting Reagan he asked him to do a Public Service Announcement for Ford Gum, which Reagan voluntarily did on Conner's portable tape recorder. In 1985, Ford Gum was acquired by Leaf. Leaf's American operations were acquired by Hershey in 1996, and Ford Gum was subject to a management buyout the next year. Today, Ford Gum and Machine Co. is headquartered in Akron, NY and has a sales office in Buffalo Grove, IL. The company is the only large scale manufacturer of gumballs in the US. Their primary competitors, Tootsie Roll's Dubble Bubble and SweetWorks' Oak Leaf Confections, manufacture gumballs and confectionery products in Canada. Ford Gum owns the trademark on \\"Carousel\\" and manufactures and distributes a complete line of bulk gumball products and toy gumball machines under Carousel brand. Ford is the first and only company to manufacture and distribute sugar free gumballs. Carousel gumballs come in a wide range of flavors, sizes and colors. Ford Gum also makes private label gum and mints. As of 2015, most of their gum products are certified Kosher by the BVK, the Buffalo Vaad HaKashrus under the direction of Rabbi Moshe Taub. Ford Gum acquired the rights to Big League Chew from Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in 2010 and was to begin production of the product in November of that year.

The Top 40 (CHR) station, located at 105.9 MHz, is known to listeners as 106 KHQ, Northern Michigan's #1 Hit Music Channel. WVOY The station signed on in 1980, but its roots can be traced back to the early 1970s, with the beginning of WVOY, a 5,000-watt daytime-only station at 1270 kHz on the AM dial. WVOY was one of the first all-contemporary-hit-music radio stations in northern Michigan and featured Bill Vogel (\\"The Captain,\\" formerly of Detroit's WDRQ), John Yaroch, Rick Durkin, and other major-market-quality talent. Despite WVOY's limited signal, the station became extremely popular and gave northern Michigan listeners a taste of the \\"big city\\" radio sound. The station was live during morning and afternoon drive (with Vogel and Yaroch), and \\"live assist\\" automation using ITC (\\"The Cart Machine People\\") \\"carousels\\" and carted music during other time periods. WKHQ Signs On After many years of expensive and time-consuming legal wrangling over a hotly contested 100 kW FM license (mostly with religious broadcast proponent Roland Cilke), the station's owners, Tim Ives and Elmo Franklin, sold an interest to former WVOY salesperson and air talent Tim Moore, who had worked with TM Programming Broadcast consultants in the interim since his departure from WVOY in the mid-1970s. Moore later purchased the interests of Ives and Franklin at a pre-arranged contract price. Tim went on to buy stations in Florida. Today Moore is the principal of Audience Development Group, a large programming consulting firm working with stations coast to coast. The call letters Moore chose were WKHQ, named after a legendary Spokane, Washington radio and TV combo, KHQ. The station signed on May 8, 1980, using TM Programming's \\"Stereo Rock\\" format, and quickly shot up to the top of the ratings thanks to its polished jocks and upbeat music. In its early years, WKHQ was known as \\"The Rhythm of the Northwest\\" (referring, of course, to northwestern Michigan), and its TM \\"Stereo Rock\\" jingles used that slogan. WVOY, in the meantime, flipped to a Music of Your Life format, although the station would return to simulcasting the FM later in the 1980s as WKHQ. The station is now WMKT, \\"News/Talk 1270.\\" Moore sold the station in the mid-1980s to Midwest Family, only to recover it a few years later. He sold it again to Cadillac Media who also ended up having financial problems, and again became the owner. Midwest then sold to MacDonald Broadcasting in 1994. WKHQ vs. WKPK In 1994, KHQ and 1270, now Talk station WMKT, was sold to Trish MacDonald-Garber, who owned WMBN 1340 and WLXT 96.3, a.k.a. Lite 96. With the ownership change, MacDonald- Garber transitioned KHQ to more of a Hot AC, causing rival 106.7 The Peak to boost their teenage audience even further. KHQ's liners would blast The Peak for being \\"the rap station\\", while The Peak's liners would blast KHQ for being too corny. As a result, by the late 1990s, KHQ would be a full-blown CHR again, but in the interim, WKPK became the dominant CHR signal and the #1 station in most areas that KHQ had once \\"owned\\". In 2000, 106.7 The Peak flipped to Hot AC, leaving KHQ all to itself in the CHR arena. With the format all to itself, KHQ again ventured into Adult CHR territory, with only a limited number of rap tracks. It has been said that part of the reason for this was that in 2001, Williams Chevrolet in Traverse City, one of the station's biggest sponsors, dropped all of their ads because the station played Eminem's \\"Without Me\\" early in the morning. The station compromised with the car dealer by only playing rap at night when advertisers weren't making huge buys (and when teenagers were most likely to be listening). The station's most-recognized personality was long-running morning man Bill \\"The Captain\\" Vogel, who hosted the station's morning show from 1983 to 2001 (and had worked at KHQ's predecessor, WVOY-AM, before that). While at KHQ, Vogel was known for his on-air signature catchphrase \\"Get the heck outta bed!\\". Vogel left KHQ in 2001 to focus on being a talk radio host on the Michigan Talk Radio Network (MTRN), only to quit due to the network's money troubles. He now owns a successful voice-over business, where he does network spots for CBS and is the announcer for the FOX sketch comedy show Mad TV. Original line- up in 1980: Tim Moore-mornings; Mike Daniels-middays; Bob Harper-afternoons; Carey Carlson-nights; John Borders-voice tracked 10p-6a; Bob White-morning news; Cindy Smith-afternoon news. Other personalities in the 1980s: Rob Hazelton, Jim Owen, Chet Jessick, Mark Cage, Mike Sommers; Christopher Knight. The departure of the Captain would be the start of many defections by high- profile personalities, including \\"Storm\\" Kennedy, Keith Michaels, Lisa Knight, and Ron Pritchard, who programmed the station for most of the late 1990s through the mid-2000s. WKHQ Today Today, WKHQ is still Northern Michigan's #1 rated CHR station Current voice over talent is Chad Erickson, who replaced Randy Cox in April 2019. Randy Cox was the voice talent of the station after the passing of longtime voice artist Brian James. Jingles WKHQ used two jingle packages from JAM Creative Productions (Skywave and Breakthrough) with a HLC package prior to its switch to JAM. However, on May 17, 2009 the station began to use ReelWorld One CHR with the Kiss L.A logo. In January 2013, WKHQ revamped its image completely, dropping jingles all together in favor of using sweepers and liners. April 2019 saw the return of Jingles to the station, again utilizing the Kiss LA Logo from Reelworld. Competition WKHQ competes with Z-93 WJZQ, the market's only other CHR station.

In a letter to Henry Oldenburg, Spinoza wrote: \\"as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken\\".Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (March 26, 2009), , letter 73 For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a mode under infinite attributes, of which we can perceive two: Thought and Extension. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world. According to German philosopher Karl Jaspers, when Spinoza wrote \\"Deus sive Natura\\" (\\"God or Nature\\") Spinoza meant God was Natura naturans not Natura naturata, that is, \\"a dynamic nature in action, growing and changing, not a passive or static thing.\\" Core doctrine Spinoza's metaphysics consists of one thing, Substance, and its modifications (modes). Early in The Ethics Spinoza argues that there is only one Substance, which is absolutely infinite, self-caused, and eternal. Substance causes an infinite number of attributes (the intellect perceiving an abstract concept or essence) and modes (things following from attributes and modes). He calls this Substance \\"God\\", or \\"Nature\\". In fact, he takes these two terms to be synonymous (in the Latin the phrase he uses is \\"Deus sive Natura\\"), but readers often disregard his neutral monism. During his time, this statement was seen as literally equating the existing world with God \\\\- for which he was accused of atheism. Spinoza asserted that the whole of the natural universe is made of one Substance - God or Nature - and its modifications (modes). One should, however, remember the neutral monist position. While the natural universe humans experience in the realm of mind and physical reality is part of God, it is only two attributes – thought and extension – that are part of infinite attributes emanating from God. Spinoza's doctrine was considered radical at the time he published, and he was widely seen as the most infamous atheist-heretic of Europe. His philosophy was part of the philosophic debate in Europe during the Enlightenment, along with Cartesianism. Specifically, Spinoza disagreed with Descartes on substance duality, Descartes' views on the will and the intellect, and the subject of free will.Michael L. Morgan, ed., Spinoza: Complete Works, translated by Samuel Shirley (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), 119n6. In Spinozism, the concept of a personal relationship with God comes from the position that one is a part of an infinite interdependent \\"organism.\\" Spinoza argued that everything is a derivative of God, interconnected with all of existence. Although humans experience only thought and extension, what happens to one aspect of existence will affect others. Thus, Spinozism teaches a form of determinism and ecology, and uses these as a basis for morality. Additionally, a core doctrine of Spinozism is that the universe is essentially deterministic. All that happens or will happen could not have unfolded in any other way. Spinoza claimed that the third kind of knowledge, intuition, is the highest kind. More specifically, he defined intuition as the ability of the human intellect to intuit knowledge based upon its accumulated understanding of the world. =Substance= Spinoza defines \\"Substance\\" as follows: This means, essentially, that Substance is just whatever can be thought of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of it as a kind of thing, e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing, because it is not a particular thing. =Attributes= Spinoza defines \\"attribute\\" as follows: From this it can be seen that Attributes are related to Substance. It is not clear, however, even from Spinoza's direct definition, whether, a) Attributes are really the way(s) Substance is, or b) Attributes are simply ways to understand Substance, but not necessarily the ways it really is. Spinoza thinks that there are an infinite number of Attributes, but there are two Attributes for which Spinoza thinks we can have knowledge. Namely, thought and extension.Stanford.edu  Thought  The attribute of thought is how Substance can be understood to be composed of thoughts, i.e., thinking things. When we understand a particular thing through the Attribute of thought, we are understanding the mode as an idea of something (either another idea, or an object).  Extension  The Attribute of extension is how Substance can be understood to be physically extended in space. Particular things that occupy space are what is meant by extended. It follows from this that if Substance and God are identical, in Spinoza's view, and contrary to the traditional conception, God has extension as one of his Attributes. =Modes= Modes are particular modifications of substance, i.e., particular things in the world. Spinoza gives the following definition: =Substance monism= The argument for there only being one Substance (or, more colloquially, one kind of stuff) in the universe occurs in the first fourteen propositions of The Ethics. The following proposition expresses Spinoza's commitment to substance monism: Spinoza takes this proposition to follow directly from everything he says prior to it. Spinoza's monism is contrasted with Descartes' dualism and Leibniz's pluralism. Thus, Spinoza avoids the unsolvable problem of how mind and body interact, which troubled Descartes in his Meditations on First Philosophy. Specifically, how can immaterial mind interface with material body, and vice-versa? They exist in wholly different categories. =Causality and modality= The issue of causality and modality (possibility and necessity) in Spinoza's philosophy is contentious.Stanford.edu Spinoza's philosophy is, in one sense, thoroughly deterministic (or necessitarian). This can be seen directly from Axiom 3 of The Ethics: Yet Spinoza seems to make room for a kind of freedom, especially in the fifth and final section of The Ethics, \\"On the Power of the Intellect, or on Human Freedom\\": So Spinoza certainly has a use for the word 'freedom', but he equates \\"Freedom of Mind\\" with \\"blessedness\\", a notion which is not traditionally associated with freedom of the will at all. The principle of sufficient reason (PSR) Though the PSR is most commonly associated with Gottfried Leibniz, it is arguably found in its strongest form in Spinoza's philosophy.Della Rocca, Michael. (2008). Spinoza, Routledge. Within the context of Spinoza's philosophical system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation.Della Rocca, Spinoza, 2008. What this means is that for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon is the way it is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense. =Parallelism= Spinoza's philosophy contains as a key proposition the notion that mental and physical (thought and extension) phenomena occur in parallel, but without causal interaction between them. He expresses this proposition as follows: His proof of this proposition is that: The reason Spinoza thinks parallelism follows from this axiom is that, since the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, such a cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, there is only one substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas concerning things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are both God's modes, but pertain to different attributes. Pantheism controversy In 1785, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a \\"Spinozist\\", which was the equivalent in his time of being called a heretic. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended substance. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. Moses Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between theism and pantheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which Immanuel Kant rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to antinomies (statements that could be proven both right and wrong) in thought. The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them: * the unity of all that exists; * the regularity of all that happens; and * the identity of spirit and nature. Spinoza's \\"God or Nature\\" [Deus sive Natura] provided a living, natural God, in contrast to the Newtonian mechanical \\"First Cause\\" or the dead mechanism of the French \\"Man Machine.\\" Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a religion of nature and called him the \\"God-intoxicated Man.\\" Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay \\"The Necessity of Atheism.\\" Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word \\"God\\" [Deus] to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. \\"Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law....\\"Frank Thilly, A History of Philosophy, § 47, Holt & Co., New York, 1914 Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God differs from the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.\\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.” These words were spoken by Albert Einstein, upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue, New York, April 24, 1921, published in the New York Times, April 25, 1929; from Einstein: The Life and Times Ronald W. Clark, New York: World Publishing Co., 1971, p. 413; also cited as a telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929, Einstein Archive 33–272, from Alice Calaprice, ed., The Expanded Quotable Einstein, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Modern interpretations German philosopher Karl Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence.Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (October 23, 1974), , Pages: 14 and 95 Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course \\"divisible\\"; it has parts. But Spinoza insists that \\"no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided\\" (Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance), and that \\"a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible\\" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (October 2, 1996), , Page: 40 Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, the pantheist formula \\"One and All\\" would apply to Spinoza only if the \\"One\\" preserves its transcendence and the \\"All\\" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things. French philosopher Martial Guéroult suggested the term \\"panentheism\\", rather than \\"pantheism\\" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, \\"in\\" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God. In other words, the world is a subset of God. American philosopher Charles Hartshorne, on the other hand, suggested the term \\"Classical Pantheism\\" to describe Spinoza's philosophy.Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, \\"Philosophers Speak of God,\\" Humanity Books, 1953, ch 4. Speculative realism, a movement in post- continental philosophy, is highly indebted to spinozaist metaphysics. Comparison to Eastern philosophies Similarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authorities. The 19th-century German Sanskritist Theodore Goldstücker was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the Vedanta tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was \\"... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.\\"Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W. H. Allen, 1879. p32.The Westminster Review, Volumes 78–79, Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1862. p1862 It has been said that Spinozism is similar to the Hindu doctrines of Samkhya and Yoga. Though within the various existing Indian traditions there exist many traditions which astonishingly had such similar doctrines from ages, out of which most similar and well known are the Kashmiri Shaivism and Nath tradition, apart from already existing Samkhya and Yoga.Disguised and overt Spinozism around 1700 – Page 133 Max Muller, in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying \\"the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'.\\"Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p123 Helena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay \\"As to Spinoza's Deity – natura naturans – conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity – as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct outflowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple.\\"H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings, Volume 13, pages 308–310.

[', '], tooth) is an extinct order of carnivorous metatherian mammals native to South America. They were once considered to be true marsupials, but are now thought to be either a sister taxon to them,Guillermo W. Rougier, John R. Wible and Michael J. Novacek. First Implications of Deltatheridium specimens for early marsupial history, Nature 396, 459-463(3 December 1998)Guillermo Rougier, New specimen of Deltatheroides cretacicus (Metatheria, Deltatheroida) from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia, BULLETIN OF CARNEGIE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 36(DEC 2004):245-266 · SEPTEMBER 2009 or considerably distantly related, part of a separate clade of Gondwanan metatherians. A number of these mammalian predators closely resemble placental predators that evolved separately on other continents, and are cited frequently as examples of convergent evolution. They were first described by Florentino Ameghino, from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia. Sparassodonts were present throughout South America's long period of \\"splendid isolation\\" during the Cenozoic; during this time, they shared the niches for large warm-blooded predators with the flightless terror birds. Previously, it was thought that these mammals died out in the face of competition from \\"more competitive\\" placental carnivorans during the Pliocene Great American Interchange, but more recent research has showed that sparassodonts died out long before eutherian carnivores arrived in South America (aside from procyonids, which sparassodonts probably did not directly compete with). Sparassodonts have been referred to as borhyaenoids by some authors, but currently the term Borhyaenoidea refers to a restricted subgroup of sparassodonts comprising borhyaenids and their close relatives. Features Although members of the order Sparassodonta showed many similarities with placental carnivores, they were not closely related and are a very good example of convergent evolution. For example, sparassodonts' molars were very similar to the sharp teeth of placental carnivores. The canines were also lengthened, and in some cases resemble those of saber-toothed cats. Sparassodonts spanned a wide range of body sizes, from 2.2 pound (1 kg) weasel or civet-like forms to Thylacosmilus, which was the size of a leopard. Along with the Australian thylacoleonids, sparassodonts include some of the largest metatherian carnivores. Sparassodonta is characterized by dental synapomorphies that distinguish the group from other closely related mammals. Unequivocal traits uniting the earliest Sparassodonts include: * a snout that forms a pronounced bulge around the canine teeth when viewed from above * a ridge on the upper molar (preparacrista) oriented anterobuccally (towards the cheek) with respect to the long axis of the tooth. * a pronounced keel near the base of the front of the paraconid * ridges on lower molars (postprotocristid-metacristid) parallel or oblique with respect to lower jaw axis. * a very tall protoconid (>90% tooth length, secondarily lost in Hondadelphys and Stylocynus) that bulges to the side and is wider at its midpoint than its base * talonid (crushing end) of lower molar narrow in relation to trigonid (shearing end). The dental formula of most sparassodonts is , with the exception of borhyaenids, which have three upper incisors, proborhyaenids (except for Callistoe), which have only two lower incisors, and thylacosmilids, which have only two lower incisors, at least two upper incisors, and only two upper and lower premolars on each side of the jaw. Some specimens of Borhyaena and Arctodictis are also missing the last upper molar, showing that the presence of this tooth was variable in these species. Sparassodonts had a typical metatherian mode of dental replacement, replacing only the upper and lower third premolar throughout their lifetime. In thylacosmilids, the deciduous upper premolar was never replaced. Sparassodonts have highly reduced epipubic bones, to the point that early analysis could not even find evidence for them.Wm. J. Sinclair, The Marsupial Fauna of the Santa Cruz Beds, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society . Vol. 44, No. 179 (Jan. - Apr., 1905), pp. 73-81 . Published by: American Philosophical Society This is a characteristic shared with the Australian thylacine, and historically argued as a synapomorphy, though nowadays it is considered to have developed independently for poorly understood reasons. Like with thylacines, it is very likely that they possessed long cartilaginous elements instead. Evolutionary history Sparassodonts have been suggested to be related to a variety of other groups of metatherians. Florentino Ameghino, who first described fossils of the group, thought that sparassodonts were closely related to creodonts and were a transitional group between metatherians and carnivorous placentals (including modern carnivorans). Contemporary authors in the late 19th and early 20th century rejected this hypothesis and considered sparassodonts to be closely related to Australian thylacines and dasyurids. The most popular hypothesis for much of the 20th century was that sparassodonts were closely related to opossums. In 1990, Marshall et al. (1990) considered the Cretaceous stagodontids to be members of Sparassodonta, but this was criticized by later authors. Marshall and Kielan-Jaworowska (1992) considered sparassodonts to be closely related to deltatheroidans, but this was also criticized. Most of these hypotheses were based on similar adaptations for carnivorous diets in sparassodonts, opossums, dasyuromorphians, stagodonts, and deltatheroidans, which are highly prone to convergent evolution within mammals. Szalay (1994) considered sparassodonts to be closely related to paucituberculatans based on features of the ankle. In recent years there has been a growing consensus that sparassodonts are positioned just outside of crown-group Marsupialia, in a broader clade (Pucadelphyida) including pucadelphyids as well as sparassodonts. Several other metatherian taxa have been suggested to be sparassodonts or closely related to sparassodonts. The australian Murgon taxa Archaeonothos has been noted as being similar to sparassodonts, but currently its relationships are not fully concluded. Carneiro (2018) recovered the genus Varalphadon from the Late Cretaceous of North America as a basal member of Sparassodonta. However, this interpretation of Varalphadon as a sparassodont has not been supported by later phylogenetic analyses, and most of the purported synapomorphies between Varalphadon and sparassodonts are not actually present in Varalphadon or have been suggested to be due to convergent evolution. Sparassodonts are currently considered to be endemic to South America, and have not even been found in nearby continents like Antarctica (which otherwise shares many groups of mammals with South America such as litopterns, astrapotheres, microbiotheres, and polydolopids). The early history of the Sparassodonta is poorly known, as most Paleocene and Eocene members of this group are only known from isolated teeth and fragmentary jaws. However, one species, the middle Eocene Callistoe vincei, is known from a nearly complete, articulated skeleton. As Callistoe belongs to one of the most specialized groups of sparassodonts, this indicates that the other major groups (e.g. borhyaenids, hathliacynids, etc.) must have also arisen by this time. Originally, the early Paleocene metatherian Mayulestes was considered to be the earliest known member of the Sparassodonta, but phylogenetic analyses suggest that this species represents an independent radiation of carnivorous metatherians more closely related to Pucadelphys; however, recent studies show that these taxa were closely related to borhyaenids. As of this writing, the earliest known true sparassodonts are either Allqokirus australis, a species from the same site as Mayulestes that may turn out to not be a sparassodont, and an isolated astragalus from the earliest Paleocene site of Punta Peligro, Argentina. Lycopsis longirostrus, from the late middle Miocene of Colombia. Sparassodonts can be divided into six major groups; basal sparassodonts (?earliest Paleocene-late Miocene), species that cannot be easily assigned to any of the other sparassodont groups and whose teeth often exhibit adaptations for omnivory; hathliacynids (late Oligocene-early Pliocene/late Pliocene), which range from a marten to a thylacine in size, and have long, fox-like snouts and teeth strongly adapted for carnivory; basal borhyaenoids (middle Eocene-late Miocene), borhyaenoids that cannot be easily classified into the families Borhyaenidae, Thylacosmilidae, or Proborhyaenidae and vary in size and shape; borhyaenids (early-late Miocene), the sparassodont group most specialized for running, but not as much as living carnivorans or even thylacines; proborhyaenids (middle Eocene-late Oligocene), robust, wolverine- like forms with ever-growing upper and lower canines; and thylacosmilids (early Miocene-late Pliocene), another terrestrially specialized group with ever-growing saber-like upper canines. After the middle Miocene, sparassodonts began to slowly decline in diversity. Basal borhyaenoids are last known from the early late Miocene (Pseudolycopsis cabrerai and Lycopsis viverensis), and after this time were at least partially replaced by large-bodied basal sparassodonts such as Stylocynus. It has been suggested that this shift in dominance was due to the more omnivorous habits of basal sparassodonts, which may have been better able to exploit the more seasonal climates of South America during the late Neogene. Borhyaenids are last known from the latest Miocene, though only fragmentary remains of this group are known from this period. Later remains assigned to this group have since been reidentified as thylacosmilids or procyonids. By the Pliocene, only two families of sparassodonts remained in South America, the Hathliacynidae and the Thylacosmilidae. Pliocene hathliacynid remains are rare, and it is possible that these animals may have competed with the large carnivorous didelphids such as Lutreolina that appeared around this time. Hathliacynids are last definitively known from the early Pliocene, though their remains are rare. The thylacosmilids, on the other hand, were more successful and abundant, being some of the only large mammalian carnivores in South America during the Pliocene, before dying out during a faunal turnover in the middle of the epoch (the youngest specimens of thylacosmilids are ~3.3 Ma). It is still not certain why Sparassodonta declined in diversity and became extinct during the late Cenozoic, but it appears as though competition from eutherian carnivorans was not a factor, as the placental analogues of sparassodonts (dogs, weasels, and saber-toothed cats) did not enter South America until the middle Pleistocene, several million years after their sparassodont counterparts became extinct. Sparassodonts did coexist with Cyonasua-group procyonids during the late Miocene and Pliocene, but Cyonasua-group procyonids appear to have been primarily omnivorous and filled ecological niches that sparassodonts never occupied, which may be one reason that these animals were able to colonize South America despite the diverse predator guild in the late Miocene. The overall decline in sparassodont diversity from the late Miocene to the end of the Pliocene may be linked to the cooling climates following the middle Miocene climatic optimum and the onset of the Pleistocene ice ages. Paleobiology Sparassodonts were carnivorous, and with the exception of some basal members of all members of this group were hypercarnivorous (having diets composed of more than 70% meat). Only Hondadelphys and Stylocynus appear to have exhibited adaptations for omnivory, and even then Stylocynus may have had a more mesocarnivorous diet similar to canids than an omnivorous one. Medium-to-large caviomorph rodents and rodent-like mammals (e.g., small notoungulates) appear to have been common prey items of sparassodonts. The subadult holotype of Lycopsis longirostrus preserves remains of the dinomyid Scleromys colombianus as fossilized gut contents. Sparassodont coprolites from the Santa Cruz Formation preserve the bones of chinchillid and octodontoid rodents inside them. Bite marks from medium-sized sparassodonts have been found on the small notoungulate Paedotherium. Stable isotope data from the early late Miocene Lycopsis viverensis and Thylacosmilus atrox suggests that these species fed on C3 grazers in open habitats, likely notoungulates. Bite marks likely pertaining to hathliacynid sparassodonts have been found on the remains of penguins and flightless marine ducks in ancient seabird nesting colonies, suggesting that sparassodonts raided seabird colonies for eggs, carrion, and other prey like many predatory mammals do today. Borhyaenid and proborhyaenid sparassodonts have been interpreted as being capable of crushing bones similar to modern hyenas, wolverines, or the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) based on their deep jaws, bulbous premolars with deep roots and pronounced wear at their tips, extensive fused or interlocking mandibular symphyses, large masseteric fossae, microfractures in their tooth enamel, and high estimated bite forces. Australohyaena antiquua shows particularly pronounced adaptations for bone-cracking, with a very deep jaw and strongly arched nasals similar to what is seen in modern hyaenids. Based on studies of the postcranial skeleton, it appears as though most sparassodonts were scansorial (adapted for climbing), although terrestrial adaptations evolved in Lycopsis longirostrus, borhyaenids, proborhyaenids, and thylacosmilids. Most sparassodonts were plantigrade, Borhyaena has been suggested to have been digitigrade but this has been questioned. The one exception was Thylacosmilus, which has been interpreted as having a digitigrade forefoot and a semiplantigrade hindfoot, this has been supported by fossil tracks. One unusual aspect of sparassodont paleoecology is that at most fossil localities their remains are nearly ten times rarer than would be expected based on comparisons with carnivorous mammals at fossil sites in other parts of the world. The exact reasons for this are not clear, though this appears to be a broader pattern applicable to other groups of Cenozoic South American terrestrial carnivores (i.e., terror birds). Little is known of the behavior and biology of sparassodonts outside of general locomotor and dietary habits. Argot (2004) proposed that Thylacosmilus atrox may have exhibited protracted parental care after weaning of the offspring, given that saber teeth in general have been suggested to require long juvenile periods in order for the young to gain the skill necessary to use them effectively. However, this has not been tested further. Sparassodonts have relatively large and complex brains for metatherians, comparable to those of some Australian marsupials like Australian possums, though the body masses used to produce these estimates of relative brain size are low compared later studies suggesting these values could be overestimated. Sparassodonts appear to have had very little binocular vision, with borhyaenids having the greatest degree of depth perception (but still lower than modern carnivorans) and the eyes of Thylacosmilus facing almost completely to the sides. However, later studies have found that Thylacosmilus likely held its head in a downward-facing position, which would have allowed for more binocular vision than previously thought. Wounds have been documented on the face of specimens of Borhyaena tuberata and Sipalocyon gracilis, potentially suggesting aggressive habits similar to the modern Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii). Several specimens of hathliacynids (Sipalocyon and Cladosictis) show a pathological disorder characterized by the presence of growths on the surface of the mandible, which in the most extreme cases can result in the loss of several teeth due to bony pathological growths. The exact cause of this condition (i.e., infection, virus, parasite) and why it seems to only occur in small sparassodonts is unknown, though this condition has also been documented in microbiotherians. Classification The following cladogram of sparassodont interrelationships is after Engelman et al., 2020. Not all studies agree on the sister group relationship between Thylacosmilidae and Borhyaenidae recovered here, with other studies finding thylacosmilids to be more closely related to proborhyaenids. The relationships among hathliacynids are also relatively unstable. Within Metatheria, a 2016 phylogenetic analysis group found that borhyaenids form a clade with the Asian \\"Gurlin Tsav skull\\" as well as other South American taxa. The same phylogeny found that marsupials group among various North American Cretaceous species. The phylogenetic tree is reproduced below. Taxonomy The taxonomic classification below follows the latest review of the group, that of Prevosti and Forasiepi (2018), with additions from more recent studies. Although Mayulestes was originally described as a sparassodont, later phylogenetic analyses have shown that it most likely does not belong to this group; however more recent studies show it to be closely related to sparassodonts. Similarly, while basal borhyaenoids such as Lycopsis and Prothylacynus were once thought to belong to a distinct family (Prothylacynidae), phylogenetic analyses have found that these animals do not represent a monophyletic group. The exact age of most Eocene species of sparassodonts is uncertain, given the lack of precise stratigraphic information associated with most specimens and the recent division of the Casamayoran SALMA into the Vacan and Barrancan SALMAs. * Order Sparassodonta ** Genus Allqokirus ***Allqokirus australis (earliest Paleocene, Tiupampan SALMA) ** Genus Mayulestes ***Mayulestes ferox (earliest

Phorusrhacos was one of the dominant land predators in South America at the time it existed. It is thought to have lived in woodlands and grasslands.  Description  Phorusrhacos had a skull nearly long, stood nearly tall, and probably weighed nearly , as much as a male ostrich. It had very strong legs, capable of running at high speed, stubby, flightless wings, a long neck, and a proportionately large head. This ended in a huge, hooked beak that could tear through flesh easily, or stab into prey. The lower jaw was smaller than the upper jaw. There were three toes on each of the feet, all of which were armed with sharp claws.  Discovery and naming  Life restoration by Charles R. Knight, 1901 Remains are known from several localities in the Santa Cruz Formation and Monte León Formation in the Santa Cruz Province, of Argentina. Among the bones found in the strata of the Santa Cruz Formations (now considered as mainly of mid-Miocene date) was the piece of a mandible which Florentino Ameghino discovered in early 1887 and the same year at first described as that of an edentate mammal which he named Phorusrhacos longissimus. The generic name is derived from Greek -φόρος, (-phoros), an element meaning \\"bearer\\" in word combinations, and ῥάκος, (rhakos), \\"rag\\" or \\"wrinkle\\", probably in reference to the wrinkled jaw surface. When the original derivation was no longer understood, other translations were given, such as the literal translation of \\"Rag-Thief\\", and \\"branch-holder\\" from the mistaken assumption the name had been intended to be derived from a Greek rhakis, \\"branch\\". The specific name means \\"very long\\" in Latin, again in reference to the lower jaws. The holotype is the mandible, specimen MLP-118 (Museo de La Plata). In 1889 Ameghino emended the name to a more grammatically correct Phororhacos but the earlier name has priority. In 1891, it was by him recognized to be a bird.  Classification  Phorusrhacos was part of the group called the Phorusrhacidae, which is an extinct group of ﬂightless, cursorial carnivorous birds that occupied one of the dominant, large land-predator niches in South America from the lower Eocene to the Pleistocene. They dispersed into North America during the Great American Biotic Interchange(∼3 Ma). Some remains from Africa and Europe and the Paleocene of Brazil have been referred to this clade or identiﬁed as phylogenetically related to the extant South American seriemas, but these assignments remain controversial.

While Takuto is unhappy with Maki keeping secrets from him again, he reluctantly helps with the project. However, in the process of reviving the monster that Dr. Noguchi has aptly called Frank (short for Frankenstein's monster), unidentified soldiers invade the MORGUE facility.

It quickly becomes clear that Frank has become the best weapon FUNERAL has to defend against the aliens, which leaves Ryu torn between revenge and the desire to protect his comrades. Further complicating the picture, the only person who can communicate with Frank is a young girl named Hattie (Harriet), who bears a striking resemblance to Ryu/Takuto's lost love Maki.

Nestor Vasilievich Kukolnik () (1809–1868) was a Russian playwright and prose writer of Carpatho-Rusyn origin. Immensely popular during the early part of his career, his works were subsequently dismissed as sententious and sentimental. Today, he is best remembered for having contributed to the libretto of the first Russian opera, A Life for the Tsar by Mikhail Glinka. Glinka also set many of his lyrics to music. Family background Nestor Kukolnik was born on September 8, 1809 in the city of Saint Petersburg in the family of a professor lecturing at the Saint Petersburg Teacher's College. His father, Bazyli Wojciech Kukolnik belonged to the ethnic group of Rusyns (Ruthenians) and came from an old noble family. Graduate of Vienna University, he lectured at Poland. In 1804, Bazyli Wojciech Kukolnik was invited to teach in Russia along with professors Ivan Orlay (Orlay János) and Mikhail Balugjanskij. Among his pupils were Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia and Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich of Russia, the future emperor Nikolai I of Russia; Czar Alexander I of Russia granted Vasily Kukolnik an estate in the Vilno Oblast and was Nestor Kukolnik's godfather at his baptism. Early life and studies Nestor studied at the Nizhyn Gymnasium of Higher Sciences (present-day Ukraine), founded earlier by Nestor's father. Nikolai Gogol studied at the same institution and they both played at the school theater. Kukolnik's literature activity started in gymnasium, where he wrote his first verses and dramas. After graduating from Nizhyn Gymnasium in 1829, he gave lessons at Vilna (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania) Gymnasium, and in 1831 moved with his brother Platon Kukolnik to Saint Petersburg, where he served at the Ministry of Finance. Literary activity In 1833 Kukolnik's first play “Tortini” was published by Faddei Bulgarin, soon followed by fantasy drama “Torcuato Tasso”, which resulted in his reputation as a legendary playwright in the capital. The turning point in his literary career came in 1834, after demonstration of patriotic drama \\"Ruka Vsevishnego Otechestvo Spasla\\" (The God's Hand Saved The Motherland), applauded by the Russian Emperor Nicolas I at the play's premiere. Inspired by this success, the writer produces historical play “Prince Mikhail Vasilievich Skopin-Shuysky”. In 1836 he founded The Gazette of Fine Arts (Khudozhestvennaia gazeta) which was published in Saint Petersburg until 1842 and wrote more than two hundred articles on art. Kukolnik's oeuvre is diverse. He experimented with multiple genres and formats: novels, historical tales, criticism, poetry and even music. He was a friend of Mikhail Glinka, who to set some of Kukolnik's verses (Hesitation, Skylark, and Passing Song, among others) to music. Dizzy from his success, he proclaimed that there were only three geniuses in Russia - himself as a writer, Mikhail Glinka as a composer, and Karl Briullov as a painter. Resignation and later life in Taganrog In 1857 Nestor Kukolnik resigned and settled in Taganrog. There he continued his literary activity, but the public work played the key role of his life in that period. Nestor Vasilievich did a lot of work for education of Taganrog's society. It had an influence on the destiny of the city, making it into the centre of education in the South of Russia. Nestor Kukolnik was the first to prove the need of university education in the Don Voisko Province and on Azov Sea. His offer to open a university in Taganrog was not successful, but later it proved to be an important foundation for opening the Novorossiya University in Odessa (1865). Kukolnik also proved necessity of local newspapers. It was one of the reasons to open newspaper-publishing houses not only in Taganrog, but also in Odessa and Rostov on Don. Since 1865 Nestor Kukolnik led the workgroup that proved necessity of a railroad line from Kharkov to Taganrog. This work was a success and the Tsar Alexander II of Russia approved the project in 1868. He also was the first to raise the issue of environmental protection of the Gulf of Taganrog. But the related project encountered strong resistance from regional leadership and was not realized. Nestor Vasilievich assisted in opening the county court in Taganrog, open soon after his death in 1869. Kukolnik died unexpectedly in Taganrog on December 8, 1868, when he and his wife were getting ready to go to the theatre. The writer was buried in Taganrog in his own estate. In 1931 the remains of Nestor Kukolnik and his wife were defiled. Searching for jewelry, robbers opened the graves and threw away the remains. Unfortunately, it was not the only case of violation. In 1966 the city administration signed a decree and allowed the Public Joint- Stock Company “The Taganrog Boiler-Making Works “Krasny Kotelshchik” to build additional industrial areas on the territory of Kukolnik's estate. All the works started two years later, in 1968. Bulldozers razed to the ground Kukolnik's house and mixed his grave with mud and debris. The remains of the great Russian writer have been lost forever. In 2008 within the framework of the writer's 200th birth anniversary, one of the streets in Taganrog was named after Kukolnik.Решение Городской Думы города Таганрога №560 от 29.11.2007 Residence of Nestor Kukolnik in Taganrog © TaganrogCity.Com.

A military engineer since 1483, and the ducal architect of Ercole I d'Este, in 1492 Rossetti was assigned the project of enlarging the city of Ferrara. Rossetti is considered the first architect in the history of urbanistics to make use of the advantages of the modern methods: balancing the humanistic principles in architecture, the real needs of the city, and local traditions. Beginning in 1492, he projected and directed construction of the defense walls around the city. After Ercole's death in 1505, Rossetti served the Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, in which role he was responsible for the creation of many notable palazzi and churches. Among the latter, he helped design Santa Maria in Vado.

History According to some accounts, the roots of Slovenian hip hop can be traced back to 1978, but all rappers from that time were forgotten or disappeared. What remains of this early history is preserved in little-circulated album releases. The mid-1980s were marked as the breakthrough of rap music in Slovenia. Hip hop dancing in Slovenia is sometimes called \\"Čefur\\" dance (derogatory term for southerner Slavic people). Ali-En released the first rap album, that immediately became a classic, in 1994. In 1997, rap duo Dandrough released Ko pride Bog ('when God comes'). The next few years there was a small hole in the hip hop scene, with only a couple of albums released up until 2000. Hip hop culture was heavily popularized by Slovenian Olympic champion skier Jure Košir, who also released an album Kartelova teorija (eng: cartel theory) with his crew Pasji Kartel (eng: Dog Cartel) in 1998. Klemen Klemen released one of the most influential mainstream Slovenian hip hop albumsTrnow Stajl (eng: Trnovo Style) on Menart Records. At about the same time, Radyoyo: Za narodov Blagor - 5'00\\" of fame, the first compilation of Slovenian hip hop music was released, including various new and unknown rappers on the scene. In 2001, the first Slovenian freestyle rap championship was organized, launching rapper 6pack Čukur, who placed 2nd, into the mainstream. The competition became a tradition and has been held every second year since then. The next year rap duo Murat & Jose released V besedi je moč, which became one of the most successful rap albums in Slovenia and Southern Europe. The following year's freestyle championship spawned 2 champions - Trkaj, an alternative rapper and N'toko - who both went on to release albums through Nika Records. The most productive years for Slovenian hip hop were 2004–2006, spawning more albums than all years before that together. Though the quality oscillated from album to album, mostly because of the unofficial releases - noting that the demo scene produced better tracks.

(n.d., c. 1950) I Gotta Horse: The Autobiography of Ras Prince Monolulu. London: Hurst & Blackett Ltd.My Brighton and Hove  People  Colourful characters  Ras Prince Monolulu 1880-1965 (year of birth appears to be incorrect) Family background and early life Monolulu claimed to be a chief of the Falasha tribe of Abyssinia, but in reality he was born in St Croix, Danish West Indies (now part of the United States Virgin Islands). His baptism (as Peter Carl McKay) is noted in the records of the English Episcopal Church of the Danish West Indies. His father, whose name is not shown in the register, was William Henry McKay and his mother was Catherine Heyliger.Pearson, John, \\"I Gotta 'Orse!\\", in Ancestors magazine, October 2008, pp. 46–49. His father and brothers were horse breeders, raisers and racers on St Croix. According to his own account, he made his way from his birthplace to the African coast, where he was shanghaied on board a British ship: he styled himself a prince in the hope of receiving better treatment. His ship was subsequently shipwrecked on the Portuguese coast, from whence he made his way to New York. More plausibly he travelled to New York via Puerto Rico. He had various jobs, on shore and at sea, and eventually reached London in 1902.McConnell 2010 Career as tipster Monolulu first went to The Derby in 1903, and soon began to establish himself as a tipster. He adopted colourful robes, a plumed headdress, and the slogan \\"I've gotta horse!\\", sometimes alternating with \\"Black man for luck!\\". However, he also continued to travel around Britain, and around Europe, for example visiting Saint Petersburg with an American \\"negro show\\". He was in Königsberg when World War I broke out, and was held in Ruhleben internment camp, near Berlin, for the duration of the war. He returned to London in 1919. Great Yarmouth resident Maud Swallow remembered Prince Monolulu at Great Yarmouth Racecourse. \\"I thought I was placing a bet on a horse but my father told me afterwards that I had actually bought a tip from Monolulu instead of placing a bet\\". Monolulu rose to prominence after picking out the horse Spion Kop in the 1920 Derby, which came in at the long odds of 100–6, and from which he personally made some £8,000, a vast amount of money at the time. Personal life Monolulu claimed to have been married six times, though only five marriages are documented at all, and reliable evidence exists for only three. He claimed to have been married first in a Jewish ceremony in Moscow in 1902, to a girl who was afterwards taken away by the police; and second in a Catholic ceremony in 1903 to a German girl who was killed in a car accident. More certain were his marriages to another German, Elizabeth Arnold, who accompanied him to England and whom he married in 1908, but who died in 1911; to Rhoda Carley in 1922, the marriage being dissolved in 1929; and finally to Nellie Adkins in 1931, a marriage which also broke down. In the 1950s he was romantically linked to an Austrian governess in London. Death The biography of Jeffrey Bernard by Graham Lord relates Prince Monolulu's death in some detail. It describes how Bernard at the time was working as a horse-racing journalist and visited Monolulu in the Middlesex Hospital to interview him. Bernard had brought with him a box of Black Magic chocolates and offered Monolulu a \\"strawberry cream\\". Monolulu subsequently choked to death on it and Bernard bade him farewell.Lord, Graham (1992). Just the One: The Wives and Times of Jeffrey Bernard. London: Sinclair-Stevenson Ltd. Media appearances Monolulu frequently featured in newsreel broadcasts, and as a consequence was probably the best-known black man in Britain of the time.Further biographical details. He appeared in a clip in the 1939 propaganda film by Alexander Korda, The Lion has Wings (1939 film), Korda used him as an example of what Britain was, a nation at play and at ease with herself. He appeared briefly in the 1952 film Derby Day, which is set around The Derby, the 1954 film Aunt Clara with Margaret Rutherford and Sid James, and also in the 1959 film Make Mine a Million. In 1957 Monolulu appeared on the March 28th and April 4th episodes of Groucho Marx's quiz show You Bet Your Life.You Bet Your Life episode #56-28, March 28, 1957 Monolulu's name is referenced by the character Rigsby in the 1974 pilot episode of the UK comedy series Rising Damp, in humorous comparison to the new tenant Philip, who had stated he was the son of a chief.

Cricket career born 7 December 1856 in Calverton, Nottinghamshire, England, Flowers was a slow bowler, who bowled offbreaks and a strong batsman who was one of the leading all-rounders of his day. He first played for Nottinghamshire in 1877, and established himself slowly in a very strong side despite being known to be unplayable on a sticky wicket. In 1881, however, a players’ strike devastated NottinghamshireNottinghamshire strike and Flowers, seen as a player with less resolve than Alfred Shaw, Fred Morley, Arthur Shrewsbury, and John Selby, was approached by county officials and took advantage of the opportunity to become much more important in the redevelopment of the county. Flowers took such advantage of this that in 1882 he took one hundred wickets for the first time. His batting, which had been not outstanding but valuable in an era of very low scoring, developed greatly the following year, in which Flowers became the first professional to do the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Derbyshire, Flowers had the outstanding record of an innings of 131 and eleven wickets for eighty-seven runs. He bettered this for the same club against Cambridge the following year, scoring 122 and taking fourteen wickets for 160 runs, and despite not doing quite so well with either bat or ball was still good enough to tour Australia with Alfred Shaw's teams in 1884–85. However, not physically strong enough for the hotter climate and drier wickets of Australia, Flowers only rarely, as when taking five for 46 in the Third Test and eight for 31 in the first match on a rain-damaged wicket, lived up to his English form. He did maintain his form well enough to tour again in 1886–87, but this time Flowers did very little worthy of his reputation. Even at county level, Flowers was increasingly overshadowed, especially in dry weather, by the physically hardier William Attewell. Nor did his batting advance during a succession of wet summers, but in the dry season of 1893 Flowers reached a four-figure run aggregate for only the second time. In the process he played an innings of 130 against the touring Australians including Charles Turner, George Giffen and Hugh Trumble, and was thus unsuccessfully picked for his last Test at Lord's, where he made 35 but was omitted in favour of Johnny Briggs who was bowling immensely better at county level. Flowers still bowled well in 1894, but in the dry weather of 1895 his bowling lost him: in his final season of 1896 he was put on for only twenty overs.Note that an over the consisted of five balls rather than six He did achieve the notable feat of scoring a century in his last match against Sussex. Flowers was awarded a benefit match in 1899, but the match between Middlesex and Somerset at Lords turned out to be a financial disaster. The match was finished in just over 3 hours, making it the shortest first-class match ever played.Brodribb, Gerald, \\"Next Man In\\", Souvenir Press, London, 1995 Post-retirement After retiring as a player, Flowers served as an umpire from 1907 to 1912. Flowers was married to Martha, and was a frame work knitter, and later a lacehand, by trade. At birth, he was registered as Wilfred Flower. His cousin Thomas Flowers also played first-class cricket.

She hates it until one day a new boy, Yūnosuke Ogasawara (小笠原 勇之助 Ogasawara Yūnosuke), starts in the same class as her on the first day of fifth grade. Earlier that day, Azuki is teased by Ken Takayanagi (高柳 健 Takayanagi Ken), or Ken-chan, about her nickname. Yūnosuke passes by and happily memorizes the name becoming the first girl he notices. Azuki is overjoyed, and instantly falls in love with him, loving both him and her nickname. However, Azuki gets jealous when she sees him closer to other girls. Azuki lives with her mother, Keiko (けい子), with her father, Tadashi (正), and with her little brother, Daizu (大豆) in an apartment.

He is kind of sleepy and was intelligent \\"until 3rd grade\\". He's one of Yūnosuke's best friends, and they really are close. Not only Azuki has a crush on Yūnosuke, but apparently most girls in her class also have feelings about him. One of them is Yōko Sakakibara, a rich girl whose mom is a friend of Yūnosuke's.

He was the owner and designer of two influential gardens – Hidcote Manor Garden in Britain and Jardin Serre de la Madone in France. Biography Lawrence Waterbury Johnston was born on 12 October 1871 in Paris, France, into a family of wealthy American East Coast stockbrokers from Baltimore. He was educated at home, and from 1893 in Britain at the University of Cambridge (Trinity College). In January 1900, not long after his graduation, he became a naturalised British subject, and he immediately joined the Imperial Yeomanry. In February he was posted to South Africa, where he fought in the Second Boer War. He was commissioned in 1901. It was at this time that he developed his interest in South African flora. The Royal Horticultural Society elected him as a fellow in 1904. In 1902 he joined the Northumberland Hussars – with whom he would serve in World War I. He attained the rank of major. In 1907 Johnston's mother (now Mrs. Winthrop) bought Hidcote Manor, an estate of some 300 acres, near Hidcote Bartram, in Britain; and Johnston began a programme of 40 years' work on its gardens. Here he combined a feeling for structure (creating a surprising series of discrete spaces) with a love of plants and a willingness to experiment with novel plant combinations. An enthusiastic plant collector, he sponsored or undertook several expeditions in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America to bring back rare specimens. In 1922 he went plant-hunting in the alps with Edward Augustus Bowles; and in 1923 sponsored W. T. Goethe on a plant-hunting expedition to the Andes. He was a close friend of socialite garden designer Norah Lindsay, whose home was nearby in Sutton Courtenay Manor, Oxfordshire. In 1924 Johnston bought Serre de la Madone, near Menton, on the Mediterranean coast of France; and from then on would spend most of the year at Menton and a few summer months at Hidcote. At Serre de la Madone he turned terraces of vines and olives into a garden bright with drifts of agapanthus and strelitzia. In 1926 Johnston sponsored Frank Kingdon-Ward on an expedition to Burma to collect seeds. In the same year his mother died, bequeathing to him the Hidcote estate. In 1927 he himself went plant hunting in South Africa, and in 1930 went to Yunnan, China. Until 1930 the gardens at Hidcote were known to most gardeners by hearsay only, but in that year two articles about them were published in Country Life magazine; and in 1934 an account of them was broadcast by the garden-designer Russell Page. From 1945 Johnston spent more time at Serre de la Madone, and in 1948 the National Trust acquired Hidcote. Johnston died on 27 April 1958. He is buried next to his mother in the churchyard at Mickleton, near Hidcote. He left his garden at Serre de la Madone to Nancy Lindsay, the daughter of Norah Lindsay, but she did not continue his work there as he had intended. Namesake A rose—the bright yellow semi-double climber \\"Lawrence Johnston\\"—bears his name.

The History and Topography of the Parish of Sheffield in the County of York, the two-volume South Yorkshire (a history of the Deanery of Doncaster), still considered among the best works written on the history of Sheffield and South Yorkshire, and his 1852 pamphlet on Robin Hood in which he argued that a servant of this name at the court of Edward II was identical with the famous outlaw. His name was adopted by the Hunter Archaeological Society. Biography Hunter was born in Sheffield on 6 February 1783 to cutler Michael Hunter (1759–1831) and Elizabeth Girdler (1761–1787) in a house on the north side of New Church Street (a site now occupied by the Town Hall). Following the death of his mother in 1787 he was placed under the guardianship of Joseph Evans, a minister at Upper Chapel. He went to school in Attercliffe and subsequently served an apprenticeship as a cutler, obtaining his freedom of the Cutler's Company in September 1804. However, in 1805 he left Sheffield to study theology at Manchester College in York. In 1809 he moved to Bath to take up a post as a Unitarian Minister at Trim Street Chapel, there he met and married Mary Hayward, with whom he would have six children., one of whom, Sylvester Joseph Hunter, converted to Catholicism and became a Jesuit priest. In 1833 he moved to London to work at the Record Commission as Assistant Keeper of Public Records. In 1843, he was granted a coat of arms and chose as his motto Vita si Cervina (avoid me if you are a deer). He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1856.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory He died in 1861 and is buried at Ecclesfield Parish Church in Sheffield. From his schooldays onwards, he had been an enthusiastic collector of memorial inscriptions and similar genealogical gleanings. At the time of his death, much of his research remained unpublished. His papers were deposited in the British Museum (now the British Library). Between 1894 and 1896, the Harleian Society published four volumes of his collection of pedigrees under the title Familiae Minorum Gentium.

She was murdered in a former psychiatric institution at Sonnenstein castle in Pirna under Action T4, a forced euthanasia program of Nazi Germany. Since 2000, a memorial center for the T4 program in the house commemorates her life and work in a permanent exhibition.  Life  Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler grew up in a middle-class family, but left at the age of 16 to study at the Royal Arts School Dresden from 1915 to 1918 (fashion, then applied graphics). From 1916 to 1919, she also attended drawing and painting courses at the Dresden Art Academy. She came into contact with the Dresden Secession Group 1919 and became part of the circle of friends around Otto Dix, Otto Griebel, and Conrad Felixmüller. Renting part of the studio of the latter near the Dresden city center she made a living with batiks, postcards and illustrations. In June 1921, she married the painter and opera singer , following him to Görlitz in 1922 and in 1925 to Hamburg. The marriage was a difficult one and the couple separated several times in the following years. In 1926, Elfriede Lohse- Wächtler joined the Federation of female Hamburgian artists and art lovers; in 1928. she was able to participate in some exhibitions of the New Objectivity. In 1929, she suffered a nervous breakdown because of financial and partnership difficulties and was committed to a psychiatric institution in Hamburg- Friedrichsberg. During the two months' stay she painted the Friedrichsberg heads, a piece of work consisting of about 60 drawings and pastels, mainly portraits of fellow patients. After her recovery and a final separation from Kurt Lohse (in 1926), she had a very creative phase. She painted numerous paintings of Hamburg's harbor, scenes from the life of workers and prostitutes, and pitiless self-portraits. But despite some exhibitions, sales, and smaller grants, she lived in grinding poverty. Due to financial problems and increasing social isolation, she returned to her parents' home in Dresden by midyear 1931. When her mental state worsened her father admitted her to the state mental home at Arnsdorf in 1932. There she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. From 1932 to 1935 she was still creatively active, drawing portraits and creating arts and crafts. After Kurt Lohse divorced her in May 1935 she was incapacitated due to \\"incurable insanity\\". After refusing to consent to a sterilisation, she was denied the permission to go out of the hospital any more. In December 1935, she underwent a forced surgical sterilisation in the Dresden-Friedrichstadt women's hospital on the grounds of Nazi eugenicist policies. After this traumatic event she never painted again. In 1940 she was deported to the former psychiatric institution at Pirna- Sonnenstein (located in the Sonnenstein castle in Pirna), where, on 31 July, she was murdered along with the majority of the other residents as part of the Nazi \\"euthanasia\\" program, Action T4. The official cause of death was \\"pneumonia with myocardial insufficiency\\". In the years of 1940 and 1941, a total of 13,720 mainly mentally ill or handicapped people were gassed by Nazis in this institution formerly well known for its humanistic traditions. Works A female patient. Woman with landscape., 1929. Her most creative period falls within the time of her stay in Hamburg. From 1927 to 1931, she painted some of her major works. The portraits of mentally ill people she drew in Hamburg-Friedrichsberg (1929) and Arnsdorf (1932–1935) have attracted much interest. As part of the \\"degenerate art\\" campaign by the Nazis nine of her works from the art museum Hamburger Kunsthalle and the Altonaer Museum were confiscated and presumably destroyed in 1937, as well as a large part of her paintings from Arnsdorf. Commemoration and legacy Renewed interest in Lohse-Wächtler started with a presentation of some of her paintings in Reinbek near Hamburg. In 1994, an association for the promotion of the works of Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler was founded (Förderkreis Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler). 1996 saw the publication of the first monograph on her works, written by Georg Reinhardt. This and the exhibitions in Dresden, Hamburg-Altona and Aschaffenburg marked the beginning of a broader reception of the artist's work and fate. In 1999, there was a stele erected in memory of her at the Saxon Hospital in Arnsdorf and a ward house named after her. In Pirna-Sonnenstein, a street was dedicated to her in 2005, and since 2008, a street in Arnsdorf also carries her name. At the former hospital site in Friedrichsberg (Hamburg- Barmbek-Süd), a rose garden with a commemorative plaque was designed for her in 2004.

Jean Ango (italianized version for Jehan Angot) (1480–1551) was a Norman ship-owner who provided ships to king of France Francis I for exploration of the globe. A native of Dieppe, Ango took over his father's import-export business, and ventured into the spice trade with Africa and India. He was one of the first French to challenge the monopoly of Spain and Portugal, in addition to trading with the eastern Mediterranean, the British Isles, and the Low Countries. He also helped to finance the voyages of Giovanni da Verrazzano and Jacques Cartier. His father (also named Jean Ango) sent two ships to Newfoundland in an early colonization attempt, including Jehan Denis and Thomas Aubert as captain of the Pensée. Their arrival in 1508 is the second recorded voyage of a French ship to the Grand Banks after the expedition of John Cabot. After his father's death (probably in the final years of the reign of King Louis XII), the younger Jean Ango stopped any personal participation in trading voyages and settled in Dieppe with his inherited fortune. He eventually controlled a fleet, partially or alone, of 70 ships, including merchant ships and fishing vessels. Although he funded expeditions for trade and exploration, and used his ships (legally) for wartime raids, \\"he also sponsored voyages whose only purpose was piracy\\". Ango was an intimate friend of King Francis I. In 1521 he was styled Viscount of Dieppe, and in 1533, after the king had visited him in his mansion in Normandy, captain of Dieppe. When John III of Portugal confiscated one of his ships which carried plunder from captured vessels, Ango received the French king's permission to respond. Acting under a letter of marque issued on 26 July 1530, he harassed the Portuguese fleet in the Atlantic, and even threatened to block the port of Lisbon. He lost popularity under King Henry II. Already nearly bankrupt after his forced participation in a royal armament project, he was imprisoned after 1549 for failing to pay taxes on his profits from privateering. In his book La chanson des pilotes, he was the first to describe in writing the use of tobacco. Notes Further reading *Knecht, R.J. Renaissance Warrior and Patron: The Reign of Francis I.

In 1865 he demonstrated that tuberculosis was an infectious disease. Biography Villemin was born in the department of Vosges, and studied medicine at the military medical school at Strasbourg, qualifying as an army doctor in 1853. Afterwards he practiced medicine at the military hospital of Val-de-Grâce in Paris. In 1874 he became a member of the French Académie Nationale de Médecine, and was its vice-president in 1891. Villemin proved that tuberculosis was an infectious disease by inoculating laboratory rabbits with material from infected humans and cattle. He published his results in the treatise Etudes sur la Tuberculosis (Studies on Tuberculosis). Here he describes the transmission of tuberculosis from humans to rabbits, from cattle to rabbits, and from rabbits to rabbits. However, his findings were ignored by the scientific community at the time, and Villemin's contributions wouldn't be realized until years later when they were corroborated by other scientists. The Prix Leconte was posthumously awarded to Villemin (and its ₣50,000 presented to his heirs) in 1893 in recognition of his work.

The film was based on a best-selling novel from 1924 of the same name, written by Percy Marks, a Brown University English instructor who chronicled the life of the fast-set of that university and used the fictitious Sanford College as a backdrop. The Plastic Age is known to most silent film fans as the very first hit of Clara Bow's career, and helped jumpstart her fast rise to stardom. Frederica Sagor Maas and Eve Unsell adapted the book for the screen. Plot Hugh Carver (Donald Keith) is an athletic star and a freshman at Prescott College. During a hazing initiation by his fraternity brothers, he meets Cynthia Day (Clara Bow), a popular girl who loves to party and have a good time. She introduces him to the pleasures of illicit drinking, dancing at illegal roadhouses, and getting nasty in the back seats of cars. A love-triangle develops between Day, Carver, and Carver's roommate, Carl Peters (Gilbert Roland), who also likes Day. Eventually, Peters gives up his crush on Day and reconciles his friendship with Carver. Carver's grades, athletic performance and moral character begin to suffer as a result of his late nights and wild partying, and on a visit home, his strict father tosses him out of the house and tells him not to come back until he's 'made good'. After almost being arrested at a roadhouse raid, Day and Carver escape in her automobile, and Day realizes that her lifestyle is bad for Carver, so the two stop seeing each other. Carver's school performance then improves greatly, and he leads his teammates to victory at the big football game at the end of the year. Peters tells Carver that Day still loves him, and that she has changed, becoming less wild and more mature. Day and Carver are reunited at the end. Background The Plastic Age was based on the 1924 novel of the same name, which was written by Brown University professor Percy Marks, a popular novelist at the time. Marks' novels were based on his students, the 'flaming youth in rebellion' of the twenties, who danced to wild jazz, drank from silver flasks, and had petting parties. Benjamin Percival Schulberg, the CEO of Preferred Pictures (a film studio & film distributor, as well as an actors agency), outbid all the major and minor studios for the rights to The Plastic Age; Schulberg paid $35,000 for the copyrights to the novel. The Plastic Age was filmed in the summer of 1925, at both Pomona College, located in Claremont, California, and in Hollywood, at the FBO Studios, the production company owned and operated by Joseph P. Kennedy, the wealthy Boston, Massachusetts banker/stockbroker patriarch of the Kennedy family. The film became a major hit in late 1925, and was Bow's first hit film. She became a star as a result of its success, which led her to being signed by a major studio and becoming a major star with the 1927 release of It. After seeing The Plastic Age soon after its release, Adolph Zukor, the founder and CEO of Paramount Pictures, contacted Schulberg, who had started his career as a publicist with Paramount before leaving the studio in 1918 to form Preferred Pictures. According to Clara Bow biographer David Stenn, Zukor proposed to Schulberg that he wanted to merge Preferred Pictures with Paramount, so that he could get Bow and make a star out of her, due to what Zukor saw as the great potential that she had as an actress. Schulberg agreed, but wanted Zukor to allow him to produce and control the product that Paramount assigned to him for Bow, which included script, casting, production crew, and wardrobe control. He also wanted to be made an associate producer at Paramount. The deal was made in early November 1925. Controversy Even though the film was a wide spread success, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) showed concerns for the films portrayal of Alcohol consumption as acceptable, regardless of the restrictions that prohibition brought in. They also voiced their opinion on the Swingers Dance style and Jazz music as \\"behaviour which is desperately in need of purification by the cleansing powers of Holy water\\" Cast Promotional photo from The Plastic Age. * Clara Bow as Cynthia Day * Donald Keith as Hugh Carver * Mary Alden as Mrs. Carver * Henry B.

DVD release The Plastic Age is currently available on DVD, through Image Entertainment, in a double-feature format, which includes the Louise Brooks film, The Show Off (1926). David Shepard preserved the film through his company, Film Preservation Associates. Composer Eric Beheim scored the music for The Plastic Age. Kino On Video released the film in August 1999, as part of a 4 video set featuring Clara's work, which includes It (1927); the set is still available in the VHS format as of March 2012.

On 30 November 2004, the McDonnell Douglas MD-82 overran the runway of Adi Sumarmo Airport and crashed onto a cemetery on landing. 25 people on board were killed in the crash, including the captain. Investigation conducted by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee concluded that the crash was caused by hydroplaning, which was aggravated by wind shear. Aircraft The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, with line number 1173 and manufacturer's serial number 49189 made its first flight on 13 November 1984, later delivered on 20 December 1984 and operated by Mexican carrier Aeroméxico as XA-AMP and named ”Aguascalientes” before being acquired by Lion Air in 2002 and registered as PK-LMN. Lion Air had sold the aircraft to another airline for delivery in January 2005. Accident Flight 583 took off from Jakarta at around 17:00 local time (West Indonesian Time) carrying a total of 146 passengers and 7 crew members. Most of the passengers were members of the Nahdlatul Ulama, who were attending a national meeting held after the victorious result of the 2004 Indonesian Presidential Election. The flight was uneventful until its landing. The flight arrived at the airport during dusk, at around 18:00 local time in heavy rain. A thunderstorm was reportedly present during the landing. Flight 583 was configured appropriately for landing, touched down \\"smoothly\\" according to most passengers, and the thrust reversers were deployed. The aircraft, however, failed to slow adequately, overran the runway and slammed into an embankment. The impact caused the floor of the front portion of the plane to collapse, reportedly killing many of the passengers. The aircraft split into two sections, coming to rest in the end of the Runway and fuel began to leak. Passengers had difficulty locating emergency exits in the waning light. Some of the passengers self-evacuated through the opening in the fuselage. =Immediate aftermath= The airport was closed and emergency services were notified. Injured passengers were transported by police vehicles and ambulances to numerous hospitals across Solo. At least 14 of the dead were transported to the Pabelan Hospital. 6 people, 2 dead and 4 injured, were transported to Panti Waluyo Hospital. Others were transported to Oen Kandangsapi, Brayat Minulya, Kasih Ibu, Oen Solo Baru and PKU Muhammadiyah, as well as facilities in Boyolali and Karanganyar. Survivors with minor injuries were treated inside the airport VIP terminal. 25 people were killed and 59 others were seriously injured. Passengers and crew Most of the passengers were Indonesians, while airport officials confirmed that one Singaporean woman was among the injured. The pilots at the control of the flight were Captain Dwi Mawastoro and First Officer Stephen Lesdek. Captain Dwi died in the crash while First Officer Lesdek survived with serious injuries. Investigation The newly elected Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ordered an immediate investigation onto the cause of the crash of Flight 583 and stated that the investigation should be open to the public to prevent unwanted rumors in the aftermath of the crash. Minister of Transportation Hatta Rajasa stated that the Transportation Department would evaluate the Indonesian airline operations in response to the crash of Flight 583 in addition to two other similar incidents which occurred on the same day. The black box was subsequently found on 1 December 2004 and was transported to the Adi Sumarmo Emergency Operations Center. A witness to the crash claimed that lightning struck the plane during its landing phase. According to him, the landing light and the interior lighting were extinguished after the strike. Lion Air \\"claimed responsibility\\" for the crash and stated that they would pay the hospital bills of the survivors. However, they denied that the crash was caused by the airline's misconduct and stated that weather was the main factor. According to them, Flight 583 experienced a tailwind during its landing, which explained why the plane didn't stop. Others claimed that the brakes or the thrust reversers malfunctioned. The pilot did not put the throttle into flight idle, this cause the spoiler to retract, one of the reverse thrust also found to be faulty. The preliminary report was published in 2005. Investigators stated that the plane's braking system was not at its optimum level. This condition was aggravated by weather conditions during the accident. Investigators also identified a faulty thrust reverser as one of the cause of the crash; they subsequently issued several recommendations to Lion Air.

After discovering they are both heading for the same location he offers to give her a motorcycle ride to where they are staying. On the way, they are spotted by paparazzi for the tabloid magazine Amour, who track the two down. As Saijo refuses to grant the photographers an interview, they plot their revenge by taking a picture of the couple having breakfast on a balcony and print it under the headline \\"The Love Story of Miyako Saijo\\". Aoye is outraged by this false scandal and plans to sue the magazine. During the subsequent media circus, Aoye is approached by a down-and-out lawyer, Hiruta (Takashi Shimura), who claims to share Aoye's anger with the press. Aoye takes him for his attorney, but Hiruta, desperate for money to cure his daughter with terminal tuberculosis, Masako (Yôko Katsuragi), accepts a bribe from the editor of the magazine to throw the trial. The trial proceeds badly for the plaintiffs. Struck by the kindness of Aoye and Saijo towards his Masako, and Masako's own disgust at the way he is handling the case, Hiruta becomes ridden with guilt.

It was broadcast on BBC 1 each weekday following the early evening news, and included the regional opt-out programmes. Outline It followed a magazine format, combining political analysis and discussion with consumer affairs, light entertainment and sports reporting. It began on 9 September 1969, running between Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:00pm, before being extended to five days a week in 1972. From 1976 until 1981 the start time was 5:55pm. The final edition was broadcast on 5 August 1983,Jeff Evans, (1995) The Guinness Television Encyclopedia. Middlesex: Guinness. and the following October it was replaced by Sixty Minutes. The long-running Watchdog programme began as a Nationwide feature. The light entertainment was quite similar in tone to That's Life!, with eccentric stories such as a skateboarding duck and men who claimed that they could walk on egg shells. Richard Stilgoe performed topical songs. The show's tendency to sidestep serious matters in favour of light pieces was parodied in an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus, where the show, instead of reporting on the opening of the Third World War, chose to feature a story about a \\"theory\\" that sitting down in a comfortable chair rests one's legs. After the introduction and round-up, the BBC regions opted out for a twenty- minute section of local news round-ups (Midlands Today, Points West, Wales Today, South Today, Look East, Reporting Scotland, Spotlight, Look North, Scene Around Six). Once they had handed back to Lime Grove Studios in London, the regions remained on standby to participate in feedback and two-way interviews to be transmitted across the whole BBC network. The programme's second, and best known theme tune, was a library piece called The Good Word, composed by Johnny Scott.Factual/The Good Word Off the Telly The show was used in an influential cultural/media studies project at the University of Birmingham, known as The Nationwide Project. Nationwide for London and the South East For all of its run, Nationwide provided the regional news for the BBC London/South East region, as this was the only BBC region not to have its own dedicated news team. During the regional opt-out, the Nationwide presenters provided the latest news and weather for the London and South East region from the Nationwide studio. A further peculiarity was that as this segment had no regional branding at all in London and the South East, it carried the Nationwide title despite only covering local news. This changed at the start of 1982, when the regional programmes and Nationwide were separated. Now Nationwide's title sequence was shown after the regional programmes and the London/South East news was now called South East at Six. However, it was still presented by the Nationwide team, used the Nationwide theme and, for the first few months, the opening titles were the same as for Nationwide but with local images superimposed. Later that year, when Nationwide introduced a new title sequence, South East at 6 started using different graphics that had no reference to Nationwide, though still with the Nationwide music. When Nationwide was replaced by Sixty Minutes, the situation returned to how it had been before 1982 and lasted until 1984. Margaret Thatcher On the Spot In May 1983, during a general election special of its \\"On the Spot\\" feature. Diana Gould, a teacher from Cirencester,Obituary: Diana Gould, Daily Telegraph, 8 December 2011 persistently challenged Margaret Thatcher about her ordering of the sinking of the General Belgrano when it was sailing away from the Falklands. Thatcher denied that the Belgrano had been sailing away, but Gould quoted map references and continued to push her point across, encouraged – so the Conservative party claimed – by presenter Sue Lawley. When Thatcher asked her whether she accepted that the Belgrano had been a danger to British shipping when it was sunk, Gould told her that she did not. Thatcher was extremely angry about the BBC for allowing the question.Michael Cockerell, (1988) Live from Number 10: The Inside Story of Prime Ministers and Television. page 238, London: Faber & Faber. Thatcher's husband Denis lashed out at Roger Bolton, the editor of the programme, in the entertainment suite, saying that his wife had been \\"stitched up by bloody BBC poofs and Trots\\". Archive status As a contemporary programme Nationwide was only recorded on broadcast videotape in the event of possible complaint or litigation; after a period of time tapes would be wiped and re-used although filmed reports were archived. Consequently, only a few complete editions exist in their original form. However, in his book The Television Heritage (1989), author Steve Bryant claimed that \\"a virtually complete collection of the BBC magazine programme Nationwide from 1971 to 1980\\" existed as domestic recordings.When domestic video recorders had become available in the early 1970s, the BBC started making Programme as broadcast (PasB) recordings of most news and current affairs programmes – until then only audio recordings had been made for future editorial review purposes. He wrote: > \\"Already virtually doomed is material held on early domestic tape formats > manufactured by Sony, Shibaden and Philips.

Ballon () is the appearance of being lightweight and light-footed while jumping. It is a desirable aesthetic in ballet and other dance genres, making it seem as though a dancer effortlessly becomes airborne, floats in the air, and lands softly. The name is widely thought to be derived from the French word ballon (meaning \\"balloon\\"), though it has been dubiously claimed that the name was inspired by French ballet danseur Claude Balon, who was known for performing exceptionally light leaps. Physics A dancer will appear to defy the laws of physics when ballon is exhibited effectively. For example, during a grand jeté, the dancer may appear to hover in the air. Physically, the dancer's center of mass follows a ballistic trajectory, as does any projectile, but observers have limited ability to reckon center of mass when a projectile changes its configuration in flight. By raising the arms and legs while ascending and lowering them while descending, the dancer alters the apparent path of the center of mass and, in so doing, seems to observers to be momentarily floating in the air. Dancers strive to exhibit ballon in large jumps as well as in small, quick jumps such as petite allegro steps. For example, ballon is a characteristic of pas de chat. The dancer starts from a plié (bent knees) and then, during the ascending phase of the step, lifts each knee in succession with hips turned out, so that for a moment both feet are in the air and the dancer appears to be suspended in air. To give the appearance of lightness when landing, the dancer pliés and rolls the foot from toe to heel.

Dosulepin was once the most frequently prescribed antidepressant in the United Kingdom, but it is no longer widely used due to its relatively high toxicity in overdose without therapeutic advantages over other TCAs. It acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and also has other activities including antihistamine, antiadrenergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, and sodium channel-blocking effects. Medical uses Dosulepin is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder. There is clear evidence of the efficacy of dosulepin in psychogenic facial pain, though the drug may be needed for up to a year. Contraindications Contraindications include: * Epilepsy as it can lower the seizure threshold * TCAs should not be used concomitantly or within 14 days of treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to the risk for serotonin syndrome * Acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction as TCAs may produce conduction defects and arrhythmias * Liver failure * Hypersensitivity to dosulepin Side effects Common adverse effects: * Drowsiness * Extrapyramidal symptoms * Tremor * * Disorientation * Dizziness * Paresthesias * Alterations to ECG patterns * Dry mouth * Sweating * Urinary retention * Hypotension * Postural hypotension * Tachycardia * Palpitations * Arrhythmias * Conduction defects * Increased or decreased libido * Nausea * Vomiting * Constipation * Blurred vision Less common adverse effects: * Disturbed concentration * Delusions * Hallucinations * Anxiety * Fatigue * Headaches * Restlessness * Excitement * Insomnia * Hypomania * Nightmares * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Incoordination * Seizures * Paralytic ileus * Hypertension * Heart block * Myocardial infarction * Stroke * Gynecomastia (swelling of breast tissue in males) * Testicular swelling * Impotence * Epigastric distress * Abdominal cramps * Parotid swellings * Diarrhea * Stomatitis (swelling of the mouth) * Black tongue * Peculiar taste sensations * Cholestatic jaundice * Altered liver function * Hepatitis (swelling of the liver) * Skin rash * Urticaria (hives) * Photosensitisation * Skin blisters * Angioneurotic edema * Weight loss * Urinary frequency * Mydriasis * Weight gain * Hyponatremia (low blood sodium) * Movement disorders * Dyspepsia (indigestion) * Increased intraocular pressure * Changes in blood sugar levels * Thrombocytopenia (an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood. This makes one more susceptible to bleeds) * Eosinophilia (an abnormally high number of eosinophils in the blood) * Agranulocytosis (a dangerously low number of white blood cells in the blood leaving one open to potentially life- threatening infections) * Galactorrhea (lactation that is unassociated with breastfeeding and lactation) Overdose The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other TCAs. Dosulepin may be particularly toxic in overdose compared to other TCAs. The onset of toxic effects is around 4–6 hours after dosulepin is ingested. In order to minimise the risk of overdose it is advised that patients only receive a limited number of tablets at a time so as to limit their risk of overdosing. It is also advised that patients are not prescribed any medications that are known to increase the risk of toxicity in those receiving dosulepin due to the potential for mixed overdoses. The medication should also be kept out of reach of children. Interactions Dosulepin can potentiate the effects of alcohol and at least one death has been attributed to this combination. TCAs potentiate the sedative effects of barbiturates, tranquilizers and depressants. Guanethidine and other adrenergic neuron blocking drugs can have their antihypertensive effects blocked by dosulepin. Sympathomimetics may potentiate the sympathomimetic effects of dosulepin. Due to the anticholinergic and antihistamine effects of dosulepin anticholinergic and antihistamine medications may have their effects potentiated by dosulepin and hence these combinations are advised against. Dosulepin may have its postural hypotensive effects potentiated by diuretics. Anticonvulsants may have their efficacy reduced by dosulepin due to its ability to reduce the seizure threshold.

The smaller the value, the more strongly the drug binds to the site. } Dosulepin is a transporter blocker of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), thereby acting as an SNRI. It is also an antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor, α1-adrenergic receptor, serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mACh), as well as a blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). The antidepressant effects of dosulepin are thought to be due to inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and possibly also of serotonin. Dosulepin has three metabolites, northiaden (desmethyldosulepin), dosulepin sulfoxide, and northiaden sulfoxide, which have longer terminal half-lives than that of dosulepin itself. However, whereas northiaden has potent activity similarly to dosulepin, the two sulfoxide metabolites have dramatically reduced activity. They have been described as essentially inactive, and are considered unlikely to contribute to either the therapeutic effects or side effects of dosulepin. Relative to dosulepin, northiaden has reduced activity as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, antihistamine, and anticholinergic and greater potency as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, similarly to other secondary amine TCAs. Unlike the sulfoxide metabolites, northiaden is thought to play an important role in the effects of dosulepin. Although Heal & Cheetham (1992) reported relatively high Ki values of 12 and 15 nM for dosulepin and northiaden at the rat α2-adrenergic receptor and suggested that antagonism of the receptor could be involved in the antidepressant effects of dosulepin, Richelson & Nelson (1984) found a low KD of only 2,400 nM for dosulepin at this receptor using human brain tissue. This suggests that it in fact has low potency for this action, similarly to other TCAs. =Pharmacokinetics= Dosulepin is readily absorbed from the small intestine and is extensively metabolized on first-pass through the liver into its chief active metabolite, northiaden. Peak plasma concentrations of between 30.4 and 279 ng/mL (103–944 nmol/L) occur within 2–3 hours of oral administration. It is distributed in breast milk and crosses the placenta and blood-brain barrier. It is highly bound to plasma proteins (84%), and has a whole-body elimination half-life of 51 hours. Chemistry Dosulepin is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzothiepine, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. It is the only TCA with a dibenzothiepine ring system to have been marketed. The drug is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain- demethylated metabolite northiaden (desmethyldosulepin) being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, doxepin, and trimipramine. Dosulepin exhibits (E) and (Z) stereoisomerism like doxepin but in contrast the pure E or trans isomer is used medicinally. The drug is used commercially as the hydrochloride salt; the free base is not used. History Dosulepin was developed by SPOFA. It was patented in 1962 and first appeared in the literature in 1962. The drug was first introduced for medical use in 1969, in the United Kingdom.

Since 1730, it has been the official symbol of Kazan. This winged snake is mentioned in legends about the foundation of Kazan. A Zilant is a legendary creature with the head of a dragon, the body of a bird, the legs of a chicken, the tail of a snake, the ears of a canine, red wings, sharp teeth, dark-gray feathers and scaly dark-gray skin. Nomenclature and etymology Coat of arms of Kazan Governorate (1730). tamğa (sign) of Kazan's Millennium. قازان is a Tatar name of the citytransliteration: qazan written in İske imlâ. The word Zilant is the English transcription of Russian Зилант, itself a rendering of Tatar yılan/елан, pronounced (or sometimes ) and meaning a snake. Modern flag of Kazan, officially adopted in 2004 The Tatars themselves, on the other hand, frequently refer to this creature with the Persian word Ajdaha (dragon)pronounced , Cyrillic: Аждаһа, Iske imla: اژدها or Ajdaha-yılan (Dragon-snake). Tatars regarded it as a repulsive creature, corresponding to European and Persian dragons. According to Idel-Ural beliefs, any snake that survives for 100 years turns into an ajdaha. The Zilant/Ajdaha differs from Aq Yılan (White Snake), which is the king of snakes. Aq YılanCyrillic: Ак Елан, Iske imla: آق یلان or Şahmarapronounced (from Persian shah (king) and mar (snake)Cyrillic: Шаһмара, Iske imla شاهمار advised and helped epic heroes (batırlar), Cyrillic: батыр often by giving them gifts. As regards his beneficial influence on humans, Aq Yılan resembles Chinese dragons. Chuvash and Mari (ethnic groups living in the area of Kazan alongside the Tatars) also have legends relating to the foundation of Kazan, but none of them refer to the Kazan dragon. After the 16th century, Russians acquired the foundation legend from Tatars. For Kazan Russians, Zilant had negative connotations, as it was represented as a Slavic dragon rather than as a snake. Western culture has strongly influenced the popular perception of Zilant among citizens of Kazan, and many modern citizens imagine Zilant largely as a classically Western wyvern or dragon - as depicted in films. No strong evidence survives that an image of a dragon or snake with wings occurred in any coat-of-arms of Kazan city or of the Kazan khanate before the Russian invasion of 1552. (Islam - the official faith of the khanate - prohibited making images of animals.) Modern Tatar villages do not have any such thing as coats of arms nor symbols of towns. (Note however that all raions of Russia adopted coats of arms recently (ca. 2004) and that the Russian Empire's uyezd centers had coats of arms before 1917). Zilant is proper name in the Russian language and the role of Zilant as a symbol of Kazan functions mostly as an element of Russian culture nowadays. Snakes with wings appear in legends in Tartar culture, and a dragon - ajdaha - plays a role in fairy tales. Legends Most legends related to Kazan are contradictory and Zilant is no exception. There are several variations on the Zilant legend. According to one story, a beautiful damsel married a resident of Old Kazan. She had to get water from the Qazansu River and complained to the local khan his capital was poorly situated. She advised him to move the city to Zilantaw Hill, and the khan agreed. However, the hill was infested with numerous snakes which were \\"stout as a log\\". Their leader was a giant two-headed snake, i.e., Zilant. One head ate only grass, while the other swallowed virgins and youths. A wizard advised the khan to build a straw and wood near the hill. In spring, the snakes came out from their winter burrows and crept into the pile of straw. A knight errant was sent out to set the pile of straw on fire, burning out the snakes. They were deadly even in death, \\"killing people and horses with their stink\\". However, the gigantic two-headed snake-dragon escaped to the Qaban lakes. According to the story he still lives in the waters of the lake and, from time to time, takes vengeance on the citizens. According to other stories, the giant snake was transformed into Diü, a spirit who founded the underwater kingdom of the lake. It is also said that Zilant did not escape to the lake but instead tried get revenge upon the knight, who by that time had ridden some 50 çaqrımpronounced away from Kazan. During the fight that followed, Zilant cut the hero into six parts. The knight, however, had managed to stab the dragon with his poisoned pike, and Zilant eventually died. There is also a legend about Zilant's return to Zilantaw. They say that Zilant re-established himself in a big cave near the hill. The dragon would occasionally fly over the panic- stricken city and drink water from the Black Lake.This is a modern name of the lake. That time it was known as Çerek Kül, i.e. Foul Lake, sometimes noted in Russian chronicles as Poganoye At first the people of the city paid tribute to him, but later they managed to kill him with a wizard's help. Рафаэль Мустафин, \\"Озеро Кабан\\", Казань, 1989. =Related legends= According to one legend, when Bulgars came to found the town of Bilär, they discovered a big snake. They decided to kill it, but the snake begged for peace and pleaded with Allah to give her wings. Once she had her wings the snake flew away from Bilär. Another great snake was said to live in a pagan tower temple at Alabuğa. Although the Bulgars adopted Islam as early as the 10th century, the snake survived until the time of Tamerlane's invasion after which it disappeared. Ibn Fadlan, who visited Volga Bulgaria in the 10th century, referred to numerous snakes, especially in trees. Ibn Fadlan wrote about a huge fallen tree, longer than hundred ells. He saw a big snake at the trunk of the tree, almost as large as the tree itself. The Bulgars allayed his fears by assuring him that the snake was not dangerous. Interpretations The popular historian Lev Gumilyov pointed out in his Ancient Turks that the Kypchaks, one of the ancestors of modern Tatars, came from the Zheliangpinyin; original source was Chinese: ?墚 Valley in the Altay Mountains. In his opinion, the nearby Zheliang Mountain and Zheliang settlement were named after Zilant the White Snake. If there is any truth in Lev Gumilyov's idea, then the dragon of Kazan should be regarded as a remnant of the once popular Turkic totem. Gumilevica These flying snakes were also known in Bolghar, Suar, Bilär and the other cities of Volga Bulgaria. For the most part, these snakes were benevolent. However, in the boundary fortresses of Kazan, Alabuğa and Cükätaw, legends about flying monsters flourished. One particular fortress on the Shishma River was known as Yılantaw, later russified as Yelantovo. Many scholars believe that Zilant, like other flying snakes, symbolized the evil rulers of the neighboring pagan peoples. The legendary burning of the snakes may symbolize the victory of Islam over paganism. Sceptics say that the Bulgars purposefully spread those legends in the border regions in order to dismay their neighbors. There is also speculations that Zilant's origination was not from the White Snake, but the Falcon (Börket), an image similar to Zilant from an earlier epoch. Zilantaw in Kazan Zilantaw hill with Zilantov Monastery Zilantaw Hill (originally Tatar Yılantaw/Елантау/Жылантау,pronounced or Snake Mount),also Зилантова гора/Zilantova gora in Russian associated with Zilant legends, was formerly situated on the bank of Kazanka River. Some researchers support the view that Kazan was founded here, citing ancient Tatar legends as support. Other legends place the city foundation at Iske Qazan, the Qaban settlement, an Old Tatar settlement from the 16th century. However, these legends ignore the Kazan Kremlin, which is actually the oldest part of the city. It is probable that a small settlement, not the city of Kazan, had existed at Zilantaw in the Bulgarian epoch (12th–14th centuries). The nearest settlement, Biş Balta, has been known since Khanate's epoch. In 1560 the Zilantov Monastery of AssumptionRussian: Зилантов Успенский женский монастырь was established on the hill. In recent centuries, the hill was covered with an old Russian cemetery, attested to since the Khanate's epoch. During the excavations in the 1970s, vestiges of an original monastery were unearthed. The most ancient layer contained indications of a great fire, lending support to the legend about the burning of the snakes. In historians' opinion this great fire would have occurred during the Mongol invasion. Zilantaw actually used to be a high and waterless island, which would make it the best place for snakes to hibernate during winter. The nearest lake was called Zmeinoye or Zmievo, that is, Snake Lake. However, in 1957 Qazansu's course was changed so that the old riverbed, separated from the Kuybyshev Reservoir, was swamped. Nowadays, Zilantaw is an unpractical depressive area, surrounded by plants and depots. The old cloister was reopened here in 2005. Zilantov Monastery Web-site Zilant as a state symbol Some Tatar flags After the conquest of Kazan in 1552, Ivan the Terrible adopted this image with the title of Kazan's khan (tsar). Zilant was also featured in a seal of False Dmitry I as well as a flag of Tsar Alexis. Early Russian images represent Zilant with one head, four chicken legs, a bird's body and a snake tail. This representation is thus a cockatrice rather than a dragon. In 1730 a royal decree established Zilant as a coat of arms of the Kazan Governorate. It was described in the decree as a \\"black snake, crowned with the gold crown of Kazan, red-winged on the white field\\". Being the coat of Kazan, Zilant was incorporated into the Russian Imperial coat of arms. The image was added to the arms of all the towns in the governorate. Zilant also appeared on the coat of arms of Kashira, a town located to the south of Moscow, as it was an appendage town of the exiled Kazan khan Ğäbdellatíf back in the 16th century. After 1917, the governorate was abolished and along with it, all the imperial emblems that featured Zilant. Kazan Metro interior left Discussion about restoring Zilant as a city symbol resumed in the 1990s. Supporters of Zilant referred to the state insignia of the Khanate of Kazan. Some Tatar nationalists, however, dismissed the use of Ajdaha-Zilant as an evil symbol of aggression, derogatory to the Tatars and their statehood. They also pointed out that Zilant might be construed as the dragon killed by Saint George as represented on the Coat of arms of Moscow. According to this popular interpretation, Saint George would then symbolize Muscovy, and the \\"dragon\\" would symbolize Kazan. It was eventually decided that Zilant should be associated with Aq Yılan (White Snake) as a positive Turkic spirit. During the Millennium of Kazan in 2005, Zilant was reinstated as a symbol of Kazan. It is now featured in the coat of arms of Kazan and as well as in the municipal jack. Zilant in art and culture  Zilant could be seen at the decorative elements all over Kazan.

It was created at the Chaplin Studio. It was a quickly made two-reeler to help fill a gap while working on his first feature The Kid. It is about a day outing with his wife and the kids and things do not go smoothly. Edna Purviance plays Chaplin's wife and Jackie Coogan one of the kids. The first scene shows the Chaplin Studio corner office in the background while Chaplin tries to get his car started.

Gags revolve around seasickness, which Charlie, a fat couple, and even the boat's all-black ragtime band succumb to, deckchairs, and Charlie's comic pugnacity. This is followed by a scene of the family returning home, and encountering trouble at an intersection, which involves a traffic cop, and hot tar. Reception A Day's Pleasure is almost universally regarded as Chaplin's least impressive First National film. Even contemporary critics were muted in their enthusiasm, as evidenced by this mixed review from The New York Times of December 8, 1919 : > \\"Charlie Chaplin is screamingly funny in his latest picture, A Day's > Pleasure, at the Strand, when he tries in vain to solve the mysteries of a > collapsible deck chair. He is also funny in many little bits of pantomime > and burlesque, in which he is inimitable.

It is 4 miles (6.4 km) long and runs from the west of Bracknell to the north west of Winnersh. It is one of a small number of parts of the motorway system in England that are managed by the local highway authority, in this case Wokingham Borough Council, rather than Highways England. Route A329(M) motorway near Wokingham From south to north, the route starts to the north of Bracknell and runs directly from the A329. It passes east of Wokingham in countryside. It then crosses the M4, continues north and meets the A3290 at Winnersh Triangle west of which see the status-downgraded A3290 road, to the junction with the A4. It is managed locally, by Wokingham Borough Council, rather than by Highways England. Death of construction workers The formwork over its new River Loddon bridge should have supported the concrete while being poured but collapsed. Three men died and ten were injured in the wreckage. The Bragg report considered why this happened and made recommendations as to how formwork should be designed and tested, to make bridge construction safer. Around 500 tons of concrete, with the steelwork and planking that should have supported it, dropped into the river. It was the eighth span of a total of 33 which make up the viaduct. History The first section of the road opened in 1973, and went from the Winnersh junction to a temporary terminus at the A321. A further section to the North/West of Winnersh — due to open at the same time — took the road up to the junction with the A4 to the east of Reading, running to the north of the railway line and dividing the Earley area of Reading almost in two. However the opening of this section was delayed due to the collapse of the Loddon Viaduct on 24 October 1972, which killed three people and injured ten others. This section subsequently opened in 1974. The third and final section to be completed was the southern section of the motorway which was built to a standard dual two lane motorway specification (D2), and was opened in 1975. This extended the road to the A329/B3408 junction at Amen Corner roundabout. The section of Berkshire Way (and the construction of the flyover) came some years later, allowing traffic to flow from Reading and the M4 past the official end of the motorway onto the Southern and Western industrial areas of Bracknell. The large free-flow interchange between the A329(M) and the M4 was constructed as part of plans for an M31 motorway which was originally planned to extend down to the M3 (and possibly beyond) in the south. In the early nineties the section of the A329(M) that met the A4 east of Reading was downgraded to an A road to enable the hard shoulder to be used by a park-and-ride bus service. It was then renamed the A3290. The Park and Ride bus service car park is subject to flooding and this causes frequent closures of the service. A feature of the A329(M) is its wide grass central reservation north of the M4. The cross-section of the motorway was built in this way to support future widening to dual-three lane standard, which was never introduced: the later southern section to Amen Corner lacks this provision. Because of this wide central reservation, the A329 (M) was formerly one of the only motorways in the United Kingdom to have no central barriers on some stretches. However, as of 2010, almost the entire length of the road has had a central reservation barrier installed, possibly due to accidents over recent years. In 2006, on an area to the south of the A329(M) just beyond the actual designated motorway section, construction began on a new housing development—Jennett's Park. A new roundabout retaining an eastbound through lane was built on the A329 to provide access to this development. It was finished in early 2011. In 2015 the A329(M) was reduced to a single lane each way through Junction 10 by Highways England.

B-34). The two other prominent modes or styles are the Dravida or Dravidian of South India and the Nagara of North India. Vesara is a combination of features from these two temple styles, and its own original characteristics.Harle, 254 The term was used by ancient writers, but possibly not with the same meaning as in modern usage. For this and other reasons, it is avoided by some writers, such as Adam Hardy.Hardy, 8 Alternative terms for the whole time span of the tradition, from the 7th to the 13th century CE, include Karnata Dravida (Hardy's choice),Hardy, 8, referring to the very early Karnata Kingdom, which occupied roughly the north of the modern state of Karnataka. 'Central Indian temple architecture style', 'Deccan architecture', or for shorter periods, terms referring to local dynasties, such as \\"Chalukyan architecture\\", or more precisely Early Chalukya or Badami Chalukya architecture and Later or Western Chalukya architecture,Hardy, 8: \\"Chalukyan\\" is used by the pioneering Victorian historian James Fergusson. Early and Later Chalukya are used by George Michell, who avoids \\"vesara\\". See Michell, 146-149 and Hoysala architecture (see the more detailed articles on these). Among those who do use \\"vesara\\", there is some disagreement as to what periods to use it for. Such disagreements are very largely restricted to matters of nomenclature: whether the term is useful, and if so, what it should cover, in particular whether the Early as well as the Later Chalukya is included in \\"Vesara\\". There is general agreement about most aspects of the actual surviving buildings. The term \\"vesara\\" Etymologically, the term vesara is believed by some to have been derived from the Sanskrit word vishra meaning an area to take a long walk. The quarters of Buddhist and Jain monks who left urban areas to live in cave temples were called viharas. Alternatively, it derives from a word meaning mule, in reference to the hybrid nature of the style.Hardy, 8 Like Nagara and Dravida, the term is used in both north and south Indian ancient texts for a major type of temple design, but it is now generally agreed that the south Indian texts do not refer to non-Dravida styles, but to particular types of floor plan, all in southern Dravida temples. It is in the north Indian texts that Nagara and Dravida refer to different modes, languages or styles of temple architecture, found respectively in north and south India. These two terms are very widely used in modern sources. But what the original meaning of Vesara was in such texts remains somewhat unclear.Hardy, 7-8; Harle, 254 Description The three shrines of the late 11th-century Kedareshvara Temple, Balligavi, from behind the main shrine; the two side shrines are seen side-on. Miniature northern shikharas used as motifs. The Vesara style (if defined as beginning only with the Western Chalukyas in the late 10th-century) contains elements of both Dravida and Nagara styles. In particular the shape of the superstructure over the sanctum is usually pyramidal in profile, and shorter than the northern shikhara tower. In plan the walls and superstructure are broadly circular, or a straight-sided cone, though its geometry is based on rotating a square imposed on a circle. It has rather different decoration and motifs to either. One common motif is in fact miniature shikharas, often of the bhumija type, showing that the architects were well aware of northern styles.Harle, 254 Like the southern vimana superstructure, the Vesara equivalent is strongly divided into storeys or steps, but there are more of them, and the kapota roof motif that is so common in contemporary southern vimanas is less dominant. George Michell describes a characteristic feature as \\"the obscuring of the outer profile of the building by multiplying the projections of the walls and superstructure; these move restlessly from one plane to another, relying upon effects of light and shade to lend the building its solidity and shape.\\"Michell, 146-147 There are generally prominent sukanasa projections from the tower on the roof over an antarala antechamber to the sanctum. The mandapa is generally larger than the sanctum and its vimana. Further open mandapas may be larger still. Temples with more than one shrine develop, especially those with three.Harle, 256 These are usually with three entrances off the same mandapa, as at the Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura and Kedareshvara Temple, Balligavi; the two side shrines are at 90° to the central, main one. History The Kesava shrine at the Chennakeshava Temple, Belur Historians agree that the vesara style originated in what is today Karnataka. According to some, the style was started by the Chalukyas of Badami (500-753AD) whose Early Chalukya or Badami Chalukya architecture built temples in a style that mixed some features of the nagara and the dravida styles, for example using both the northern shikhara and southern vimana type of superstructure over the sanctum in different temples of similar date, as at Pattadakal. However, Adam Hardy and others regard this style as essentially a form of Dravida. This style was further refined by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (750-983AD) in sites such as Ellora. Though there is clearly a good deal of continuity with the Badami or Early Chalukya style, Michell, 149 other writers only date the start of Vesara to the later Western Chalukyas of Kalyani (983-1195 AD),Harle, 254 in sites such as Lakkundi, Dambal, Itagi, and Gadag,Harle, 256-261 and continued by the Hoysala empire (1000-1330 AD). The Hoysala temples at Belur, Halebidu and Somnathpura are leading examples of the Vesara style.Harle, 261-263 These temples are now proposed as a UNESCO world heritage site.

Koestler hypothesized that the Khazars (who converted to Judaism in the 8th century) migrated westwards into Eastern Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries when the Khazar Empire was collapsing. Koestler used previous works by Douglas Morton Dunlop, Raphael Patai and Abraham Polak as sources. His stated intent was to make antisemitism disappear by disproving its racial basis. Popular reviews of the book were mixed, academic critiques of its research were generally negative, and Koestler biographers David Cesarani and Michael Scammell panned it. Summary =Contents= Koestler advances the thesis that Ashkenazi Jews are not descended from the historical Israelites of antiquity, but from Khazars, a Turkic people originating in and populating an empire north of and between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Koestler's hypothesis is that the Khazars – who converted to Judaism in the 8th century – migrated westwards into current Eastern Europe (primarily Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, Hungary and Germany) in the 12th and 13th centuries when the Khazar Empire was collapsing. At the end of the book's last chapter, Koestler summarizes its content and his intentions as follows: \\"In Part One of this book I have attempted to trace the history of the Khazar Empire based on the scant existing sources. In Part Two, Chapters V-VII, I have compiled the historical evidence which indicates that the bulk of Eastern Jewry — and hence of world Jewry — is of Khazar-Turkish, rather than Semitic, origin. In the last chapter I have tried to show that the evidence from anthropology concurs with history in refuting the popular belief in a Jewish race descended from the biblical tribe.\\" =Sources= Mattias Gardell writes that Koestler's thesis is \\"partly based on amateur anthropology\\", and its scientific arguments come from The Myth of a Jewish Race (1975) by Raphael Patai and his daughter Jennifer.Biale, David. Blood and Belief: The Circulation of a Symbol Between Jews and Christians, University of California Press, 2008, , p. 259.

Neil McInnes writes that Dunlop was, however, \\"much more tentative\\" in his conclusions, as were other historians of Khazars, including Peter Golden and Moses Shulvass. Golden himself described the book as \\"controversial\\", stating it contained \\"sweeping claims of Khazar legacy and influence\\".Golden, Peter B., \\"Khazar Studies: Achievements and Perspectives\\", in Golden, Peter B.; Ben-Shammai, Haggai; Róna-Tas, András. The World of Khazars: New Perspectives, Brill Publishers, 2007, , p. 9. =Koestler's reason for writing it= Koestler biographer Michael Scammell writes that Koestler told French biologist Pierre Debray- Ritzen he \\"was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of Eastern European Jews (the ancestors of today's Ashkenazim) were descended from the Khazars, the racial basis for anti-Semitism would be removed and anti-Semitism itself could disappear\\".Scammell, Michael. Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic, Random House, 2009, , p. 546. According to George Urban, Koestler's desire to connect Ashkenazi Jews with Khazars was \\"based on a tacit belief that the intellectual brilliance of and international influence of Hungarians and Jews, especially Hungarian Jews or Jewish-Hungarians, was due to some unexplained but clearly ancient affinity between the two peoples\\".Urban, George. Radio Free Europe and the Pursuit of Democracy, Yale University Press, 1997, , p. 200. Reception In The Invention of the Jewish People, Shlomo Sand, historian of cinema, French intellectual history, and nationalism at Tel Aviv University, writes \\"while the Khazars scared off the Israeli historians, not one of whom has published a single paper on the subject, Koestler's Thirteenth Tribe annoyed and provoked angry responses. Hebrew readers had no access to the book itself for many years, learning about it only through the venomous denunciations\\".Sand, Shlomo. The Invention of the Jewish People, Verso Books, 2009, p. 238. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Chronicle of Higher Education editor Evan Goldstein states \\"Sand suggests that those who attacked Koestler's book did so not because it lacked merit, but because the critics were cowards and ideologues. 'No one wants to go looking under stones when venomous scorpions might be lurking beneath them, waiting to attack the self-image of the existing ethnos and its territorial ambitions.'\\"Goldstein, Evan R. \\"Where Do Jews Come From?\\", The Wall Street Journal, 29 October 2009. In the Arab world the theory espoused in Koestler's book was adopted by persons who argued that if Ashkenazi Jews are primarily Khazar and not Semitic in origin, they would have no historical claim to Israel, nor would they be the subject of the Biblical promise of Canaan to the Israelites, thus undermining the theological basis of both Jewish religious Zionists and Christian Zionists.See: *Plaut, Steven. \\"The Khazar Myth and the New Anti-Semitism\\" , The Jewish Press, 9 May 2007. *Rossman, Vadim. Russian Intellectual Antisemitism in the Post-Communist Era, University of Nebraska Press, 2002, , p. 86. The Saudi Arabian delegate to the United Nations argued that Koestler's theory \\"negated Israel's right to exist\\".Scammell, Michael. Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic, Random House, 2009, , p. 547. Koestler did not see alleged Khazar ancestry as diminishing the claim of Jews to Israel, which he felt was based on the United Nations mandate and not on Biblical covenants or genetic inheritance.Barkun, Michael. Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement, University of North Carolina Press, 1994, , pp. 144–145. In his view, \\"[t]he problem of the Khazar infusion a thousand years ago... is irrelevant to modern Israel.\\" Koestler's book was praised by the neo-Nazi magazine The Thunderbolt as \\"the political bombshell of the century\\", and it was enthusiastically supported by followers of the Christian Identity movement.Gardell, Mattias.

According to Jeffery Kaplan, The Thirteenth Tribe was \\"Identity's primary source for the Khazar theory\\"; they felt Koestler's book confirmed their own beliefs regarding Jews,Kaplan, Jeffrey.

Goldstein writes that \\"Koestler and the Khazar theory he advanced lives on in the fever swamps of the white nationalist movement\\".Goldstein, Evan. \\"Inventing Israel\\", Tablet Magazine, 13 October 2009. Michael Barkun writes that Koestler was apparently \\"either unaware of or oblivious to the use anti-Semites had made of the Khazar theory since its introduction at the turn of the century.\\" Assessment After it was first published, Fitzroy Maclean in The New York Times Book Review called The Thirteenth Tribe excellent, writing \\"Mr. Koestler's book is as readable as it is thought-provoking. Nothing could be more stimulating than the skill, elegance and erudition with which he marshals his facts and develops his theories.\\"Maclean, Fitzroy. \\"Shalom Yisrah\\", The New York Times Book Review, 29 August 1976, p. 219. Reviewing the work in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs in 1991, journalist and author Grace Halsell described it as a \\"carefully researched book\\" that \\"refutes the idea of a Jewish 'race'.\\"Halsell, Grace. \\"Book Reviews. The Thirteenth Tribe\\", Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, May/June 1991, p. 71. Despite some positive reviews in the press, James A. Beverley writes \\"When The Thirteenth Tribe was released, the academic critique of its research was prompt, public, and generally negative\\",Beverley, James A. Nelson's Illustrated Guide to Religions, Thomas Nelson, 2009, , p. 342. and Evan Goldstein states that it was \\"savaged by critics\\". An August 1976 review in Time magazine described Koestler's theory as \\"all too facile, despite the obvious effort and time the author spent on his study\\", and stated that \\"Koestler offers a blizzard of information but not enough hard facts to support his thesis\\".Sheppard, R.Z. \\"Books: Caucasian Connection\\", Time magazine, 23 August 1976. A November 1976 review in National Review stated that the work had \\"neither the value of a well-executed honest piece of scholarship nor the emotional appeal of a polemic – only the earmarks of a poorly researched and hastily written book\\".Majeski, Jane. \\"Chutzpah: The Thirteenth Tribe, by Arthur Koestler\\", National Review 27, 12 November 1976, p. 1248, cited in Blumstock, Robert. \\"Going Home: Arthur Koestler's Thirteenth Tribe\\", Jewish Social Studies 48:2, 1986, p. 94. Koestler's analysis was described as a mixture of flawed etymologies and misinterpreted primary sources by Chimen Abramsky in 1976 and Hyam Maccoby in 1977.Abramsky, Chimen. \\"The Khazar Myth\\", Jewish Chronicle, 19, 9 April 1976.Maccoby, Hyam. \\"Koestler's Racism\\", Midstream, 23, March 1977. Barkun describes the book as an \\"eccentric work\\", and writes that Koestler was \\"unequipped with the specialist background the subject might be thought to require\\", but that he \\"nevertheless made an amateur's serious attempt to investigate and support the theory.\\" Professor of Polish-Jewish history Gershon D. Hundert wrote in 2006 \\"There is no evidence to support the theory that the ancestors of Polish Jewry were Jews who came from the Crimean Jewish kingdom of Khazaria\\", describing Koestler as the \\"best-known advocate\\" of the theory. In 2009, Jeffrey Goldberg wrote that the book was \\"a combination of discredited and forgotten [ideas]\\". Koestler biographers have also been critical of the work. In Arthur Koestler: The Homeless Mind (1998), David Cesarani states it makes \\"selective use of facts for a grossly polemical end\\" and is \\"risible as scholarship\\". In Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic (2009), Michael Scammell writes that Koestler's theory \\"was almost entirely hypothetical and based on the slenderest of circumstantial evidence\\", and takes the book as evidence that Koestler's brain \\"was starting to fail him\\".Scammell, Michael.

However, 11.5% of male Ashkenazim were found to belong to Haplogroup R1a, the dominant Y chromosome haplogroup in Eastern Europeans, suggesting possible gene flow. Referencing The Thirteenth Tribe, the study's authors note that \\"Some authors argue that after the fall of their kingdom in the second half of the 10th century CE, the Khazar converts were absorbed by the emerging Ashkenazi Jewish community in Eastern Europe.\\" They conclude: \\"However, if the R-M17 chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jews do indeed represent the vestiges of the mysterious Khazars then, according to our data, this contribution was limited to either a single founder or a few closely related men, and does not exceed ~ 12% of the present-day Ashkenazim\\".Almut Nebel, Dvora Filon, Marina Faerman, Himla Soodyall and Ariella Oppenheim. \\"Y chromosome evidence for a founder effect in Ashkenazi Jews\\", European Journal of Human Genetics, (2005) 13, 388–391. (Published online 3 November 2004). Writing in Science, Michael Balter states Koestler's thesis \\"clash[es] with several recent studies suggesting that Jewishness, including the Ashkenazi version, has deep genetic roots.\\" He refers to a 2010 study by geneticist Harry Ostrer which found that Ashkenazi Jews \\"clustered more closely with Middle Eastern and Sephardic Jews, a finding the researchers say is inconsistent with the Khazar hypothesis\\" and concludes \\"that all three Jewish groups—Middle Eastern, Sephardic, and Ashkenazi—share genomewide genetic markers that distinguish them from other worldwide populations\\". Geneticist Noah Rosenberg asserts that although recent DNA studies \\"do not appear to support\\" the Khazar hypothesis, they do not \\"entirely eliminate it either.\\"Balter, Michael. \\"Tracing the Roots of Jewishness\\", Science, 3 June 2010.

Wolf was born in Fällanden, near Zurich. He studied at the universities of Zurich, Vienna, and Berlin. Encke was one of his teachers. Wolf became professor of astronomy at the University of Bern in 1844 and director of the Bern Observatory in 1847. In 1855 he accepted a chair of astronomy at both the University of Zurich and the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Wolf was greatly impressed by the discovery of the sunspot cycle by Heinrich Schwabe and he not only carried out his own observations, but he collected all the available data on sunspot activity back as far as 1610 and calculated a period for the cycle of 11.1 years. Wolf's estimates of the solar cycle's period appear on p. 250 and p. 251. In 1848 he devised a way of quantifying sunspot activity. The Wolf number, as it is now called, remains in use. In 1852 Wolf was one of four people who discovered the link between the cycle and geomagnetic activity on Earth. Notices of Wolf's discovery appeared in: * * * The three other astronomers who observed a relation between the solar cycle and magnetic declination on Earth were: * Johann von Lamont (1805–1879) of Scotland and Germany: * Edward Sabine (1788–1883) of Ireland: From p. 103: \\" … I have had the satisfaction of finding that the observations [of magnetic declination] of these years [i.e., 1846–1848] confirm … the existence of a periodical variation, which … corresponds precisely both in period and epoch, with the variation in the frequency and magnitude of the solar spots, recently announced by M. Schwabe … \\" * Jean-Alfred Gautier (1793–1881) of Switzerland: On pp. 189–190, after discussing Schwabe's discovery of the solar cycle, Gautier presents Lamont's findings on the relation between the solar cycle and the periodic variations in the magnetic declination. Gautier mentions that the Austrian astronomer Augustin Reslhuber (1808–1875) confirmed Lamont's findings. (Reslhuber's confirmation appeared in: ) Around 1850, to study the laws of probability, Wolf performed a Buffon's needle experiment, dropping a needle on a plate 5000 times to verify the value of π, a precursor to the Monte Carlo method.

He succeeded Alan Davidson as Australia's premier fast bowler and was in turn succeeded by Dennis Lillee, playing with both at either end of his career. McKenzie was particularly noted for his muscular physique (hence his nickname) and ability to take wickets on good batting tracks. His father Eric McKenzie and uncle Douglas McKenzie played cricket for Western Australia and Garth was chosen for the Ashes tour of England in 1961 aged only 19. He made his debut in the Second Test at Lord's, where his 5/37 (including the last three wickets in 12 balls) wrapped up the England innings to give Australia a 5 wicket victory.  Early years  McKenzie grew up in a sporting family. His father, Eric McKenzie, was an opening batsman who played once for Western Australia, against the touring South African cricket team in 1931–32. His uncle, Douglas McKenzie, was a batsman who represented Western Australia on several occasions, scoring 88 in his last game against Lindsay Hassett's Services team in 1945–46. Douglas went on to become President of the Western Australian Cricket Association. Both Douglas and Eric also represented Western Australia in field hockey. In his youth, McKenzie was an all rounder, batting right- handed and bowling off spin. Aged twelve, he gained selection for Western Australia in the 1953–54 under-14 interstate competition held at Adelaide, but the team withdrew after a polio epidemic in Western Australia. The next season, he captained the state when the competition was held in Perth, leading his team to the championship. McKenzie attended John Curtin High School, where he performed well with both bat and ball in the school's first XI. At sixteen he was made his first grade debut for Claremont-Cottesloe as a batsman, but after unproductive performances was dropped to the second XI. The following year in 1958–59, he continued in second grade and took up fast bowling, taking 50 wickets at an average of 14.50 after his team had a pace bowling shortage. He was recalled to the First XI in 1959–60. He finished the season with 515 runs at an average of 39.46 and 49 wickets at an average of 11.21. His efforts were rewarded when the state selectors handed him a debut for the penultimate match of the Sheffield Shield season against Victoria in Melbourne. He went wicketless and scored 22 and 41. He took his first wickets in the final match against South Australia at Perth with 3/69. At season's end, his captain Ken Meuleman advised McKenzie to concentrate on his fast bowling.  International career  The 1960–61 season began with McKenzie's third first-class match, against the West Indies. He did not bowl in the first innings but took 4/41 in the second to seal a 94 run win, prompting West Indies captain Frank Worrell to predict a bright future. Further strong performances during the Shield season saw him selected at age 19 for the 1961 Ashes tour under Richie Benaud. Following an injury to Benaud, Australia replaced him with a third seamer, allowing McKenzie to make his debut in the Second Test at Lord's during the \\"Battle of the Ridge\\". In his first innings, he made 34 on his twentieth birthday batting at number 10 on a difficult pitch. The last two wickets added 102 and Australia gained a lead of 134. In England's second innings, McKenzie captured the prized wickets of Ted Dexter and Peter May, and took the last three wickets in twelve balls to give 5/37 on debut. Australia went on to win by five wickets. After losing the Third Test at Headingley, Australia won the fourth Test at Old Trafford with McKenzie again making a valuable contribution with the bat. With a lead of only 177 with nine wickets down in the second innings, McKenzie joined Alan Davidson. He held his end for 32 runs while Davidson's powerful hitting saw 98 added for Australia's highest tenth wicket partnership on English soil. This allowed Benaud to bowl Australia to victory on the final day. The youngest member of the touring party, McKenzie was one of eight bowlers to take at least fifty wickets. When Dexter's Englishmen toured Australia in 1962–63, McKenzie was promoted to share the new ball with Davidson. Playing in all five Tests, he did not trouble the batsmen to the same extent as his partner, taking 20 wickets for 30.95. He was noted for his ability to contain the opposition by bowling long spells. Davidson retired at the end of the series and McKenzie became the pace spearhead when South Africa toured in 1963–64. He was Australia's leading bowler with 16 wickets at 43.06. In the Third Test in Sydney, he hit his highest Test score of 76.  Pace spearhead  1964 saw McKenzie make his second Ashes tour of England. He led the attack as Australia retained the Ashes. His 29 wickets in five Tests equalled the highest obtained for Australia in England by Clarrie Grimmett in 1930. He took 21 wickets when Australia visited India and Pakistan on the return journey to Australia. Another seven wickets in a one off Test against Pakistan in Melbourne in December established a new record for the number of Test wickets in the space of one year; from 11 December 1963 to 8 December 1964 he took 73 wickets in fifteen Tests. This surpassed Maurice Tate's 65 wickets in 1924–25. In this period, he became the youngest bowler to reach 100 wickets, at the age of 23 and 162 days, 139 days younger than A.L. Valentine. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1965, the first Western Australian born recipient. McKenzie had an unproductive tour of the West Indies in 1964–65 and had mixed fortunes in the 1965-66 Ashes series. He was not selected for the First Test, but took 5/134 in England's mammoth 558 the Second Test at Melbourne. He did little in the Third Test, which Australia lost by an innings, and was one of the five men dropped for the Fourth Test. Fortunately Peter Allan was injured and McKenzie was brought back into the team. The Adelaide Oval was notoriously flat, but McKenzie was an expert on getting batsmen out on dull wickets and used the humid atmosphere and fresh pitch to bowl Bob Barber for a duck and have John Edrich caught by the ever- reliable Simpson at slip. McKenzie took 6/48 to have England out for 241 and Australia won by an innings. He took 3/17 in the second innings in the Fifth Test to finish with 16 wickets (29.18), the chief wicket taker along with Neil Hawke who took 16 wickets (26.18). Thereafter McKenzie became one of the most consistent opening bowlers in the world. He toured South Africa in 1966–67 and in 1967–68 was dropped for the final two Tests after taking his only ten wicket match haul against India. This was speculated to be due to fears that his dominance over the Indian batsmen was diminishing public interest in the series. In 1968, McKenzie became a full-time cricketer, believing that it would offer him the best chance of financial security. At the time the Australian Cricket Board regarded its players as amateurs and paid them accordingly. McKenzie joined Leicestershire, captained until 1968 by the Western Australian skipper and former England Test stalwart Tony Lock. He took over four hundred wickets for the county and was instrumental in its four One Day Cricket trophies in the early 1970s and winning their first County Championship in 1975.http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/1/1152/1152.html In 1968–69 he took 30 wickets (25.26) against the visiting West Indies and at 27 became the youngest man to take 200 Test wickets, a record since beaten. Another 21 wickets (21.00) came on the Indian tour of 1968–69, but when the Australian team proceeded to South Africa his form slumped (1/333 in four Tests) and they were whitewashed. It led to suspicions that he had contracted hepatitis. He played in the first four Tests of the 1970-71 Ashes series against England, taking 4/66 in the Second Test at Perth, the first played at the WACA Ground and 2–22 in the first ever One Day International at Melbourne. In the Fourth Test at Sydney McKenzie retired hurt after being hit in the face by a bouncer from John Snow as the England fast bowler took 7–40 in England's 299 run victory.p101, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 He recovered sufficiently to break Geoff Boycott's forearm in a tour match just before the vital Seventh Test,p104, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 but was not recalled and was left stranded on 246 Test wickets, two short of Richie Benaud's Australian record. He was only 29 years old. He continued to play for Western Australia until 1974. He came out of retirement in 1977 to play in Kerry Packer’s World Series Cricket. After that, he moved his family to South Africa to play in domestic Limited Overs cricket, before returning to Western Australia. He has the record for taking the most dismissals, hit wicket (4), in Test match history. In 2010, McKenzie was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.

This was Chaplin's first film for First National Films. Chaplin plays opposite an animal as \\"co-star\\". \\"Scraps\\" (the dog) was the hero in this film, as he helps Charlie and Edna towards a better life. Edna Purviance plays a dance hall singer and Charlie Chaplin, The Tramp. Sydney Chaplin (Chaplin's brother) had a small role in this film; this was the first time the two brothers were on screen together. Charles Lapworth, a former newspaper editor who had met Chaplin when he interviewed him, took a role as a consultant on the film. Synopsis Charlie is jobless and has few prospects for employment. He tries to steal food from a lunch cart and is nearly caught by a police officer, avoiding arrest by doing some fancy rolling back and forth under a fence. Later, Charlie saves a stray dog (Scraps) from other dogs. Charlie and Scraps become fast friends and partners in purloining food. Charlie enters a cabaret where dogs are not allowed. Charlie hides Scraps in his baggy trousers, but Scraps' tail emerges from the back end. Charlie meets a girl who works in the cabaret. She is disillusioned with life, so Charlie attempts to cheer her up. Charlie is ejected from the cabaret for having no money and returns to his normal outdoor sleeping spot. By chance, thieves have buried a stolen wallet nearby that is laden with a small fortune. Scraps digs up the wallet. Charlie returns to the cafe and shows the girl he has enough money for them to be married. The crooks discover that Charlie has the wallet and violently take it back from him. Charlie fights furiously to reclaim it. This leads to a frantic chase which culminates in the thieves' arrest. Charlie uses the money to buy a farm for himself and his bride. The movie ends with the newlyweds peering fondly into a cradle. It contains Scraps and her puppies.

He is sometimes known as the Prince of the Thomists. His Four Books of Defenses of the Theology of St. Thomas Aquinas can be said to have sparked a revival in Thomism. Life Only scant details of his personal history are known. He was a Dominican affiliated with the province of Toulouse, and a general chapter of his order at Poitiers in 1407 assigned him to lecture on The Sentences at the University of Paris. He began in 1408 and achieved success. The following year he finished the first part of his celebrated defensive on commentary on the theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. He passed examinations for degrees at the Sorbonne in 1411 and in 1415. After serving for some time as regent of studies at Toulouse, he repaired to Rodez where he laboured at his commentaries completing the three remaining parts in 1426, 1428 and 1433. Works In the preface of a compendium of Capreolus's work by Isidore de Isolanis, it is stated that these manuscripts once narrowly escaped destruction by fire, a lay brother having saved them, to the joy of the author, who was then advanced in years. The same authority describes the erudite commentator as having a devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Though following the order of The Sentences, the commentaries of Capreolus are a calm, learned, and penetrating exposition of the teaching of St. Thomas, as well as a comprehensive defence against sundry opponents and critics, including Scotus, Henry of Ghent, John of Ripa, Guido the Carmelite, Aureolus, Durandus, Gregory of Rimini, William of Ockham, and other Nominalists. Copious and apt citations show that the author mastered Aristotle and his Arabic commentator, Averroes; but a scrupulous fidelity to the Angelical Doctor, that earned for him the extraordinary appellation of \\"Soul of St. Thomas\\", is his chief characteristic. There is nothing in the wide field of the doctrinal discussions of his time that Capreolus did not study and elucidate, in a style terse and vigorous. His work is one of the enduring achievements of Scholasticism. The commentaries, bearing slightly variant titles, were published in four folio volumes at Venice, 1483, 1514, 1519, 1589. ln 1881, Bishop Borret of Rodez, who had made the life and works of Capreolus, the object of considerable research, suggested a critically revised edition of the commentaries, which was at length undertaken by the Dominicans. Its publication was begun at Tours in 1900 under the title: Johannis Capreoli Tholosani, Ordinis Praedicatorum, Thomistarum principis, Defensiones Theologiae Divi Thomae Aq.de novo editae cura et studio RR. PP. Ceslai Paban et Thomae Pegues. Early compendiums of the work by Paul Soncinas and by Sylvester Prierias were much used in their day.

It was his third film for First National Pictures. Plot summary  Charlie works on a farm from 4 a.m. to late at night at the run- down Evergreen Hotel in the rural village of Sunnyside. He has endless duties inside the hotel as well as farm chores. Chaplin's boss is the local preacher who mistreats him badly. He gets his food and the boss' on the run (milking a cow into his coffee, holding a chicken over the frying pan to get fried eggs). Charlie's love interest in the village is the girl played by Edna Purviance. He loves her, but is disliked by her father. One day, while leading some cattle, a steer escapes into the church. Charlie tries to ride it out of harm's way, but instead is tossed off a small bridge. Unconscious, he dreams of an encounter with four beautiful nymphs who dance with him. Back in reality a city slicker is hurt in a car crash and is being cared for by Edna. He appears to have an eye for Edna too. Chaplin tries to win her back by dressing as the city man does—but his homemade spats only prompt ridicule. When Charlie is rejected after attempting to imitate the slicker, he appears to be preparing to commit suicide. However, the result is ambiguous with the film either having a tragic or a happy ending. Critics have long argued as to whether the final scene is real or a dream. Deleted Scene The 1983 documentary Unknown Chaplin contains a deleted scene in which Charlie also serves as the hotel's hapless barber. Albert Austin plays a man who has come in for a shave and gets more than he expected from the Evergreen Hotel's inept barber.

His Catechism of the Church of Denmark heavily influenced Danish and Norwegian religious thought and practice for roughly the next 200 years after its 1737 publication. Biography Pontoppidan was educated in Fredericia (1716–18), after which he was a private tutor in Norway, and then studied in Holland, and in London and Oxford, England. In 1721 he became informator of Frederick Carl of Carlstein (later duke of Plön), and two years later morning preacher in the castle and afternoon preacher in Nordborg. From 1726 to 1734 he was pastor at Hagenberg, where he so protected the pietists as to find it advisable to defend his course against the Lutherans with Dialogus; oder Unterredung Severi, Sinceri, und Simplicis von der Religion and Reinheit der Lehre (1726) and Heller Glaubensspiegel (1727). During this same period he laid the foundation of his later topographical and historical works in Memoria Hafniæ (1729); Theatrum Daniæ (1736); and the aforementioned Kurzgefasste Reformationshistorie der dänischen Kirche. Pontoppidan became successively pastor in Hillerød and castle preacher in Frederiksborg (1734), Danish court preacher at Copenhagen (1735), professor extraordinary of theology at the University (1738), and a member of the mission board (1740), meanwhile writing his Everriculum fermenti veteris (1736) and Böse Sprichwörter (1739). In 1736 Pontoppidan was directed by royal rescript to prepare an explanation of the catechism and a new hymnal, and through these two works — Sandhed til gudfrygtighed (1737) and the hymnbook (1740) — the pietistic cause in Denmark received powerful assistance. He likewise continued his historical investigations in his Marmora Danica (3 vols., 1739–41; a collection of noteworthy epitaphs and ecclesiastical monuments) and his uncritical Annales ecclesiæ Danicæ (4 vols., 1741–52); and also wrote a novel, Menoza (3 vols., 1742–43), a critique of the religious conditions of Denmark and other countries. In 1747 he was appointed bishop at Bergen, where he introduced many educational reforms, and wrote Glossarium Norvagicum (1749) and Versuch einer natürlichen Geschichte Norwegens (Copenhagen, 1752–53), while his pastoral letters formed in part the basis of his later Collegium pastorale practicum (1757). The antagonism which Pontoppidan roused at Bergen, however, obliged him to go in 1754 to Copenhagen, where he became prochancellor at the university in the following year. But all his plans in this capacity were thwarted by his opponents, and he sought consolation in writing, the results being his Origines Hafnienses (1760) and the first two parts of his Den danske Atlas (1763–67), of which the last five volumes were edited posthumously. He was also active as a political economist, being the editor of Danmarks og Norges ökonomiske Magazin (8 vols., 1757–64). Sea serpents Pontoppidan argued for the existence of the sea serpent, the kraken and the mermaid in his two-volume work, Versuch einer natürlichen Geschichte Norwegens (The Natural History of Norway), published in 1752 and 1753.

She was born in Haifa, Israel to Palestinian parents, but moved to Australia when she was 3 years old. Wiggins was a gymnast at the Australian Institute of Sport, then began diving when she was 12 on suggestion from her physiotherapist. Wiggins competed at her first Olympic Games for Diving when she was 17 years old at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. She won bronze in the 10m synchronised platform event at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, becoming the first Australian to win an Olympic medal in diving since Dick Eve in 1924 (with Rebecca Gilmore). She and Rebecca Gilmore were also the first Australian female Olympic diving medallists. She won bronze at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka after a successful year on the Diving Grand Prix circuit and was named Female Australian Diver of the Year. Loudy was known as being a powerful platform diver. After winning many National championships in both springboard and platform as well as many international medals, in 2002 she won gold in the 10m platform event at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and backed this up in 2003 by winning first place at an unprecedented three successive CAN-AM-MEX FINA Diving Grand Prix competitions coming home with 6 gold medals. She finished 2003 with a silver medal at the FINA Aquatic World Championships in the 10m synchronised diving event in Barcelona. In 2004, after finishing second in the 10m platform event at the Diving World Cup in Athens, Wiggins won bronze in the 10m event at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. She also won 2 silver medals the following year at the 2005 FINA World Aquatic Championships in Montreal in the 10m and 10m Synchro events and 2 gold medals at the same events at the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. Wiggins trained for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, but a calf injury suffered during the Olympic selection trials on 13 April 2008 prevented her from competing in the Games.http://www.sporttalk.com.au/loudy-wiggins-out-of-beijing-olympics/ After getting married and having her first child, Wiggins began a comeback, placing 14th at the Olympic Test Event in London. Returning to Australia, she partnered with Rachel Bugg and, after very limited preparation, defeated Melissa Wu and Alexandra Croak at the Australian Nomination Trials. and competed at her fourth Olympic Games at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, where, at 33, she was the oldest diver in the field. Wiggins has a degree in media and communications, from the University of Sydney, was on the Australian Olympic Committee Athletes' Commission and the Board of Directors of Diving Victoria from 2012 - 2016. Personal life She was born in Haifa, Israel and is of Palestinian background. She was born to Butros and Afaf Tourky, who moved to Australia when Loudy was three. Wiggins is married to former Carlton Australian rules football player Simon Wiggins. They have a daughter born in 2010 and a son born in 2013.

Names and sections The trail comprises a loop between Bellevue and Mount Helena, and a line from Mount Helena to Wooroloo. The loop, called Trail Loop, is in length, and follows the two Eastern Railway routes travelling east from Bellevue and meeting up again in Mount Helena, thus forming a loop. The southern route, which traverses Mundaring, is the First Route, opened in 1884. In contrast, the northern route, which passes through John Forrest National Park, follows the Second Route, opened in 1896. In Mount Helena the Railway Reserves Heritage Trail continues as a line in length, called Eastern Extension, onto Wooroloo. The line is coincident with this part of the Kep Track, which continues along the old railway route as far as Northam. In Kalamunda there is a railway heritage trail that follows the alignment of the old Upper Darling Range Railway. Sign identifying sponsors of upgrades to trail and facilities History It was created following the Western Australian Government Railways (the WAGR, as it was commonly known) ceasing to operate on the Bellevue to Northam railway following the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway in 1966. The first two attempts at the Eastern Railway from Bellevue to Chidlow, Western Australia both constructed before 1900 failed to have sufficiently low gradients for the increasing tonnages on the railway system. The Avon Valley route taken by the new Standard Gauge line, was the third and final attempt to take the railway system out of the metropolitan area across the Darling Scarp. The first two Eastern Railway formations were closed by an Act of Parliament in the 1960s, and the lands were vested with the Mundaring Council. As a result, most of the removable property of the WAGR - was removed from the reserve. Notably the Mundaring and Darlington concrete railway platforms remain, and approximately three telegraph poles remain along the original formation. Otherwise all rails, sleepers and buildings no longer remain. The Koongamia platform, although in use for only about five years in the 1960s, was re-built as public sculpture in the 2000s. Interesting exceptions to the removal of railway operations assets are the stationmaster's houses in Mundaring and Glen Forrest - these have been preserved and maintained. The Mundaring house is currently the location of the office of the Mundaring and Hills Historical Society. Considerable alterations have been made to the original railway formations by telecommunication, power, road and other authorities. In parts, roads named \\"Railway Terrace\\", and other old roads running parallel to the reserve remain unchanged. Australian Bicentenary In 1988 the Australian Bicentenary saw 17 Heritage Trails funded by the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments under the Commonwealth State Bicentennial Commemorative Program - as the W.A. Heritage Trail Network. The Railway Reserves Heritage Trail was developed by the Mundaring Bicentennial Community Committee, and a pamphlet and signage on the trail was funded by this as well. In the pamphlet and on the signage - the main stopping places as annotated, and the details go as far as Wooroloo. Current conditions In some parts the reserve is an important wildlife corridor, while other parts have been degraded by erosion and bushfire damage. It passes through the John Forrest National Park and is one of a number of named trails in the park. Considerable funds have been given to the Mundaring shire to maintain the reserve for use by walkers, cyclists and horse riders (hence the Bridle Trail name recurring). However, despite restraints, motor cyclists and others provide a regular hazard. Ecology and environmental context The two earlier routes of the Eastern Railway followed closely the line of two creeksthe first route followed Nyaania Creek which is part of the Helena River catchment, while the second followed Jane Brook which joins the Swan River at Middle Swan. Sections of the reserve have important ecological features that contain examples of a range of conditions found in the region. The whole trail is in effect a vital Wildlife corridor creating connections between adjacent parks and nature reserves: First Route or southern section * Greenmount National Park - adjacent reserve grounds - Greenmount and Boya * Darlington Recreation Ground - Darlington * Binbrook Park - Darlington * Glen Forrest Super Block - Glen Forrest * Strettle Road Reserve - Mahogany Creek * State Forest - Sawyers Valley John Forrest National Park section of trail east of Swan View Second Route or northern section * John Forrest National Park - Swan View and Hovea * Brookside Park - Hovea * Milligan Park - Stoneville * Leschenaultia Conservation Reserve - Chidlow * Beechina Nature Reserve - Beechina * Beechina North Nature Reserve - Beechina * Needham Nature Reserve - Wooroloo It also has named parks and reserves either within or linked in the legal bounds of the land designated as the trail: * Whybourne Park - Bellevue * Darlington Station Reserve - Darlington * M.J.

He was a fast bowler. Hogg played in 38 Test matches and 71 One Day Internationals between 1978 and 1985. In Tests he took 123 wickets at an average of 28.47. He is best remembered for taking 41 wickets in his first six tests during the 1978–79 Ashes. Career =Early career= Hogg had asthma as a child and battled it through his career. Hogg started out as a batsman before switching to be an aggressive fast bowler. He made his grade cricket debut for Northcote in 1967–68.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/569/569528.html He played for Victorian Colts in 1972–73. He was not able to break into the Victoria side so he transferred to South Australia where he began his first class career in 1975–76, taking seven wickets in his debut against Victoria.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/35/35902.html South Australia won the Sheffield Shield that summer, although Hogg's contribution was relatively minimal. Loss of players to World Series Cricket in 1977–78 saw Hogg mentioned as a possible test prospect that summer despite his lack of experience. He was unable to force his way into the test side – Jeff Thomson, Wayne Clarke, Ian Callen and Alan Hurst were the preferred fast bowlers – but he did take 36 first class wickets at an average of 27 over the summer, including 10–124 for South Australia against Queensland. =1978–79 Ashes: Test Debut= At the beginning of the 1978–79 summer, a fast bowling spot opened up in the Australian side when Jeff Thomson told selectors he would no longer be available for international matches. Hogg took 4–43 for South Australia against the touring English team and leapt into test contention. He was duly picked in the first test. His first class statistics at that stage were 54 wickets at 20. Hogg's selection was almost immediately in jeopardy when, in a Shield game against NSW, he had to minimise the amount of bowling due to stomach cramps and an asthma attack. However he recovered to take 5–73. Hogg had a magnificent first test, top scoring in Australia's first innings with 36, then taking 6–74 in England's first innings. However he could not prevent England from comfortably winning the match. His figures were even better in the second test, taking 5–65 and 5–67. Australia's batting did not support him and England won again.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63221.html Hogg won man of the match. Australia's fortunes changed in the third test – the batsmen managed to score some runs, and Hoggs' return of 5–30 and 5–36 helped the team to a 103 run victory.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63222.html Australia's bowlers performed excellently in the fourth test, dismissing England for 152 (Hogg 2–36). When Australia scored 294 in response they had an excellent chance of winning the game. However England made 346 in response (Hogg 4–67) and Australia collapsed for 111.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63223.html Hogg was then rested for a Shield game out of fear of injury. He returned to make made his one-day international debut against England, taking 1–20 in an Australian defeat.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64169.html Hogg's incredible run continued in the fifth test, taking 4–26 and 3–59, but Australia lost the match.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63224.html During the game Hogg had a confrontation with captain Yallop and left the field for an hour. Hogg asked to be not selected for the next international match, a one-day game, due to health concerns. Australia lost the 6th test with Hogg taking 1–42.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63225.html His 41 wickets in a series was a record for an Australian in an Ashes series (later broken by Terry Alderman), and is still (at the end of 2016) equal fifth for any player in any series.Most wickets in a series, ESPNcricinfo) That summer Hogg was tempted to move to Queensland for financial reasons but accepted a job offer from Hindmarsh Building Society to stay in South Australia. =1978–79 vs Pakistan= Hogg continued his good form into the two-match series with Pakistan, although returns of 4–49 and 3–75 in the first test could not prevent another Australian defeat.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63235.html Hogg was the center of some controversy while batting when run out off a no ball. Some strong batting and bowling saw Australia win the second test; Hogg had a comparatively poor match taking 1–88 and 2–45. One writer called it his \\"worst performance\\" at international level to date.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63236.html However, by the end of the summer Hogg was easily the leading first class wicket taker in Australia with 76 wickets at 16.43. There was controversy in April when Graham Yallop released a (ghost written) book about the Ashes, Lambs to the Slaughter where he claimed Hogg ran \\"roughshod\\" over him during the English series. \\"There was no way I tried to run roughshod over him\\", said Hogg. \\"I simply didn't get any support at all for field placings in the early Tests and that is why we had continual disagreements\\". Yallop said he didn't actually write the book and wanted the Hogg chapter re-written. The book was released regardless. =1979 World Cup= Hogg toured England with Australia for the 1979 World Cup. While in the country he and Peter Toohey participated in a double wicket competition. He took 2–11 in a trial game against New Zealand and withdrew from the game against Pakistan with a bronchial infection. He took Geoff Boycott's wicket in the game against England but Australia still lost (Hogg's figures were 1–25).http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65052.html Playing Canada, Hogg was hit for four fours in a row by Glenroy Sealy, and he was taken out of the attack with figures of 0–26 off two overs.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65059.html =1979 Tour of India= Hogg was expected to be one of Australia's main weapons against India on the 1979 tour. However he had a poor series. He started badly, being ill with stomach cramps and was pelted with rocks and fruit during a match against South Zone. He went for 2–85 in the first test,http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63241.html leaving the ground three times because of the heat and being no balled 21 times in his first 13 overs. He contributed some useful tail end batting helping Australia escape with a draw. Hogg performed worse in the second test. He was no balled fourteen times and wound up arguing with the umpire and bowling a beamer. \\"Both Rodney Hogg and (Australian captain Kim) Hughes apologised to the umpire concerned and that is as far as the matter will go\\", said manager Bob Merriman. \\"However I will be talking to him... and I will seek an assurance that nothing of this nature will happen again\\". He finished with figures of 0–118 – the first time he had failed to take a wicket in an innings – with 21 no balls.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63242.html According to one journalist: > What has happened? Can a man who sets records for wicket-taking in his first > series be reduced to bowling to a wicketkeeper unaccompanied by slips, > gullies or short legs? How can Hogg get no wicket for a hundred-odd in a > Test? There is no single answer. But the major factor was the pitch. It got > lower, slower and deader as the match progressed... There was a bit of bad > luck... Hogg was not slacking. His teammates will confirm that he has worked > harder on this tour than ever before. After the blow-up on the second day, > Hogg realised what was at stake. He did his best to sort out his no-ball > problem. Hogg continued to cause controversy in his next game against Central Zone. According to press reports, \\"Rodney Hogg cannot walk on to a cricket field in India without causing a stir. In nine overs against Central Zone yesterday he bowled 18 no balls, hit one batsman on the head, sent another to hospital with three teeth knocked out and was warned for running on the wicket.\\" Captain Kim Hughes admitted for the first time that Hogg was struggling for his place in the team. \\"It's something new for him and it will be important for us to see how he handles it,\\" said Hughes. Hogg's form improved in the third test with figures of 4–66 (including a spell of 3–14) and 1–49.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63243.html In the fourth test he took 0–91,http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63244.html 2–103 and 0–26 in the fifthhttp://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63245.html and 2–53 in the sixth.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63246.html He took 20 wickets at 37.35 for a whole tour. Reflecting on the series Kim Hughes said, \\"Rodney Hogg was disappointing. He took a long while to get to grips with the conditions.\\" =1979–80: Post World Series Cricket= Due to his success the previous summer, Hogg was considered a strong chance to play in the reunified Australian side along with Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. He ensured his selection with 6–95 for South Australia against the touring West Indies. He was one of only four non-WSC players picked for the first test against the West Indies (the others were Dymock, Border and Hughes). Hogg said, \\"I did pretty poorly in India, but that was in India, and this series is in Australia – so they've decided to give me another chance, which I'm very grateful for\\". He played in an ODI before the test against the West Indies. Hogg's took 0-55 and 2–11 in the first test.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63253.html A back injury flared up, meaning he missed the next test, against the English side. He returned to national colours in a one-day international, taking 4–46 against England, then played the second test against the West Indies, earning figures of 0–59 in the first innings; Hogg's back injury recurred and he had to leave the field while Australia was bowling.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63254.html Hogg dropped out of the Australian side for the rest of the summer. Hogg had been picked in the initial 18 man squad to tour Pakistan (which was going to be cut down to 14) but he pulled out because of the injury. =1980–81= Hogg began the 1980–81 season with injury worries. He recovered to take 6–75 against Victoria and was recalled to the test side to play the second test against New Zealand, replacing a dropped Geoff Lawson. Hogg had a good game, taking 2–29 and 2–25.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63277.html He was also recalled to the one day side. He followed it with 4–60 and 2–14 in the third test.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63278.html He was kept in the side to play India, taking 1–54 and 1–24 in the first testhttp://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63279.html and 2–100 and 0–11 in the second.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63280.html He was made 12th man for the third game. Hogg had enjoyed a strong summer – 42 first class wickets at 22.85 – and was picked on the 1981 tour of Sri Lanka and England. =1981 Ashes= He got into trouble in Sri Lanka after bowling beamers, but bowled well in early tour games. He took 3–47 in the first test.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63289.html However his back injury flared up again and his form fell away. \\"He has a muscular spasm in his back\\", captain Kim Hughes said. \\"It's no use playing him unless he is... fit. It's no good if he goes into the match feeling that he might break down\\" There was discussion that he might have to be replaced on tour by Carl Rackemann. He was replaced by Ray Bright for the second test but passed a fitness test and was kept on in the squad. He rediscovered his form, taking 6–87 against Northampshire and 3–10 in a one-day game, but the selectors persisted with Bright for the third test. After taking 3–42 in a tour game he replaced Geoff Lawson in the fourth test. Hogg took 1–41 and 0–18.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63292.html However his back injury flared up again and Hogg was overlooked for the fifth test; Mike Whitney was called up to replace him. He passed a fitness test which meant he stayed with the squad. He took 3–39 in a one-day tour game to put him back in contention for a test place. He took four wickets in a game against Sussex but was plagued with no ball problems and was ruled out for the sixth test. He took 27 first class wickets on the tour over all at 24.33 with his best being 6–87. On his return to Australia Hogg was diagnosed with Scheurmann's disease, a long-term degeneration of the vertebrae. He missed the 1981–82 season. =1982–83 Ashes= Hogg returned to first class cricket in 1982–83, bowing in tandem with Joel Garner for South Australia. Twelve wickets against Queensland and 6–132 against New South Wales saw him discussed as a test prospect once more. Injuries to Carl Rackemann, Terry Alderman and Dennis Lillee led to his selection in the third test in the 1982–83 Ashes. He took 2–41 and 1–53, his bowling described as \\"brilliant\\".http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63326.html He was kept on for the fourth test, taking 4–69 and 3–64.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63327.html In the fifth he took 1–50 and 0–25.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63328.html English captain Bob Wilis said Australia's fast bowling trio of Hogg, Lawson and Jeff Thomson was a key reason in Australia winning the Ashes. He took 49 first class wickets that summer at 22.85 – his highest tally after 1978–79. Hogg was also picked in Australia's one day team that summer. He was injured in a game against New Zealand but bowled extremely well in that format throughout the summer. =1983 vs Sri Lanka= Hogg toured Sri Lanka with the Australian side. In the sole test he took 1–31 and 0–7.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63342.html =1983 World Cup= Hogg was picked to in the squad for the 1983 World Cup.

His final figures were 3–20 and 1–72.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63356.html He bowled well in the second test too taking 2–43 and 0–11.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63357.html Things were harder in the third, Hogg returning figures of 1–123.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63358.html Hogg's back injury meant he declared himself unfit for the fourth test and was replaced by John Maguire. He was back for the fifth, taking 0–60 and 2–53.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63360.html He also played in Australia's one day team. Highlights included 4–34 against Pakistan. and 4–37 against the same team. During the 1983–84 season, Hogg took 1–10 off ten overs in the McDonald's Cup semi final, helping South Australia win.

He had a good first test with the bat, making 52 (his highest first class score), but took 2–48 and 0–56 with the ball.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63367.html He took 1–103 in the second testhttp://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63368.html – a match best remembered for the fact that Hogg threw a punch at captain Kim Hughes on the field. Hogg's best performance came in the third test, taking 6–77.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63369.html A side strain saw him out of the fourth test.

There was some talk Hogg might make a good Australian captain but Alan Border was appointed with Hogg as his vice captain. Hogg took 1–75 and 3–77 in the third test.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63385.html He withdrew from a Shield game with a knee injury then took 2–96 and 0–40 in the fourth.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63386.html That would be the last test Hogg played for Australia.

He also did not play in the World Championship of Cricket. Hogg was left out of the Australian squad to tour Sharjah in 1985 – Graeme Wood was appointed vice- captain instead. Hogg was also left out of the squad to tour England in 1985. He had endured a relatively lean season – 15 first class wickets at 43.53. =South African rebel tour= Rodney Hogg was interested in touring South Africa. He met with Ali Bacher in London during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. \\"I was pretty much in from day one,\\" said Hogg. I was in my mid-30s, and the idea was that the tour wouldn't happen for another year or two. Had it been on in 1983, I'd have been less interested as I was still in the Test side and doing well at the time.... I was pretty happy with the money on offer. My career was pretty much over by then. Fast bowlers don't last forever. Prime minister [Bob] Hawke called us traitors. I thought that if it was okay for Hawke to trade with South Africa, it was okay for me to go and play cricket there.\\" Hogg signed up for two rebel tours to South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87 during apartheid times. This gave him a three-year ban practically ending his international career. \\"I have no regrets whatsoever about going on those tours,\\" he said in 2016. The first tour he took 21 first class wickets at 24.52 with a best return of 5–83 and 13 one-day wickets at 21. On the second tour he got 22 wickets at 20.13. Post-playing career After retirement from first class cricket, Hogg was a bowling coach for the Victorian team working alongside David Hookes. In 2005–06 he was a selector for Victoria. On Australia Day 2012 Hogg sparked a controversy when he posted an offensive tweet about Allah. He later removed the tweet and apologised, claiming it was just a bad attempt at Australian humour. Hogg's autobiography is titled The Whole Hogg – Inside the mind of a lunatic fast bowler. He said that former England captain Mike Brearley had a \\"degree in people\\". In 1990, when Shane Warne made his first class debut, Hogg boldly predicted in his column in The Truth that Warne would play 100 tests and take 500 wickets.An Australian anecdote ... or two, Siddhartha Vaidyanathan, ESPNcricinfo, 2 Jan 2008The shady past of wide-brim Warney, Peter Hanlon and Martin Blake. The Age, December 27, 2007 Hogg said he was sacked from the column soon after, but Warne exceeded the prediction, taking 708 wickets in 145 tests. Rodney Hogg has been a regular commentator for Channel 7 in Australia and since 2001 has been working as a corporate speaker throughout Australia.

He's believed to have died before 420. He is venerated as a Saint by Catholics, Greek Orthodox believers and Copts, his feast being kept on 4 December. He brought into his episcopal city the relics of so many martyrs that it received the surname Martyropolis. He was a friend of Saint John Chrysostom. He acted as an ambassador between the East Roman Emperor and the Persian Emperor. In the interests of the Church of Persia, which had suffered much in the persecution of Shapur II, he came to Constantinople, but found Emperor Arcadius too busily engaged in the affairs about the exile of St. John Chrysostom. Later Maruthas was sent by Emperor Theodosius II to the court of Persia, where, notwithstanding the Magi, he won the esteem of King Yazdegerd I of Persia by his affability, saintly life,The Armenian Life of Marutha of Maipherkat, Ralph Marcus, The Harvard Theological Review, 49. and, as is claimed, by his knowledge of medicine. So Marutha managed to negotiate a peace between the two empires. He was present at the general First Council of Constantinople in 381 and at a Council of Antioch in 383 (or 390), at which the Messalians were condemned. For the benefit of the Persian Church he is said to have held two synods at Ctesiphon.

The phrase PRO-DG was originally registered as a UK trademark, but the hyphen was never used for a released version and the suite has subsequently been known as ProDG. The suite consisted of console hardware- specific assemblers, a C/C++ compiler, ELF/DLL linkers, and a source-level debugger. The build tools could be controlled either from the command line or integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio. The artist preview software tool, ProView, and Tuner, a profiler and performance optimizer, were also included in some versions of ProDG.  Components  = Compiler = From 2004 the suite included the SN Systems Compiler, SNC, tailored for specific hardware requirements, rather than a derivative of the compiler provided by the console manufacturer, frequently a variant of the GNU Compiler Collection. The SNC compiler was designed to improve code generation, reduce the size of debug data, provide console specific intrinsic functions and provide greater control in respect of program layout. = Linker = The linker allowed flexibility for object code management and the creation of dynamic linked libraries and overlays. It also identified and removed unused code and data. = Assemblers = Assemblers with additional, hardware specific instructions were provided for all processors. = Debugger = The debugger was designed for the specific target console. Windows are customizable and colour-coded and debug information was organized logically by processor. Multiple target views including CPU registers, memory, disassembly, source, local variables and watch points were supported. Also included was the colour-coded display of printf streams with optional auto-wrapping and configurable scrollback buffer sizes, as well as a templated registers pane supporting user-defined layouts. = Visual Studio Integration = All toolchain command-line switches could be added to the Project / Settings dialog in Visual Studio. Projects could be generated using custom App wizards, code could be edited, compiled and built in Visual Studio. Visual Studio Integration provided a seamless edit/build/debug cycle including, access to all Visual Studio features for the project, such as build dependencies, browse information, and Intellisense features when editing C and C++ source. = Target Manager = Managed connections to multiple development hardware kits on a network, allowing simultaneous debug sessions and sharing between teams of developers. Target Manager API provided target control for writing plug-ins and custom tools  Versions  = ProDG for PlayStation 2 = The ProDG development tools were initially released for PlayStation 2 in 2000. = ProDG Plus for PlayStation 2 = ProDG Plus provided additional game development tools and debugging features which were not available in the standard ProDG for PlayStation®2. These included: * ProView – an artist and testing preview tool which used an IEEE 1394 connection. * A built-in debugger scripting language. This made it possible to customize the debugger type displays, add new debugger windows and extend debugger menus. The script window also provided an immediate-mode command-line capability from which custom debug functions could be called. * Tuner - a performance tuning tool. In 2004 SNC for PlayStation 2 was released. = ProDG for Nintendo GameCube and ProDG for Game Boy Advance = SN-TDEV connected to the developer-only brown GameCube ProDG for Nintendo GameCube and ProDG for Game Boy Advance were released in 2001. In 2002, DevLink and SN-TDEV for Nintendo GameCube were released. Devlink was a high speed communication tool for game developers using ProDG for Nintendo GameCube, which helped programmers debug their code on the NR-Reader. It could also be used by artists and level designers to download artwork or scene data from a PC to the NR-Reader. SN-TDEV was used with ProDG for Nintendo GameCube to build, debug, view and optimise games. The ProDG for Gamecube is the only device which makes use of the second serial port featured on earlier Gamecube hardware releases. = ProDG Plus for Nintendo GameCube = ProDG Plus for Nintendo GameCube was released on 24 February 2003. It included Tuner and additional debugger scripting features, which were not available in the standard ProDG suite. Based on an image from the PRO-DG website, this was the only product to ever utilize Serial port 2 on Nintendo Gamecube. = ProDG for PSP = ProDG for PSP® was released in 2004, using SNC technology licensed from Apogee. It included the v2.0 debugger, SNC C/C++ Compiler and Tuner as standard. The majority of North American launch titles for Sony Computer Entertainment's PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) were developed using the ProDG suite of tools. From a line-up of 24 game titles listed in the North American launch window for PSP, 20 were developed using SN Systems' ProDG for PSP® development tools. In 2005, SN Systems won a Game Developer Magazine \\"Front Line Award\\" in the Programming Environment category for the ProDG for PSP suite. In 2005, the ProView for PSP artist and testing preview tool was released, with USB and Wi- Fi connectivity. = ProDG for Nintendo DS = In conjunction with the Japanese software and hardware producer Hudson, SN Systems produced an official hardware development kit for the Nintendo DS and ProDG for Nintendo DS was released in 2005. = ProDG for PlayStation 3 = In 2005 Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEI) acquired SN Systems, the world leader in development tools for videogames platforms. Following this acquisition, the ProDG suite was central to Sony's plans to improve the development environment and tools for PlayStation 3. ProDG for PlayStation 3 was released in 2006. = ProDG for PlayStation Vita = ProDG for Sony PlayStation Vita was released in 2011. The tools were integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio and Windows Explorer and included Razor Performance Analyzer.

In 1783, Dauberval moved to Bordeaux, where he accepted the post of maître de ballet to the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux, a position he held until 1791. In 1789, Dauberval created his most enduring ballet, La Fille mal gardée, in which his wife, the dancer Marie-Madeleine Crespé, who is known to history as Madame Théodore, created the role of Lison.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for most of the years from 1906 to 1915, when he was elevated to the peerage and served as Lord Chancellor under H. H. Asquith from 1915 to 1916. Background and education Buckmaster was born on 9 January 1861 to John Charles Buckmaster, of Ashleigh, Hampton Wick, by his wife Emily Anne Goodliffe. His father began life as an agricultural labourer, and rose to teach chemistry at the Imperial College of Science and Technology. He was educated at Aldenham School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he took second class honours in mathematics. He was called to the Bar in 1884 at the Inner Temple. Beginning with a general practice on the Midland circuit, he eventually came to acquire a large Chancery practice. He was appointed King's Counsel in April 1902. The same year he joined Lincoln's Inn. Political career At the 1906 general election, Buckmaster was elected as MP for Cambridge, winning the seat from the Conservatives with a majority of less than 4%. At the January 1910 general election, he lost the seat to the Conservative Almeric Paget on a 5% swing. He contested Cambridge again at the December 1910 election, but made only a small dent in the Conservative majority. Buckmaster returned to the Commons the following year, when he was elected at a by-election in October 1911 for the safe Liberal seat of Keighley in Yorkshire. He was knighted in 1913 on his appointment as Solicitor general, when he was comfortably re-elected in the ministerial by-election. He was a Member of the Council of the Duchy of Lancaster and served under H. H. Asquith as Solicitor-General from 1913 to 1915. Buckmaster was also Counsel to the University of Oxford from 1911 to 1913, Director of The Press Bureau, 1914 to 1915, and a member of The Interallied Conference on Finance and Supplies.  Lord Chancellor  In 1915, Asquith was forced to form a Coalition government. The Conservatives insisted on the removal of Lord Haldane as Lord Chancellor, and after Sir John Simon refused the post Buckmaster was appointed instead. He was sworn of the Privy Council and raised to the peerage as Baron Buckmaster, of Cheddington in the County of Buckingham. Buckmaster was Lord Chancellor for only eighteen months, resigning alongside Asquith in December 1916. His tenure was largely overshadowed by the war. He only appointed two High Court judges—Peterson and McCardie—and no new King's Counsel, on the grounds that junior barrister engaged in war service would be disadvantaged. Sitting judicially, he gave the decision in Cook v. Deeks, a notable company law case. As a member of the Cabinet, he also took part in decision concerning war strategy.  Lord of Appeal  After stepping down from the woolsack, Buckmaster continued to sit judicially as a Lord of Appeal, except for a time when he left his judicial work to go into the City. In Bowman v. Secular Society he held that a company formed for the purpose of challenging Christianity was not illegal. In Donoghue v Stevenson he gave a dissenting opinion against the extension of the duty of care. He was highly regarded as a judge by his colleagues: Lord Birkenhead described him as \\"a consummate judge\\" and Lord Dunedin regarded him as the greatest colleague he had on the bench. He later served as Chairman of the Governing Body of Imperial College of Science and Technology and as Chairman of the Political Honours Review Committee between 1924 and 1929. He was appointed GCVO in 1930 and was made Viscount Buckmaster, of Cheddington in the County of Buckingham, in 1933. He died on 5 December 1934 in London, England. Family Buckmaster married Edith Augusta Lewin, daughter of Spencer Robert Lewin, in 1889. Their eldest daughter the Hon. Barbara was the mother of the Conservative politician Hal Miller. Buckmaster died in London in December 1934, aged 73, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. He was succeeded in his titles by his only son, Owen. Lady Buckmaster died in October 1935. His niece, Hilda Buckmaster was also active in politics, three times standing as a parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Party.

This school was the earliest catechetical school, and became influential in the development of Christian theology. Biography Pantaenus was a Stoic philosopher teaching in Alexandria. He was a native of Sicily. He converted to the Christian faith, and sought to reconcile his new faith with Greek philosophy. His most famous student, Clement,Cf. Article \\"Clement of Alexandria\\" in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed.

This may indicate that Syrian Christians, using a Syriac version of the New Testament, had already evangelized parts of India by the late 2nd century.

In first- class cricket, Gunn played professionally for Nottinghamshire from 1880 to 1904 and represented England in 11 Test matches. In football, he played for both Notts County and Nottingham Forest as an amateur and played twice for England, scoring one goal in the inaugural 1884 British Home Championship.\\"Have it!\\" (Dec 2008) Four Four Two, No. 172, p. 48 Cricket career Born at St Ann's, Nottingham, Gunn was a specialist right-handed batsman who occasionally bowled slow underarm lobs. He was an outfielder who was noted for his accurate throwing. His most successful season was 1889, following which he was voted Wisden Batsman of the Year. He joined his Nottinghamshire colleagues Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury in the English cricket team in Australia in 1886–87. In his Wisden citation, Gunn was described in the following terms: > ...we think we are correct in saying that no batsman of the same height [6 > ft. 2½ in.]\\"William Gunn\\" (1892) The Strand Magazine Vol. 4, p. 42 has ever > played in more elegant and perfect form.

Gunn was a member of > Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury's team in Australia during the season of > 1886/7, and averaged 21.8 in eleven-a-side matches, and 20.7 in all matches. Football career =Early career= Gunn first signed to play football for Nottingham Forest. Gunn signed for Forest sometime in 1880–1881 and made only one appearance for Forest, in 1881. In the February 1882 he signed for Notts County but had to wait until November 1882 to make his debut. This was an F.A. Cup first round tie, played at Trent Bridge, Nottingham against Sheffield. Notts County achieved a big win, 6–1. Gunn was 6 ft 2 in tall, weighed 12st 2 lbs, and had the ability to throw a football long distances, \\"establishing himself as the Delap of his day by hurling the ball inhuman distances... with one hand\\". At the time, rules for throw-ins were not formalised, but when his throws \\"repeatedly hurtled into Scotland's penalty area from well inside England's own half\\" in an unofficial match in 1882, he \\"forced the FA to change the law to [that of] ... today.\\" Wisden described his footballing career in the following terms: \\"For several years Gunn was one of the most brilliant forwards in the country at Association football, but latterly gave up the game, reserving himself entirely for cricket.\\" Gunn founded the sports equipment firm Gunn and Moore in 1885 and became the first former professional cricketer to serve on a county club committee. His nephews, George and John Gunn, were both England Test cricketers. =1888–1889 season= Gunn, playing as a winger, made his League debut on 22 September 1888 at Wellington Road, the then home of Aston Villa. Notts County were overwhelmed by the home team and lost 9–1. To this day that remains Notts County' heaviest defeat. The team lost by the same score on two other occasions. When Billy Gunn played as a winger on 29 September 1888 against Aston Villa he was 29 years 300 days old; that made him, on that fourth weekend of League football, Notts County' oldest player. Billy Gunn appeared in one of the 22 League matches played by Notts County in season 1888–89. (registration & fee required) =1889 onwards= By season 1892–93, when Billy Gunn ceased playing football, he had made 28 appearances (three League) and scored 14 goals (one League). Even before he finished playing Gunn was appointed a director of Notts County Football Club in August 1890. In July 1920 he became the President of Notts County Football Club. In a series of reader's letters appearing in the 'Football Post' in 1920, a Mr. W. Dawson of Sutton–in–Ashfield, shared his reminisces of Billy Gunn: \\"The finest outside–right who ever played football. How he used to delight the Trent Bridge spectators with his delightful runs along the wing. He seemed to go from one end of the field to the other in about three strides.\\" The latter observation obviously associated with his great height and resultant long stride. Gunn was also renowned – before the law changed – for massive one–armed throws from the touchline. He died, still as President of Notts County, on 19 January 1921, in the Standard Hill district of Nottingham, at the age of 63.

Early life Candy was born Candis Loving in Oswego, Kansas, on September 4, 1956 and moved to Ponca City, Oklahoma, at the age of three with her mother and four siblings. She graduated from Ponca City High School in 1974 and married Ron Prather. She then enrolled in a journalism major at University of Oklahoma. Playboy career In 1978, the Playboy magazine began a yearlong nationwide Great Playmate Hunt for its 25th- anniversary publication. Candy was working in a dress shop and as a waitress when she saw the ad in the paper. At the urging of her then husband, Candy entered the contest and photographer Dwight Hooker shot the test photos of her. Seven months later the 22-year-old college student beat out more than 3,500 other models with her natural beauty, girl-next-door looks and name that seemed almost fabricated for a playmate. Her centerfold came out in the January 1979 issue. That year, she took advantage of her celebrity status and moved out to California to pursue acting and modeling. She traveled the world as the ambassador of Playboy magazine.Chillicothe, Missouri, Constitution Tribune, \\"Centerfold Candy\\", December 6, 1978, page 9 In 2001, the readers of Playboy would vote her the runner-up for \\"the sexiest Playmate of the 1970s.\\" Post Playboy By 1981, she realized the celebrity life was not for her, so she reenrolled at the University of Oklahoma at the age of 25 to finish her bachelor's degree in journalism, and then began a Master of Arts degree in human relations. She continued to perform publicity duties for the magazine during her studies and after, but began phasing out of that lifestyle. The Playboy life had taken its toll on her marriage and she later met Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive lineman Dave Reavis when both were judging a beauty pageant. She followed him to Tampa in July 1983. Even though this relationship did not last, she remained in Southern Florida, working in the healthcare industry designing benefit packages for companies.

Background A dark brown, almost black*, colt, Domino was sired by Himyar out of the mare Mannie Gray.Sam Hildreth writes in his book, \\"The Spell of the Turf\\" that he looked black was actually a deep chestnut. Himyar was out of speed horse called Alarm who'd inherited this speed from the great Eclipse. Domino, who also inherited that speed, was foaled at Major Barak Thomas's Dixiana Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.http://www.pedigreequery.com/domino What he did not have was stamina. Owned by James R. Keene, he was purchased as a yearling for $3,000 by his son, Foxhall Keene. Domino was trained by William Lakeland and ridden by jockey Fred Taral, whom Domino hated for his rough style and copious use of whip and spur. Racing career =1893: two-year- old season= At the age of two, he won the Great Eclipse Stakes, the Great American Stakes, the Great Trial Stakes, the Hyde Park Stakes, the Matron Stakes and the Produce Stakes, and dead-heated for the win in the Futurity Stakes. The Futurity Stakes marked the beginning of Domino's hatred for Taral.http://tbheritage.com/Portraits/Domino.html During the running, Domino's stablemate fell, and Domino, trying to avoid him, nearly went down as well. Taral whipped Domino mercilessly as a result, and then, when a colt named Dobbins challenged him, Taral went for the whip again. A newspaper article, while dramatic, described the race as follows: > \\"Once, twice, thrice, the lash descended on Domino's quivering flanks, but > still Dobbins crept nearer and nearer...A furlong from home Dobbins' muzzle > showed ahead. Taral shifted his whip from his right to his left hand and > played a tattoo on Domino's ribs that could be heard half a mile away. His > heels were busy, and Domino's sides ran blood...The game colt that had never > known defeat, struggled on, and 100 yards from the finish there was not a > man alive capable of predicting the winner.\\" By now, people called him \\"The Black Whirlwind.\\" About this time heats no longer dominated horse races in America (they'd fallen out of favor in England decades earlier), and speed was becoming a premium. Domino was considered the fastest sprinter of his time.http://tbheritage.com/Portraits/Domino.html =1894: three-year-old season= In his first start at age three in the Withers Stakes, Domino defeated the Belmont Stakes champion Henry of Navarre, and went on to win five of the next seven races he entered including a dead heat in a match race with arch rival Henry of Navarre. As such, they met again three weeks later in a race to determine the 1894 championship. For this event, the 4-year-old Clifford joined the two younger colts. This time, Henry of Navarre won by 3/4's of a length, earning Horse of the Year honors. At three, besides the Withers, he won the Flying Stakes (carrying 130 pounds and setting a new track record), the Culver Stakes, the Ocean Handicap, and the Third Special. =1895: four-year-old season= Raced as a four-year-old, Domino won four of eight races: the Coney Island Handicap, the Sheepshead Bay Handicap, and came in 2nd in the Coney Island Fall Handicap carrying 133 lb., conceding 24 lb to the winner. Slightly unsound, and always raced in bandages, in his 25 starts, Domino won 19, placed in 2, and came third in one. His life career earnings amounted to $193,550. Eventually refusing to train due to a bad foot, at the end of the 1895 season, he was retired to Castleton Stud. Stud career Domino had produced only twenty foals when at age six (July 29, 1897) he died unexpectedly of spinal meningitis. However, this diagnosis is still disputed today. Known for being a gentle, but playful horse, Domino would rear and paw the air upon being turned out in his paddock, lending credibility to the claim that he slipped and fell, thus breaking his neck. Despite his short time as a sire, of Domino's twenty foals eight were stakes race winners, an incredible 42% rate versus the industry norm of just 3%. (Only four colts were not gelded.) Included among them was Cap and Bells, the first American-bred to win the Epsom Oaks, and Belmont Stakes winner and two- time Horse of the Year Commando, who in turn sired a number of top horses one of whom was hall of famer, Colin. Today, many thoroughbred race horses trace their lineage to Domino. Some of his most famous descendants were War Admiral, Personal Ensign, Buckpasser, Zenyatta, Secretariat, Seattle Slew, Affirmed, Bold Ruler, Assault, Whirlaway, Gallant Fox, Omaha, Native Dancer, American Pharoah,http://www.pedigreequery.com/american+pharoah and Justify. Ten of the 13 Triple Crown winners have Domino in their pedigree. Honors Domino was one of the first handful of horses inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1955.

Danube River which separates Buda and Pest Gellért Hill (; ; ) is a high hill overlooking the Danube in Budapest, Hungary. It is located in the 1st and the 11th districts. The hill was named after Saint Gerard who was thrown to death from the hill. The famous Hotel Gellért and the Gellért Baths can be found in Gellért Square at the foot of the hill, next to Liberty Bridge. The Gellért Hill Cave is also located on the hill, facing the hotel and the Danube. At the top of the hill Citadella (English: citadel) can be found with a nice panoramic view of the city  Origin of the name  Citadel The first recorded names of the hill in the Middle Ages were Kelen-hegy, Pesti-hegy (English: Pest Hill) and Blocksberg. From the 15th century it has been called Szent Gellért hegye (lit. the hill of St. Gerard) referring to the legend about the death of St. Gerard. The bishop was assassinated by the pagans during the great pagan rebellion in 1046. He was put in a barrel and rolled down into the deep from the top of the hill. The former name, Pesti-hegy () referred to the large cave (now Gellért Hill Cave) in the hillside. The word is probably of Slavic origin and means oven or cave.A Rend külföldön The Ottoman Turks called the hill Gürz Elyas bayiri. Gürz Elyas was a holy man from the Bektashi order whose shrine and grave on top of the hill was a place of pilgrimage in the 17th century.MN Magyar Nemzet  Geology  The hill belongs to the Buda Hills but in a narrow sense it connects to the southern Buda range consisting also Sashegy. These hills are based on main dolomite from the Late Triassic era although the hills themselves arose later, in the Pleistocene. along a tectonic breakline. This explains also the origin of the hot springs all around the area. The caves are the result of the breaklines and the springs. The most significant among them is the Szent Iván Cave with the Sziklatemplom (English: Cave Church).  History  Naphegy and Tabán in Budapest 1905 Meyers Lexikon After the assassination of Gerardus the hill was not populated. The dense forest and rocks gave way to legends of witches holding their ceremonies on the hill. From the 18th century the hillsides were covered with vineyards. The Tabán district at the foot of the hill was an important centre of winemaking in Buda. According to the 1789 land register vineyards covered 128 hectares (316 ac) on the hill (only 7.62 hectares or 18.8 ac were used as pastures).Eltűnt budai szőlők nyomában, in: Borbarát, 2007/3, p. 52 A small calvary was built on the top of the hill which was rebuilt around 1820. On Easter Mondays a procession climbed the steep road leading to the calvary to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. Many tents and vendors were erected on the nearby meadow. Emmausjárás (En: Emmaus-walk) or tojásbúcsú (En: Egg Feast) was one of the most popular Catholic holidays of the year during the 18th–19th centuries.Népszabadság Online: A vén Gellért-hegy oldalán… The Citadel was built after the 1848–49 Hungarian uprising by the ruling Habsburgs, as it was a prime, strategic site for shelling both Buda and Pest in the event of a future revolt. Gellért Hill also saw action in the Second World War and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, when Soviet tanks fired down into the city from the hill. Indeed, battle scars still pockmark some buildings in Budapest. There is a small military museum in the Citadel’s grounds.http://www.budapest-city- guide.com/budapest-attractions/budapest-museums-and-galleries/budapest- citadel.html At the end of Citadella is the Liberty Statue (Szabadság Szobor in Hungarian), a large monument erected by the Soviet Red Army to commemorate their victory in World War II.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83080/Budapest#ref149150  Today  Now an affluent residential area, a number of embassies and ambassadorial residences line the streets that wind up the hill. Since 1987, the area has been a UNESCO World Heritage site as part of \\"the Banks of the Danube\\". A large proportion of the hill consists of parkland. Bats and hedgehogs are commonly observed on summer nights. In January 2007, a new cave was discovered under Gellért Hill during private construction. The cave is 60 m long and 18 m deep with three rooms. The interior is covered with dazzling white crystals composed of gypsum, calcite, and aragonite. The cave was created 300,000–500,000 years ago by a now disappeared thermal spring.

Biography Hautefeuille was born in Orléans, France. While still young, his experimental activities came to the attention of Marie Anne Mancini, Duchesse de Bouillon, who became his patroness and brought him into her entourage. In this way, he was able to travel through Italy and England. Through the Duchess' patronage, he came to be ordained as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. His passion, however, was for the sciences rather than religious matters, and he focused on the field of engineering design. One of Hautefeuille's most important achievements was his proposal to use a spiral spring with a balance wheel in place of a pendulum to control a clock. In the 1670s, he was involved in a dispute with Christiaan Huygens, who along with Robert Hooke claimed priority. Huygens is today generally credited with the invention as he managed to perfect it and the first watch using one was made under his direction. Hautefeuille also conducted investigations in acoustics, investigating the action of speaking trumpets, and wrote an essay on the cause of echoes which was awarded a prize by the Academy of Bordeaux in 1718. He also made improvements in lenses, and suggested a method of raising water using the explosive action of gunpowder. He was also interested in the phenomenon of the tides, and invented an instrument called a thalassameter to register them. In 1678 Hautefeuille proposed an early form of internal combustion engine, which was to use gunpowder as a fuel, but it seems unlikely that any such machine was ever constructed by him. He was, however, the first person to propose the use of a piston in a heat engine. Huygens proposed a similar device two years later in 1680 based on de Hautefeuille's suggestion and appears to have constructed some form of prototype. Though considered intelligent, Hautefeuille rarely perfected his inventions, and was inclined to prematurely publish ideas and then abandon them in favour of new pursuits. The Paris Academy of Sciences attested the value and usefulness of many of his discoveries, but it never conferred on him the honour of electing him as a member. He was however elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1687. He was the author of a number of essays on a variety of subjects.

He is the minor league outfield and baserunning coordinator for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays/Rays, Cincinnati Reds, Washington Nationals, Oakland Athletics, Boston Red Sox, Atlanta Braves, and Kansas City Royals from 2003 through 2016. Early years Gomes was born and raised in Petaluma, California. He was an all-league player while attending Casa Grande High School in Petaluma. In May 1997, at the age of 16, he was a passenger in a car accident that killed his best friend, Adam Westcott. Gomes, who was sitting next to Westcott in the back seat, was only slightly injured. Gomes has Westcott's initials tattooed on his right biceps.Gomes Focuses on OF Job Cincinnati.com, February 25, 2009 After graduating from high school in 1999, Gomes went to Santa Rosa Junior College, where he hit .127 with 23 strikeouts in 55 plate appearances. He improved in his sophomore season, recording a .356 batting average with nine home runs. Gomes was then selected in the 18th round of the 2001 MLB Draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. While he was in the rookie leagues, he was certified to become a personal trainer. His older brother, Joey Gomes, played in the minor and independent baseball leagues from 2002 to 2011. Gomes suffered a heart attack on Christmas Eve in 2002, the result of a clogged artery, despite being in playing condition (he reported having 8% body fat at the time). He ignored the symptoms for 27 hours, even sleeping through it one night, before going to the hospital after briefly blacking out and ceasing to breathe. His doctors said he would not have survived a second night. As a result of the heart attack, the Rays' team doctor had to keep nitroglycerin pills on hand in case Gomes suffered a second heart attack. Professional career =Tampa Bay Devil Rays/Rays= Gomes made his major league debut on September 12, 2003. He spent 2004 going back and forth between the Triple-A Durham Bulls and Tampa Bay. He told an MLB.com interviewer that when he was relegated back to Durham after a brief early stint in Tampa Bay in May 2005, he resolved that he would put up such an offensive onslaught that the Major League team would \\"get sick of looking at his face on the Tropicana Field scoreboard when the top Minor League performers were shown.\\" He would have a .321 batting average with 14 home runs and 46 runs batted in (RBIs) in 45 games with the Bulls before returning to the Devil Rays for good in July.Gomes large and in charge: Slugger lives life to the fullest after overcoming adversity, MLB.com, May 3, 2006 After his return to Tampa Bay, Gomes became a starter for the club and became one of the club's most important players. On July 30, he became the first player in the franchise's history to hit three home runs in a single game, against the Kansas City Royals. For the year, Gomes hit 21 home runs in only 101 games and 348 at-bats. Projected over a full season, Gomes could have hit over 35 home runs. He became a fan favorite, and was known for his all-out hustle and long home runs; one went 474 feet and went over the Batter's Eye Restaurant behind the center field wall at Tropicana Field. He finished 3rd in voting for the 2005 American League Rookie of the Year award. Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2006 Gomes was figured to play a prominent role in the continued rebuilding and long range plans of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He started 2006 off by hitting a team-record 11 home runs in April. He hit the catwalk rings of Tropicana Field twice during a series with the Toronto Blue Jays in May; one landed in the B ring and rolled off to be caught, while the other hit the C ring and was ruled a home run.This is per the ground rules at Tropicana Field. He struggled after his hot start, hitting nine home runs during the rest of the season and finishing with a .216 batting average. He attributed most of his problems to an injured shoulder, which hindered his hitting and his usually aggressive baserunning. He played through the injury until electing to have surgery on it in September. In addition to rehabilitating his shoulder, Gomes said in an MLB.com article that he wanted to lose weight over the offseason. He was listed at 205 pounds, but played the 2006 season weighing 250. He also mentioned possibly playing first base in 2007 for the Devil Rays, who then had Carl Crawford, Rocco Baldelli, and Delmon Young in their outfield. During the first two months of 2007, Gomes was not given much playing time and his batting average was down to .184 when he was sent down to Durham again on May 25. He was recalled on June 14, and had an immediate impact as he saw increased playing time, though by the end of the season he again had tapered off. He went on to finish the season with a .244 batting average with 17 home runs and 49 RBIs while drawing 39 walks in 348 at-bats. He also compiled 126 strikeouts, a career high and his third straight season in which he had 100 or more strikeouts while playing in less than 120 games. During spring training in 2008, on March 12, Gomes rushed to the defense of Akinori Iwamura when the latter was spiked by Shelley Duncan of the New York Yankees. Gomes immediately rushed in from right field, flinging himself into Duncan as he was beginning to stand up. This emptied both teams' benches, as players and coaches ran onto the field. Gomes and Duncan were both ejected, as were two Yankees coaches. Due to his actions, he was suspended for two games, effective at the start of the season.Chastain, Bill. Gomes suspended, fined, Tampa Bay Rays. Published March 14, 2008. Gomes commented that his actions were simply coming to the defense of his teammate, saying \\"I was taught in T-ball all the way up, to always protect a teammate's back. I just acted how I act. I wasn't really trying to get a shot in on him. I probably could have done a lot of things worse. But it is a baseball field and there's fans and kids watching. I just had to let him know that's not going to fly.\\"Hoch, Bryan. Tempers flare in Yanks-Rays matchup, Tampa Bay Rays. Published March 12, 2008. In the third game of a series against the Boston Red Sox on June 5, 2008, Gomes was involved in a bench clearing brawl after Coco Crisp charged the mound as a result of, among other events, being hit by a pitch. Replays of the incident show Gomes throwing punches at Crisp as he was already being shoved to the ground by several other Rays players. He was suspended for five games due to his role in the brawl. On August 6, Gomes was optioned to the Durham Bulls of the International League to create roster space for Ben Zobrist, and he was recalled after rosters expanded in September. The Rays would play the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2008 World Series but would lose in 5 games, Gomes did not play in the World Series. Gomes was the only Rays batter to hit a homer while serving as a pinch hitter in 2008. Gomes was non- tendered by the Rays following the 2008 season, making him a free agent. =Cincinnati Reds= Cincinnati Reds in 2010 On January 19, 2009, Gomes signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. Despite a strong spring he was cut by the Reds on April 5. He was sent down to their AAA team in Louisville. He was called up by the Reds on May 21. He had his second three-homer performance on August 13, 2009 against the Washington Nationals. He was non-tendered a contract and became a free agent on December 12. On February 22, 2010, Gomes agreed to a deal with the Cincinnati Reds. On August 25, 2010, Gomes hit his 100th home run against the San Francisco Giants in what turned out to be a four home run inning by the Reds.

The Athletics strongly considered re-signing Gomes for 2013, but their offer turned out to be about half of what the Red Sox would eventually offer. =Boston Red Sox= On November 21, 2012, Gomes agreed to a two-year, $10 million deal with the Boston Red Sox. While in Boston, Gomes received the nickname \\"Hacksaw Jonny Gomes\\", which was appointed to him by his teammates after watching his style of play. Boston Red Sox in 2014 In his first year in Boston, Gomes batted .247 with 13 home runs and 52 RBIs while accounting for 49 runs himself. During the ALDS and ALCS, the Red Sox were 6-0 when Gomes started in left field (hit .200 with two RBIs and 6 runs scored during this stretch). In Game 4 of the World Series, Gomes broke a 0 for 9 slide by hitting a 387-foot, 3-run home run to help the Red Sox take the lead. He was not in the original lineup for that game but was added during batting practice after Red Sox outfielder Shane Victorino was scratched due to back pain. The Red Sox ended up winning the World Series that year. =Return to Oakland Athletics= On July 31, 2014, Gomes, along with pitcher Jon Lester, were traded to the Oakland Athletics for Yoenis Céspedes and a competitive balance draft pick in 2015. Gomes spoke highly of his time in Boston, stating \\"It was the best year and a half that anyone could imagine. Going from worst to first. It was humbling.\\" =Atlanta Braves= Gomes signed with the Atlanta Braves for the 2015 season after agreeing to a one-year contract worth $5 million. Gomes quickly became well liked by teammates and fans alike. He was featured in a limited edition shared \\"Freddie Hugs\\" bobble head along with first baseman, Freddie Freeman. The bobble head was part of a promotional giveaway before the Braves' July 21, 2015 game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

He pitched the entire ninth inning, giving up two runs, including a home run to Chris Young, and recording his first strikeout. =Kansas City Royals= On August 31, 2015, Gomes was traded to the Kansas City Royals for minor league infielder Luis Valenzuela. The Royals would go on to win the World Series against the Mets. However, Gomes did not make the postseason roster and played in only 12 games for the Royals in 2015 but was given a World Series ring. =Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles= Gomes signed with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles on February 3, 2016. On May 6, the Eagles released Gomes. =Coaching career= On February 1, 2018, Gomes announced his retirement to become the Rookie League hitting coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2019 he was named the outfield and baserunning coordinator for the Diamondbacks. Charity work Gomes has been known for his charity work in the Tampa Bay area, working with the Boys and Girls Clubs and many local schools. He participated in the Tampa Bay Rays \\"Shop with a Jock\\" where children from the Boys and Girls Clubs are invited to have lunch with the players and were each treated to a $100 shopping spree. He also participated in the \\"Take Jonny to School\\" program; the winner, 13-year-old Shamika Smith, brought him to A.J. Ferell Middle Magnet School. He has also sponsored a total of nine Little League Teams in his home town of Petaluma, California during his years in professional baseball. These teams range from T-ball to 12-year-olds. He is involved with Camp for a Cure, an annual charity baseball camp in Petaluma that has raised over $25,000 to date for cancer and lupus research. While in Arizona for spring training with the Reds, Gomes visited a local middle school classroom for the Extra Innings Foundation where he shared his journey on how he has reached his goal and inspired youth to go after their dreams. Broadcasting During the 2017 season, Gomes has worked as a studio analyst for NESN.

It links the River Don Navigation and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal with the Aire and Calder Navigation (Knottingley Canal). It is completely straight, and was the last canal built in England for commercial purposes. The canal has one lock, which was sized to allow the compartment boats of the Aire and Calder to use it, but the owning company failed to raise enough money to upgrade the River Don Navigation beyond, and Long Sandall lock prevented working of such boats through to Doncaster until it was rebuilt in 1959. There is still some commercial traffic on the canal, but most use is now by leisure boaters. One notable feature is the aqueduct over the River Don which is protected by large guillotine gates, which can be lowered when the Don is in spate, to prevent the surrounding countryside from being flooded. History The New Junction Canal was conceived at a time when there was dissatisfaction with the state of the waterways in Sheffield and Doncaster, which were then under the ownership of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Steam-powered boats were still prohibited from using the waterways in 1888, even though they had been in use on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation for over 50 years, and the railway company had set rates for using the canal considerably higher than those for using the railway. The President of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce invited the engineer Charles Hawksley and B. P. Broomhead, an influential Sheffield solicitor, to a meeting of the Chamber on 16 August 1888, at which he outlined the situation. A committee was appointed, which met on 20 August, and decided that a new independent canal was needed to connect Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster to the sea, to maintain the profitability of the local coalfields. By October, a report had been produced, which suggested that the locks on the canal from Sheffield to Keadby were too small, and that the waterway could be greatly improved by building new locks besides the existing ones, capable of holding boats which could carry 300 or 500 tons. Believing that such locks could be built without disrupting traffic, the estimated costs of the works were £1 million, in addition to which the existing waterways would need to be acquired. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Ltd was registered on 15 November 1888, with the aim of obtaining an Act of Parliament to authorise this work. The Act was passed on 26 August 1889, which created the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Co., who had powers to raise £1.5 million, and to buy the four South Yorkshire canals, consisting of the Sheffield Canal, the River Don Navigation, the Stainforth and Keadby Canal and the Dearne and Dove Canal. They had nine months to negotiate with the railway owners, and could resort to compulsory purchase after that. In order to demonstrate their resolve, £20,000 had to be deposited within six months of the date of the Act. By this stage, the plan was to enlarge the waterways to enable 300 or 400 ton barges to navigate, but also to make the locks suitable for compartment boat trains, as used on the Aire and Calder. New facilities would be built at Keadby, where the canal joined the River Trent, so that coal could be trans-shipped to larger vessels. Negotiations with the railway company began, but they refused to co-operate, instead waiting nine months until the compulsory purchase option was possible, and then taking court action against the Canal company once the purchase order was served. The Canal company sought assistance from the Court of the Railway and Canal Commission, who ruled in their favour, and the railway company finally produced the details of their ownership in early 1891. The concept of using compartment boats led to discussions with the Aire and Calder Navigation Company, as a result of which it was decided to abandon the plan to develop Keadby, and instead use the existing port facilities at Goole. As the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Company had yet to take control of any canals, an agreement was negotiated, which would see the Aire and Calder obtaining an Act of Parliament to authorise construction of a straight canal from Bramwith on the River Don to a point some above Goole. The Act was obtained on 28 July 1891, and specified that the S&SYN; could become joint owners and subscribers, once they had acquired the four waterways from the railway company. Transfer of the canals was finally agreed on 31 July 1894, at a cost to the canal company of £1.14 million, of which £600,000 was to be paid in cash. The company managed to raise £625,000 through the issue of preference shares, but the rest of the purchase price was held as ordinary shares by the railway company, who were then able to appoint five of the ten directors. As a consequence of continued railway involvement, the Aire and Calder did not invest in the new company, which took control of the four waterways on 1 March 1895. The Aire and Calder, meanwhile, had not started to build the New Junction Canal, but they had extended the time allowed to purchase land for its construction through another Act of Parliament. The new company struggled to raise the finance for the New Junction construction, and for improvements to the River Don Navigation, to allow larger boats to use it. The canal was completed on 2 January 1905, at a total cost of £300,000, shared between the Sheffield and South Yorkshire and the Aire and Calder companies. It was the last canal to be built in England for commercial purposes. Operation The canal helped to increase traffic on the River Don from 835,982 tons to 961,774 tons between 1905 and 1913. Income from tolls over the same period rose from £48,981 to £53,586. Although the River Don was straightened at Doncaster in 1905 and at Sprotborough in 1907, traffic on the New Junction canal was hindered by the size of the locks on the river. Doncaster lock was extended in 1909 and 1910, but although trains of 17 compartment boats could then use both Sykehouse and Doncaster locks, they had to be split up at Long Sandall lock, which was between the two, as they could only pass through it three at a time. Traffic to Hatfield Main colliery was improved between 1930 and 1932, when Bramwith lock, the first on the Stainforth and Keady Canal, was lengthened to allow compartment boats from the New Junction to reach it. The work, which included a colliery lay-by, cost £20,000. Doncaster Corporation paid most of the cost of straightening the river there and building a wharf and warehouse, which opened in 1934. Further improvements had to wait until after the canals were nationalised in 1948. Long Sandall lock was lengthened and widened to in 1959, enabling compartment boats to work through to Doncaster and Hexthorpe without having to be split for the first time. Although traffic is much reduced, there is still some commercial activity on the canal. Features The canal overflowing the Don aqueduct into the river below The canal is straight for its entire length, and the surrounding countryside is relatively flat. It has one lock, five swing or lift bridges and is carried across two aqueducts. At its northern end it crosses the River Went, while at its southern end it crosses the River Don. The River Don aqueduct looks precarious, as the canal regularly overflows the eastern side of the structure, and there only appears to be railings preventing the boats from falling down into the river below. Both ends of the aqueduct are protected by large guillotine gates, which are there to prevent the river overflowing the canal when it is in spate, and flooding the surrounding countryside. For the boater, the most notable feature is the complicated operation of Sykehouse Lock. The lock is automated but the control system is disabled until the manually operated swing bridge over the top of it has been opened. The region through which the canal flows is sparsely populated, as there are no major towns, and just two main villages. The civil parish of Sykehouse, which includes a number of outlying settlements, straddles the northern end of the canal, and Kirk Bramwith is at the southern end. For much of its length, the towpath forms part of the route for the Trans Pennine Trail which joins it at Top Lane lift bridge, crosses to the east bank at Sykehouse lock, and leaves at Sykehouse lift bridge.Ordnance Survey, 1:50,000 map Points of interest See also *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system Bibliography * * * =References= External links * Pennine Waterways - New Junction Canal * The canal on an OS map Category:1905 establishments in England Category:Canals in South Yorkshire Category:Canals in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Canals opened in 1905 ","title":"New Junction Canal"},{"id":"2553745","text":"Johannes de Muris (c.1290 - c.1355), or John of Murs, was a French philosopher, astronomer, mathematician, and music theorist best known for treatises on the ars nova, titled Ars nove musice. Life For a medieval person primarily known through his scholarly writing, it is highly unusual that Johannes de Muris’ life can be traced enough to form a decently consistent biography. Born in Normandy, he is believed to have been related to Julian des Murs who was secretary to Charles V of France. The suggested birth year for Muris is based on a murder of a cleric on September 7, 1310, which Muris was allegedly a part of. Muris would have been at least 14 to assume the responsibility for the crime, suggesting his birth year to be sometime in the 1290s. He was convicted and banished to Cyprus for seven years for punishment. The aloof and haphazard movements of his life have been blamed on this early punishment. By 1318 records indicate that Muris was living in Évreux although he was actively taking part in scholastic endeavors in Paris. An explicit of his writings indicate that he was a resident in the Collège de Sorbonne until around 1325. During this time it is believed that he travelled freely, making trips to the town of Bernay to observe the solar eclipse of 1321. However, the double monastery of Fontevraud Abbey was where he settled in March 1326. He remained associated with the institution until 1332 or 1333 when he returned to Évreux. Financial records in Muris’ own hand from 1336 indicate that he took up residence in Paris in that year. In 1342 he was one of six canons of the collegiate church in Mézières-en-Brenne. In 1344, he was invited to Avignon by Pope Clement VI to participate in the calendar reform. The final date associated to Muris is 1345 in conjunction with the reforms that took place in Avignon. Much of his writings were finished in the early decades of his life with a major gap in activity that can be filled with astronomical observations. Though his mathematical and astronomical writings – his most comprehensive being Quadripartitum numerorum from 1343 – were well regarded, influential, and transmitted in many manuscripts, his musical writings were more widely circulated. Muris wrote five treatises on music: Notitia artis musicae (1319–21), Compendium musicae practicae (c. 1322), Musica speculativa secundum Boetium (1323), Libellus cantus mensurabilis (c. 1340), and Ars contrapuncti (post 1340) (all dates are suggested dates by U. Michaels). Many of the surviving manuscripts of these treatises are from the 15th century and of Italian origin, suggesting his wide influence both geographical and temporal.

It was the final release from the group's \\"Classic-5\\" era, during which David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Otis Williams constituted the Temptations' lineup. Wish It Would Rain also marks the last Temptations solo album to focus on the classic \\"Motown Sound\\", and the last to feature production from Smokey Robinson. Overview Included on Wish It Would Rain are the hit singles \\"I Wish It Would Rain\\" and \\"I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)\\", both featuring Ruffin on lead vocals and co-written by Motown writer Roger Penzabene, who committed suicide on New Year's Eve 1967 because of the breakup described in these two songs. \\"I Wish It Would Rain's\\" b-side, \\"I Truly, Truly Believe\\", is a rare solo showcase for Franklin, the group's bass singer. The third single, \\"Please Return Your Love to Me\\", features Kendricks on lead, and was released in July after Ruffin's departure. The song's b-side, \\"How Could I Forget\\" (led by Paul Williams), is not included here, because it was newly recorded on June 29 to accompany the a-side. Background Ruffin himself did not sing on \\"How Can I Forget\\" because, by late June, he was no longer part of the Temptations. The group had already been dealing with Ruffin's ego clashes and his desire for special treatment for at least a few months, and warded off his desire to have the name of the group changed to \\"David Ruffin & the Temptations\\" (in response to The Supremes being renamed \\"Diana Ross & the Supremes\\"). After Ruffin failed to show up for a series of engagements in Cleveland, Ohio that month (instead going to visit his then-girlfriend Gail Martin, daughter of Dean Martin, and see her open her own musical show), Otis Williams and the other Temptations decided Ruffin had gone too far and fired him. Dennis Edwards was brought in as Ruffin's replacement, amidst cries of \\"Where's David?\\" from the crowds at live shows, and Ruffin's attempts to jump onstage and steal the microphone from Edwards during the shows. Edwards was officially introduced as the Temptations' new lead singer on July 9, 1968, at a live show in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and the group enlisted extra security to prevent Ruffin from attending and disrupting their shows, Edwards would make his on-record debut with the next Temptations album, Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations. Starting with the group's next solo studio album, also titled Cloud Nine, producer Norman Whitfield began edging the group towards a Sly & the Family Stone-esque sound (dubbed \\"psychedelic soul\\"), using Edwards' gruffer voice as the centerpiece for several psychedelic-based hit singles and albums.

In December 1864, while a prisoner of war, he requested permission to be released so he could return home to take care of his seven motherless children. Boyd's wife Caroline had died while he was incarcerated. Edwin M. Stanton, the United States Secretary of War, approved Boyd's petition on February 14, 1865. Boyd's official whereabouts following his release remain a mystery. His son James received a letter to meet Boyd in Brownsville, Texas, for a trip to Mexico, but Boyd never showed up for the rendezvous and no further contact was ever received from him. Alleged role in the Lincoln conspiracy According to a theory put forth by the 1977 book and subsequent film The Lincoln Conspiracy, Boyd was mistaken for John Wilkes Booth and killed on April 26, 1865, at Richard Garrett's farm, near Bowling Green, Caroline County, Virginia. The theory adds that the U.S. government was aware of the error, but covered it up and, thus, enabled Booth to escape to freedom. James L. Swanson counters this claim by stating, \\"The survival myth of John Wilkes Booth, roaming across the land, evokes the traditional fate of the damned, of a cursed spirit who can find no rest. There is no doubt that Booth was the man who died at Garrett's farm.\\"Swanson, James L. (2006) Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase For Lincoln's Killer. William Morrow. p. 385.

Copernicia alba in the Paraguay river basin, 1892. Ancient peoples in South America used wax palm for making candles by scraping away wax on the leaves. C. alba can reach 25 m in height and 40 cm in girth. The trunk is cylindrical, rarely bifurcated, and has a grayish bark with a smooth surface in adult specimens. The leaves are persistent, grouped at the apex of the trunk, and measuring between 40 and 70 cm. The inflorescence is almost 2 m long; the flowers are hermaphroditic, about 4 mm long, with a tubular yellowish green corolla, and arranged in a spiral pattern. Each flower has three ovaries, of which only one develops into a globular fruit, a dark pulpous berry that contains a light- brown, 12-mm-long ovoid seed. Young specimens have a lightweight semihard wood, which becomes hard and heavier in mature individuals, reaching a relative density up to 0.92. This wood finds its main use in telephone and electrical line poles. In Paraguay, C. alba currently studied for its suitability as a biodiesel oil crop.

It forms a separate regency of the province of Nusa Tenggara Timur. The length of the island is about 80 km from the southwest to the northeast and the width is about 30 km from the west to the east. It rises to a height of 1,533 metres. To the west lie the other islands in the archipelago, most notably Solor and Adonara, and then the larger island of Flores. To the east is the Alor Strait, which separates this archipelago from the Alor Archipelago. To the south across the Savu Sea lies the island of Timor, while to the north the western branch of the Banda Sea separates it from Buton and the other islands of Southeast Sulawesi. Administration The Lembata Regency is sub-divided into nine districts, tabulated below with their 2010 Census populations: { class=\\"sortable \\" - !

Ships frequently connect the coastal towns and surrounding islands, but the only bigger harbour exists at Lewoleba in the north of the island. From Lewoleba there are daily connections to Larantuka, Flores, and Waiwerang on the neighbouring island of Adonara. Like the other Lesser Sunda Islands, and indeed much of Indonesia, Lembata is volcanically active. It has three volcanoes, Ililabalekan, Iliwerung, and Lewotolo.  History  The south part of Lembata was the site of the state of Labala.  People  The people of Lembata are, like many other inhabitants of Eastern Indonesia, famous for their handmade ikat weavings. The national language, Indonesian, is known by many people of all ages, but like on other islands the national language coexists with many local languages. The most widespread and most widely understood of these is probably Lamaholot (another lingua franca inside the Solor archipelago). Lamaholot is spoken as a native language on Eastern Flores and Western Solor, and is itself divided into ten or more sublanguages (and many more dialects). It is spoken by 150.000 or more people in the region. Some of those sublanguages are indeed very distinct from Lamaholot, i.e. the Atadei language of Atadei District (Kecamatan Atadei), which again is subclassified as Eastern and Western Atadei, the former being spoken in Atalojo for example, the latter in Kalikasa. A very distinct language spoken in the eastern part of the island is Kedang. On the South coast of Lembata, the village of Lamalera (pop. 2,500) is known for its hunting of the sperm whale and other deep-sea species. This is allowed under International Whaling Commission regulations around aboriginal whaling but conservationists worry that commercial whaling is also done. Lamera whaling Lamalera and Lamakera (on the neighbouring island of Solor) are the last two remaining Indonesian whaling communities. Environment In 2011, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) found two rare coral reef fish in the sea of Lamalera, they were Yellow-fin fairy wrasse (Cirrhilabrus flavidorsalis) and Swallowtail hawkfish (Cyprinocirrhites polyactis), which only exist in waters surrounding Indonesia and the Philippines. The two species were the first to be found in Lamalera Sea, but similar types have been found near Bali before. The fish were only found in seas with good coral reefs, although traces of bombing had been found around the coral reefs in the Lamalera Sea, but it was not serious yet. In 2016, a new species of flasher wrasse, Paracheilinus Alfiani, was described from a holotype collected from the reef around Lembata.Adams, Jake.

Early life MacEwen was born in Calcutta, India, the son of Robert Sutherland Taylor MacEwen (1839-1900), a barrister from Dornoch who served in India as the Recorder of Rangoon. Alexander MacEwen was educated at Clifton College, Bristol\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p159: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 and the University of Edinburgh. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1901, he began his legal career in Stornoway, before joining the Inverness legal firm of Stewart Rule & Co., where he later became senior partner. Political career A member of the Liberal Party, MacEwen was elected to Inverness Town Council in 1908, and served as Provost of Inverness 1925–1931. During his period in office, Provost MacEwen promoted schemes for the improvement of public health and housing in Inverness, and served as a member of the Inverness-shire Education Committee, and as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Royal Northern Infirmary. He also served as a councillor on Inverness County Council, representing Benbecula. He was Chief of the Gaelic Society in 1930. In 1930 MacEwen was one of the founders of the Scottish Party, and in the 1933 Kilmarnock by-election he stood as the joint candidate of the Scottish Party and the National Party of Scotland, coming fourth with 6,098 votes. With merger of the National Party of Scotland and the Scottish Party on 7 April 1934 to form the Scottish National Party, Sir Alexander MacEwen became the new party's first leader. The party's performance in the 1935 general election was disappointing with only Inverness and MacEwan in the Western Isles achieving respectable results. Sir Alexander MacEwen stood down as leader of the SNP in 1936, when he was succeeded by Andrew Dewar Gibb. He died at his home on the Black Isle in 1941, aged 66. MacEwen had three sons and two daughters. His son Malcolm joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and became a prominent conservationist. Honours He was knighted by King George V in the 1932 Birthday Honours for services to local government and public health in Scotland. MacEwen Drive in Inverness is named after him.

The dandy horse, a derogatory term for what was first called a Laufmaschine (in German), then a vélocipède or draisienne (in French and then English), and then a pedestrian curricle or hobby-horse,Bicycle at Britannica.com is a human-powered vehicle that, being the first means of transport to make use of the two-wheeler principle, is regarded as the forerunner of the bicycle. A dandy horse is powered by the rider's feet on the ground instead of the pedals of later bicycles. It was invented by Karl Drais (who called it a Laufmaschine [, \\"running machine\\"]) in 1817, and then patented by him in France in February 1818 using the term vélocipède. It is also known as a Draisine ( in German, a term used in English only for light auxiliary railcars regardless of their form of propulsion), and as a draisienne ( in French and English. In English, it is also sometimes still known as a velocipede, but that term now also has a broader meaning. History The dandy-horse was a two-wheeled vehicle, with both wheels in-line, propelled by the rider pushing along the ground with the feet as in regular walking or running. The front wheel and handlebar assembly was hinged to allow steering. Drais was inspired, at least in part, by the need to develop a form of transit that did not rely on the horse. After the eruption of Mount Tambora and the Year Without a Summer (1816), which followed close on the devastation of the Napoleonic Wars, widespread crop failures and food shortages resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of horses, which either starved to death or were killed to provide meat and hides. \\"In wartime,\\" he wrote, \\"when horses and their fodder often become scarce, a small fleet of such wagons at each corps could be important, especially for dispatches over short distances and for carrying the wounded.” Several manufacturers in France and England made their own dandy-horses during its brief popularity in the summer of 1819—most notably Denis Johnson of London, who used an elegantly curved wooden frame that allowed the use of larger wheels. Riders preferred to operate their vehicles on the smooth pavements instead of the rough roads, but their interactions with pedestrians caused many municipalities worldwide to enact laws prohibiting their use. Later designs avoided the initial drawback of this device when it had to be made to measure, manufactured to conform with the height and the stride of its rider. An example is Nicéphore Niépce's 1818 model with an adjustable saddle for his 'velocipede' built by Lagrange.Nicéphore Niépce Museum, Other Inventions - The velocipede However, in the 1860s in France, the vélocipède bicycle was created by attaching rotary cranks and pedals to the front-wheel hub of a dandy-horse. =Modern adaptation= The modern balance bike borrows from the dandy horse. The dandy horse has been adapted as a starter bicycle for children, and is variously called a balance bike or run bike. In popular culture Buster Keaton rides a dandy-horse in his 1923 film Our Hospitality, which is set in the 1830s. Keaton's technical crew were unable to obtain a vintage dandy horse, so they built one to match existing drawings and prints. Keaton later donated the machine to the Smithsonian Institution, which had lacked an authentic example. George Arliss, as the title character of the 1929 film Disraeli, rides a dandy-horse through a London park until he collides with a pedestrian. This occurs in the opening scene of the film, set in the 1830s, when Disraeli was still a writer and a famous dandy. In the 1997 film Amistad, a citizen is briefly seen riding a dandy-horse through a forest trail when the escaped slaves first land on American soil. A bi-annual magazine called \\"dandyhorse\\", based in Toronto, Canada, promotes art, fashion and cycling culture. Literature *H.E.Lessing: How sophisticated was the draisine?

Born in France, Job represented the Cameroon national team. After starting his career in France, Job moved to English team Middlesbrough, where he spent six years and is most remembered for scoring one of the two goals in the 2004 League Cup Final, where Middlesbrough won their first ever trophy. He also played for clubs in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Belgium. Whilst playing for Saudi club Al-Ittihad, he won the 2005 AFC Champions League and scored in the final. Club career =Lyon= Job was born in the French city of Lyon and began training with the Olympique Lyonnais youth academy at the age of ten. He made his debut for the club in the Intertoto Cup when he was nineteen years old in 1997, scoring a hat-trick as the club beat Polish club Odra Wodzisław 5–2. =Lens= Job joined RC Lens on 1 August 1999. He scored a number of goals for Lens in the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup as they reached the semi-final stage. =Middlesbrough F.C.= Middlesbrough's then manager Bryan Robson signed Job in 2000 for £3 million, where he scored 19 goals in 94 appearances for the club. He also scored 20 minutes into his debut against Coventry City. After struggling to hold down a regular place in the team, he was sent on loan to French Ligue 1 club FC Metz in December 2001, until the end of the season. On 30 November 2002, Job cracked his skull in a clash of heads with West Bromwich Albion player Darren Moore and was knocked unconscious on the pitch. On 29 September 2003, Job twisted his knee in training and was expected to be out of action for four months, just after scoring the clubs winning goal against Everton with then Middlesbrough manager, Steve McClaren saying, \\"It's a huge blow for Joseph because he has been playing well lately and he also got our winner against Everton. We'll miss him. The highlight of his career at Middlesbrough came in the 2004 Football League Cup Final on 29 February 2004 when he scored a second minute goal to help the club to win their first ever major trophy, in a 2–1 win over Bolton Wanderers at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, a result which also saw the club qualify for the UEFA Cup. On 15 December 2004, Job scored Middlesbrough's second goal in a 3–0 UEFA Cup Group E win over Serbian club FK Partizan at the Riverside Stadium as they qualified, as winners of the group, for the knockout stages. Middlesbrough went out of the competition in the Round of 32 to Portuguese club, Sporting Clube de Portugal, with Job again scoring in the home leg on 10 March 2005. During his time at Middlesbrough he was the subject of one of the more memorable fan chants, being serenaded by the words \\"there's only one Job on Teesside\\", due to a lot of unemployment in the area at the time. In the 2005–06 season, he was again sent on loan, this time to Saudi Arabia on 31 August 2005, where he played for Al-Ittihad on a season-long loan. He helped the club win the AFC Champions League in 2005, scoring in the second leg of the final against United Arab Emirates club, Al Ain FC on 5 November 2005 in Jeddah. Job's struggle to win a first-team place became even more difficult, following the signings of established Premiership strikers Mark Viduka, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Yakubu. His contract with Middlesbrough expired after his loan spell with Al-Ittihad. He spent part of the 2006–07 pre-season training with Watford, but was not offered a contract. =Sedan= Job joined Ligue 1 club CS Sedan on 19 September 2006 on a one-year contract. He capped 28 times and scored 10 goals. =Nice= Job moved to Ligue 1 club OGC Nice in summer 2007, signing a two-year contract. In summer 2008, he was linked with a move to English Football League Championship club Blackpool. =Lierse= On 15 March 2010, Lierse SK signed the Cameroonian 32-year-old forward as free agent. At the start of the 2009–10 Season, Lierse SK were the major favorites to win the championship in the Belgian second division (EXQI League) but when Job arrived, they were struggling in the deciding moments. Job played his first game against KV Turnhout. He entered the game in the second half, when Lierse was behind 0–1 at home and playing badly. He scored 2 goals and gave 1 assist to help Lierse win the match 3–1 and ultimately helped them win the championship, as he also scored the second goal in the deciding match at home against Red Star Waasland (2–0 win). Job signed a new contract for Lierse for two seasons on 21 June 2010. International career Job was tipped early on to be a future French International player, however he instead accepted a call-up to the Cameroon national team, and made his debut in a 2–0 defeat to England at Wembley Stadium in November 1997. Job has played at two FIFA World Cup finals, in 1998 and 2002. He also played for Cameroon at the victorious 2000 African Cup of Nations and in the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2001 and 2003. However, his next call up to the Cameroon squad came five years later, in March 2007, when he was called up to the squad for a 2008 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Liberia. In January 2008 he scored three goals in two games, scoring once as Cameroon beat Sudan 2–0 in a friendly match and twice as Cameroon beat Zambia 5–1 in a 2008 AFrican Cup of Nations qualifying match. He was also in the Cameroon squad for the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations. Personal life Job is the cousin of FC Ingolstadt 04 midfielder Marvin Matip and Liverpool defender Joël Matip.

It lies in Loch Craignish, about off the Argyll coastline. The name is Gaelic for \\"King's Island\\", although which royal is not known. History Looking south from Eilean Mhic Chrion to Eilean Rìgh The island has the remains of two Iron Age forts. In the 1930s, the island was home to Sir Reginald Johnston, retired tutor to Puyi, the last Chinese emperor. Johnston modernised the houses, built a Buddhist temple, and even flew the flag of Manchukuo in the Chinese-style gardens. with Chinese servants who lived in the farmhouse. Johnston was immortalised in the multiple Oscar winning film (nine Oscars) by Bernardo Bertolucci, 'The Last Emperor' where Johnston was portrayed by Peter O'Toole. The property was purchased by a retired Indian army officer, Major Campbell, who lived in it with his family until the outbreak of the Second World War, when they left for a house in Ardfern. He believed that a German submarine had entered the loch during the First World War and had caught sheep. In 1959 it was purchased by Wilfred Brown and his cousin Robert Banks Skinner.They believed that in the future the UK would become crowded and the island would be a place for some privacy but was largely used as a as a holiday home. In 1992 it was sold to James Waldegrave, Viscount Chewton. The current owner is a Scottish-based ex-financier, Mr Christian Siva-Jothy (he retired as a Partner of Goldman Sachs in 2004) who bought the island from Viscount Chewton in 1998 and then substantially renovated the properties on it, installing mains electrics via an undersea power cable, a new fresh water well and telecoms via a microwave link. The island was for sale from 2013 for over a year but was taken off the market early in 2015 when the present owner (Mr Siva-Jothy) sold his estate in the North of Scotland and moved back to live permanently on Eilean Righ. Mr Siva-Jothy and his wife (who studied Mandarin both as an undergraduate and postgraduate student at SOAS where Sir Reginald Johnston was the first professor of Chinese) now reside full-time on the island.

The film co-starred Edna Purviance, Eric Campbell, Henry Bergman, and Albert Austin, and is best known for showcasing Chaplin's roller skating skills. Synopsis Charlie plays an inept and sometimes clumsy waiter at a restaurant. One of his customers is the hot-tempered Mr. Stout. Charlie determines his bill by examining what he has spilled on his suit. While he is not a great server, Charlie is an excellent skater at the nearby roller rink. He meets a girl there and saves her from the unwanted attentions of the same Mr. Stout he earlier encountered at the restaurant. The grateful girl invites Charlie to a skating party. Charlie accepts and attends the party in top hat and tails. He again encounters the volatile Mr. Stout and runs afoul of Mrs. Stout. While skating, Charlie accidentally falls on her and pulls down her skirt. The skating party quickly descends into a riot. The police are called to restore order, but Charlie escapes by deftly rolling away with his cane hooked to the back of a moving automobile. Chaplin's obvious skill on roller skates surprised many of his fans, but Charlie was an experienced performer. As a touring vaudevillian with Fred Karno's pantomime troupe, Chaplin appeared in a roller-skating skit in which he displayed talent for comedic falls--and the ability to cause other skaters to topple. Review A reviewer from Variety positively wrote, \\"There is plenty of fun provided by [Chaplin] on the rollers and he displayed a surprising cleverness on them. A number of funny falls occurred as was looked for, with Charlie outshining and outwitting any of the others on the floor.\\" Cast * Charles Chaplin - A Waiter.

He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Weingart Foundation, and past Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Playa Vista. In September 2011 he was appointed by the California Science Center to be the Senior Advisor to the museum in its project with NASA to bring, and permanently exhibit, the Space Shuttle Endeavour to the CSC. He is Chairman of the Maccabiah Games Committee of 18, a member of the Board of Directors of the Macerich Company (NYSE), and is widely known as the foremost collector of typewriters which were previously owned by famous individuals. Soboroff is the past Chairperson of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University, and was a Senior Fellow and member of the Advisory Board at UCLA's Luskin School of Public Affairs, and remains as a member of the Board of Councillors at the USC Price School of Public Policy. He served as Senior Advisor to Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. Soboroff joined Big Brothers while a college student and was matched with then 9 year old Terry Alan Williams as his Little Brother. In 2018 the pair celebrated their 50th year as a match. Both Steve and Terry are now grandfathers. From 1995-2000, he was President of the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Commission and prior to that was a member of the L.A. Harbor Commission where he was instrumental in making the Alameda Corridor project happen. Soboroff ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Los Angeles in 2001 with then-Mayor Riordan's endorsement. Biography Soboroff was raised in a middle-class, secular Jewish family in Chicago, the son of Evelyn and Irving Soboroff. His father's hat manufacturing business collapsed in the 1960s when hats went out of fashion and the family moved first to Arkansas and then to California where his folks opened the successful Shaxted linen boutique in Beverly Hills. In 1966, Soboroff graduated from Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. He tried to enlist during the Vietnam War but was denied for medical reasons. He holds Bachelor and Master's Degrees from the Dept. of Finance, Insurance and Real Estate at the University of Arizona. During the summers while in college, he worked as a chauffeur/kid watcher/assistant for Kirk Douglas, whose wife Anne was a frequent customer to his parent’s retail linen shop called Shaxted While in college, his father introduced him to J. K. Eichenbaum, a Los Angeles-based real estate developer who specialized in shopping centers. In 1971, he went to work for Eichenbaum and in 1979, he left the company and using his network of contacts began to lease and renovate shopping centers on his own. In 1994, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan appointed him as president of the Recreation and Parks Commission. =STAPLES Center= Soboroff is widely credited as the driving force behind the development of STAPLES Center in downtown Los Angeles, having come up with a plan, as Senior Advisor to Mayor Riordan, to keep the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings in the City of Los Angeles instead of the teams developing a new arena in Inglewood, California. According to The Los Angeles Times: The vision came to him hundreds of feet in the air. Looking down at the Convention Center from a rented helicopter, Steve Soboroff was struck by inspiration. \\"That piece of property,\\" he says. \\"God put it there for an arena. Turning this notion into reality--the $400-million Staples Center--would require years of high hopes and dead ends, political infighting and uncommon cooperation. Millionaires, elected officials and civil servants all would play roles. As is probably the case with any undertaking of this magnitude, few of them now agree on precisely how and why things got done. But pretty much everyone concurs the project began with one man. =2001 race for mayor= Soboroff entered the 2001 mayoral primary election, and received Riordan's endorsement. In the primary, Soboroff received the most votes among many groups including Westsiders and residents of the San Fernando Valley. He finished third overall, with 108,000+ votes, coming within 3% of eventual winner James K. Hahn. Hahn and former California State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa advanced to the runoff. In 2005, many of the traffic-fighting proposals Soboroff introduced during his 2001 campaign, as well as his plan to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), were reintroduced by other candidates in that year's mayoral contest. Later in 2005, newly elected Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, with whom Soboroff competed for the Mayor's job in 2001, implemented Soboroff's proposal to ban all road construction during rush hour. Villaraigosa's 2005 and 2009 campaign manager, Ace Smith, played the same role for Soboroff in 2001. =Playa Vista= In October 2001, six months after finishing out of contention in the Los Angeles mayoral race, Soboroff joined Playa Vista as the city’s president. He oversaw the development of 20 parks, an elementary school, offices, the Los Angeles Clippers training facility, residences, and other amenities, which resulted in one of the most popular neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The wetlands were preserved and major traffic mitigation improvements were established. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On April 19, 2011, Soboroff was hired to be the Vice Chairman of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. His responsibilities were said to include leading the efforts to improve the fan experience and strengthening the team's ties to the community. One day later, Major League Baseball seized control of the Dodgers from McCourt. He resigned his position on June 25, 2011, citing the \\"unanticipated action by the commissioner of Major League Baseball\\" as preventing him from doing the job he was hired for. Personal life In 1982, he married Patti Schertzer. They have five children: Jacob (1983), Miles (1985), Molly (1987), Hannah (1988), and Leah (1993).

He was the first ever professor of philosophy of medicine at a German university and has made significant contributions to the philosophy, methodology, and logic of medicine since 1970.See a list of Sadegh-Zadeh's works on these subjects here  Life and career  Sadegh-Zadeh was born on 23 April 1942 in Tabriz, Iran. The fourth of eight children, he grew up in Tabriz and attended school from 1947 to 1959. His father was a craftsman and manufacturer and ran a minor terrycloth weaving mill. In the wake of severe political and economic crisis in the country caused by the U.S. and British coup d’état against the democratically elected government of Iran's Prime Minister Dr. Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953,CIA Confirms Role in 1953 Iran CoupCIA admits role in Iran coup he went bankrupt and never recovered. At eleven years of age when entering the high school shortly after his father's bankruptcy, Sadegh-Zadeh told his parents he would become a professor of medicine in the future and provoked laughter from them.Cf. Sadegh-Zadeh's autobiography Upon finishing school education at the prestigious Ferdowsi High School in Tabriz, Sadegh-Zadeh came to Germany in March 1960 to pursue his goal as a working student and studied medicine and philosophy at the universities of Münster, Berlin, and Göttingen from 1960 to 1971 with Internship and residency 1967–1971. He earned a doctorate of medicine, Dr. med., from the University of Göttingen in November 1971. But immediately he left practical medicine to conduct theoretical research on clinical reasoning, for during his training in the hospital he had got the impression that in the foundations of clinical decision-making something was going wrong to produce about 38% errors of diagnosis and treatment.Cf. Gross R, and Löffler M, Prinzipien der Medizin. Eine Übersicht ihrer Grundlagen und Methoden. Berlin: Springer, 1997, p. 357. In an autodidactic way he specialized in the philosophy of medicine and was assistant professor and lecturer 1972–1982 and full professor of philosophy of medicine 1982–2004 at the University of Münster located in the city of Münster in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in northwest Germany. He is married since 1970 and has two sons. In the 1970s, Sadegh-Zadeh inaugurated a new direction in the philosophy of medicine that he based, like analytic philosophy, on the application of formal logic and dubbed analytic philosophy of medicine to distinguish it from the traditional philosophy of medicine,Seising R, A \\"Goodbye to the Aristotelian Weltanschauung\\" and a \\"Handbook of Analytic Philosophy of Medicine\\".

The Emergence of Machina Sapiens. (In German.) Tecklenburg, Germany: Burgverlag, 2000.  Work  = Analytic philosophy of medicine = Sadegh-Zadeh conceives analytic philosophy of medicine as philosophy of medicine in the analytic tradition of philosophizing, i.e., philosophy of medicine by means of logical and conceptual analysis with its primary fields of inquiry being: * Philosophy of medical language, * Medical praxiology, i.e., philosophy, methodology and logic of medical practice, * Medical epistemology, * Medical deontics, i.e., analysis of medical morality, obligations, and law, * Medical logic, and * Medical metaphysics:Seising R, Tabacchi ME (eds.), Fuzziness and Medicine: Philosophical Reflections and Application Systems in Health Care, A Companion Volume to Sadegh-Zadeh’s Handbook of Analytic Philosophy of Medicine. Berlin: Springer, 2013.  Philosophy of medical language  Sadegh-Zadeh considers medical language an ill-structured and ill-kept extension of everyday language by adding technical terms such as \\"angina pectoris\\", \\"appendicitis\\", etc. Sadegh-Zadeh claims that most of its terms are imprecise and ambiguous because they are either undefined or ill-defined.Cf. Chapter 2 and page 822 of the above-mentioned Handbook. Since it has a significant impact both on medical knowledge and medical decision-making, he devotes himself extensively to the analysis of its nature and of its syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. He demonstrates and analyzes what he claims to be the inherent vagueness of medical terms and constructs techniques for dealing with this principally ineliminable feature by means of fuzzy logic. To this end, he introduces a comprehensive methodology of medical, including fuzzy, concept formation. Inspired by Patrick Suppes's and Carl Gustav Hempel's works,Suppes P, Introduction to Logic. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, 1957. Chapters 8 and 12.Hempel CG, Fundamentals of Concept Formation in Empirical Science. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1952. he bases this methodology on an explication and formalization of all methods of definition known today.Cf. pp. 13–118, particularly 69–118, in the above- mentioned Handbook  Medical praxiology  Medical, or clinical, praxiology is an old term introduced by Sadegh-Zadeh in 1977–1981 already to denote a wide-ranging inquiry into the foundations of clinical practice, particularly of clinical judgment and decision-making, with the aim of reducing diagnostic-therapeutic errors and of improving physician performance.Basic problems in the theory of clinical practice. Part I: Explication of the concept of medical diagnosis. Metamed, 1977;1:76–102.Foundations of clinical praxiology. Part I: The relativity of medical diagnosis. Metamedicine, 1981;2:183–196. See the article here In the latter article referred to, he has defined the term explicitly as \\"analysis of clinical practice\\", \\"inquiry into clinical practice\\", and \\"theory of clinical practice\\", i.e., the philosophy, methodology, and logic of medical doing and acting.Cf. page 121 in the above-mentioned Handbook. Central topics include everything related to concepts and theories that are basic to clinical practice, i.e., the concepts and theories of patient, suffering, health, illness, disease, diagnosis, etiology, prognosis, therapy, and prevention. This perspective, Sadegh-Zadeh claims, creates a fertile scientific field with a host of tasks ranging from conceptual analyses (like \\"what is disease?\\", \\"what is a diagnosis?\\", \\"what is differential diagnosis?\\", etc.) to logical analyses – such as \\"is clinical decision-making computable or does it require human intelligence and intuition?\\" – to epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics of clinical decision-making and so forth. Over the past decades, Sadegh- Zadeh's clinical praxiology has developed further with increasing sophistication. One example of his theories is the prototype resemblance theory of disease presenting a fuzzy-logical explication of the vague concept of disease:  Medical epistemology  Medical epistemology is the philosophy of medical knowledge or simply theory of medical knowledge. Sadegh- Zadeh conceived it as a task or branch of the philosophy of medicine already in 1982 deploring that \\"The contemporary philosophy of medicine movement is mainly concerned with medical-ethical problems while unduly neglecting medical-epistemological ones\\".Cf. Sadegh-Zadeh K, Perception, illusion, and hallucination. Metamedicine, 1982; 3:159–191. See the article here The category medical knowledge consists of statements of spatio-temporally localized facts, general hypotheses, and theories. Sadegh-Zadeh has proposed an elaborate systematics of all types of medical hypotheses and knowledge the latter ones including classificatory knowledge, causal knowledge, experimental knowledge, theoretical knowledge, practical knowledge, clinical knowledge, and medical metaknowledge.Cf. pp. 463–478 of the Handbook Most important among them is what is called practical knowledge or know-how in medicine. By a formally precise explication of this knowledge type he shows that medical- practical knowledge actually consists of conditional norms, i.e., deontic conditionals, mainly conditional obligations. This is one of the reasons why Sadegh-Zadeh considers medicine a deontic discipline. Specifically, he views clinical practice as practiced morality because clinical decision-making is nothing but the application of conditional obligations of which diagnostic- therapeutic rules of action primarily consist. And since clinical research pursues such rules of action and tries to improve the available ones, it constitutes explorative and normative ethics based on empirical research and experience.Sadegh-Zadeh K, Medicine as Ethics and Constructive Utopia. (In German.) Tecklenburg / Germany: Burgverlag, 1983. See also pp. 597–603 and 843–845 of the Handbook A central role in Sadegh-Zadeh's medical epistemology play medical theories. He analyzes the concept of \\"medical theory\\" in line with the so-called structuralist view of theories to represent their structure and content, according to Patrick Suppes and Joseph D. Sneed's approach, as set-theoretic predicates. This enables him to show that a theory in medicine cannot be confirmed, supported, disconfirmed, verified or falsified simply because it is merely a conceptual structure and no epistemic entity to be true, probable or false. It does not make any empirical claims about the world. Such claims are made using the theory as a tool. The claims themselves, as empirical hypotheses, are something different than the theory.See pp. 417–461 of the Handbook Not only medical theories, as non-epistemic entities, do not deserve the ascription of truth or falsehood. Regarding any other piece of general medical knowledge, Sadegh-Zadeh shows that apart from the Gettier problem, it does not fulfill the classical definition of knowledge as justified true belief. According to his detailed analysis, there are no justified true beliefs in medicine.See pp. 413–417, 471–476 and 506–508 of the Handbook Statements, hypotheses and theories in medicine and other fields are usually viewed as knowledge only because the ascription \\"this is knowledge\\", for example, that AIDS is caused by HIV is knowledge, is a performative conducted or affirmed by a scientific or professional community as a social group. This communitarian and social epistemology that goes back to the Polish physician and epistemologist Ludwik Fleck (1896–1961), is profitably utilized and extended by Sadegh-Zadeh.See pp. 518–550 of the Handbook  Medical deontics  Apart from the deontic nature of medical-practical knowledge referred to above, a second reason why Sadegh-Zadeh classifies medicine as a deontic field is his view that according to his prototype resemblance theory of disease, the concept of disease is inherently value-laden. This is so because prototype diseases upon which nosology is based are, as phenomena, disvalued by human beings and are therefore considered to be something \\"that ought not to be\\". That means that they are, and consequently all other diseases as their resemblants are, deontic entities.For the notion of \\"deontic entity\\" (deontic thing), see page 602 of the Handbook The deonticity of medicine and of disease as its basic concept necessitates, according to Sadegh-Zadeh, a specific inquiry by means of suitable tools and methods, i.e., deontic logic. This research field he terms medical deontics. It also includes medical ethics, medical metaethics, and medical law.Cf. Chs. 14–16 on pp. 575–603 of the Handbook  Medical logic  Publications entitled \\"The Logic of Medicine\\" give rise to the question whether medicine has its own logic like quantum logic is argued to be the logic of quantum mechanics. To answer the question, Sadegh-Zadeh distinguishes between logic in medicine and logic of medicine. \\"Logic in medicine\\" means the class of all logics that are, or may be, applied in medicine to solve theoretical or practical problems. Examples are classical two-valued logic, many-valued logic, paraconsistent logic, deontic logic, temporal logic, probability logic, fuzzy logic, and so on. Their number is unlimited. But none of them is specifically made for medical use. This logical pluralism in medicine parallels the mathematical pluralism in that innumerable mathematical theories are used in medicine as well without any of them being \\"the mathematics of medicine\\". So, there is no logic of medicine, Sadegh-Zadeh concludes, a logic that could be viewed or used as a specifically medical logic.Cf. Part V, Chs. 17–18, pp. 609–706 of the Handbook  Medical metaphysics  Medical metaphysics is primarily concerned with (i) medical ontology, (ii) medical truth, and (iii) the nature of medicine.Cf. p. 7 and Part VII (pp. 747–852) of the Handbook (i) Medical ontology. Sadegh-Zadeh devotes himself extensively to pure, formal, and applied ontology to use them in his logical analysis of medical-ontological issues of medical knowledge, clinical practice, nosology, psychiatry, psychosomatics, and biomedicine such as, for example, whether diseases exist or are fictitious entities invented by nosologists and physicians, and whether particular other things such as genes, psyche, and schizophrenia exist or are mere myths. To settle these enduring controversies and similar ones in medicine, he first distinguishes between ontology de re and ontology de dicto. The distinction is based on a syntactic criterion similar to Barcan formula and enables differentiation between fictional entities such as Sherlock Holmes and real ones. Second, he inaugurates an intriguing fuzzy ontology by introducing a many-place existence operator and fuzzyfying this operator to obtain a quantitative concept of existence that he calls the Heraclitean operator.Cf. p. 765 f. of the Handbook The Heraclitean operator ranges over the domain of all imaginable entities, including existent, non-existent, and fictitious ones, and over all possible frames of reference, a frame of reference being a particular language and a particular logic. As a result, an entity exists, does not exist, or is fictitious only to a particular extent in the unit interval [0, 1] with respect to a particular language and a particular logic. In this way, ontological stances such as realism, anti- realism, and fictionalism regarding whether something exists or not, become obsolete. For example, schizophrenia may exist with respect to Eugen Bleuler (1857–1939) and his followers' language and logic, while Thomas Szasz and his followers may view it as a myth with respect to their language and logic. The only remedy for irreconcilable ontological controversies of this and similar type is to care about one's unkempt language and logic, and to reach an agreement about which language and conceptual system and which logic should be used in a particular scientific discourse. Anyhow, medical language and its sublanguages as ill-structured and ill-kempt workaday languages are absolutely unsuitable for serious discourses. They allow their users too much latitude in interpretation. \\"Change your language or logic, and you will see another world\\".Cf. p. 171 in Sadegh-Zadeh K, Perception, illusion, and hallucination. Metamedicine, 1982; 3:159–191 . See also pp. 756 and 766 of the Handbook His fuzzy ontology also includes a fuzzy mereology and mereotopology by means of which vague part-whole relationships, for example in anatomy, surgery and other medical fields, become logically tractable. In addition, he has developed a technique to bring to light the ontological commitments of any piece of medical knowledge so as to ascertain the ontological prerequisites of its satisfiability. He hopes to have paved the way thereby for a precise medical model theory in analogy to the mathematical one, which might enable sophisticated knowledge ontology in medicine and elsewhere, and thus, advanced medical epistemology. \\"In such a medical model theory, relationships between models of different items of medical knowledge, including theories, could be precisely analyzed\\".Cf. p. 778 of the Handbook However, he is very skeptical about what has recently come to be known as biomedical ontology engineering in biomedical computer and information sciences. He does not regard this endeavor as ontology at all because it is actually concerned with vocabularies and terminologies confirming the slogan \\"ontology recapitulates philology\\".Cf. pp. 797–800 of the HandbookOn page viii of his book Word and Object (paperback edition 1964), Willard Van Orman Quine attributes the sardonic slogan to James Grier Miller (ii) On medical truth. After a thorough discussion of truth theories, Sadegh-Zadeh shows that there is sufficient evidence to support the assertion that medical truths are system-relative, and are produced within the respective health care systems themselves. They do not mirror or report scientifically discovered facts in the world out there which could be independent of the conceptual system from where they are viewed and judged. This problem not only concerns truth in medical sciences, but also truth in clinical practice. Specifically, he precisely explicates the concepts of diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and misdiagnosis to demonstrate that the truth and falsehood of all these outcomes of clinical decision-making are relative to the respective medical language and knowledge used, to methods of inquiry applied, to conceptual systems, vocabularies and terminologies constructed and proposed by scientific and professional communities, to regulations issued by health authorities, and to other factors in the health care system that impact on the actions and interactions of the diagnostic personnel. According to Sadegh-Zadeh, medical truth is made in medicine.Cf. pp. 819–827 of the Handbook (iii) On the nature of medicine. In his analytic philosophy of medicine, Sadegh-Zadeh places particular emphasis on the analysis of medicine as a scientific field. Abandoning widespread, shallow mono-categorizations such as \\"medicine is a science\\" versus \\"medicine is an art\\", he demonstrates that in declarations of the type \\"medicine is such and such\\", the global term \\"medicine\\" should be differentiated to acknowledge that medicine, comprising many heterogeneous disciplines, belongs to a large number of categories. For example, without doubt biomedicine is natural science; clinical research, however, is practical science; it is also normative ethics; clinical practice is practiced morality; and so on. What is worth noting, is that medicine is also a poietic science (from the Greek term ποίησις for \\"making, creating\\") that invents, designs, and produces medical devices in the widest sense of the term \\"making\\", from drugs to prosthetics to brain chips to artificial organs to artificial babies. Medicine is thus on its way to become an engineering science, conducted as health engineering and anthropotechnology.Cf. pp. 7–8 and 829–873 of the Handbook = Applied fuzzy logic = The application of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic to biomedical subjects, clinical problems, and philosophical issues is one of Sadegh-Zadeh's main interests. Prominent among his achievements in this area is the reconstruction of biopolymers (such as nucleic acid chains DNA and RNA and polypeptide chains) as ordered fuzzy sets.Sadegh-Zadeh K, Fuzzy genomes. Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 2000; 18:1–28. In addition, (i) Fuzzy biopolymers, p. 683 ff. of the Handbook. And (ii) The fuzzy polynucleotide space revisited, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 2007; 41:69–80 accessible here. This theory of fuzzy biopolymers has made biopolymers amenable to fuzzy set theory and logic and has proved very fruitful thereby to stimulate research interest in different teams.Cf., for example, Torres A and Nieto JJ, The fuzzy polynucleotide space: basic properties. Bioinformatics, 2003; 19:587–592 accessible here Other examples are (i) extensive application of fuzzy logic in his clinical praxiology and to problems of clinical decision-making; and (ii) fuzzification of deontics and ontology.Cf. the lists of his publications among External links below. = Philosophy of technology = In his methodology of fuzzy concept formation, Sadegh-Zadeh has introduced a fuzzy concept of self-reproduction, termed quasiself-reproduction, that has enabled him to interpret the self-reproducing machines in a completely new way and to suggest an intriguing theory of technoevolution.Sadegh-Zadeh K, When Man Forgot How to Think: The Emergence of Machina Sapiens. (In German.) Tecklenburg / Germany: Burgverlag, 2000. There is something in the nature of technology, he says, that we, as human beings, cannot afford to ignore. It is the tendency of machines to join up and to work together to the effect that a larger machine emerges being more efficient and powerful than its parts. This peculiarity has led in the last centuries to the growth of a distributed, unique Global Machine, GM, which consists of the network of all machines on and around the earth. How this globalization of the machine could occur and what GM looks like, is reconstructed and explained in his theory. Comparable to the bioevolution of animal and plant species, the technoevolution proceeds as a Darwinian one by quasiself-reproduction and selection. GM constitutes a subsystem of a hybrid hypercycle of two evolving partners, biosphere and technosphere, which due to the enormous dynamics of the hypercycle rapidly coevolve. On the part of the technosphere, the salient yield of the coevolution is the advancing mentalization of GM, a process that human beings misconceive as artificial intelligence constructed by them. But according to Sadegh-Zadeh's theory, this is only a myopic interpretation of the gradual, natural emergence of the intelligent and self-conscious Machina Sapiens in the guise of a globally distributed machine.When Man Forgot How to Think  Selected publications  = Articles = * K.

A power forward, he was part of the Houston Rockets National Basketball Association championship teams of the mid-1990s. He was the first Venezuelan to ever play in the NBA. Basketball career Out of Jacksonville Junior College in Texas and the University of Houston, Herrera was selected by the Miami Heat with the 30th pick in the 1990 NBA Draft, spending his first professional season in Spain, with Real Madrid. Partnering with another future NBA player, Stanley Roberts, he helped the Liga ACB club to the Korać Cup final in his only season. Herrera began his professional career in the United States in 1991 with the Houston Rockets, where he played until 1995, when the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic in four games to win their second straight NBA Championship. During the regular season of the two successful seasons combined, he averaged six points and four rebounds in roughly 20 minutes of play.

Huang writes mainly about the tragic and sometimes humorous lives of ordinary Taiwanese people, and many of his short stories have been turned into films, including The Sandwich Man (1983). Career Born in Ratō Town, Taihoku Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan (modern-day Luodong, Yilan, Taiwan), Huang began his higher education career at a college in Taipei but, after a series of transfers, ended up graduating from National Pingtung University of Education in southern Taiwan. He is a writer of broad interests and remarkable versatility, but he is first of all a short story writer. During the 1960s as a major contributor to the influential Literature Quarterly, Huang was hailed as a representative of the Taiwan Nativist Literature movement that focused on the lives of rural Taiwanese people. In more recent works he has turned his attention to urban culture and life in Taiwan's growing cities. Starting in the 1990s, he established and has written for and directed the Big Fish Children's Theater Troupe (黃大魚兒童劇團). Huang was awarded the for Literature in 1997. He opened a cafe and salon in his native Yilan, operating it for three years before closing it in December 2015.  Influences  Huang has said that in his early years he had limited access to literature in Chinese and that significant influences were Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and \\"The Killers\\"; Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\"; William Faulkner's \\"A Rose for Emily,\\" \\"The Bear,\\" The Wild Palms, and other American literature. Two other important influences were an anthology of short stories by Shen Congwen and a Chinese translation of stories by Anton Chekhov.Author's preface to the collection of English language translations of stories, The Taste of Apples, pp. xiv-xv. English translations The major translation of Huang's work into English is The Taste of Apples (Howard Goldblatt trans). New York: Columbia University Press, 2001.

He was a student of Johann Sebastian Bach.Applegate, Celia, Bach and Berlin: Nation and Cullture in Mendelssohn's Revival of the St. Matthew Passion, Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London, 2005, p. 15 According to Ingeborg Allihn, Kirnberger played a significant role in the intellectual and cultural exchange between Germany and Poland in the mid-18th century (Allihn 1995, 209). Between 1741 and 1751 Kirnberger lived and worked in Poland for powerful magnates including Lubomirski, Poninski, and Rzewuski before ending up at the Benedictine Cloister in Lviv (then part of Poland). He spent much time collecting Polish national dances and compiled them in his treatise Die Charaktere der Taenze (Allihn 1995, 211). Kirnberger became a violinist at the court of Frederick II of Prussia in 1751. He was the music director to the Prussian Princess Anna Amalia from 1758 until his death. Kirnberger greatly admired Johann Sebastian Bach, deeming him \\"the greatest of all composers.\\" Kirnberger published Bach's Clavierübungen mit der bachischen Applicatur in the 1760s, and seeking to secure the publication of all of Bach's chorale settings, which finally appeared after Kirnberger's death; see Kirnberger chorale preludes (BWV 690–713). Many of Bach's manuscripts have been preserved in Kirnberger's library (the \\"Kirnberger collection\\"). Kirnberger is known today primarily for his theoretical work Die Kunst des reinen Satzes in der Musik (The Art of Strict Composition in Music, 1774, 1779). The well-tempered tuning systems known as \\"Kirnberger II\\" and \\"Kirnberger III\\" are associated with his name (see Kirnberger temperament), as is a rational version of equal temperament (see schisma). One of his most familiar compositions is Fuga in C-dur für Orgel (\\"Fanfare\\" Fugue), which was formerly attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach and then to his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach.

She was named for Isaac Hull. Hull received 10 battle stars for World War II service, having sailed to Europe, and serving in the Pacific before and during the war in combat. After addition of equipment that made her more top-heavy, she was one of three destroyers sunk by heavy seas encountered in Halsey's Typhoon. 11 officers of the Hull, including the executive officer, and 191 enlisted sailors perished in the sea, while seven officers and 55 enlisted men were recovered.Clavin, Tom & Bob Drury. Halsey's Typhoon: The True Story of a Fighting Admiral, an Epic Storm, and an Untold Rescue; Grove Press; reprint edition : 10 November 2007; Construction and commissioning Hull was launched by New York Navy Yard 31 January 1934; sponsored by Miss Patricia Louise Platt; and commissioned 11 January 1935, Commander R. S. Wentworth in command.  Pre-World War II  Following a shakedown cruise which took her to the Azores, Portugal, and the British Isles, Hull arrived San Diego, California, via the Panama Canal 19 October 1935. She began her operations with the Pacific Fleet off San Diego, engaging in tactical exercises and training. During the summer of 1936 she cruised to Alaska and in April 1937 took part in fleet exercises in Hawaiian waters. During this increasingly tense pre-war period, Hull often acted as plane guard to the Navy's Pacific aircraft carriers. She continued these operations until the outbreak of the war, moving to her new home port, Pearl Harbor, 12 October 1939.  Pearl Harbor  The pattern of fleet problems, plane guard duty, and patrolling was interrupted 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Hull was alongside tender undergoing repairs and put her anti-aircraft batteries into operation. As the main object of the raid was battleships and the absent aircraft carriers, the destroyer suffered no hits and departed next day to join carrier and escort her into Pearl Harbor. During the next critical months of the war, Hull operated with Admiral Wilson Brown's Task Force 11, screening in important strikes on Japanese bases in the Solomon Islands. She returned to Pearl Harbor 26 March, and for 3 months sailed on convoy duty between San Francisco, California and Pearl Harbor. Hull was sailed 7 December for Suyu, Fiji Islands, to prepare for the amphibious assault on Guadalcanal. She departed 26 July for the Solomons and on the day of the landings, 7 August 1942, screened cruisers during shore bombardment and then took up station as antisubmarine protection for the transports. Next day she helped repel bombing attacks, shooting down several planes. That evening she intentionally sank the transport George F. Elliott, burning beyond control. On 9 August the destroyer sank a small schooner off Guadalcanal, departing that evening for Espiritu Santo. During the next difficult weeks on Guadalcanal, Hull made three voyages with transports and warships in support of the troops, undergoing air attacks 9 and 14 September.  Aleutian Islands  The ship returned to Pearl Harbor 20 October, and spent the remainder of the year with battleship in the New Hebrides. She sailed 29 January from Pearl Harbor bound for repairs at San Francisco, arriving 7 February 1943. Upon completion she moved to the Aleutian Islands, arriving Adak, Alaska 16 April, and began a series of training maneuvers with battleships and cruisers in the northern waters. As the Navy moved in to retake Attu in May, Hull continued her patrol duties, and during July and early August she took part in numerous bombardments of Kiska Island. The ship also took part in the landings on Kiska 15 August, only to find that the Japanese had evacuated.  South Pacific operations  Hull returned to the Central Pacific after the Kiska operation, arriving Pearl Harbor 26 September 1943. She departed with the fleet 3 days later for strikes on Wake Island, and operated with escort carriers during diversionary strikes designed to mask the Navy's real objective—the Gilbert Islands. Hull bombarded Makin during this assault 20 November, and with the invasion well underway arrived in convoy at Pearl Harbor 7 December 1943. From there she returned to Oakland, California 21 December for amphibious exercises. Next on the island road to Japan was the Marshall Islands, and Hull sailed with Task Force 53 from San Diego 13 January 1944. She arrived 31 January off Kwajalein, screening transports in the reserve area, and through February carried out screening and patrol duties off Eniwetok and Majuro. Joining a battleship and carrier group, the ship moved to Mille Atoll 18 March, and took part in a devastating bombardment. Hull also took part in the bombardment of Wotje 22 March. The veteran ship next participated in the raid on Truk 29–30 April, after which she arrived Majuro 4 May 1944. There she joined Admiral Lee's battleships for the next major invasion, the assault on the Marianas Islands. Hull bombarded Saipan 13 June, covered minesweeping operations with gunfire, and patrolled during the initial landing 15 June. Two days later Hull and other ships steamed out to join Admiral Marc Mitscher's carrier task force. The fleets approached each other 19 June for the biggest carrier engagement of the war, and as four large air raids hit the American dispositions fighter cover from the carriers of Hull's Task Group 58.2. With help from American submarines, Mitscher succeeded in sinking two Japanese carriers in addition to inflicting fatal losses on the Japanese naval air arm during \\"The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\" 19 June, Hull assisting in several of these engagements. During July the destroyer operated with carrier groups off Guam, and after the assault 21 July patrolled off the island. In August she returned to Seattle, Washington, arriving on the 25th, and underwent repairs which kept her in the States until 23 October, when she anchored at Pearl Harbor.  Typhoon Cobra  Hull was ordered to join a 3rd Fleet refueling group, departing 20 November 1944, to rendezvous with fast carrier striking forces in the Philippine Sea, at the instructions of South Pacific Commander William Halsey Jr. Fueling operations with the fast, carrier strike-force in the Philippine Sea began on 17 December 1944, but increasingly heavy seas forced cancellation later that day. The fueling group became engulfed next day in an approaching typhoon, designated Cobra, with barometers falling to very low levels and winds increasing above 90 knots. After Hull was ordered to change course to 140 degrees, ostensibly by Admiral Halsey \\"to see what they were doing,\\"\\"Tide to History\\" by Greil Marcus, The Threepenny Review, Spring 2008 the wind increased to over 100 knots. At about 11:00 hours, on 18 December, Hull became locked \\"in irons\\", in the trough of the mountainous sea. Unable to steer with the north wind on her port beam, yawing between 80 and 100 degrees, the whaleboat and depth charges were swept off. As the roll increased to 70 degrees, she was pinned down by a gust as the sea flooded the pilot house and poured down the stacks. All hands worked feverishly to maintain integrity and keep the ship afloat during the heavy rolls, but finally, in the words of her commander, Lt. Cmdr James A. Marks, \\"the ship remained over on her side at an angle of 80 degrees or more as the water flooded into her upper structures. I remained on the port wing of the bridge until the water flooded up to me, then I stepped off into the water as the ship rolled over on her way down\\".Capsizing of USS Hull in typhoon off Luzon : Narrative by Lt. Commdr. Jame A. Marks, 18 December 1944, from the USS Hull (DD-350) & association A later finding was that additional sea water ballast could possibly have helped the ship recover from the 70-degree roll.\\"Typhoon Cobra\\" by Carl M. Berntsen, SoM1/C, Sailors Association website, December 2007 Reportedly, some time before Hull became locked \\"in irons,\\" some officers had debated whether to remove captain Marks from his command in order to turn the ship to a safer course, but the executive officer, Greil Gerstley, refused to do so on the grounds that there had never been a mutiny on a US Navy ship. This incident provided novelist Herman Wouk with the inspiration for the climax of his novel The Caine Mutiny, in which a captain is actually relieved of his duties by his officers in the course of Typhoon Cobra. Rescue work by and other ships of the fleet in the days that followed saved the lives of 7 officers, including the captain of the ship, and 55 enlisted sailors.Typhoon Cobra, USS Hull (DD-350) & association 11 officers of the Hull, including the executive officer, and 191 enlisted sailors perished in the sea. In all, 790 men of the Fleet lost their lives in the typhoon. The subsequent Court of Inquiry found that though Halsey had committed an \\"error of judgement\\" in sailing the Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon, it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction.Melton Jr., Buckner F. Sea Cobra, Admiral Halsey's Task Force and the Great Pacific Typhoon; Lyons Press; 2007; Admiral Nimitz, Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, presented a six-page document to the Court, stating in his conclusion, among other recommendations directed strictly to ships' commanders, that \\"steps must be taken to insure that commanding officers of all vessels, particularly destroyers and smaller craft, are fully aware of the stability characteristics of their ships; that adequate security measures regarding water-tight integrity are enforced; and that the effect upon stability of free liquid surfaces is thoroughly understood\\". The executive officer was the father of rock journalist Greil Marcus.Greil Marcus: a life in writing by Simon Reynolds, The Guardian, 18 February 2012 Years later, Marcus wrote that in December 2006 the survivors of the Hull held in Las Vegas what they determined would be their last reunion, and one of Marcus' daughters went. The people in the reunion related to his daughter, Marcus claimed, that when the original captain of Hull was told by one of the survivors that if he had still been the captain the ship would never have gone down, he shot himself. A few weeks after the events at sea, in January 1945, Halsey passed command of the Third Fleet to Admiral Spruance (whereupon its designation changed to Fifth Fleet). Halsey took over command of the Fleet again in May 1945. In June 1945, Halsey sailed the ships into the path of a typhoon, designated Connie, resulting in six lives lost, and 75 airplanes destroyed, with 70 more planes badly damaged. While ships sustained crippling damages, none were lost on this occasion. A Court of Inquiry was convened and, after lengthy deliberations, recommended that Halsey be \\"reassigned,\\" but Admiral Nimitz rejected the Court's recommendation on account of Halsey's \\"prior service\\" to the Navy. Halsey remained in command for approximately eight more weeks, until the cessation of hostilities on 14 August 1945. He was promoted to Fleet Admiral on 11 December 1945, and retired in March 1947.

Investigators in this field have differing specialties and backgrounds. Some insurance companies have their own in-house investigation teams while other companies sub-contract the work to private investigators or private investigation firms. Although such investigations are usually conducted to combat fraud, very often investigators will be working simply to establish the circumstances of a particular claim (for example, in a multi- vehicular road accident involving various parties, claims and insurance companies). Insurance fraud Methods of defrauding insurance companies are manifold, as are the means of investigating them. As a crime, however, evidence shows that insurance fraud in wealthy nations is increasing, with many governments running public awareness campaigns to deter potential fraudsters and appeal to the public to report any suspicious claims. One of the most common forms of insurance fraud is the exaggeration of injuries. Because many injuries can be exceptionally difficult to quantify (for example, psychological injuries or physical injuries such as whiplash), investigators will often seek to establish that what the claimant claims is true (for example, if a claimant states he or she cannot work) and that there are no obvious discrepancies in the symptoms claimed (very often examined in conjunction with medical staff). Surveillance is often employed in such circumstances to verify the claim. Another form of lesser known fraud is that of claiming on an insurance policy for injuries sustained before the policy came into effect. For example, in a road accident, a person may claim to have sustained a debilitating back injury. On investigation, however, it transpires that the injury had been sustained in an incident some months or even years before. Very often insurance companies and investigators will study medical reports and history to eliminate this possibility, as well as searching for evidence of previous claims or accidents. There are also many forms of fraud involving property, for example when a person with valuable assets (property, for example) deliberately destroys them, often through arson, with the intention of then claiming the value back through insurance. Another form would be an art collector insurance a high value piece and then having it 'stolen' - claiming the money for himself and keeping the art piece in the process.

Portrayed by Alan Halsall, the character first appeared on screen during the episode airing on 30 November 1998 and is still a cast member nearly 22 years later. Tyrone's storylines have been focused on his relationships with Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie) and Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) as well as his doomed marriage to Molly Compton (Vicky Binns) and suffering domestic violence at the hands of his fiancée Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede). In 2018, following the death of his adoptive mother Jackie (Margi Clarke), Tyrone discovers that Jackie was not his biological mother and while searching for his birth parents, meets his maternal grandmother, Evelyn Plummer (Maureen Lipman).  Storylines  Upon his arrival, it becomes clear that Tyrone has been in minor trouble with the law. He is employed by Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) collecting trolleys at a supermarket but loses his job when he accidentally pushes a trolley into the area manager's new car. Following this, Tyrone trains as an apprentice mechanic at the local garage, Webster's Auto Centre, owned by Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell). After his mother abandons him, Tyrone moves into Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth's (Liz Dawn) bed and breakfast establishment and adopts a greyhound, Monica. While seeking a partner for Monica, Tyrone meets and begins dating Maria Sutherland (Samia Smith), a kennel maid and they get engaged in 2002. Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine), however, tries to come between them. She succeeds and has a brief relationship with Tyrone but he ends it and realises he is better suited to Molly Compton (Vicky Binns). They live with Jack and Vera at number 9 and plan to buy somewhere of their own but they buy Jack and Vera out when they decide to move to Blackpool. Vera, however, dies in January 2008. Jack stays with Tyrone and Molly at Number 9 and the family atmosphere is soon enhanced with the arrival of Molly's aunt, Pam Hobsworth (Kate Anthony). Jack, attempting to encourage Tyrone to propose to Molly, gives him Vera's engagement ring. Tyrone books a table at a fancy restaurant, but is upstaged by a much flashier proposal before he can. Several days later, Pam suggests that Tyrone put a ring in a decorative egg with a voice recorder. When Tyrone opens the egg at The Rovers, Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment) is heard instead, asking how it works. Tyrone runs out, embarrassed. Jack and Kirk follow and Jack tells him that the moments that do not go as planned are often happier than the moments that do. Tyrone tries again and returns to find a burger van decorated in Christmas lights, with a table in front. When Tyrone opens the egg to propose, Molly opens an egg herself, with a recording of her saying, \\"Of course, you great nana.\\" The following month, Tyrone and Molly visit his mother and discover that she is £1,000 in debt and owes his father's friend money. Tyrone and Molly decide to help, despite their plans to use it for Molly's wedding dress. On discovering that Jackie has scammed them, Tyrone tells Jackie that she is not welcome at the wedding. Jack introduces Tyrone to his new friend, Connie. Tyrone, angry that Jack would consider replacing Vera, is hostile and decides that she is a gold-digger who only wants Jack's money. Connie proves him wrong on this by inviting them to her house, proving by the size and facilities that Connie needs companionship, not more money. Needing space from Tyrone, Kevin and Molly start to go running together and decide to train for a fun run. Kevin develops feelings for Molly and feeling flattered, they begin an affair. At one point, Tyrone gets worried about how Molly has changed but Kevin insists that she would never cheat on him. Trying to cover her tracks, Molly accuses Tyrone of cheating on her with Minnie Chandra (Poppy Jhakra). In January 2010, after just a year of marriage, Molly leaves Tyrone and moves into the flat over the corner shop, leaving him confused and inconsolable. Thinking Molly is having an affair with Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin), he attacks him. However, in March, Molly faints at work and learns that she is four months pregnant. Convinced that Molly has not slept with Dev, Tyrone assumes that he is the father and persuades Molly to come home. Feeling lonely and rejected by Kevin, Molly agrees and in April they learn that they are expecting a boy. Kevin and Sally support Molly when she gives birth to her baby in September and names him Jack. Tyrone, Molly, and Jack settle into family life, unaware that Tyrone may not be Jack's father. Tyrone's joy at his new life is dashed when a month later, Jack reveals that he has an incurable form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and has only weeks to live. Tyrone is devastated and gives a moving eulogy at Jack's funeral and later scatters his ashes. On 6 December 2010, Molly admits to Tyrone that she had an affair and he is not Jack's father. Tyrone is shocked and turns to Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) for help. He is concerned when Molly and Jack are trapped in the Corner Shop after a tram crashes into it. Jack is rescued first and Tyrone goes with him to the hospital but Kevin stays with him and sends Tyrone to check on Molly and is devastated by news of Molly's death. Back at the hospital with Jack, Tyrone tells Kevin that he will kill whoever destroyed his family. At Molly's funeral, Tyrone breaks down during the eulogy and Sophie prompts Kevin to take over but Sally walks out, angered by his hypocrisy, puzzling Tyrone. After overhearing them argue, he realises that Kevin is Jack's father and attacks him at the graveside, knocking him into Molly's grave. When Tyrone gets home, Sally returns baby Jack, persuading him that he is the only father Jack knows and that he should raise him regardless. Eventually, he agrees and takes Jack but realizes that his feelings for Jack have changed. All he sees is a reminder of Molly and Kevin's betrayal and gives him to Kevin. On Christmas Eve, he decides to make a fresh start by \\"getting drunk and going sober\\". Kevin tries to persuade him to keep Jack but Tyrone refuses, insisting he does not want anything to do with him or Jack. Tyrone spends Christmas Day with Maria, Kirk and Liam and sees the New Year in with Sally, both feeling 2011 has to be better than 2010. Despite his hatred of Kevin, Tyrone is unwilling to walk away from the garage and continues to work there. However, 2011 is worse, not better: in early January, Kevin attacks Tyrone after learning that he and Sally spent two nights together and assumes that something happened between them. Then, in February, Tyrone dates Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) briefly but they break up as they agree that they are not right together. In March, Tyrone is incensed when Kevin wins £200,000 on a scratchcard, feeling he has no right to it and tells Sally just before she signs the divorce papers. In return, she buys him a drink in gratitude. His year improves when Jack's grandson, Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain), comes looking for Jack; Tyrone tells him that Jack died a few months ago and they become friends and Tommy moves in. However, his life goes downhill in mid-May: on the 19th, Kevin orders a new hydraulic car ramp for the garage but would not let Tyrone use it. The next day, when Tyrone sees Kevin sack Tommy and head off on a call- out, he loses it and attacks the ramp with a 32-inch spanner before going to the Rovers. However, the ramp, due to the damage Tyrone has done, collapses on Kev and crushes him but Tyrone and Tommy pull him out, just as the ambulance arrives. Tyrone, in shock, gets drunk as he realises that he nearly killed Kevin but Kevin blames Tommy, assuming that it was because Kevin sacked him, so Tyrone confesses. Kevin is angry but understands why Tyrone did it and they call a truce. Tyrone agrees but continues to wind Kevin up at every opportunity. In September 2011, Tyrone and Tommy go to a bar in town and Tommy pays an attractive girl to flirt with Tyrone to boost his self-esteem. The young woman, Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede), enjoys Tyrone's company and they swap numbers. Tyrone is euphoric but Tommy feels guilty, fearing that Kirsty only did it because he paid her. Tommy tells him the truth after she phones and they arrange a date. Kirsty feels that they could build a relationship and soon, they fall in love. However, the first time Kirsty suggests spending the night together, Tyrone panics and Kirsty reassures him that they can wait until he is ready. Tyrone is grateful and buys her a new mobile phone to say thank you. Although he has feelings for Kirsty, he is stunned to learn that she is a policewoman. Tyrone is proud and nervous, worrying about everything he says to her. However, Kirsty soon shows her dark streak when she warns him to stay away from Fiz, as she has just been released from prison. Kirsty insists that her job would be jeopardized by having a criminal as a friend so Tyrone agrees to keep his distance from Fiz but is shocked. However, the situation worsens when she and Tyrone's friend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) argue repeatedly and Tyrone hears Kirsty threaten her. Forced to choose, Tyrone picks Tina. Later, Kirsty visits Tyrone but Tina insists that he is out so Kirsty waits for him in her police car. Convinced that Tyrone and Tina's relationship is closer than they are admitting, she follows them when Tina takes Tyrone out for a curry. Furious at Kirsty's behaviour, Tina drives to the police station, intending to make a complaint however Kirsty crashes into Tina's car so all three are taken to hospital. They are stunned to learn that Kirsty is pregnant so she and Tyrone reconcile, despite his anger at Kirsty's lies. Tina makes a complaint regardless but Tyrone persuades her to drop it, due to Kirsty's pregnancy, and she reluctantly agrees. Kirsty later helps Tommy and Tyrone expose a crooked local councillor but loses her job as she is caught breaking the law. Tyrone gets her a job at the factory but Kirsty is not pleased and hits him so Tyrone leaves. He later tells her that his mother used to hit him. Tommy persuades Tyrone to lend him £9,000 to get his father, Terry, out of a loan shark's clutches but Terry leaves with the money, claiming that it is rightfully his as Tyrone inherited it from Jack. He leaves Tommy to deal with the loan shark, who insists Tommy use the garage to put drugs into cars, to repay Terry's debt. Tommy also agrees on a repayment plan with Tyrone. Tyrone and Kirsty's relationship is rocky due to her inability to control her temper and fists. She hits Tyrone repeatedly and blames her pregnancy hormones when Tyrone demands an explanation. He insists she see the doctor to get counselling for her problems but she walks out of the surgery at the last minute, scared that the doctor will tell her that she's a risk to the baby. This prompts Deirdre to check on her and finds Kirsty with a cut forehead after a row with Tyrone when she slipped in the yard after Tyrone pushed her away. Deirdre misunderstands and thinks that Tyrone is hitting Kirsty so she leaves him. Tommy, however, seeing how upset Tyrone is, tracks Kirsty down and asks her to return. She does, just as Tyrone is chatting to another woman, and assumes he has moved on but he insists it was strictly platonic and she believes him. When Tina learns what Tommy has done, she is horrified and tells him that Kirsty was abusing Tyrone. Disgusted, he soon intervenes when Kirsty accuses Tina of having designs on Tyrone, and tells her, Tina and Tyrone that he knows what she's been doing, infuriating Tyrone as he had told Tina in confidence. Kirsty, angry and upset, threatens to leave again unless Tyrone chooses her over his friends, which he does and she stays. When Tina and Tommy tried to talk to him again, Tyrone fires Tommy from the garage, telling him he only wants to see him when he's giving him the cash he owes. Tommy tells everyone in the pub about it but this backfires when Tyrone tells people about him selling drugs in the garage. They soon reconcile after Tommy breaks his ankle in a road accident, insisting that there is no rush to repay the money he owes. However, the peace is short-lived when he finds out that Tina had pushed Kirsty, sending her into labour. They have a daughter and name her Ruby. Tommy and Tina tried to make amends but to no avail. Unfortunately, Kirsty's violent outbursts continue after Ruby is born, making it clear to Tyrone that pregnancy hormones were not the problem, after all. When he sees Kirsty has smashed up the kitchen and knocked Ruby's pram over, he panics that she has attacked Ruby and rushes her to the doctor. Luckily, Ruby is fine but Fiz finds Tyrone and convinces him to have a cup of tea with her. He tells Fiz about the abuse and she convinces him to talk to her counsellor but soon learns that Kirsty has not seen her counselor for some time. He confronts Kirsty and tells her that he has given up on her. Later, he sees Alison, Kirsty's mother, at the bus stop. She tells him that she has left her husband, Ed, and Tyrone asks her to stay with them, seeing it as a solution to their problem. Kirsty was against it, knowing that her father would come looking for Alison and he did. Ed soon arrived and snatches Ruby, refusing to give her back until Alison goes home with him, which she does. Following another violent outburst, Tyrone tells Kirsty to leave and he is keeping Ruby but she tells him that if she goes, Ruby goes with her as Tyrone has no right to keep her. He is devastated to learn that she registered Ruby's birth alone, leaving his name off the birth certificate, so he has no parental rights. Having no other choice, Tyrone allows Kirsty to stay and they agree that she will go back to work and he will be a stay-at-home father. Worried about Tyrone being isolated, Fiz persuades Katy to take Tyrone and Ruby to a playgroup where he befriends a woman named Angela. When Kirsty finds a text from Angela, inviting him to her daughter's birthday party, she is jealous and asks Tyrone not to go. Fiz finds out and confronts Kirsty who tampers with Fiz's sewing machine, causing a nasty injury to Fiz's fingers, to teach her a lesson. Kirsty tells Fiz that she tampered with the machine, but when Fiz tells people, no one believes her so Fiz reports Kirsty to the police and they question her at work. Furious, Kirsty attacks her again, unaware that Tyrone is in Fiz's kitchen. Feeling she cannot trust Tyrone because Fiz has been texting him, she takes his keys and phone with her to work the next day. When Tyrone complains, Kirsty attacks him again but this time shows no remorse and demands Tyrone apologize, which he eventually does. Distraught, Tyrone plans to snatch Ruby and run but Fiz and Tommy persuade him that he should marry Kirsty so he will have parental rights. Needing comfort, Fiz and Tyrone begin an affair, despite his plans to marry Kirsty. Tina is horrified when she finds out and tells Tyrone to take Kirsty to court, rather than marry her, but he insists he knows what he's doing and goes ahead regardless. Unfortunately, this plan costs Fiz her job at Underworld but Tyrone makes amends by getting her a job at the café so things settle down again but Kirsty demands Tyrone have no further contact with Fiz. This sparks another beating when she finds Fiz has given him a birthday card and, feeling guilty, Kirsty wants to call off the wedding, but Tyrone refuses. On the day of Kirsty and Tyrone's stag- do/hen party, Kirsty finds Tyrone's secret phone with messages that detail Tyrone's plan for parental responsibility. In revenge, she invites Fiz to the wedding and promptly reveals their affair to the congregation before refusing to marry Tyrone. She takes Ruby and leaves, eventually going home to confront Tyrone. He admits everything and tells her why before asking her to let him take Ruby and move out but she refuses. She goes to hit Tyrone again but overbalances at the top of the stairs and when found by the neighbours, she accuses Tyrone of domestic abuse. Tyrone is arrested and Ruby goes into temporary care while Kirsty is in hospital. Fiz and Tina stand by Tyrone and convince him to fight for Ruby when he is released on bail, but Kirsty threatens to refuse him all access if he does not return to her. In desperation, he kidnaps Ruby with Fiz and Hope and they go to Wales, planning to sail to Ireland but Fiz calls the police. Tyrone is arrested for child abduction and charged with the assault on Kirsty. On 29 March 2013, during Tyrone's trial, Kirsty walks into court with Ruby and admits that she is the abuser, not Tyrone. After this revelation, Tyrone is freed and Kirsty is sent to prison. Kirsty nominates Tyrone to look after Ruby in her absence and Social Services arrange for him to have formal custody. She phones and asks him to visit her in prison, which he does, and he tells her not to contact them ever again after wishing her luck in dealing with her problems. When Tyrone gets out of prison he struggles to forgive people for thinking he was a wife beater. However, Fiz eventually talks him round and he accepts the apologies of his friends. Shortly afterwards, Fiz moves in with Tyrone with her daughter Hope. The couple is devastated when they learn that Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) is dying from pancreatic cancer, and help her and her husband Roy (David Neilson) through the terrible situation. Fiz and Tyrone are later distraught when Hayley passes away. In August 2014, Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) is doing a loft conversion for Tyrone, and Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) is putting more boards in the floor of the loft. Jason and Todd leave for the Rovers and warn Tyrone not to go up there. However, Tyrone goes up to video about what he is going to do in the loft. He stands on the ladder, falls and crashes through the floor. He has a bloody nose and forehead, two broken ribs and a broken wrist. Todd had put up unsteady boards. Gary Windass (Mikey North) finds out what Todd did and tells Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard) who is furious with Todd. In October 2015, it is revealed Hope is suffering from a type of childhood cancer called neuroblastoma, plunging Fiz and Tyrone into panic. Hope was eventually cured, but Fiz and Tyrone's insistence to provide a perfect Christmas to her in case it turned out to be her last. This later gave them financial issues. In August 2019, Hope is referred to a specialist school due to her disruptive behaviour and is home taught by care worker Jade Rowan (Lottie Henshall), who moves in with Fiz and Tyrone, and is later revealed to be the daughter of John Stape. Jade feels that Fiz caused his downfall and death, and fearing that Hope is also at stake, enlists the help of social services in order to have Hope taken away from Fiz and Tyrone by pretending that Hope has been physically abused at home. Casting Alan Halsall (pictured) plays Tyrone During an interview with Alan Halsall, the actor revealed that he likes characters that develop in different ways. Halsall stated he enjoys the experience of the character's various relationships, especially as it differs with each one, notably his character's partnership with Molly's auntie Pam. The actor confirmed that he was pleased to see Tyrone involved in more storylines, feeling that his character was underused for a long period of time. He also claimed interest in the aspect of a wedding. Alan Halsall contradicted statements that Tyrone and Molly were the new Jack and Vera, claiming it impossible for him to fill. The actor revealed that he would be pleased to see Margi Clarke as Tyrone's on-screen mother full-time on the show. Development In June 2011, it was announced that a new \\"love interest\\" for Tyrone would be introduced; Natalie Gumede was cast as Kirsty Soames, making her first appearance later that year. Executive producer Phil Collinson said: \\"A big storyline across the summer and into the autumn is Tyrone meeting somebody who's hopefully going to help him move on from Molly and everything that happened. A brand new character is going to come in - she's called Kirsty. I have to say, it's not all going to be a smooth ride for Tyrone - he's got a lot of baggage and he's got a lot that he's got to get over. It's a big story for him over the summer.\\" In March 2012, it was announced that an upcoming storyline would see Tyrone become a victim of domestic abuse from Kirsty. A Coronation Street source said: \\"Kirsty will be seen attacking Tyrone and the fallout will be how she feels terrible about it and attempts to show some remorse.\\". ManKind, the UK's leading charity for supporting male victims of abuse, praised the storyline for tackling the issue. Reception For his portrayal of Tyrone, Halsall was nominated in the category of \\"Most Popular Newcomer\\" at the 1999 National Television Awards. On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Halsall was nominated for \\"Best Male Soap Actor\\" and came second with 18.2% of the vote. Tyrone's domestic abuse storyline with Kirsty won Best Storyline with 28.3% of votes. In 2013, Halsall won the award for \\"Best Dramatic Male Performance\\" for his portrayal of Tyrone.

Biography Born in Gainesville, Florida, she was raised in the western Detroit suburb of Inkster by foster parents. By the time of her high school years at Inkster High School on Middlebelt Road, Gladys had taken a strong interest in singing, joining the high school glee club. In 1960 Horton formed a group with her former highschool glee club members Georgeanna Tillman, Katherine Anderson and Juanita Cowart. She also invited Georgia Dobbins to join her new group. =Early years= Formerly calling themselves The Casinyets (can't sing yet), the group eventually auditioned for Motown after a talent contest, and while the audition was successful, the group was requested to return to Hitsville with an original song. After member Georgia Dobbins co-created the song \\"Please Mr. Postman\\", Dobbins suddenly left the group after her father forbade her to be in nightclubs. Dobbins, who was also the group's original lead singer, gave Horton the spotlight to be the lead vocalist, a spot Horton was not comfortable with in the beginning. The group changed their name to the Marvelettes shortly after Motown signed the act and released \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" in the summer of 1961 when Horton was reportedly just fifteen years old. =Popular Success= The single eventually hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 – becoming Motown's first No. 1 Pop hit – and turning the group into instant Motown stars. Horton would later sing lead on Marvelettes' classics such as \\"Playboy\\", \\"Beechwood 4-5789\\" and \\"Too Many Fish in the Sea\\". Horton's position as lead vocalist ended in 1965 with Wanda Young, who had replaced Dobbins, taking over from then on as lead vocalist. Horton left the group in 1967 and was replaced by Cleveland, Ohio vocalist Anne Bogan. In the late 1980s, Horton and Wanda Young Rogers reunited to collaborate on the 1990 Marvelettes album for Ian Levine's Motor City Records label titled The Marvelettes...Now! though Young didn't take part in the group's performances. The Marvelettes released the single \\"Holding On With Both Hands\\" in 1990, which was sung on record by Wanda but performed by Gladys in public due to Wanda's severe personal problems. =Later years and death= Gladys and former Marvelette Katherine Anderson were involved with Marc Taylor's official biography of the group. She remained semi-retired from the business to take care of her disabled son. However, she still performed on occasion as \\"Gladys Horton of the Marvelettes\\". She had resided in Southern California since the 1970s. Gladys Horton died on January 26, 2011, in a nursing home in Sherman Oaks, California, following several strokes and years of declining health. The Marvelettes were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013 and again in 2015.

The series was created by Ian Kennedy Martin, who had previously devised The Sweeney and Juliet Bravo. Plot The series starred British Chinese actor David Yip as Detective Sergeant John Ho, the first Chinese lead actor in a British television drama series. The series offered traditional police procedural storylines in a setting of occasional prejudice and distrust within the police force, and the prejudice displayed by those Ho encounters whilst doing his job. Like many other television detectives of the time, Ho was something of a maverick, often using unorthodox methods to solve crimes. The series was set in and around London's docklands, before redevelopment began in the 1980s. His immediate superior in the force, Detective Chief Inspector Berwick (Derek Martin), often provided him a source of stress, often reprimanding him for his approach towards the cases he was investigating. Ho is also often seen visiting his father, Joe (Robert Lee), for advice at the shipping container plant where he worked. Like many other television detectives of the era, Ho drove a 'classic' car. In this case, Ho's vehicle of choice was a Morris Minor Traveller.

He spent the vast majority of his professional career in France and Spain, most notably with Deportivo de La Coruña, appearing in more than 200 official games over the course of six seasons and winning the 1999–2000 La Liga. Songo'o represented the Cameroon national team in four World Cups, being first-choice in 1998. Club career Songo'o was born in Sackbayeme, in the Yaoundé suburbs. After first establishing himself as a professional in France, with Ligue 1 club FC Metz, he was voted Best African Goalkeeper in 1996, then arguably lived his most successful period at Spain's Deportivo de La Coruña. With the Galicians, Songo'o won the 1996–97 edition of the Ricardo Zamora Trophy (awarded to the best goalkeeper of the season), and was his side's undisputed starter in his first four years, which ended with a first-ever title in La Liga. When Depor bought José Francisco Molina in 2000, he soon lost his place and was eventually transferred to old team Metz; on 13 February of that year, from a corner kick, he was supposed to have scored his first career goal, but it was wrongfully disallowed in a 0–1 away loss against CD Numancia. After two seasons, Songo'o returned to Deportivo and A Coruña, again in a free transfer. He settled there after having retired from football, aged 40. International career Songo'o featured for Cameroon in every FIFA World Cup from 1990 to 2002, although only as first-choice in 1998. He was also a member of the squad that competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. After retiring in 2004, Songo'o was hired as the national team's goalkeeper coach. He left the position in 2006, returning four years later as a replacement for Thomas N'Kono. In the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Songo'o was part of Paul Le Guen's coaching staff. After the tournament, which ended in the group stage, he led Cameroon to a 3–0 victory over Poland on an interim basis, the nation's first win in ten competitive games. Songo'o returned for a third spell in the same capacity in September 2019, now under newly hired manager Toni Conceição. Personal life Songo'o also held French citizenship. Both of his sons, Franck and Yann, were also professional footballers.

Career Pearson is the eldest of five siblings, and he studied both dance and fashion at college prior to embarking on a career in music. In 1983, Pearson (then aged 19) joined his teenaged brother and sisters in Five Star, which was created and managed by their father, former musician Buster Pearson. In addition to performing backing vocals, Stedman's interest in dance and fashion would play an integral role in the group and he began designing some of the outfits that would ultimately become the group's trademark matching stage costumes. The glittering costumes coupled with their synchronised dance routines often led to comparisons with The Jackson Five. The group achieved huge commercial success in the mid 1980s, with their second album Silk & Steel reaching no.1 and selling in excess of 1.2 million copies in the UK alone.British Phonographic Industry - Certifications Database By the end of the decade, they had achieved fifteen UK Top 40 hit singles and four Top 20 albumsChart Stats - Five Star (three of them reaching Platinum status). Pearson would join his four siblings on stage at the 1987 Brit Awards where they won the category for \\"Best Group\\". However, their popularity declined and did not continue into the 1990s, even though the group continued to record. In 1989, amid reports of bankruptcy, Pearson and his family were forced to move out of their opulent Berkshire mansion which they had bought in 1987. They moved first to Hatfield and then over to the United States in an attempt to revive their career. However, further commercial success eluded them throughout the 1990s, and by 2001 the group had downsized to a trio, with Stedman, Denise, and Lorraine Pearson being the only remaining members. This version of the group performed on the Here and Now Tour in 2002 along with various other pop acts of the 1980s. Pearson would continue to appear with sister Denise and three backing dancers billed as Five Star up until 2008, making appearances at Butlins Holiday Camps in the UK. Though not primarily a songwriter within the group, Pearson gained a writing credit for the B-side tracks \\"Pure Energy\\" (1986) and \\"Stone Court\\" (1987), an instrumental track named after the Berkshire mansion the family had moved into. He also co-wrote the track \\"Feelings\\" with sister Doris for the group's 1990 self-titled album. After Five Star After his years of success with Five Star, Pearson diversified with other business interests. For a time, he ran a limousine hire service and also taught dance at a school in London. In September 2006, Pearson utilised his dance skills and appeared as a contestant on the UK Channel 5 programme The All Star Talent Show in which he finished in third place. In 2007, Pearson announced that he was recording his first solo album, although this yet remains to be released. In 2008, Pearson was one of the contestants on the BBC reality show Celebrity Scissorhands, in which celebrities become hairdressers in aid of Children In Need. In September 2009, after already teaching dance at a school in London, Pearson began working at the Derngate Gym in Northampton, holding a weekly 'jazz dance' class at the facility. In October 1990, Stedman Pearson appeared in court and pleaded guilty to a charge of public indecency after being arrested in a public toilet in New Malden in London.\\"We Are Family\\" (Documentary interview with 5 Star).

In 1903 to 1904 he studied art in the studios of Konstantin Yuon and Ilya Mashkov, in 1905 to 1909 he studied at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture with Konstantin Korovin and Valentin Serov. In 1910, Falk was of the founders and the most active participants of artistic group Jack of Diamonds. The group considered Paul Cézanne the only painter worth following, and the rest of visual art to be too trivial and bourgeois. The distinctive feature of Falk's paintings of the time was sculpturing of the form using many layers of different paints. Robert Falk,Still life: Bottles and a Jug. 1912 In 1918-1928, Falk taught at VKhUTEMAS (State Higher Artistic and Technical Workshops). In 1928 Falk went on a supposedly short trip to France and refused to return; he worked in Paris until 1938, when he returned to Moscow. After 1938, until his death in 1958 he worked in Moscow, most of the time in isolation. His works of that time were in neo-impressionist style with characteristic white-on-white colors (not unlike the later paintings of his teacher Valentin Serov). During the Khrushchev Thaw Falk became popular among young painters and many considered him to be the main bridge between the traditions of the Russian and French Moderne of the beginning of 20th century and Russian avant-garde and the Russian avant-garde of the 1960s. There are numerous paintings by Falk in the New Tretyakov Art Museum in Moscow.

Biography Brazzi was born in Bologna, Italy, the son of Maria Ghedini and Adelmo Brazzi, an employee of the Rizzoli shoe factory. He was named after Rossano Veneto, where his father was stationed during his military service in World War I. Brazzi attended San Marco University in Florence, Italy, where he was raised from the age of four. He made his film debut in 1939. He was propelled to international fame with his role in the English-language film Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), followed by the leading male role in David Lean's Summertime (1955), opposite Katharine Hepburn. In 1958, he played the lead as Frenchman Emile De Becque in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific. His other notable English-language films include The Barefoot Contessa (1954), The Story of Esther Costello (1957), opposite Joan Crawford, Count Your Blessings (1959),The Light in the Piazza (1962), and The Italian Job (1969). Personal life =Marriages and relationships= In 1940, Brazzi married baroness Lidia Bertolini (1921–1981) to whom he was married until her death from liver cancer in 1981. The couple had no children. However, he did father a son, George Llewellyn Brady (born 24 July 1955), from a relationship with 20-year-old Llewella Humphreys (1934–1992), the daughter of American mobster Murray Humphreys. Llewella Humphreys later changed her name to Luella Brady, an anglicization of Brazzi. In 1984, Rossano Brazzi married Ilse Fischer,Rossano Brazzi Biography a German national, who had been the couple's housekeeper for many years. Originally from Düsseldorf, Fischer had met Brazzi as an infatuated fan in Rome at the age of twenty-four.Rossano Brazzi: Portrait of a \\"Gentleman of the Cinema\\" This marriage was also childless. Eccentricities Brazzi was known in film production circles for a number of strange traits, including his preference for ordering off-menu and his love of karaoke. He was often referred to among contemporaries by his nickname Merlion. Death Brazzi died in Rome on Christmas Eve 1994, aged 78, from a neural virus.

Description With age, the face of females turns slightly pink. This is especially prominent in the subspecies sinica. Distribution M. s. sinica is found from the Vavuniya, Mannar] to the lowlands of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Puttalam, and Kurunegala; and along the arid zone of the Monaragala and Hambantota districts. M. s. aurifrons can be found sympatrically with subsp. sinica within intermediate regions of the country in Kegalle and parts of Kurunegala. They are also found in south-western parts of the island in the Galle and Matara districts near Kalu Ganga. M. s. opisthomelas has recently been identified as a separate subspecies. It can be found in the entire south- western region of central hill bordering Ratnapura) and in the Nuwara Eliya districts. They can be seen around the Hakgala Botanical Garden and other cold climatic montane forest patches. They also can be observed in Trincomalee near Koneswaram Temple. Taxonomy The three recognized subspecies of toque macaques are: * Dryzone toque macaque or Common toque macaque = Macaca sinica sinica * Wetzone toque macaque or Pale-fronted toque macaque = Macaca sinica aurifrons * Highland toque macaque or Hill-zone toque macaque = Macaca sinica opisthomelas M. s. opisthomelas is similar to subsp. aurifrons, but has a long fur and contrasting golden color in the anterior part of its brown cap. The three subspecies can be identified through the orientation of their different hair patterns. Social structure Monkey is cleaning the other Monkeys The social status is highly structured in toque macaques, where there are dominance hierarchies among both males and females. A troop may consist of as few as 8 to as many as 40. When the troop becomes too large, social tension and aggression towards each other arise, causing some individuals to flee from the troop. This is noticeable in adults and sub adults, where a troop may consist largely of females. Newly appointed alpha males also show aggressiveness towards females, causing the females to flee. There are sightings of severe fights between individuals of the same troop and some get heavy wounds to cheeks, eyes, and sometimes broken arms. Young offspring of a troop's alpha female will typically receive better sustenance and shelter than their peers.https://www.pbs.org/show/animal-babies-first-year-earth/#photo- gallery Reproduction Mother Toque macaque (Macaca sinica) with her baby in Katagamuwa sanctuary - Sri Lanka When in estrous, the female's perineum becomes reddish in color and swells. This change is a signal to the males that she is ready to mate. There is an average of 18 month between births. After a 5–6 month gestation period, female macaque give birth to a single offspring. Offspring hold on to their mothers for about 2 months. During this time they learn survival techniques and social skills critical for survival. The infants are born into their social classes based on their mothers position in the troop. Young males are forced to abandon their troop when they are about 6–8 years of age. This prevents in-breeding and ensures that the current alpha male maintains his position in the troop. Leaving the troop is the only way a male can change his social standing. If he has good social skills and is strong he may become an alpha male. A single alpha male can father all of the troops' offspring. Birth rarely occurs during the day or on the ground. During labor the female isolates herself from the group (about 100 m). The mother stands bipedally during parturition and assists the delivery with her hands. The infant is usually born 2 minutes after crowning. The infant can vocalize almost immediately after birth; it is important for the mother and infant to recognize each other's voices. Vocalization will be used to alert the mother of imminent danger, and can assist in finding each other if separated. After birth the mother licks the infant and orients it toward her breasts. She will resume foraging behavior within 20 minutes after parturition. The mother also eats part of the placenta, because it contains needed protein. The alpha female of the group asserts her power by taking part of the placenta for herself to eat. Diet Macaca sinica opisthomelas They are fond of eating drooping yellow clusters of flowers of Cassia fistula. They eat any good thing making use of human detritus by going after plantains, pineapples, rice grains, papaws, and mangoes. Even there are plenty of foods present in natural habitation, toque macaques enjoy to take any food with little effort around human dwellings. They are occasionally seen around houses near a forest patch, where they invade all the fruiting plants in the day sessions and return to the forest cover in night. Because, these macaques have very little fear for humans and their companions-the dogs. Cheek pouches enable toque macaques to store enough food while eating fast. In the dry zone, they are known to eat drupes of understory shrub Zizyphus, ripe fruits of Ficus, and Cordia species. They occasionally eat many small animals ranging from small insects to mammals like indian palm squirrels and Vandeleuria oleracea. Predators Wild cats (leopards and fishing cats) and Indian rock python are the main predators of this species. Life expectancy The lifespan of toque macaques in the wild is about the same as in captivity, up to 35 years. The expected lifespan in the wild is low due to high infant mortality rates. There is also significant mortality among adolescent males when they venture off to join a different troop. Once toque macaques have reached sexual maturity they will likely live to an old age. (Fooden, 1979; Michael and Crook, 1973). Conservation Macaca sinica in the Bundala National Park, Sri Lanka As of 2008, IUCN listed toque macaque as endangered in their list due to habitat destruction and hunting, and also for taming for pets. With few patches of forests for survival, they engage to survive close to human habitation, giving a serious trouble for both the parties. Due to devastated eating of crop plants, humans always take precautions to avoid their entrance to the cultivation fields. This results killing by shot, trappings, and poisoning. Both subsp. aurifrons and sinica are kept as pets by various indigenous people for economic purposes. They were heavily used by both Sri Lanka Army and LTTE for their shooting practices in the recent past, but now prohibited. Antibody prevalence In an experiment, serum samples taken from toque macaque individuals at Polonnaruwa were examined for antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii by the modified agglutination test. There was no evidence of maternal transmission of antibodies or congenital toxoplasmosis. None of the infected macaques died within 1 year after sampling. Toxoplasma gondii infection was closely linked to human environments where domestic cats were common. Although infection with T. gondii has been noted in several species of Asian primates, this is the first report of T. gondii antibodies in toque macaques. As dengue reservoir It's unclear if nonhuman primates also serve as a reservoir of human dengue viruses under certain conditions. According to a study by some biologists, a cross-sectional serologic survey was carried out to characterize the pattern of transmission of a recently identified dengue virus among toque macaques in Sri Lanka. The results indicated that an epizootic dengue virus was active among the macaques. A single epizootic had taken place between October 1986 and February 1987 during which 94% of the macaques within the 3 km2 study site were exposed to the virus. The epizootic was highly focal in nature because macaques living 5 km from the study population were not exposed to the virus. The transmission of dengue viruses among macaques in the wild may have important public health implications.http://www.ajtmh.org/content/60/2/300.full.pdf  References   External links  * ARKive - images and movies of the toque macaque (Macaca sinica) * BBC - Science & Nature - Animals - Toque macaque * Wolfgang Dittus - A Toque Macaque researcher toque Macaque Category:Mammals of Sri Lanka Category:Endemic fauna of Sri Lanka Toque Macaque toque macaque ","title":"Toque macaque"},{"id":"2553980","text":"Batang Ai National Park () is a national park located in Sri Aman Division, Sarawak, Malaysia. It is located in Lubok Antu, some 250 kilometers east of Kuching. The park covers an area of of extensive tropical rainforest with a number or rare and protected animals surrounding the 24 square kilometer artificial lake created by the Batang Ai hydroelectric reservoir. The park was proclaimed in 1991, and has become increasingly popular with locals and tourists despite the lack of facilities. Access is possible by chartering a boat (traditional boat called Longboat), as water is the main method of transportation in the area. The ride takes approximately about 40 minutes to Batang Ai National Park headquarters. The lush dipterocarp forests are home to the orang-utan, gibbons, and hornbills. The lake creates a beautiful environment and gives a sense of peace and tranquillity. The local inhabitants are mostly Iban, and tours to nearby Iban longhouses are also a tourist diversion. This national park takes strong steps in having the local communities involved in its management. The communities have formed a cooperative called 'Kooperasi Serbaguna Ulu Batang Ai' and are helping to conserve the park.

Vaginal fingering is legally and medically called digital penetration or digital penetration of the vagina. Fingering may also include the use of fingers to sexually stimulate the anus. Fingering may be performed on oneself (masturbation) or by or with a sexual partner. When performed on the vulva or vagina by a sexual partner, it is a form of mutual masturbation, and is analogous to a handjob (the manual stimulation of the penis). It may be used for sexual arousal or foreplay, constitute an entire sexual encounter, or be used as a form of non-penetrative sexual activity. Fingering may be used in association with other sex acts or acts of intimacy, or to enable the woman to achieve orgasm. Stimulation =Vulva= Parts of the vulva, especially the clitoris, are erogenous zones. Massage of the vulva, and in particular the clitoris, is the most common way for a woman to achieve an orgasm. Studies indicate that 70-80% of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm. The clitoral glans or shaft may be massaged, usually through the skin of the clitoral hood, using up-and-down, side-to-side, or circular motions. The rest of the genitals are also stimulated by fingering. =Vagina= While the vagina is not especially sensitive as a whole, its lower third (the area close to the entrance) has concentrations of the nerve endings that can provide pleasurable sensations when stimulated during sexual activity. Fingering the vagina is often performed in an effort to stimulate an area which may be termed the G-spot. The G-spot is reportedly located roughly up on the anterior wall of the vagina, forwards toward the navel. It is described as being recognized by its ridges and slightly rougher texture compared to the more cushion-like vaginal cavity walls around it. Fingering this spot, and in effect possibly stimulating the Skene's gland, is commonly cited as a method that may lead to female ejaculation. Some women have cited the \\"come hither\\" approach as a significant catalyst to orgasm. This technique involves the middle finger, sometimes additionally the index or ring finger, making a hand gesture like \\"come here\\" with the palm facing upwards towards her pubic bone. Medical professionals suggest washing the hands before contact with the vagina, to ensure proper hygiene, especially when moving between different orifices. =Anus= Anal fingering may be pleasurable because of the large number of nerve endings in the anal area, and because of the added stimulation gained from stretching the anal sphincter muscles while inserting the finger. A good quality personal lubricant is advisable to both increase the pleasurable sensation and aid insertion. Some people prefer to simply stimulate the outer ring of the anus, while others will follow this by inserting one or more fingers. Fingering may be seen as an act in itself, or as an arousing prelude in preparation for further anal sex. Anal fingering can arouse the receiver, allowing them to relax their anus and prepare them for the insertion of a penis or any other sexual instrument. Anal fingering is also an effective way of stimulating the prostate in males, and thus may bring the receiver to orgasm. Anal fingering can also stimulate the perineal sponge in women. Safety and sexual assault Fingering is generally considered safe sex as long as there are no open wounds on the fingers. The nails should be trimmed and filed; long, sharp or jagged nails can cause cuts, injury, or severe infection. If there are cuts, infections, or open wounds on the fingers, extreme protection and care is necessary. If finger cots are used they may slip off and remain inside the receptive partner. The hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and warm water before practicing any other activity to avoid spreading bacteria or germs. In stimulating both the anus and vagina, separate latex gloves should be used for each to avoid cross- contamination. How digital penetration without consent is classified legally depends on the jurisdiction. For example, penetration without consent of the vagina or anus with a finger is called \\"rape\\" in Australia and \\"forcible rape\\" in the US. In Scotland, the term \\"rape\\" is only used for penetration with a penis, whereas penetration with a finger can be \\"sexual assault by penetration\\".

The OCC produces its charts by gathering and combining sales data from retailers through market researchers Kantar, and claims to cover 99% of the singles market and 95% of the album market, and aims to collect data from any retailer who sells more than 100 chart items per week. In 2017, the OCC made a 5-year deal with the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) to compile the Irish Singles Chart, Irish Albums Chart and other Irish charts on behalf of IRMA. The OCC is operated jointly by the British Phonographic Industry and the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA) (formerly the British Association of Record Dealers (BARD)). Since 1 July 1997, CIN and then the OCC have compiled the official charts. Prior to this date, the charts were produced by a succession of market research companies, beginning with the British Market Research Bureau in 1969, and later by Gallup. Before the production of the \\"official\\" charts, various less comprehensive charts were produced, most notably by newspaper/magazine New Musical Express (NME) which began its chart in 1952; some of these older charts (including NMEs earliest singles charts) are now part of the official OCC canon. Chart synopsis  All of the OCC's charts are published weekly on Friday nights, and cover sales for the preceding week, Friday to Thursday. From 3 August 1969 until 5 July 2015, the chart week ran from Sunday to Saturday. Genre-specific charts include UK Dance Chart, UK Indie Chart, UK R&B; Chart, UK Rock Chart and the Asian Music Chart Top 40. The Scottish Singles and Albums Charts ― and the former Welsh Singles and Albums Chart ― appears in listings within the Official Charts Company. It is a regional listing reflecting how sales towards the UK Singles Chart and UK Albums Chart are faring in Scotland. The Welsh Singles and Album Chart served the same purpose in Wales. It also charts the UK DVD Chart and UK Budget Album Chart. While their music charts are now Friday to Thursday, their video charts remain Sunday to Saturday. On 5 September 2008, the Official UK Charts Company rebranded itself as the Official Charts Company and introduced a new company logo. It later dropped the word 'Company' and became just \\"Official Charts\\". From May 2012, a new chart was launched – the Official Streaming Chart. This counts audio streams from streaming services Spotify, Deezer, Blinkbox Music, Napster, amongst others. The chart is the first of its kind to rank streams from ad-funded and subscription services and the Official Streaming Chart Top 100 is now published weekly on the Official Charts website, and in music industry trade magazine Music Week. In April 2015, the UK's first vinyl record chart of the modern era was launched by the Official Charts Company due to 'the huge surge of interest' in the sector. The chart was launched following the growth of the sector in the UK for the seventh year in a row. In July 2015, Official Charts changed its chart methodology from traditional Sunday slot to the new Friday slot, effective on 10 July 2015 to coincide with the 'New Music Friday - Global Release Day' campaign set by IFPI which effective on 10 July 2015 as well. Beginning in 2017 the Official Charts Company changed its methodology for calculating the Top 40, intending to more accurately reflect the rise in music streaming. Prior to January 2017, 100 streams counted as one 'sale' of a song. From January onward, the ratio became 150:1. Additionally, in June 2017, it was decided that after a record has spent at least 10 weeks on the chart, any track which has declined for three consecutive weeks will see its streams:sales ratio change from 150:1 to 300:1, in an attempt to accelerate their disappearance from the chart. In mid-2019, the company also compiled the Asian Music Chart Top 40, alongside BritAsia TV. The chart highlights UK's biggest Asian songs of the week, based on sales and streams across a seven day period.https://britasia.tv/chart/https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/asian- download-chart/https://dailyentxpress.com/britasia-in-conjunction-with-the- official-charts-company-launch-the-uk-punjabi-chart See also * UK Albums Chart * UK Singles Chart * UK Video Charts * UK Singles Downloads Chart * UK Album Downloads Chart * British Phonographic Industry (BPI) References External links *Official Charts Company website Category:British record charts Category:Music organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Official Charts Company"},{"id":"2554025","text":"Jerome \\"Pooh\\" Richardson Jr. (born May 14, 1966) is an American former basketball player who played 10 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

In many European countries, Donald is considered the lead character in Disney comics, more important and beloved than Mickey Mouse. In America, the Donald Duck comic strip debuted on February 7, 1938, following a 1936-1937 trial run in the Silly Symphony Sunday page. The strip ran for more than 50 years, ending in 1995. The Donald Duck comic book first appeared as part of Dell Comics' Four Color Comics one-shot series, beginning in 1942. It became an independent comic book with issue #26 in November 1952. Donald Duck also has a prominent role in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories, the American flagship anthology comic first published in 1940. The most popular issues featured the Donald Duck 10-pagers written and drawn by Carl Barks, who began the run with issue # 31 (April 1943). Pre-cartoon namesake The earliest print mention of a character called \\"Donald Duck\\" is in 1931 in the book, The Adventures of Mickey Mouse, published by David McKay Company, Philadelphia. On the first text page, none of which are numbered, the third paragraph begins, \\"Mickey has many friends in the old barn and the barnyard, besides Minnie Mouse. They are Henry Horse and Carolyn Cow and Patricia Pig and Donald Duck...\\" A duck with the same name made another early printed appearance in Mickey Mouse Annual #3 (published 1932; the annual for 1933), a 128-page British hardback. This book included the poem Mickey's 'Hoozoo': Witswitch, and Wotswot, which listed some of Mickey's barnyard animal friends: \\"Donald Duck and Clara Hen, Robert Rooster, Jenny Wren...\\" However, the duckling that appears on this page bears no resemblance to the one introduced in The Wise Little Hen during 1934. Mickey Mouse Annual #3 was drawn entirely by Wilfred Haughton. Comic strip debut The Donald of The Wise Little Hen made his printed debut in the June 1934 issue of Good Housekeeping Magazine. A single page ad depicted 6 comic images of Donald as part of the monthly Silly Symphonies section. Later that year, Donald made his newspaper debut in the comic strip adaptation of that cartoon. It was released between September 16 and December 16, 1934, in the Silly Symphony Sunday pages by Ted Osborne and Al Taliaferro. Starting February 10, 1935, Donald appeared in the Mickey Mouse comic strip by Ted Osborne and Floyd Gottfredson, in the story \\"Editor-in-Grief\\". In the story, Mickey hires Donald as a newsboy to sell Mickey's newspaper, the Daily War- Drum. The paper is involved in a battle with a criminal gang who try to keep Donald from selling the paper, which makes him furious and even more determined. Donald is there for the happy ending at Mickey's house on May 30, and then disappears from the strip, for a while. Featured character A supporting character in Mickey's strip, Donald came to dominate the Silly Symphony strips between August 30, 1936, and December 12, 1937. At the time, Ted Osborne was credited as writer and Al Taliaferro as artist and inker. The duo turned Donald from a countryman to a city dweller. They also introduced the first members of the Duck family, Donald's identical triplet nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, who debuted on October 17, 1937. The triplets were sent to spend some time with him as guests while their father recovered at the hospital from their latest prank. Nevertheless, Donald ended up serving as their adoptive parent. Comic book debut At this time, the first Donald Duck stories originally created for a comic book made their appearance. In the United Kingdom, Odhams Press also created original stories with Donald Duck. \\"Donald and Donna\\", published in Mickey Mouse Weekly #67 (May 15, 1937), was the first Donald Duck adventure ever. The story was fifteen pages long and published in weekly episodes. The last appeared on August 21, 1937. All episodes were drawn by William A. Ward. Disney had also licensed the Italian publishing house Mondadori to create stories with the Disney characters as their stars. The first to star Donald, under his Italian name Paolino Paperino, was \\"Paolino Paperino e il mistero di Marte\\", written and drawn by Federico Pedrocchi for the new 1937 Disney comics magazine Paperino e altre avventure (Donald Duck and Other Adventures). The story was later reprinted in the United States as \\"The Secret of Mars\\", Donald Duck #286. Developments under Taliaferro Back in the USA, Donald finally became the star of his own newspaper comic strip. The Donald Duck daily strip started on February 2, 1938, and the Donald Duck Sunday page began December 10, 1939. Taliaferro drew both, this time co-operating with writer Bob Karp. He continued to work at the daily strip until October 10, 1968, and at the Sunday page until February 16, 1969. Among other innovations, Taliaferro made several additions to Donald's supporting cast. Bolivar, Donald's pet St. Bernard first appeared in the strip on March 17, 1938, following his animated appearances in Alpine Climbers (July 25, 1936) and More Kittens (December 19, 1936). Donald's cousin Gus Goose made his first appearance on May 9, 1938, in a series of strips that promoted his upcoming debut short Donald's Cousin Gus (1939). Daisy Duck first appeared in the strip on November 4, 1940, following her first proper animated appearance in Mr. Duck Steps Out, first released on June 7, 1940. Donald's paternal grandmother, usually just called Grandma Duck, first appeared in a portrait on August 11, 1940, and in person on September 28, 1943. Taliaferro also reintroduced Donna Duck as a separate character from Daisy. This old flame of Donald rivaled Daisy for his affections between August 7, 1951 and August 18, 1951, before leaving him for another. First treasure hunt Donald had already been familiar to the American reading public through his newspaper comic strip by 1942. Then Disney licensed Western Publishing to create original comic book stories, with Disney characters as their stars. But the first American Donald Duck story originally created for a comic book was created by Studio-employed artists: Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold, first published in October 1942. The story was written by Bob Karp, who based it on the storyboard of the unproduced Mickey Mouse short Morgan's Ghost by Harry Reeves and Homer Brightman. Karp gave Donald a starring role by removing Mickey and Goofy from the plot while also adding Donald's nephews. Then it was given to Carl Barks and Jack Hannah to illustrate. The story places Donald and his nephews on a treasure hunt for the lost treasure of Henry Morgan, and it manages to combine elements of humor and adventure with dramatic moments and mystery rather well. Though it is one of his early drawings, Barks's attention to detail is already visible. The script asked for drawings of a Harbor and a sailing ship. Barks decided to use issues of National Geographic, which he collected, as reference sources. It was the first Donald story drawn by Barks for a comic book and the first to involve Donald in a treasure hunting expedition. Barks would later use the treasure-hunting theme in many of his own stories. Developments under Barks Until this point, the development of both the animated and the comic strip version of Donald was the result of a combined effort by a number of different creators, but the comic book version of Donald was mainly developed by Carl Barks beginning in 1943. The comic version had already diverged from the animated one in a number of ways. This same division between Mouse strips and Duck strips was generally followed in the comic books. Pete, however, remained his villain of choice for the first few years of his comic book work. Barks largely did away with Donald's animated persona as a loafing, lazy hothead whose main quality is his hardly understandable quacking. To make him suitable for a comic-book story, Barks redefined his personality and gave him articulated speech and shaded emotions. To give Donald a world to live in, Barks developed the city of Duckburg in the American state of Calisota. He was allowed to focus entirely on his own cast of Duckburg citizens, such as the richest duck in the world, Uncle Scrooge McDuck, lucky cousin Gladstone Gander, and peculiar inventor Gyro Gearloose. In the comics, Donald lives in a Duckburg house with Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck. Much of this scenario would resurface in the 1987 television series, DuckTales. In that cartoon, however, Donald works and lives as a sailor on an aircraft carrier, and Huey, Dewey and Louie live for a time with Uncle Scrooge. Barks quit working at the Studio and found employment at Western Publishing with a starting pay of twelve dollars and fifty cents per page. He created his first Donald Duck ten-pager, The Victory Garden, which first published in April 1943; the basic script came from the studio, but Barks was asked to rewrite it in addition to drawing it. From then on, Barks both scripted and illustrated his stories, with few exceptions. His production during that year seems to be at the pace he would follow for much of the following decade. Eight 10-pagers to be published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories, published in a monthly basis, and one longer story for the sporadically published Donald Duck. In this case the story was Donald Duck and the Mummy's Ring, 28-pages long, first published in September, 1943. The shorter stories would usually focus on Donald's everyday life and on comedy, while the longer ones were usually adventure stories set in exotic locales. The latter would often contain more dramatic elements and darker themes, and would place Donald and his nephews into dangerous and often near-fatal situations. To add realism to his illustration of those stories' settings, Barks would still seek reference sources. The magazine National Geographic would usually provide most of the material he needed. In both cases the stories presented Donald's personality as having multiple aspects that would surface according to circumstance. Or as Barks would say later: \\"He was sometimes a villain, and he was often a real good guy and at all times he was just a blundering person like the average human being.\\" Adding another note of realism was the fact that Donald could end up being either the victor or the loser in his stories. And often even his victories were hollow. This gave a sense of realism to Donald's character and the characters and situations around him. His nephews accompanied him in those stories and Barks also gave many aspects to their personalities. In some cases they acted as the mischievous brats Taliaferro had introduced, often antagonizing their uncle. In some cases they got in trouble and Donald would have to save them. But in others they proved remarkably resourceful and inventive, often helping their uncle out of a difficult situation. But most of the time, they would appear to have developed a deeper understanding of things and level of maturity than their uncle. The first recurring character that Barks would introduce was Donald's next-door Neighbor Jones. He was mentioned by name and made a cameo in Good Deeds, first published in July, 1943. He was mentioned as a neighbor that Donald likes to harass, but more as a form of teasing than anything more serious. Then he made his first full appearance in Good Neighbors, first published on November 1943. There Donald and he appear to have agreed to a truce. But when they misinterpret a number of chance events to be covert attacks by their respective neighbor, they resume their fighting with renewed determination. Jones seems to always be in a bad mood and Donald just serves to make him angry. The two irrational and easily irritated neighbors would serve as the focus of a number of short stories. From 1947, Jones was also used by non-Barks comics writers; from the 1960s onward, he has frequently reappeared in stories by a great number of authors. The next two recurring characters to be introduced by Barks were much more significant. Donald's maternal uncle Scrooge McDuck made his first appearance in Christmas on Bear Mountain, first published in December 1947. The first member of The Clan McDuck to appear, his name was based on Ebenezer Scrooge, a fictional character from Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol. The story's title was based on A Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky, a scene of Fantasia. Scrooge's first appearance was almost immediately followed by that of Donald's first cousin Gladstone Gander in Wintertime Wager, first published in January, 1948. Both characters did not yet have their now-recognizable characteristics. Scrooge was a bearded, bespectacled, reasonably wealthy old duck living in isolation in a huge mansion who is visibly leaning on his cane. Gladstone was presented as a rather arrogant cousin that had a claim on Donald's house. More specifically, in summer he had gotten Donald to agree to a wager. On Christmas, he had to either swim in a lake near his house or to pass his house to Gladstone. Gladstone does not yet lay claim to the title of The Luckiest Duck In the World. Daisy, who saves Donald from losing his house, still seems to have no interest in Gladstone. Their love triangle hadn't formed yet. In the following years both characters would become prominent members of Donald's supporting cast. In Gladstone's case, he soon started to rival his cousin in a number of personal wagers and organized contests. His incredible luck was introduced in Race to the South Seas!, first published in 1949. This story also was the first to present Donald and Gladstone trying to win Scrooge's favor in order for one of them to become his heir. The story also explains their relationship to their rich relative: Donald is the son of Scrooge's sister and Gladstone is the son of Scrooge's sister's sister-in-law. Gladstone would also rival his cousin in a treasure hunt in Luck of the North, first published in December, 1949. Gladstone soon became Donald's rival for Daisy's affections. The love-triangle of Donald, Daisy and Gladstone would become an ongoing theme for the following decades. While Gladstone's development and establishment seemed to take about a year after his appearance, Barks continued to experiment with Scrooge's appearance and personality for the following four years. Scrooge was soon established as a recurring character and various stories cast him as a featured character alongside Donald. By 1952, Scrooge had gained a magazine of his own. From then on Barks produced most of his longer stories in Uncle Scrooge with Scrooge as their star and focusing in adventure, while his ten-pagers continued to feature Donald as their star and focused on comedy. Scrooge became the central figure of the stories while Donald and their nephews were cast as Scrooge's helpers, hired helping-hands who followed Scrooge around the world. Other contemporary creators also reflected this change of focus from Donald to Scrooge in stories. Since then the role of the central figure in new stories alternates between Donald and Scrooge. Further developments Barks was not the only author to develop Donald. All over the world hundreds of other authors have used the character, sometimes with great results—for example, the Disney Studio artists that made comics directly for the European market. Two of these, Dick Kinney and Al Hubbard, created Donald's cousin Fethry Duck, an obsessive dreamer with a love of discovering new lifestyles and hobbies. Fethry remains one of the most popular Duck characters in Italy and Brazil, frequently with his own comic book title in Brazil. The American artists Vic Lockman and Tony Strobl, working directly for the American comic books, created Moby Duck. Italian publisher Mondadori created many of the stories that were published throughout Europe. They also introduced numerous new characters that are today well known in Europe. One example is Donald Duck's alter-ego, a superhero called Paperinik in Italian, created by Guido Martina and Giovan Battista Carpi. Giorgio Cavazzano and Carlo Chendi created Humphrey Gokart (Umperio Bogarto in Italian), a Sam Spade-like detective. They also created O.K. Quack, an extraterrestrial Duck who landed on earth in a coin- shaped spaceship. When his ship shrank in size, O.K. Quack lost track of it among the coins in Scrooge's money bin. But OK befriended Scrooge and is now allowed to search through the bin time after time, looking for his ship. Romano Scarpa, an Italian Disney artist, created Brigitta MacBridge, a female Duck who is madly in love with Scrooge. Her affections are rarely reciprocated, although she perseveres. Scarpa also created Dickie Duck (Paperetta Ye-Ye in Italian), granddaughter of Glittering Goldie (Scrooge's prospective love interest in the Klondike), and Kildare Coot (Sgrizzo Papero in Italian), an eccentric nephew of Grandma Duck. Italian artist Corrado Mastantuono created Bum Bum Ghigno, a cynical, grumpy, and not very good- looking Duck who teams up with Donald and Gyro a lot. The American artist William Van Horn also introduced a new character, Rumpus McFowl, a rather fat and lazy old Duck with a giant appetite who in Horn's earliest stories is said to be a cousin of Scrooge. Only later, Scrooge reveals to his nephews that Rumpus is actually his half-brother. Later, Rumpus also finds out. Working for the Danish editor Egmont, artist Daniel Branca and scriptwriters Paul Halas and Charlie Martin created Garvey Gull (British name \\"Sonny Seagull\\" more commonly seen), a mischievous orphan who befriends Huey, Dewey, and Louie and his rival, Mr. Phelps. A productive Duck artist was Vicar, active from 1971 until his death in 2012, with some of his later stories published posthumously until 2016. He has his own studio, where he and his assistants drew stories sent in by Egmont. With writers Stefan Printz-Påhlson and his wife Unn Printz- Påhlson, Vicar created the character Oona, a prehistoric princess who traveled to Duckburg in the 1990s by using Gyro's time machine. A well-known and popular Duck-artist of this time is Don Rosa. He started doing Disney comics in 1987 for the American publisher Gladstone. He later worked briefly for the Dutch editors, but moved to work directly for Egmont soon afterwards. Rosa created numerous sequels to Barks's stories as well as a 12-part series on The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, which won Rosa two Eisner awards. Also for Egmont, Rosa developed a popular edition of the Donald Duck family tree. Rosa retired in 2008, two years after the publication of his last story. Other important artists who have worked on Donald are Freddy Milton and Daan Jippes, who made eighteen ten-pagers in the 1970s and 1980s that some claim are as good as Barks's work. More recently, both Jippes and Milton have continued to produce Duck stories on a solo basis. =Paperinik (Duck Avenger)= Paperinik logo. Paperinik (), also known as PK (Italy, USA video game), Duck Avenger (USA), Superduck (UK), Phantom Duck (Φάντομ Ντακ, Greece), is a comic book- costumed vigilante, Donald Duck's alter ego. Donald originally created Paperinik as a dark avenger alter-identity to secretly seek revenge upon relatives such as Scrooge McDuck and Gladstone Gander, but he soon found himself fighting other menaces as a superhero. The character is an Italian invention and, though dominant in stories in which he appears, is very much absent from all others not starring him. The Italian creators (Elisa Penna, Guido Martina, and Giovan Battista Carpi) introduced Paperinik in the two- part, 60-page story \\"Paperinik il diabolico vendicatore\\" (\\"Paperinik the diabolical avenger\\") published in Italy in Topolino #706-707, on June 8 and June 15, 1969. The name \\"Paperinik\\" likely initially meant to reference the Italian comic book antihero Diabolik, to which Paperinik's original depictions wear similarities. The debut story featured Donald receiving the ownership papers of Villa Rosa, an abandoned villa outside of Duckburg whose owner had disappeared decades ago. Donald soon finds that the ownership papers were actually intended for his cousin Gladstone, but he is content not to correct the mistake. Visiting the villa with his nephews, he discovers the diary and an abandoned suit of Fantomius (Fantomallard), who was known as a notorious gentleman burglar and sometime vigilante active long ago. Donald learns Fantomius's methods of maintaining a secret identity by acting as a harmless and rather incompetent gentleman during the day and during the night as a vindicator, taking revenge for his grievances against society. In the early stories, Paperinik was not actually a superhero, but an anti-hero vindicator inspired by Diabolik and Fantômas. The writers toned this aspect down later and turned him into a Batman-style heroic avenger instead, and he started targeting the criminal population of Duckburg, in particular the Beagle Boys. This still remains his main mission today, although he occasionally faces higher profile adversaries and finds missions which require him to travel away from Duckburg. Paperinik's most important ally in his heroic identity is the inventor Gyro Gearloose, who fabricates most of his special equipment, but (in some stories) without knowing his identity. To be able to equip and support Paperinik without risk of accidentally disclosing his secret identity, Gyro has invented a pill which causes complete loss of memory of the most recent couple of hours upon ingestion. After meeting with Paperinik, Gyro takes one of these pills (called UhKa, short for unohda kaikki in Finnish or VergAll, short for vergiss alles in German, both meaning \\"forget everything\\") as a safety precaution. The character was renewed in PKNA - Paperinik New Adventures, a series of comics published in Italy between 1996 and 2000, where the character had access to more advanced equipment (Gyro \\"resigned\\" in a special issue) and was often called \\"PK\\", for short. The series was science fiction and introduced its own universe of characters, and previously-existing Disney characters aside Paperinik himself were rarely seen; recurring antagonists were the evil \\"Evroniani\\" aliens and time criminals such as the \\"Razziatore\\" (Red Raider in the US). The series was followed by a sequel named PK² (2001-2002), and by a reboot named PK - Pikappa (2002-2005). In the sequel, \\"Uno\\", the artificial intelligence which supported him during the first series, has been shut down, and Paperinik cannot use its tower as headquarters anymore; in the reboot, PK has never been Paperinik, and the origin of his secret identity is him being hired as a \\"guardian of the galaxy\\" (he chooses \\"PK\\" when someone asks his name, quickly reading part of a code printed on his equipment). In 2002, a video game loosely inspired by PKNA was released for PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, entitled PK: Out of the Shadows (sometimes called Donald Duck PK, or just PK). In the game, Donald Duck, guardian of the Ducklair Tower, is transported into the artificial intelligence secret area and tasked with saving the world from the Evronians. He is given special powers, and told that he has become a \\"platyrhynchos kineticus\\", an energized duck, or PK for short, stepping around his Paperinik roots. The game received mixed reviews and once represented the only English language use of the name PK. Before the game and after it until 2016 when IDW Publishing did official English translations for the comics, \\"Duck Avenger\\" has remained standard in American comic books. In 2008, a mobile Java game known as PK: Phantom Duck was released; with the help of Gyro, Paperinik has to fight against the plans of the Beagle Boys there.pocketgamer.co.uk Paperinik was an unlockable character in a vídeo game The Duckforce Rises in 2015. In 2014, in Topolino #3058, \\"PKNE - Paperinik New Era\\" was released in four episodes. Francesco Artibani wrote the \\"PK - Might and Power\\" story, and Lorenzo Pastrovicchio drew the graphics. In this issue, Raider and Odin Eidolon persuaded Donald go back to his Duck Avenger identity, and prevent the Evronian empire from rising again. In May 2015 has been published the four- episode issue \\"PK - The banks of the time\\", and the story focuses on the paradoxes of time and marks the return of Lyla Lay, the charming journalist of Channel 00. This venture is scripted by Alessandro Sisti, designed by Claudio Sciarrone and colored by Max Monteduro. In the US, the origin story of Paperinik premiered in a two-part issue under the title \\"The Diabolical Duck Avenger\\" in 2015.Donald Duck #5 and #6. IDW Publishing, 2015. =Paperino Paperotto= thumb Paperino Paperotto (or PP8) is a comic book series starring the childhood of Donald Duck and his friends in stories. He first appeared in Paperino Paperotto and the Hardest Day. The comics was originally in Italy published by Disney Italia. Created by Bruno Enna, Diego Fasano and Paola Mulazzi, young Donald lives in Quacktown, a country village on the outskirts of Duckburg located where there is the farm of Grandma Duck with Billy Goat. Other than Italian comics, some stories about the character have also been created for Danish comics. On February 4, 2019, it was announced that a Paperino Paperotto sequel was in the works. It is called Young Donald Duck and will include Donald as a teenager with Mickey, Minnie, Daisy and Goofy. The book was released in the US by Francesco Artibani and IDW Publishing on November 27, 2019. Donald's character history According to Don Rosa, Donald was born in 1920, however, this is not an official year of birth. According to Carl Barks, Donald's parents are Hortense McDuck and Quackmore Duck. Donald’s sister is named Della Duck, but neither she nor Donald's parents appear in the cartoons or comics except for special cases, like The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. According to Rosa, Donald and Della are twins. Donald's car Taliaferro introduced Donald's car, on July 1, 1938, although it is rumored to be based on the car Donald trades for his \\"burro\\" to impress Donna Duck in the 1937 short Don Donald.https://paperpedia.fandom.com/it/wiki/313 It is recognizable by its license plate number 313, which, in the Italian publications depicting it, also becomes its name. Though Donald briefly drove other cars both in Taliaferro's strip and in later stories, this car would stay with Donald throughout the following decades. The car's constant breakdowns and need of repairs is often used as a source of humor. His alias Paperinik on the other side has the 313 (which sports a different plate, namely X) equipped with a lot of high tech gadgets by Gyro Gearloose to combat crime. In \\"Recalled Wreck\\" by Don Rosa, Donald says he constructed it himself from spare parts of various sources, adding that he can't buy new car parts instead of having them fixed because his car is made of parts that are no longer produced. Various scale models of the car have been distributed, including some by BBurago.https://www.carmodel.com/it/burago/8006/1-18/walt-disney/313-di- paperino-donald-duck-car/1569https://www.ebay.it/itm/133123520345 See also *Disney comics * Donald Duck pocket books Notes References External links * I.N.D.U.C.K.S., World-wide database about Disney comics * Paperinik il Diabolico Vendicatore / The Devilish Duck Avenger * mouseplanet.co * webcitation.org Category:1934 comics debuts Category:1938 comics debuts Category:1942 comics debuts Category:Disney comics characters ","title":"Donald Duck in comics"},{"id":"2554030","text":"Tornado was a competitor on the UK TV series Robot Wars, noteworthy as the champion of the sixth series. It was built by Andrew Marchant, Bryan Moss and David Gamble, from Sawtry, near Huntingdon. Construction Andrew Marchant had originally planned to build a caterpillar tracked combat robot called Plague in 1999. After relocating to Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Marchant met fellow Robot Wars enthusiast Dave Gamble. They formed a team and, inspired by Robot Wars series two semi-finalist King Buxton, revised Marchant's design to employ go-kart wheels in a four-wheel drive formation. This redesigned robot was named Tornado, as Gamble is a storm chaser. Bryan Moss joined the team in late 1999 to provide pneumatics assistance for the robot's weapon system. Work began on Tornado's steel chassis in February 2000 and the first iteration of the robot was completed at the end of July 2000, two days before the qualifying rounds for the fourth series of Robot Wars. The robot's initial design was a red box-shaped chassis covered in polycarbonate armour, with drive wheels protruding from the top and bottom of the chassis so that Tornado would remain drivable if inverted. Its primary weapon was a piercing spike propelled by a pneumatic ram which, alongside additional static spikes attached to the chassis, was designed to puncture opponents' armour. From the fifth series of Robot Wars onwards, the weight limit for heavyweight competitors was increased to . In response, Tornado's chassis was increased in length to , and tapered so that Tornado's rear wheels would remain in contact with the ground even if its front end was raised by an opponent. Its weapons system was also revised for series five: the pneumatic spike was replaced with an electrically powered spinning disc. From Robot Wars series six, Tornado retained the spinning disc but it was now mounted in a removable framework. This allowed it to be interchanged with the weapon best suited for each opponent. The robot The robot was a basic box-shaped robot with a red frame and clear polycarbonate armor. The robot only had a pneumatic spike in Series 4, but was given a vertical spinning disc in Series 5. In Series 6, it had interchangeable weaponry - the disc, a wedge, a static spike, and a rectangular frame with horizontal blade (intended for use against Razer). Rather than its weaponry, however, Tornado mainly relied on its speed and strength to push competitors into the pit or slam them into the arena walls. It featured 24V motors being run at 36V to give it high pushing power - its top speed was only 10 mph, but it had very good acceleration. Tornado was also invertible, allowing it to continue running even when flipped. According to the team's website, it transpired that Tornado was inspired by King B Powerworks, a robot which competed in series 2 and 3 as King Buxton. Series 4 =Round 1 vs. Kater Killer vs. Gemini= Tornado focused on ramming Kater Killer, and also rammed the House Robot Shunt. After being attacked by both Gemini and Tornado, Kater Killer became immobilised. Tornado drove into the pit at the end, but it had already qualified with Gemini. =Round 2 vs. Berserk 2= Tornado rammed Berserk 2 into the arena wall repeatedly, until it was immobilised. =Round 3 vs. Gemini= Tornado was flipped by Gemini, but was hardly affected since it was invertible. It rammed one half of the clusterbot onto an arena spike, immobilising it - the rules stated that if one half of a clusterbot was immobilised, the whole robot would be considered immobilised, so Gemini lost the fight, even though Tornado lost its drive chain at the end. This victory sent Tornado into the semifinals. =Round 4 vs. Wheely Big Cheese= Tornado rammed Wheely Big Cheese in the wheel, but was also flipped a couple of times. Tornado then pushed Wheely Big Cheese into a CPZ, and one of WBC's wheels broke. However, Tornado started smoking towards the end. The fight went to the judges, who declared Tornado the winner. =Round 5 vs. Chaos 2= This battle was fought three times, but only the last one was seen on TV. The first was stopped when the arena was accidentally damaged. In the second, both robots were immobilised at the same time: Chaos 2 by Shunt, Tornado by losing its drive chain. In the third, Chaos 2 successfully flipped Tornado out of the arena, winning the fight. Chaos 2 went on to win Series 4. Tornado won the award for Best Newcomer in Series 4. Robot Wars Extreme 1 This was a series of shows with different events that Tornado participated in. =Vengeance= This was the opening battle of Extreme - Tornado against Stinger, who had apparently claimed that Tornado was just a boring box on wheels. Tornado won the fight on a judges decision by shoving Stinger around. The 'grudge' was very obviously faked, as it had been fought to entertain viewers when filming was delayed. Tornado slammed and flipped Stinger over and over. Then Killalot grabbed Stinger, and planned to drop out of the arena, but Sir Killalot reversed before it let go. Tornado won the Judges over. =Mayhem= Tornado competed in a three robot melee with King B Powerworks and The Steel Avenger. After some shoving, it suddenly became immobilised and was out after all its hard work. It was then put on the floor flipper. The Steel Avenger won the melee and went through to a six robot annihilator. =All Stars= In this 16 robot tournament featuring the most successful robots in Robot Wars, Tornado beat 3 Stegs 2 Heaven on a judges decision in the first round. In the quarter finals, it beat Pussycat, ramming it around so much it caused one of Pussycat's wheels to fall off. In the semifinals, it rammed Chaos 2 around the arena - despite getting flipped against the wall at one point, it won the judges decision. In the final against Razer, Tornado was quickly clawed by Razer, and was eventually immobilised by the damage it sustained - Razer won the All Stars Tournament. =Challenge Belt= Tornado challenged the original holder of the Challenge Belt, Behemoth - proving the more powerful and maneuverable machine, it won a judges decision, and took the Challenge Belt for itself. Tornado then beat two challengers, Comengetorix and Wild Thing. With three victories, it was allowed to keep the first Belt forever, and so was given another one to fight for. It then beat two more challengers, Chaos 2 and Pussycat, and as there were no more challengers they were given the second belt without beating a third opponent. =Second World championship= Tornado represented England in the Second World Championship. In the first round, it was in a melee with Philliper (Belgium), Panzer Mk2 (USA) and Yeborobo (South Africa). Yeborobo never moved, and Tornado was flipped about by Panzer Mk2, but then Philliper flipped Panzer Mk2, who was unable to right itself. Being more dominant over Philliper, Tornado won the judges decision and went into the next round, where it met the reigning world champion Razer. Razer beat Tornado again, clawing it and lowering it into the pit. Simon Scott quoted on the Razer DVD \\"that his heart nearly came out in that battle\\"! Razer went on to win the final against DrillZilla, and retain its title as World Champion. Series 5 In Series 5 Tornado had a small spinning drum (since the weight limit was increased from 80 kg to 100 kg). =Round 1 vs. Gravedigger= Both robots quickly on to the attack, with Gravedigger landing a couple of hits with its axe. But Tornado soon took control, and the ramming against the wall was too much for Gravedigger, who became immobilised. =Round 2 vs. Diotoir= Tornado shoved Diotoir around the arena for some time, but then Diotoir started shoving back, and successfully pushed Tornado into the pit. Diotoir then lost the heat final against Spawn Again who went on to the Series Semi Finals, only to lose to the eventual champion Razer. Series 6 =Round 1 vs. Edge Hog vs. Terror Bull vs. Inshredable= This fight started off with Tornado giving out some powerful slams - it pushed Inshredable around the arena a bit, then combined with Edgehog to push Inshredable into Matilda's CPZ. Edgehog became immobile soon afterward. Tornado continued shoving Inshredable around, then shoved Terror Bull into the pit - Tornado and Inshredable qualified. Inshreadable was in no shape to fight again, as proved in its fight against Anarchy. =Round 2 vs. Thor= Tornado pushed Thor around the arena and into the House Robots, causing one of Thor's side panels to come off. Tornado won on a judges' decision. =Round 3 vs. Anarchy= Tornado replaced their spinning disc with a static spike for this battle. They pushed the walker Anarchy around, but were also flipped a few times. Tornado again won the judges' decision, and was through to the semifinals. =Round 4 vs. Hypno-Disc= Tornado fitted a low wedge for this battle. They simply shoved Hypnodisc around, leaving Hypnodisc unable to get its spinning disc up to speed and use it effectively. Tornado won the judges' decision. =Round 5 vs. Dominator 2= Tornado slammed Dominator 2 twice with its scoop, Dominator 2 axed it and made a nice hole though. However, Tornado pushed Dominator 2 into the side of Matilda in a CPZ, but Matilda couldn't turn her flywheel into Dominator 2, and Tornado backed straight into Matilda's flywheel, and went soaring above the pit and landed at the side of it, where it ran away, but Dominator 2 tried to chase it, but did a backwards-nose-dive into the pit. Tornado had made it to the Grand final for the very first time. =Round 6 vs. Firestorm 4= Tornado pushed Firestorm around the arena for a bit. Firestorm was having trouble getting under Tornado because their scoop was so low to the ground. Eventually they pushed Tornado into Shunt and Tornado got axed by the House Robot. Firestorm wedged Tornado into the wall. Tornado's wheels started smoking as they then pushed Firestorm back. Firestorm then got under Tornado again and pushed them around for a bit. Tornado was beginning to falter as they pressed the Pit Button. Tornado then got under Firestorm and slammed them into Shunt. After axing Firestorm, Shunt axed Tornado, nearly hitting the receiver. Firestorm flipped Tornado over. Tornado's scoop was now upside down and ineffective, until Firestorm flipped them again. Tornado then got under Firestorm and slammed them into the Pit Button. Just before time ran, Tornado pushed Firestorm down the pit, qualifying for the grand final. =Round 7 vs. Razer= For the battle against Razer, Tornado was fitted with a large metal frame with a lawnmower blade attached. Created specially for this fight, should it have occurred, this frame made it impossible for Razer to reach the inner parts of Tornado. The round begun with Tornado ramming Razer several times, although rather ineffectively. Tornado's lawnmower blade stopped spinning at one point. Razer was able to grab onto the cage, but to no avail, as its moving power was outmatched by Tornado's. Razer was slammed and became stuck behind the disc button, and Tornado rammed it many more times. Refbot eventually freed Razer. Tornado pushed Razer to the CPZ's of both Dead Metal and Shunt. The pit button was pushed and Razer managed to get a grip on Tornado's cage, lift it up and drag it into the pit, but Tornado's frame was too big for it to even fit all the way. Cease was called. After a 45-minute wait, the judges finally ruled in favour of Tornado owing to the fact that Razer did not release itself from the robot upon its placement on the pit. Therefore it was deemed that Tornado did nothing wrong and subsequently became the new UK Champion. Robot Wars Extreme 2 =All Stars= In the first round, Tornado was in a three-robot melee with Dantomkia and Terrorhurtz. Terrorhurtz was eliminated via pit, allowing Dantomkia and Tornado to qualify. Tornado was then beaten in the second round by Bigger Brother via pit, while Dantomkia lost to the heat winners Firestorm 4, who were beaten by reigning and eventual All Star champions Razer. =Challenge Belt= Eight robots (Barbarous 2, Dantomkia, Hypno-Disc, Iron Awe 2, Sir Chromalot, SMIDSY, Terrorhurtz and Vader) competed against each other for the right to challenge Tornado for the Challenge Belt, which Tornado had continued to hold since the first series of Extreme. Terrorhurtz won, and went against Tornado. Tornado quickly pitted Terrorhurtz, and was allowed to keep the second Challenge Belt forever. =European championship= Qualifying as UK champion, Tornado faced the Razer-esque Snake Bite from Switzerland but did not use the anti-crusher frame. After constantly shoving it around the arena, Tornado eventually pitted its foe to face World Champions and arch foe Razer. Although the UK champions did use the spinning blade and framework, Razer now had a new hook extension, specially designed to grapple Tornado's frame and lift it up. The World Champion's tactic worked but, suddenly, their motors burned out in an attempt to pit Tornado and the judges went for Razer. However, the Razer team conceded defeat as they believed their robot to be immobilised. Tornado therefore faced the Belgian Phillipper 2 in the final, who had taken a lot of damage in their previous fight. Tornado, equipped with their disc, shredded through Philliper 2's armour and eventually pitted it to claim the European title. Series 7 =Round 1 vs. Saw Point 2 vs. Ewe 2 vs. Devastator= Tornado pushed Devastator straight into Mr. Psycho in the CPZ, and when it escaped, chased them to the top of the arena, and pushed them towards Matilda. Devastator got stuck in another CPZ with both House Robots whilst Tornado went after Saw Point. Ewe 2 hit the Pit Release button, and after a few attempts, pushed Saw Point in. Then Ewe 2 and Tornado teamed up to push Devastator in on top of Saw Point. =Round 2 vs. Leveler 2= Leveler 2 was patched up after the first round, and only really got one flip in on Tornado. Tornado remained in control, and Leveler 2 eventually drove into the pit. =Round 3 vs. Tetanus Booster= Tornado pushed Tetanus Booster all around the arena, but they put up a good fight, fighting back with their spinning drum weapon, actually breaking the electronic lifter so it couldn't lift, so Tornado could only ram with it. Tornado hit the Pit Release button fairly early on, but Tetanus Booster kept managing to escape the pit at the last moment when Tornado pushed them towards it. Tornado then let the House Robots do the work, and pushed them into Sir Killalot, then chasing them when they escaped into Cassius Chrome. When Tetanus Booster escaped this time, Tornado got in underneath and finally pitted it, qualifying for the semifinals again. =Round 4 vs. Raging Knightmare= Tornado (with their spinning disc) got underneath Raging Knightmare and slammed them against the wall in the CPZ. Raging Knightmare tried to use the flipper to self-right, but Tornado kept pounding on them until Shunt came in and axed Tornado. Raging Knightmare proceeded to flip Shunt. As Dead Metal came to Shunt's aid, Tornado slammed Raging Knightmare into another CPZ wall and started pounding on them and ramming them hard. Raging Knightmare was stuck upside-down. Tornado pressed the Pit Button and pushed Raging Knightmare down the Pit. =Round 5 vs. Gravity= Armed with a scoop and spinning chain, Tornado pushed Gravity into the guardrail, and then into Sir Killalot. Tornado then continued pushing Gravity around the arena until Gravity got behind Tornado and flipped them. Gravity chased Tornado, but now both Gravity's tires were flat. Tornado pushed Gravity onto the flame pit. Gravity flipped Tornado again. Tornado recovered and pressed the Pit Button and shoved Gravity into the opening pit. Tornado was into the finals once again. =Round 6 vs. Storm 2= Throughout Tornado's opponent's run in the war, Jonathan Pearce described it as \\"similar in many ways to Tornado, Could even be stronger\\". Storm 2 proved to be faster and a little more powerful than Tornado. Twice Storm 2 rammed Tornado so hard that it bounced off the arena wall and flew across the floor. Storm 2 got underneath Tornado and used their lifter to flip them upside down, rendering their scoop useless. Tornado lost any real kind of offence with their push from then on. Refbot then hit the Pit Release button, and just as he did, Storm 2 pushed Tornado onto the pit, but they just managed to drive off in time. It went to the judges, who declared Storm 2 the winner. Storm 2 went on to come second place in the grand final against Typhoon 2 on a judge's decision. =3rd Place Playoff vs. X-Terminator= X-Terminator was in poor shape before the battle, having sustained major damage in the previous fight against Typhoon 2. Tornado pushed X-Terminator into Matilda in the CPZ, and her disc knocked them onto their front, so their disc, spinning at full speed, carried them across the floor and into the wall. Tornado then pushed X-Terminator into the bottom-right CPZ. X-Terminator's disc clipped Sir Killalot's arm, and the House Robot began leaking fluid onto the floor. X-Terminator was then immobilised in the CPZ, and Tornado hit the Pit Release button, but they couldn't then push X-Terminator towards the pit: the CPZ was soaked with fluid from Killalot, leaving Tornado with wet tyres and little traction. Having won the playoff, Tornado finished third in Series 7. =Third World championship= Qualifying as European champion, Tornado faced the German Ansgar 3 and fellow UK representatives Storm 2. Both UK robots teamed up to pit Ansgar then Tornado pushed Storm 2 into Dead Metal. Storm 2 escaped and slammed Tornado into the side wall a few times, flipping them upside down in the process. The judges ruled in favour of Storm 2, again who later became the new World Champion. Toys In the past, Tornado has had a minibot, pullback, and remote controlled toy. The minibot and RCT had the flywheel and perfect painting. The RCT also had a removable rear panel, where a button is enclosed. If the button is hit twice, the robot is immobilised. It represents the safety link. The pullback had interchangeable Scoop or Disc. Tornado was the only competitor to have an R/C toy based on it. Tornado was going to have a DVD, but was turned down, as was Firestorm, since the series was coming to an end.

Background Born on 1 March 1968 at Kairang Mayai Leikai in Imphal in Manipur, Kunjarani Devi started taking interest in sports while still in Imphal's Sindam Sinshang Resident High School in 1978. By the time she finished her graduation from Maharaja Bodha Chandra College in Imphal, weightlifting had become her first choice. She joined the Central Reserve Police Force. She also went on to make waves in the Police Championships and captained the Indian Police team from 1996 to 1998. Sporting history Beginning 1985, she started winning medals, mostly gold, in the National Weightlifting Championships in 44-kilogram, 46-kilogram and 48-kilogram, the latter her final weight category. She created two new national records in Trivandrum in 1987. Changing her weight category to 46-kilogram she claimed a gold in Pune in 1994 but was relegated to silver when she tried to compete in the 48-kilogram class four years later in Manipur. Her first World Women's Weightlifting Championship was the Manchester edition in 1989 and the reward of three silver medals buoyed her spirits considerably. Since then she has taken part in seven successive World Championships and with the exception of the Melbourne edition in 1993, she has won medals at every one of those competitions. However, she however could not get to the top spot, having always to be content with silver medals. A bronze medal was the most she managed in the Asian Games at Beijing in 1990 and Hiroshima in 1994, and she failed to secure any medal in the 1998 edition of the Asian Games at Bangkok. Kunjarani has had better luck in the Asian Weightlifting Championships to which she has been a regular visitor. Starting with one silver and two bronze medals in the 1989 edition in Shanghai, she progressed to three silver medals in the 44-kilogram class in the 1991 edition in Indonesia. She retained her second spot in the next one in Thailand in 1992 and China in 1993. Her best performance came in the 1995 competition in South Korea where she won two gold and one bronze in the 46-kilogram category. In 1996 she settled for two silver and one bronze in the championship held in Japan. Recognition She was a recipient of the Arjuna Award in 1990 and shared the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award with Leander Paes for the year 1996-1997. In the same year she also won the K.K. Birla sports award. The Government of India awarded her the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 2011. She has more than fifty international medals to her credit. She also won a gold medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games held in Melbourne for 48 kg women's weightlifting with a Games record with an overall lift of 166 kg which included 72 kg in snatch and 94 kg in the clean and jerk. Current status N.Kunjarani Devi holds the rank of a \\"Commandant\\" and nodal officer of Central sports team in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). She was a member of the committee which was to be recommended to the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award and Arjuna Award for the year 2014. She also was the coach of the Indian women's weightlifting team in Commonwealth Games 2014 in Glasgow.

The doo-wop revival group Sha Na Na derived their name from the song's lyrics. \\"Get A Job\\"' is included in the soundtracks of the film American Graffiti, Trading Places and Stand By Me. The Silhouettes performed in the 1986 movie Joey. Career The Silhouettes were formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, in 1956, at first using the name The Thunderbirds. Their classic hit \\"Get A Job\\" – originally the B-side to \\"I Am Lonely\\" – was issued by their manager Kae Williams on his own Junior Records label, before being sold to the nationally distributed Ember label in late 1957.Jay Warner, American Singing Groups: A History from 1940 to Today (Hal Leonard Corporation, 2006):290–291. It reached number 1 on both the R&B; and pop charts in US and the group performed it on television's American Bandstand. The song sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a gold record. The lyrics of \\"Get a Job\\" are notable for the depiction of a household in tension because of unemployment, despite the man's desperate attempts to find work, all delivered in a relentlessly upbeat style. A second release, \\"Heading for the Poorhouse\\", continued the economic theme. It was one of the few songs to allude to inflation, the trip to the poorhouse being because \\"all our money turned brown\\". This single and all their subsequent singles sold poorly and the group never entered the national charts again, making them a classic example of \\"one hit wonders\\". The Silhouettes toured with Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Clyde McPhatter and others. They disbanded in 1968, but the four original members reformed the group in the 1980s and continued to work until 1993.

The Spanish Government sanctioned forces to raid and pillage English port towns of the provinces of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Without an adequate regular military garrison in these provinces, the Kingdom of Great Britain encouraged the provinces to raise local militias to combat the Spanish-related attacks. Causes Following the War of Spanish Succession Britain and Spain found themselves in a struggle for the balance of power which spilled into their respective colonial empires. This added to existing tensions of their disagreement as to the territorial boundaries of Georgia and Florida. Additionally Spain opposed English slave trafficking in the West Indies and its illegal lumbering on the Mosquito Coast of Central America. Britain disliked the Spanish Guarda-costas, the Spanish coastal police force, because of their harsh methods used to manage and inspect shipping in Spain. \\"Hostilities between the rival settlements in Georgia and Florida were inevitable\\". 'Alarm' The southern frontier (South Carolina and Georgia) received British military support because of petitions from South Carolina, Oglethorpe, a British general, and the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America. The British Government's comparative neglect and long deliberation however distressed the Trustees. In February 1737, Sir Robert Walpole wrote to Oglethorpe: > that he could form about 300 men capable of bearing arms in Georgia, that > South Carolina had money but no men, that North Carolina had men but no > money; that Pennsylvania had both, and Virginia only money. That New England > had men but no money, and New York had money and few men. It was in that year that British support finally began. British ships were posted on the coast, and Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon was dispatched to destroy Spanish settlements in the West Indies. In October 1739, Oglethorpe was instructed to attack St. Augustine, and colonial naval commissioners were instructed to assist. At the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear, the Province of North Carolina raised four companies of one hundred men each to join other colonial troops in the siege of Cartagena in South America during 1741. In addition the colonies had to raise militias to defend their coastal towns and ports. Spanish attacks along the eastern seaboard were intended to disrupt shipping and loot port towns. These raids were continuous from 1741 to 1748 - the Spanish attacked Beaufort Town and Brunswick Town in 1747. In 1739, word had gotten out that there was a war between the British and the Spanish, and Carolina colonists were met with satisfaction. The mercantile community looked forward to getting rid of Spanish influence. > The time had arrived, South Carolinians believed, to remove once and for all > a galling Spanish influence which had incited rebellion among slaves, to > establish firm provincial boundaries and secure the Indian trade by pushing > back the frontier with Spanish Florida, and to realize profits from afar > which had objectives as much commercial as political. When the war had finally ended, however, South Carolinians were relieved; the war had not brought in much of the way of benefits. \\"No sooner had the war begun than did Charleston merchants begin to consider methods by which they could gain from it\\". The English colonists hoped to gain from the Spanish Alarm, but as the raids continued, the merchants realized their ill effects. Many colonists started to lose their enthusiasm, especially during the 1740s. The court, \\"during nine years of actual warfare, recorded only twenty-one enemy ships which were captured by Charleston privateers and condemned as prizes of war\\". The book Georgia Journeys stated that \\"the Spanish Alarm...was of great damage to the colony in regarding cultivation\\". Aftermath The two nations settled some of their differences in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. This effectively halted the Spanish excursions into the English Americas.

G. Wodehouse published on 18 September 1902 by Adam & Charles Black. It was Wodehouse's first published novel, and the first of several school stories, this one set at the fictional public school of St. Austin's. It was originally published as a serial in the British magazine Public School Magazine from January to March 1902. An American edition was issued from imported sheets.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 11–12, A1. The novel follows the lives of several of the schoolboys as they study, take part in their school sports (particularly boxing and running), and enjoy tea in their studies. After two of the school's silver sports trophies ('pots' in contemporary slang) are stolen in a burglary, the boys, their masters, and the police join in the hunt for the 'pots'. Several characters in the novel also appear in stories about St. Austin's published in the short story collection Tales of St. Austin's (1903). Plot Tony Graham, of the Sixth form at St Austin's, narrowly defeats his cousin Allen Thomson, of Rugby, in boxing at the inter-school sports at Aldershot. Tony returns to St Austin's with Welch, another athlete. Tony's fag Robinson excitedly tells them that a window pane was removed from the Pavilion, where the school sports trophies are temporarily being kept. Robinson thinks the trophies have been stolen. Tony later sees Jim Thomson, Allen's brother who attends St Austin's. Jim bet two pounds on Allen at Aldershot, with Allen betting against himself to hedge another bet. Jim now needs two pounds to pay Allen. Jim's father will pay Jim a pound for every race he wins at St Austin's. He has already won the half- mile and hopes to win the mile. Thanks to Robinson, news quickly spreads about the burglary. Only two trophies (for the quarter-mile and hundred-yard races) and a valueless flask were taken. Jim tells Tony that on the night of the burglary, he broke into the Pavilion because he had left notes there which he needed to study for an examination. At the time, he heard someone jump out through a different window. Jim now realizes he interrupted a burglary. He worries about what will happen if it is discovered that he was in the Pavilion at the time of the burglary. Dallas and Vaughan share a study with Plunkett, the patronizing head of their House. They tell MacArthur, a day-boy, how much they dislike Plunkett. Welch shares a study with Charteris, who runs an unofficial school magazine, The Glow Worm. His identity as its editor is only known to the magazine's contributors: Welch, Tony, Jim, and Jackson. Charteris jokingly suggests that Welch, who is likely to win the missing trophies, stole them, but Welch says he does not compete solely for trophies (see pothunter). Jackson says that two pounds were stolen from a blazer in the Pavilion. Another student, Barrett, trespasses on the land of Sir Alfred Venner to collect bird eggs. He discovers the stolen trophies in a poacher's hideout in a hollow tree. A groundskeeper chases Barrett away and comes across Plunkett, who also trespassed. Barrett runs into Roberts, a detective investigating the burglary. Barrett does not want to get caught trespassing and does not mention seeing the trophies. A schoolmaster, Mr Thompson, takes an interest in investigating the burglary. Roberts tells Thompson that the culprit was not a professional, since the window pane was not cut neatly. Furthermore, only someone connected with the school could have known the trophies were being kept there temporarily. Thompson later opens a letter addressed to \\"J. Thomson\\", mistaking the name as his own. The letter is from Allen telling Jim that he needs two pounds right away. After Jim is narrowly defeated in the mile race, Charteris proposes publishing a special issue of The Glow Worm about the burglary and sports to earn the money Jim needs. The Headmaster and Mr Thompson accuse Jim of the burglary, though Jim denies it. After Sir Alfred complains about Plunkett smoking a pipe on his land, the Headmaster has Plunkett removed from the school, delighting Dallas and Vaughan. Jim goes with MacArthur to MacArthur's family's house nearby. Roberts tells the Headmaster that he has found the burglar. After a man named Stokes, who was drunk, bumped into Roberts and dropped nearly two pounds, Roberts showed a photograph of him to Biffen, the school ground-man. Biffen identified him as someone who worked on the school grounds. Stokes confessed that he took the trophies and hoped to sell them. He is a poacher and kept them in his hiding place. Roberts advises the Headmaster to ask Sir Alfred to search the hideout, and discourages him from prosecuting Stokes, since Stokes is now scared off crime. That night, Jim is not in his House. The Headmaster fears Jim ran away as a result of being accused of the burglary, and has Mr Merevale and other housemasters send their prefects to search for him. Charteris and Tony learn from Biffen that Jim went to MacArthur's home. They find and rescue Jim, who fell in a quarry on his way back. Barrett decides to admit that he saw the trophies, but changes his mind when he sees they have been returned and awarded to Welch. Charteris and his friends stay up late to finish the special issue of The Glow Worm. It sells well, earning Jim his pound, though Jim forgot to write anything for the issue. Characters Students at St Austin's: * Tony Graham, a prefect in Merevale's House at St Austin's and cousin of Jim and Allen Thomson * Jim Thomson, the brother of Allen Thomson and a prefect in Merevale's House * J. George Welch, a student who shares a study with Charteris in Merevale's * Charteris, a prefect in Merevale's nicknamed \\"the Alderman\\" who edits the unofficial monthly school magazine, The Glow Worm * Barrett, a collector of bird eggs who shares a study with Reade in Philpott's House * Plunkett, the unpopular head of Ward's House who shares a study with Vaughan and Dallas, and whom they jokingly call \\"the Mutual Friend\\" * Robert MacArthur, a day-boy nicknamed \\"the Babe\\" * Jackson, a contributor to The Glow Worm in Dawson's House * Reginald Robinson, Tony Graham's fag in Merevale's House St Austin's staff and other characters: * Biffen, the ground-man at St Austin's * Mr John Thompson, the master of the Sixth form * Mr Merevale, a housemaster at St Austin's, coaches the House rugby and cricket * The Rev. Herbert Perceval, M.A., the headmaster of St. Austin's College * Sir Alfred Venner, M.P., the owner of Badgwick Hall and nearby land * Detective Inspector Roberts, a detective from Scotland Yard * Stokes, an odd-job worker, farmhand, and poacher Publication history The story was originally published as a serial in Public School Magazine, with illustrations by R. Noel Pocock.McIlvaine (1990), p. 176, D123.18–20. The serial commenced in January 1902 and the second part appeared in the February 1902 issue, but when the magazine ceased publication in March that year, the remainder of the plot was summarised at the end of the third part of the serial, in the form of a letter from one of the characters, Jim Thomson, to his brother Allen. Jim's statements in the letter are not entirely consistent with the ending of the novel. For instance, he claims he wrote nearly all of the special issue for The Glow Worm. The American edition of the novel was issued by Macmillan, New York, from imported sheets, in September 1902. Macmillan reissued the novel again from imported sheets in 1924. The Pothunters is dedicated to Joan, Effie and Ernestine Bowes-Lyon, first cousins to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. The novel was collected in The Pothunters and Other School Stories, published by Penguin Books in 1986. The book also included A Prefect's Uncle and Tales of St. Austin's.McIlvaine (1990), p. 130, B35. Annotations The advance of technology has made part of the story opaque to the modern reader. \\"On Sunday we jellygraph it\\", writes Wodehouse without explanation. Jellygraph was a method of making a limited number of copies, about 20 to 80, from a master copy written with a special type of pencil containing jellygraph pigment. These special pencils are referred to in the story: \\"How many jelly machine things can you raise?\\" The master copy—on paper—was placed face down in a pan whose bottom was covered in a special gelatin, to which the pigment was transferred as a mirror image. The copies were then made one at a time by placing blank sheets of paper onto the gelatin after the master copy was removed. Although a reasonably simple, if slow, method, the copy produced had text (and figures) in a pale coloured ink that was hard to read. In chapter 11, one of the characters quotes a Latin phrase (attributing it to Thucydides): :Conscia mens recti, nec si sinit esse dolorem sed revocare gradum. This is a joke: Thucydides wrote in Greek, not Latin (as Wodehouse would have expected the reader to know) and the quoted phrase is in fact a mixture of lines from Ovid and Virgil.

He was born in Amritsar. Education Educated in Lahore, Kavishar began his public career in 1913, when he launched the English-language newspaper Sikh Review. An early article in the Sikh Review criticized the demolition of an external city wall during the construction of New Delhi, as the wall had been part of a historic Sikh gurdwara. This led to widespread Sikh agitation until the outbreak of the First World War, at which point that particular issue was considered to be of lessened priority. After the war Kavishar renewed his calls for action, with the result that he was expelled from Delhi. He moved to Lahore and began another newspaper, the New Herald. In 1919, he was arrested and imprisoned for writing against the Rowlatt Act. Call to rebuild In 1921, he issued a public call for 100 Sikh volunteers to rebuild the gurdwara's demolished wall, at the cost of their lives if need be. 700 volunteers (including Kavishar himself) turned out. However, before they could leave Lahore for Delhi, word arrived that the Delhi city government had rebuilt the wall. The next month, he was arrested, charged with sedition, and imprisoned for four years for having written about a massacre of Sikh reformists. Congress In 1933, he became acting president of the Congress after his predecessor was arrested for participating in civil disobedience. In 1935, he openly opposed the Congress's participation in the Government of India Act, and in 1937 chose to resign his membership in the party after they accepted office in the provinces where they had earned a majority. Subhas Chandra Bose In 1939, he joined Subhas Chandra Bose's All India Forward Bloc faction; when Bose left India in 1941, Kavishar became the Bloc's president. As a result, he was arrested, and imprisoned for four years. Split When the All India Forward Bloc split in 1948, soon after it had been reorganized, Sardul Singh Kavishar sided with the anti-Marxist group led by R.S. Ruiker. At its conference, Kavishar was elected president of Forward Bloc (Ruiker). Soon thereafter, as Ruiker's party dwindled, Kavishar retired from active politics.

He is a German photographer. Early life and education Ruetz was born in 1940 in Berlin, Germany. His ancestors were from Riga, where they worked as printers, journalists and publishers. After attending school in Bremen, Ruetz studied Sinology, with Japanology and Journalism as subsidiary subjects, in Freiburg, Munich and Berlin. Until 1969 he worked on a dissertation on the novel Nieh-Hai Hua by Tseng-P’u (1905). In 1975, Ruetz graduated as external student from the Folkwang Hochschule Essen. Career Ruetz was a member of the Stern editorial in Hamburg from 1969–1973. Since then he has been self-employed and works as a freelance author and photographer. Since 1981, Ruetz is a contract author for publishers Little, Brown & Co./New York Graphic Society, Boston, Massachusetts. In 1982, he became professor of Communication Design at the Braunschweig University of Art and taught Photography until 2005. Ruetz lived in Italy, Australia and the U.S. for 12 years. In 2002 he organised a major retrospective of German photographer Heinz Hajek-Halke in Centre Pompidou, Paris. Ruetz is a member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Photographie (DGPh), the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner (GDL)/Deutsche Foto Akademie and the Academy of Arts, Berlin. In May 2002 he was appointed member of the Ordre des Arts et Lettres by French Minister of the Arts, Jean-Jacques Aillagon.  Works  Ruetz first became known through his photographs of the student protest movement in West Germany. His portraits of the APO (extra-parliamentary opposition), now part of German photographic history, were immediately bought up by major newspapers and magazines in Germany and abroad, including Time, Life, Der Spiegel and Stern. In 1968, Ruetz covered the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet troops (Prague Spring) and reported for Stern on the military dictatorship in Greece, as on the World Festival of Youth and Students 1973 and the International Workers’ Day 1974 in East Berlin. He later accompanied François Mitterrand on his election campaign, visited Chile after the victory of Salvador Allende and reported on the war in Guinea-Bissau and on many other international events. After spending several years in America and Australia, Ruetz began to concentrate increasingly on cultural-historical and documentary projects, such as the exploration of the \\"visual world\\" of such figures as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Theodor Fontane creating series like In Goethe's Footsteps, With Goethe in Switzerland, Me Too in Arcadia/Goethe's Italian Journeys, Fontane's Walks Through Mark Brandenburg. An extensive study of the phenomena of European Necropoles followed. Recent works deal with the capability of visualizing time and transience. Projects like Second Sight, Timescape and The Perennial Eye, assembled under the main title Eye on Time, document the change of the world's surface during time. In contrast to the individual picture pairs of the Second Sight project, Timescape comprises photographs made during several phases. The period of observation is limited to 25 years. The project is to be completed around the year 2015 and currently consists of more than 300 series of different objects. The photographs already give a clear indication of how much the people, the places, the squares, the apartments, and even nature are in a state of change. What does not change, however, is the geographical vantage point of each photographic series and the name originally given to the object photographed.

It was written by Gary Gygax, and combines two previously published modules from 1978, the original Descent into the Depths of the Earth and Shrine of the Kuo-Toa. A sequel to the first two modules, Vault of the Drow, was also published in 1978. All of these D-series modules were produced for use with the 1st edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D;) rules. The D-series itself is part of a larger overall campaign of adventures set in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. The overall campaign begins with the three modules in the Against the Giants series, continues through the D-series, and concludes with module Q1 Queen of the Demonweb Pits. The latter segments of the campaign, including the D-series and module Q1, are set in a vast network of caverns and tunnels called the Underdark. Plot summary The plot of the original modules Descent Into the Depths of the Earth and Shrine of the Kuo-Toa places a party of player characters (PCs) on the trail of the drow priestess Eclavdra through the Underdark, a vast subterranean network of interconnected caverns and tunnels, battling various creatures on their journey. In the last module in the preceding G-series, Hall of the Fire Giant King, the PCs were supposed to have discovered that the drow had instigated the alliance between the races of giants and their attacks on neighboring humans. The drow that survived the party's incursion have fled into tunnels leading deep into the earth. The adventurers will have arrived at the bottom of the dungeon below the cave- castle of King Snurre. In D1 Descent Into the Depths of the Earth, the PCs seek the home of the drow by traveling through an underground world of caves and passages. In the tunnels, the adventurers first fight a tough drow patrol, and the next major fight is with a raiding party of mind flayers and wererats, who have halted their patrol long enough to torture their drow prisoner. The characters also find a grand cavern containing drow soldiers, purple worms, a lich, a clutch of undead, a giant slug, sphinxes, trolls, bugbears, troglodytes, wyverns, and fungi. D2 Shrine of the Kuo-Toa picks up with the party continuing to pursue the drow. The party encounters a kuo-toan rogue monitor who helps them cross a large river for a fee. A party of Svirfneblin (or deep gnomes) approaches the player characters on the other side, and the party has a chance to convince them to help them fight against the drow. As the party travels, signs of the drow are all around; the drow are allowed to pass through these subterranean areas, even though they are hated and feared by the other local intelligent races. The party then moves through kuo-toa territory, ruled by the Priest-Prince Va-Guulgh. If the PCs appease the kuo- toa and respect their customs, the evil kuo-toa are not openly hostile to the party, but will attack if the party gives them a reason. The party learns that the drow and kuo-toa trade with each other openly, but the kuo-toa hate and fear the drow, resulting in frequent skirmishes between the two peoples. D3 Vault of the Drow is set in Erelhei-Cinlu, an underground stronghold of the drow, and the Fane of Lolth, their evil spider-goddess. After traveling for league after league into the Underdark, the adventurers come upon Erelhei- Cinlu, the vast subterranean city of the drow. The adventure is written in a very open-ended fashion, giving the Dungeon Master (DM) free rein to script any number of mini-campaigns or adventures taking place inside the drow capital. An extensive overview of the drow power structure is given for just this purpose. Eventually, the players may discover an astral gate leading to the plane of the Abyss, leading into the Q1 module. Publication history The original modules Descent Into the Depths of the Earth and Shrine of the Kuo-Toa were both written by Gary Gygax and published by TSR, Inc. in 1978. Gygax had recently finished the Player's Handbook (1978), and according to Gygax, he authored the D series \\"as sort of a relaxation to get away from writing rules\\". Descent Into the Depths of the Earth, the first module of the D-series, was printed as a sixteen-page booklet, and Shrine of the Kuo-Toa, second of the three-part D-series was twenty pages; both featured an outer folder. Both modules were released before the Dungeon Masters Guide and Players Handbook. Both modules were reprinted in the omnibus collection D1-2 Descent Into the Depths in 1981, as a thirty-two page booklet with an outer folder. The original versions of the D1 and D2 modules both featured monochrome cover artwork by David C. Sutherland III, but the 1981 compilation was released with a color cover illustrated by Jim Roslof. Sutherland's interior artwork from the original two publications was included in the compilation, as was that of David A. Trampier. Other artists whose work appears inside the compilation include Jeff Dee, Erol Otus, David S. LaForce, Bill Willingham and Roslof. Vault of the Drow, also by Gygax and the last of the D-series, was also originally published in 1978 as a thirty-two page booklet with a two-color outer cover. The original printing featured monochrome cover artwork by David C. Sutherland III. In 1981, TSR re-issued the adventure with a new color cover. D3 was re-released to coincide with the release of the D1-2 compilation Descent into the Depths of the Earth. Since the D1-2 compilation featured color cover artwork, Erol Otus was tasked with creating a new color cover for D3 as well. Sutherland's interior artwork was retained, and other interior artists for the module include Jeff Dee, David S. LaForce, David A. Trampier, and Otus. The entire campaign was eventually combined into a supermodule GDQ1-7 - Queen of the Spiders. The modules were designed as a sequel to the G-series of modules. At the time these modules were released, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. The D in the module code represents the first letter in the word Drow. According to a Wired.com article, the D-series \\"introduced the world to the concept of the dark elves.\\" Game statistics for the Drow first appear in the module, although the 1977 edition of the Monster Manual does mention the Drow.Gygax, Gary (1977,1978). Advanced D&D; Monster Manual. TSR. p.39. . The D-series is part of a larger overall campaign of adventures set in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. The overall campaign begins with the three modules in the G1-3 Against the Giants series, continues through the D-series, and concludes with module Q1 Queen of the Demonweb Pits. The latter segments of the campaign, including the D-series and module Q1, are set in a vast network of caverns and tunnels called the Underdark. The entire campaign was eventually combined into a supermodule GDQ1-7 Queen of the Spiders. Descent into the Depths of the Earth was the basis for a 2000 novel of the same title by Paul Kidd. The original TSR product codes for modules D1, D2, and D3 are 9019, 9020, and 9021 respectively (9021 being reused for the new Erol Otus cover with the blue background). Reception When combined with the G-series and Q module as the Queen of the Spiders, the D-series was voted the single greatest adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004. Reviewer Alan Kohler said, \\"The Underdark has become a classic place to set adventures... This is where it all got started.\\" According to the editors, Vault of the Drow would have made the top five if it had been considered as a single module. They felt the Drow city detailed in the module offered \\"more intrigue\\" than any module previously. Judge Clark Peterson compared it favorably to City State of the Invincible Overlord, which also had a complicated city environment, saying \\"this was an underground city of evil monsters--the Drow, who, then, were new and mysterious as opposed to tired and overused as they are today.\\" Dungeon Master for Dummies lists Descent into the Depths of the Earth as one of the ten best classic adventures, noting that it takes \\"the player characters into the underground world of the Drow--the wildly popular dark elves of D&D; lore.\\" The series has received considerable praise. It was reviewed by Don Turnbull in British RPG magazine White Dwarf No. 11, who gave it 10 out of 10. He compared the series favorably to the G series of modules, which he also liked. Turnbull commented that the scope was large, and that the modules were of good value. Although D3 can be played by itself, he speculated that the party of characters may need the magic items that can be acquired in the first two to not be put at a disadvantage. Turnbull did lament that the series was designed for parties of a high level, making it difficult to use with a group of lower level characters. He concluded the review by saying \\"don't be surprised if they eclipse in quality most of the material you already have.\\" All three modules are also profiled in Heroic Worlds, Lawrence Schick's 1991 guide to role-playing games. The D-series of modules was also given an extensive overview review by Turnbull in issue No. 15 of White Dwarf, wherein he cautioned DMs that running these modules was unlike any they had run before. He commented that the adventure would be too difficult for most groups of player characters, and speculated that buyers wouldn't actually play the modules because it would take a lot of sessions to finish. He did run the adventure himself, though. He recommended using miniatures on a grid, because some of the battles involved so many characters and monsters. He also recommended rolling the dice for various encounters in advance. Although some such work would be wasted when the players chose one route over another, \\"it will be worth the effort.\\" He also thought that planning enemy tactics in advance was a good idea, providing an example of how to do so using the Drow outpost from D1, as well as other encounters. He noted that while some DMs may ban psionics in their games, if they don't allow the creatures in section M12 of D1 to use them, the game will be unbalanced in favor of the players. Although he hadn't run D3 at the time of writing the article, he wrote that the thought of planning some of its encounters \\"brings me out in perspiration.\\" The power levels of his regular players' characters were insufficient for the adventure, so he gave them pre-generated ones. Although he felt the magical weapons he gave these characters were too powerful, he warned that giving weapons that are too weak would be a bigger problem. He also recommended many healing spells and potions. Overall, he enjoyed playing the modules, despite wishing he had prepared more, and thought that his players also enjoyed the experience. He hoped that people would not be scared to use the modules because of their difficulty. In summary, he said \\"I can give no higher praise to these designs than to say they are as good as anyone is likely to meet, and better than almost everything else I've seen.\\" Reviewer Anders Swenson reviewed the D1-2 Descent into the Depths of the Earth compilation in 1982 for Different Worlds #21. Swenson noted that purchasers of adventure publications had come to expect longer texts for the given price, so that the two adventures had been combined into one format; redundant text was eliminated, and new illustrations were added to fill the resultant gaps in layout. He was perplexed by all of the creatures found in the grand cavern area originally found in module D1: \\"All these creatures are apparently expected to do nothing but sit in their caves and wait to be attacked, for they would certainly defeat any moderately tough adventurer party specified by the author if they all tried a massed and well-coordinated attack.\\" He also wondered about the placement of the kuo-toan shrine: \\"There is great hostility between the Kuo Toa and the Drow, so it is surprising to find the main Kuo Toa stronghold in the middle of a thoroughfare used by the Drow as a main route. It is also surprising to find the Kuo Toa still in business, given the seeming superior military power of the Drow, but who knows?\\" Anders felt that the adventures contained a great deal of imaginative material, \\"but while the writing style is by no means poor, the combination of florid prose and new ideas makes a text which is relatively difficult to read. Gygax does not make a regular practice of organizing his text to help the poor GM pick out the important information quickly.\\" However, Swenson concluded that this is overall a worthwhile adventure. \\"The plot is interesting, and everything is well detailed. Aside from the problems I have already noted, the adventures are interesting and generally of superior quality.\\" References External links * Drow Series at Acaeum.com * Descent into the Depths of the Earth (1981) at the Pen & Paper RPG Database * Descent into the Depths of the Earth (1978) at the Pen & Paper RPG Database * Shrine of the Kuo-Toa (1978) at the Pen & Paper RPG Database * RPG.net review of D1 Descent into the Depths of the Earth * RPG.net review of D2 Shrine of the Kuo-Toa Category:Greyhawk modules ","title":"Descent into the Depths of the Earth"},{"id":"2554070","text":"KDCA may refer to: * Kadazandusun Cultural Association, an association of the indigenous ethnic groups of Sabah, Malaysia * Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (ICAO: KDCA), an airport in Virginia, United States * Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency ","title":"KDCA"},{"id":"2554075","text":"George Ivy Hunter (born August 28, 1940), known as Ivy Jo Hunter, is a former R&B; songwriter, record producer and singer, most associated with his work for Motown in the 1960s. Raised in Detroit, Michigan, Hunter was trained in orchestral music — primarily trumpet and keyboards. After a stint in the United States Army, Hunter began performing as a singer in the proto-soul venues around Detroit, where he became friends with songwriter Hank Cosby. Cosby introduced him to Motown's first A&R; man, William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson. He played keyboards on Motown sessions before Stevenson began working with him as a songwriter. He became a principal in the Motown Records house band and began to write some of the most significant hits of the early Motown years, as The Spinners' \\"Truly Yours\\" and \\"Sweet Thing\\", The Temptations' \\"Sorry Is a Sorry Word\\", The Isley Brothers' \\"Behind a Painted Smile\\" and \\"My Love Is Your Love (Forever)\\", and \\"Ask the Lonely\\" and \\"Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\\" for the Four Tops. With Marvin Gaye and Stevenson, he cowrote the Martha and the Vandellas hit \\"Dancing in the Street\\" which, in the fall of 1964, provided an American counterpart to the British Invasion. Hunter also produced and wrote songs for Motown artists like The Velvelettes (their single \\"That's a Funny Way\\"), The Contours (their 1964 hit, \\"Can You Jerk Like Me\\"), The Marvelettes (their hits \\"Danger Heartbreak Dead Ahead\\" and \\"I'll Keep Holding On\\"), Gladys Knight & the Pips (the album track \\"The Stranger\\") and Gaye, for whom he produced the Top 40 hit single \\"You\\" in 1968. He continued to write, produce, serve as session musician and perform throughout the 1960s. As a vocalist he recorded a great deal of material with Motown during the 1960s, including demos of his own compositions, but nothing was released until 1970. In 1970, Motown issued an Ivy Jo single on their soon to be discontinued VIP label entitled \\"I Remember When (Dedicated to Beverly)\\". The following year another single on VIP was issued entitled \\"I'd Still Love You\\". An album was also planned with the title Ivy Jo is in this Bag, but was shelved. Shortly after this he left Motown. In 1970, he contributed to Funkadelic's \\"Mommy, What's A Funkadelic?\\" on that band's eponymous first album. He also co- produced an album for Wee Gee (William Howard), the former lead singer of The Dramatics, which included the mega-hit \\"Hold On (To Your Dream)\\", which has become a favorite in graduation ceremonies. In 2009, he took part in celebrations to mark Motown's 50th anniversary. Hunter should not be confused with either blues singer and pianist Ivory Joe Hunter (1914-1974), or Motown pianist Joe Hunter who was leader of the label's houseband The Funk Brothers from 1959 to 1964.

It was created by John Hawkesworth, previously the producer of the ITV period drama Upstairs, Downstairs. It starred Gemma Jones as Louisa Leyton/Trotter, the eponymous \\"Duchess\\" who works her way up from servant to renowned cook to proprietrix of the upper-class Bentinck Hotel in Duke Street, St. James's, in London. The story is loosely based on the real- life career of Rosa Lewis (née Ovenden), the \\"Duchess of Jermyn Street\\", who ran the Cavendish Hotel in London, which still stands, at the corner of Duke St, St. James’s’. When the show first aired, there were many people who still remembered her, as she lived until 1952. According to census returns, she was born in Leyton, Essex, to a watchmaker. In the series, Louisa's family name is Leyton, and her father is a clockmaker. The programme lasted for two series totalling 31 episodes, shown in 1976 and 1977. Shown later on PBS in the United States, it was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series in 1980. The theme music was composed by Alexander Faris. Plot summary Beautiful but low-born Louisa Leyton (Gemma Jones) has one driving ambition: to become a great cook. She finds employment as a cook in the household of Lord Henry Norton (Bryan Coleman). His handsome, wealthy, aristocratic nephew, Charlie Tyrrell (Christopher Cazenove), attempts to seduce the attractive redhead, but she rebuffs him, refusing to be sidetracked from her ambition to become the best cook in London. Louisa manages to convince Lord Norton's sexist French chef, Monsieur Alex (George Pravda), into accepting her as his apprentice. The main characters (from left to right): Charles Tyrrell, Louisa Trotter, Major Smith-Barton, Merriman, Starr, Mary. When Louisa is unexpectedly called upon to prepare a dinner by herself, she catches the eye of one of the guests, Edward, the Prince of Wales (Roger Hammond), who admires both her cooking and her appearance. After the dinner, Louisa is pressured into becoming Edward's mistress. Against her own wishes, she agrees to marry Lord Norton's head butler, Augustus 'Gus' Trotter (Donald Burton), to maintain the appearance of respectability and to protect the royal reputation. Gus and Louisa are given a house, and her involvement with the prince commences. In time, Edward's mother, Queen Victoria, dies leaving Edward to assume the throne as King Edward VII and causing him to end his relationship with Louisa. Louisa's shaky marriage to Gus becomes strained, both from her affair with the prince and her great success as a chef. In an effort to help him recover his pride, Louisa purchases the Bentinck Hotel and talks a reluctant Gus into managing it. Before long, abetted by his sister, he lets the authority go to his head. His arrogance alienates the staff and, more importantly, the guests. Once Louisa discovers that he has lavishly entertained his friends and driven away the guests, she throws both him and his meddling sister out. Then she discovers, to her horror, the mountain of bills he has left unpaid. With only Mary, one of Lord Norton's servants, to assist her, she sets to work to pay the debts, taking any and all cooking jobs, however humble, but finally she collapses, exhausted from overwork, in the street very early one morning. Charlie Tyrrell is passing by (leaving a late-night assignation) and takes her back to the Bentinck. Once he learns of Louisa's financial woes, he convinces her to allow him to help her to the extent that he becomes a silent partner in the hotel. Louisa keeps one of the Bentinck's previous employees, the elderly head waiter Merriman (John Welsh). She hires the brisk, soldierly Starr (John Cater), who is always accompanied by his dog Fred, as the porter. From their former employer, Louisa takes along her loyal Welsh assistant and friend Mary (Victoria Plucknett). (In the final episode, Starr and Mary get engaged.) Rounding out the principal cast is Major Toby Smith-Barton (Richard Vernon), an upper-class, retired Army officer. The Major enjoys wagering on the horse races and ends up unable to pay his hotel bill. Reluctant to \\"toss him out on the street\\" and liking the man, Louisa offers the Major a position: general adviser, bellhop and greeter. Charlie and Louisa eventually have a very passionate romance. Infatuated with Charlie, Louisa begins to neglect both the hotel and her cooking. Recognizing what is happening, the Major steps in and has a discreet word with Charles. Knowing how much the establishment means to Louisa, Charlie leaves for an extended stay in America, giving Louisa a chance to refocus on her business. Grief- stricken at first, Louisa eventually regains her balance and makes the Bentinck a great success, only to discover that she is pregnant. Eventually, Louisa secretly gives birth to their illegitimate daughter Lottie (Lalla Ward). Louisa accepts Charlie's suggestion that Lottie be discreetly adopted by a young couple who work on his estate. Later, Charlie and Louisa agree it is best they remain friends, not lovers. Upon the death of his father, Charlie inherits the family fortune and the title of Lord Haslemere. With Louisa's approval, Charlie marries another woman. He tells Louisa that if his marriage has any hope of working, he will have to be away from her. However, when Charlie's wife later passes away, he and Louisa renew their relationship. They decide to postpone their wedding until the end of the First World War. Tragically, Charlie dies of a head injury received while fighting in the trenches. Louisa is grief-stricken, but gradually recovers. Louisa informs the teenage Lottie the identity of her true parents. Lottie accepts her mother's offer to take her to London. Louisa, not quite knowing what to do with her, eventually sends her to a Swiss finishing school to become a lady. When Lottie returns, she has her heart set on being a singer instead. Louisa's parents occasionally make an appearance. She is on very good terms with her ineffectual, but loving father (John Rapley), but not with her critical, abrasively selfish mother (June Brown). Late in the series, Louisa's father dies, but not before giving his modest savings to his granddaughter to help her pursue her singing career. Louisa becomes reconciled to Lottie's career choice.

He batted and threw right-handed. He was the older brother of former outfielder Carlos May. May, nicknamed \\"The Big Bopper,\\" hit 20 or more home runs and 80 or more runs batted in (RBI) in 11 consecutive seasons. He led the American League (AL) in RBI in 1976. He also made three All-Star Game appearances, including as the starting first baseman for the National League (NL) team in 1972. High school May was a standout in both baseball and football at A.H. Parker High School in Birmingham. May played fullback on the varsity football team and was offered a scholarship at the University of Nebraska. However, the Cincinnati Reds organization was also interested in him, and the team signed May to an amateur free agent contract with a $12,000 bonus on June 1, 1961.Sport Magazine August 1972 \\"Lee May: The Man Behind the Astros' Surge\\" Minor league May began his professional career in 1961 with the Tampa Tarpons in the Florida State League, a D-league affiliate of the Reds. He played two years in Tampa before moving up to the Rocky Mount Leafs in the Class A Carolina League. The following year he was again promoted, this time to the Macon Peaches in the Class AA Southern League. At all three stops, May, like many black players, endured racist taunts not only from an opposing team's white fans but from the fans of his own team as well. May hated his time in Macon, Georgia the most. Not only did he hear racist epithets, but he also had to avoid thrown bottles. May's emergence in 1964 allowed him to be promoted the following year to the San Diego Padres, who were then in the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. During his only season with the Padres, May was one of the best players in the league. He hit 34 home runs while driving in 103 runs and hitting .321. He was called up briefly to the Reds at the end of season but then moved to the Reds new Class AAA International League team, the Buffalo Bisons in 1966. A solid AAA season at Buffalo led to his permanent major league promotion. Major league =Cincinnati Reds 1965–71= May made his major league debut on September 1, 1965.

That season, May was named NL Rookie of the Year by The Sporting News. He was also named to the Topps All-Star rookie team. The next two years saw much of the construction of the future The Big Red Machine. Along with Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, and Pete Rose, May helped power arguably one of baseball's great offenses. In 1968, he hit 22 home runs and drove in 80 runs. Despite only walking 38 times and striking out 100 times, he still had an OPS of .805 which was remarkable during the Year of the Pitcher.Hard Ball Times In 1969, he finished the year with 38 home runs, 3rd in the National League. He also had 110 RBIs which was 4th in the league. May was also 2nd in extra base hits, 4th in total bases, 6th in slugging percentage and 6th in doubles. Also in 1969, May had three consecutive multi- home run games, a feat that has only happened three other times in major league history.

During his time in Cincinnati, May was one of the clubhouse leaders for the Reds. With his pragmatic personality and comic sense of timing, manager Sparky Anderson often called on May to put out clubhouse fires. In 1970, the Reds pounded nearly everyone into submission. Batting in the fifth slot, May delivered 94 runs batted in. On June 24, 1970, May hit the last home run in the history of Crosley Field during the park's final game. The game-winning shot came in the eighth inning off San Francisco Giants pitcher Juan Marichal. May was the most productive member of the Big Red Machine in the 1970 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. He batted .389 with two home runs, six runs scored which was tied with Boog Powell for Series high and eight RBI which was a five-game World Series record at the time. He also had the highest slugging percentage and on-base plus slugging (OPS) with .833 and 1.283 respectively.1970 World Series: Baltimore Orioles over Cincinnati Reds (4-1) - Baseball-Reference.com.

Retrieved October 15, 2020 Although the Reds slumped in 1971, May continued to slug away, hitting 39 home runs (3rd in the NL) and driving in 98 RBIs (6th in NL). Consequently, May was named the Reds MVP for the 1971 season. =Houston Astros 1972–74= With the Reds needing to shore up their infield defense and add speed on the basepaths and seeing Tony Pérez and May as essentially the same type of player (right- handed power hitters), the Reds sent May to the Houston Astros for future Hall of Famer Joe Morgan. The Astros, badly in need of power after finishing last in the NL in home runs in 1971, completed a trade with the Reds on November 29, 1971 that sent second baseman Morgan, pitcher Jack Billingham, infielder Denis Menke, outfielder César Gerónimo and minor leaguer Ed Armbrister for May, second baseman Tommy Helms and utility man Jimmy Stewart.

During the 1973 season, May set an Astro club record with a 21-game hitting streak. It was during this streak he hit three home runs in one game (also a club record) and collected his 1000th base hit. On April 29, 1974, May became the 17th player in MLB history to hit two home runs in one inning. =Baltimore Orioles 1975–80= May at bat in 1977 as a member of the Baltimore Orioles. He was traded along with Jay Schlueter to the Baltimore Orioles for Enos Cabell and Rob Andrews on December 3, 1974.

He took an immediate liking to the American League. In his first at bat in the junior circuit, he hit a three-run home run at Tiger Stadium. In his first appearance at Boston's Fenway Park, May crushed two three-run home runs over the park's famed Green Monster including a game-winning shot. May Lee Greets the Green Monster Beaver County Times (Pa), April 19, 1975. In 1976, May enjoyed his best season as an Oriole. He hit 25 home runs and led the American League in RBI with 109. For his effort, May won the Louis M. Hatter Most Valuable Oriole Award. In his last three seasons with the Orioles, May was primarily used as a designated hitter to make room for a young Eddie Murray at first base. Although May was a major contributor in 1979 with 19 homers and 69 RBI, in the 1979 World Series, he only came to bat twice because the DH was not used in that series. =Kansas City Royals 1981–82= After being allowed to leave the Orioles via free agency after the 1980 season, May signed with the Royals as part-time 1B/DH/pinch hitter. Despite hitting .308 in only 48 games in 1982, the 39-year-old May was released by the team in November and he decided to call it a career. Following his release from the Royals, he was hired back as the team's hitting coach and earned a World Series ring as part of the 1985 World Series championship team. Overall career In his 18-season career, May posted a .267 batting average, with 354 home runs, 1244 runs batted in, and 2031 hits in 2071 games. Defensively, he recorded a .994 fielding percentage. May was prone to strike out; 10 times he fanned more than 100 times in a season and compiled 1,570 in his career. However, he is one of 11 major leaguers to reach the 100-RBI plateau playing for three teams, the others being Dick Allen, Joe Carter, Orlando Cepeda, Rocky Colavito, Goose Goslin, Rogers Hornsby, Reggie Jackson, Al Simmons, Vic Wertz, and Alex Rodriguez.

As a student at the Royal Academy Schools, Solomon was introduced through Dante Gabriel Rossetti to other members of the Pre- Raphaelite circle, as well as the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne and the painter Edward Burne-Jones in 1857. His first exhibition was at the Royal Academy in 1858. He continued to hold exhibitions of his work at the Royal Academy between 1858 and 1872. In addition to the literary paintings favoured by the Pre-Raphaelite school, Solomon's subjects often included scenes from the Hebrew Bible and genre paintings depicting Jewish life and rituals. His association with Swinburne led to his illustrating Swinburne's controversial novel Lesbia Brandon in 1865.Peter Horne, Reina Lewis, Outlooks: lesbian and gay sexualities and visual cultures, Routledge, 1996, , p. 70 In 1873 Simeon was arrested for \\"cruising public restrooms\\" and having sex with a 60-year-old stableman named George Roberts. Both men were charged with indecent exposure and an attempt to commit buggery. Both were found guilty, fined £100 and sentenced to 18 months hard labour. .William A. Peniston, \\"Pederasts and others: urban culture and sexual identity in nineteenth-century Paris\\", Haworth gay & lesbian studies, Routledge, 2004, , pp. 77–78 He was arrested again in 1874 in Paris, after which he was sentenced to spend three months in prison.Michael Matthew Kaylor, \\"Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde\\", Michael Matthew Kaylor, 2006, , p. 81Jeffrey Merrick, Bryant T. Ragan, \\"Homosexuality in modern France\\", Studies in the history of sexuality, Oxford University Press US, 1996, , p. 134 After his prosecutions he no longer exhibited, but achieved a degree of celebrity amongst those who shared his sensibilities: Oscar Wilde, John Addington Symonds, Count Eric Stenbock, and Walter Pater all collected his works.Kaylor, Michael Matthew, Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians - Hopkins, Pater and Wilde, Masaryk University, Brno: 2006, p82 Note 1 In 1884 he was admitted to the workhouse where he continued to produce work, but his life and talent were blighted by alcoholism. Twenty years later in 1905, he died from complications brought on by his alcoholism. He was buried at the Jewish Cemetery in Willesden. Examples of his work are on permanent display at the Victoria and Albert Museum, Wightwick Manor in Wolverhampton, and at Leighton House in west London. Retrospectives of his work have been held at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 2005–6, and in London at the Ben Uri Gallery in 2006.

It is usually used to treat acute kidney injury (AKI), but may be of benefit in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or sepsis. During hemofiltration, a patient's blood is passed through a set of tubing (a filtration circuit) via a machine to a semipermeable membrane (the filter) where waste products and water (collectively called ultrafiltrate) are removed by convection. Replacement fluid is added and the blood is returned to the patient. As in dialysis, in hemofiltration one achieves movement of solutes across a semi-permeable membrane. However, solute movement with hemofiltration is governed by convection rather than by diffusion. With hemofiltration, dialysate is not used. Instead, a positive hydrostatic pressure drives water and solutes across the filter membrane from the blood compartment to the filtrate compartment, from which it is drained. Solutes, both small and large, get dragged through the membrane at a similar rate by the flow of water that has been engendered by the hydrostatic pressure. Thus convection overcomes the reduced removal rate of larger solutes (due to their slow speed of diffusion) seen in hemodialysis. Hemodiafiltration Hemofiltration is sometimes used in combination with hemodialysis, when it is termed hemodiafiltration. Blood is pumped through the blood compartment of a high flux dialyzer, and a high rate of ultrafiltration is used, so there is a high rate of movement of water and solutes from blood to dialysate that must be replaced by substitution fluid that is infused directly into the blood line. However, dialysis solution is also run through the dialysate compartment of the dialyzer. The combination is theoretically useful because it results in good removal of both large and small molecular weight solutes. Intermittent vs. continuous These treatments can be given intermittently, or continuously. The latter is usually done in an intensive care unit setting. There may be little difference in outcome between the two in the context of acute kidney failure. =On-line intermittent hemofiltration (IHF) or hemodiafiltration (IHDF) = Either of these treatments can be given in outpatient dialysis units, three or more times a week, usually 3–5 hours per treatment. IHDF is used almost exclusively, with only a few centers using IHF. With both IHF or IHDF, the substitution fluid is prepared on-line from dialysis solution by running dialysis solution through a set of two membranes to purify it before infusing it directly into the blood line. In the United States, regulatory agencies have not yet approved on-line creation of substitution fluid because of concerns about its purity. For this reason, hemodiafiltration, had historically never been used in an outpatient setting in the United States. =Continuous hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration (CHDF) = Continuous hemofiltration (CHF) was first described in a 1977 paper by Kramer et al. as a treatment for fluid overload. Hemofiltration is most commonly used in an intensive care unit setting, where it is either given as 8- to 12-hour treatments, so called SLEF (slow extended hemofiltration), or as CHF (continuous hemofiltration), also sometimes called continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Hemodiafiltration (SLED-F or CHDF or CVVHDF) also is widely used in this fashion. In the United States, the substitution fluid used in CHF or CHDF is commercially prepared, prepackaged, and sterile (or sometimes is prepared in the local hospital pharmacy), avoiding regulatory issues of on-line creation of replacement fluid from dialysis solution. With slow continuous therapies, the blood flow rates are usually in the range of 100-200 ml/min, and access is usually achieved through a central venous catheter placed in one of the large central veins. In such cases a blood pump is used to drive blood flow through the filter. Native access for hemodialysis (e.g. AV fistulas or grafts) are unsuitable for CHF because the prolonged residence of the access needles required might damage such accesses. The length of time before the circuit clots and becomes unusable, often referred to as circuit life, can vary depending on the medication used to keep blood from clotting. Heparin and regional citrate are often used, though heparin carries a higher risk of bleeding.

The house is notable for its use of modern architecture at the time. Design and architecture The design for Casa Aboy was the product of various architects, among them Antonin Nechodoma, a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright. Nechodoma, who moved to Puerto Rico around 1905, used a tropical style of architecture which became popular in the island. Puerto Rican architect Miguel Ferrer and engineer Francisco Pons also worked on the property's design with the purpose of taking advantage of the north breezes and natural light of the location. Pons and Ferrer hired Frank B. Hatch, who had worked with Nechodoma, also put some of his ideas in the design of the house. Finally, Ramón Aboy Lompré made his own suggestions for the house, which he would inhabit. The house entrance features an ample house-wide porch with two posts, typical of Nechodoma's style. The attic windows were altered to adorn the front of the house, and the tinted glass were bought on the Dominican Republic. Aside of the porch, it also features ornamental tiles, a double interior staircase, and the style of the roof are all Nechodoma's trademarks. However, unlike his style, the house features big rooms, and a wide hallway. History After its construction, the Aboy Residence was a common setting for social gatherings. The building on the original lot, which extended from the avenue in front to what is now Calle Martí, no longer exists. Upon the death of the original owner, the lot was divided between his two sons who built twin residences there. However, in 1986, after a legal battle over the inheritance, the house was closed. Shortly after, Ramón Aboy died. Today only the house built by Don Ramón Aboy remains. It has been declared part of Puerto Rico's \\"cultural heritage,\\" and it houses the Federación de Foto Periodistas de Puerto Rico (Federation of Photojournalists of Puerto Rico). The Federation helped fund Ramón Aboy Miranda, a direct descendant of the original owner. In 1989, the Aboy Residence was listed at the National Register of Historic Sites. The local government began the process of restoring it with the help of the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture, and Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly, among others. The house was reopened on May 5, 1994 for the purpose of free cultural activities. It also housed the Cultural Center Ramón Aboy Miranda, which is part of the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture. The street that runs past the residence also carries the name of the Aboy family because it was constructed on the lands that belonged to them. Distinguished members of this family have included the aforementioned Ramón Aboy Miranda (accomplished Puerto Rican photojournalist); José Ferrer (actor and first Puerto Rican to win an Academy Award), and Carmen Aboy de Valldejuli (Puerto Rican cooking pioneer and author, with her husband Luis Valldejuli Duprey, of various Puerto Rican cookbooks).

Springburn developed from a rural hamlet at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Its industrial expansion began with the establishment of a chemical works by Charles Tennant on the newly opened Monkland Canal at nearby St. Rollox in 1799, which later became part of the United Alkali Company. Later in the 19th century, the construction of railway lines through the area led to the establishment of railway works and the village became a parish in its own right. The Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway first opened in 1831 to supply the St. Rollox Chemical Works and the Edinburgh & Glasgow Railway was opened in 1842. Later, the City Union Line was extended to Springburn in 1871 and the Hamiltonhill Branch Line opened in 1894. Initially located outwith the Glasgow boundary, the core area was eventually absorbed by the city in 1872 and other parts in 1891. In the early 21st century, it forms part of the Springburn/Robroyston ward under Glasgow City Council. Industrial development Map of North Glasgow including Springburn, published in 1923 The area's economic development has a strong historical link to heavy industry, particularly railways, with the manufacturing of locomotives. In the past, Springburn's locomotive industry had a 25% global market share. Former headquarters of the North British Locomotive Company in Springburn was designed by James Miller and completed in 1909. From 1961 the building was the campus of North Glasgow College and was converted into an office complex in 2009. There were four main railway manufacturing sites that located in Springburn; the North British Railway's (NBR) Cowlairs Works in 1841, the Caledonian Railway's St Rollox Works in 1856, Neilson and Company's Hyde Park Works in 1861 and Sharp Stewart and Company's Atlas Works in 1888. The latter two eventually amalgamated to become part of the North British Locomotive Company (NBL) in 1903. Also located in Springburn is the Eastfield Running Shed, originally built by the NBR near the Cowlairs Works in 1904. St Rollox became the largest works, and is the only one still in operation today, after the collapse of the North British Locomotive Company in 1962 and the closure of Cowlairs in 1968. In 2007 Railcare Limited, who also owned the Wolverton railway works in Milton Keynes, took over operations at St Rollox, from Alstom, who had originally acquired the works from British Rail Engineering Limited in the wake of the railway privatisation. After a significant refurbishment programme, the site currently operates as a rolling stock repair and maintenance facility. The former Eastfield Running Sheds are now operated as a maintenance depot by Abellio ScotRail and part of the former Cowlairs carriage sidings is now operated as a signalling and maintenance depot by Network Rail. Another large industrial company operating in Springburn is Promat UK, which manufactures Passive fire protection materials at the Germiston Works on Petershill Road. Social development thumbThe derelict A-listed Winter Gardens at Springburn Park, August 2008. Completed by Simpson & Farmer for the Reid family in 1900, in return for the Glasgow Corporation's agreement to construct the Springburn Public Halls. The building has lain derelict since Glasgow District Council applied to demolish the structure in 1985, due to rising maintenance costs. The largest structure of its kind in Scotland, the Springburn Winter Gardens is approximately 180 ft long and 9060 sq. ft. (842 sq. m.) in area. =Springburn Park= The highest point in Springburn and of the City of Glasgow is its famous park on Balgrayhill, 364 feet above sea level. Springburn Park was opened by Glasgow Corporation in 1892 and laid out to a design by the City Engineer, Alexander B. McDonald. James Reid, a business colleague of locomotive manufacturer Walter Neilson, gifted a bandstand, built by the Saracen Foundry, to the park in 1893. His son Sir Hugh Reid of Neilson, Reid and Company's Hyde Park Works also gifted the lands of the adjacent Cockmuir Farm for the park to be extended to the east in 1900. It was at this time that the Reid family funded the construction of the Park's spectacular Winter Gardens, a £12,000 gift from Hugh Reid of the Hyde Park Works, as part of an arrangement for Glasgow Corporation to build a Public Hall in Springburn, both buildings however are currently derelict. A statue in honour of James Reid was erected in the park by public subscription in 1903. Stobhill Hospital was later built adjacent to the park in 1904. Mosesfield House, situated in the park, was also the site where George Johnston built Britain's first Motor Car in 1895, which eventually grew to become the Arrol-Johnston company. =Barnhill Poorhouse= The Barnhill Poorhouse, had also opened at Springburn in 1850. Paupers who could not support themselves were sent here by the Parish and were obliged to work at jobs such as bundling firewood, picking oakum (separating tarred rope fibres) and breaking rocks. In 1905 the Glasgow Poorhouse in Townhead closed and its inmates went to Barnhill, making it the largest poorhouse in Scotland. In 1945 it was renamed Foresthall Home and Hospital and was thereafter used as a geriatric hospital and residential home. It was demolished in the late 1980s and a private housing development now stands on the site. =Sport= Local football team Cowlairs were a founder member of the Scottish Football League in 1890 but were bankrupt by 1896. Another local team, Northern also played in the SFL for a single season in the 1890s. Petershill was founded in 1897 and continues to play today at New Petershill Park, a modern stadium with a 2,000 capacity, including a 562-seat stand. Regeneration The derelict B-listed former Springburn Public Halls, April 2009. The building, a gift to the community from the Reid family of Neilson, Reid and Company, was opened in 1902 and later used as Springburn Sports Centre from 1960, until it was closed by Glasgow District Council due to dry rot problems in May 1985. A proposal by Spectrum Properties in 2009 to convert the building into an office complex and childcare centre was awarded planning permission, but never went ahead. The building was demolished by Glasgow City Council on 27 December 2012. The old alignment of Springburn Road, leading to Balgrayhill. The Springburn Leisure Centre at Kay Street, opened on 17 November 1988 and expanded to include a large swimming pool in 1995, is located on the left and the Springburn Shopping Centre, opened in 1981, is located on the right. Modern tenement housing, constructed by the North Glasgow Housing Association at the former Springburn Cross in the early 1990s. Springburn continued to see expansion, with the area incorporating housing schemes that were developed in the Interwar period, such as Balornock and also post-war housing schemes such as those in Balgrayhill, Barmulloch and Sighthill. Barmulloch also included the high-rise development at Red Road. The old urban centre of SpringburnGlasgow’s Crosses, Glasgow History, 28 May 2016 was redeveloped from the early 1970s to the early 1980s. Selected as one of Glasgow's \\"Comprehensive Development Areas\\", Springburn saw the demolition of 85% of buildings in the district and the construction of a sequence of housing estates which transformed the area completely. A major dual carriageway, the A803 Springburn Expressway (originally designed to be the northern link to the aborted Glasgow Inner Ring Road) was completed in 1988. The regeneration vision remained incomplete, and by the mid-1980s Springburn had become one of Glasgow's most notorious areas, exacerbated by decaying housing and lack of major employers to replace the decline in the railway industry, despite the creation of North Glasgow College (now Glasgow Kelvin College) at the former North British Locomotive Company headquarters in 1965. Since then, there has however been further efforts to regenerate the area. More recently the area of Keppochhill Road, which links Springburn with Possilpark, has been regenerated through the work of the West of Scotland Housing Association Ltd, many of the Victorian sandstone tenement flats in Gourlay Street, Carlisle Street and Keppochhill Road have been renovated and work continues to maintain and improve housing in the area. New build developments in recent years has seen Glasgow Housing Association high-rise flats demolished or refurbished and new modern low rise houses built in the area. West of Scotland housing Association now has a head office based at 252 Keppochhill Road however the interest of the charitable organisation extends into Ayrshire and Lanarkshire. The most notable surviving architectural feature in this area, the former Public Halls, was opened in 1902 and designed by William B. Whitie, who also designed Springburn's Public Carnegie library, which latterly formed Springburn Museum till it was closed in 2003. Since closing in the mid-1980s, the Springburn Public Halls fell into a state of dereliction and were demolished in December 2012. The Springburn Library building now operates as the Glasgow North Regeneration Agency Conference Centre following a £2m refurbishment. Social problems Many social problems associated with poverty from crime to alcoholism and drug addiction have plagued the area for decades. In the 2001 UK Census, nearly half of the residents in Springburn said they did not have any formal qualifications, the fourth-highest figure in the UK, and almost two-thirds said they did not own a car, second only to Shettleston; also in Glasgow.Profile of Glasgow North East That same year, it was reported that 40% of Springburn's residents were living in poverty, the area's unemployment rate was 140% higher than Scotland's average, deaths from lung cancer was twice higher than the Scottish average and the proportion of children leaving school without Standard Grades was four times higher. The average household income was £13,310 and male unemployment stood at 13% - the highest level in Scotland.Motorway was the route to poverty and deprivation for Springburn, The Herald, 6 August 2001 A study by CACI in 2010 found Springburn to be the most- feared neighbourhood in Scotland for violent crime in a national league table, with 42% of residents living in fear of violence.Springburn tops league as nation’s most feared area for violent crime, The Herald In 2012, the \\"Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation\\" analysis by the Scottish Government identified Springburn's Keppochhill as the third-most deprived area in Scotland behind Ferguslie Park and neighbouring Possilpark.Ferguslie Park in Paisley is Scotland's most deprived area, new research showsScottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2012: Key findings According to a 2013 report, 51% of children in Springburn were living in poverty, the highest rate of child poverty in Scotland.Warning over high levels of child poverty, The HeraldCall to help Glasgow kids who are in poverty, Evening Times Transport The Springburn area is served by Springburn railway station and Barnhill railway station, offering regular commuter services on the North Clyde and Cumbernauld lines of the Glasgow suburban rail network.

Like The Grove Family, a series shown by the BBC between 1954 and 1957, Emergency Ward 10 is considered to be one of British television's first major soap operas.  Overview  The series was made by the ITV contractor ATV and set in a fictional hospital called Oxbridge General. Growing out of what was originally intended to be no more than a six-week serial (entitled Calling Nurse Roberts), the series became ITV's first twice- weekly evening soap opera. Emergency Ward 10 was the first hospital-based television drama to establish a successful format combining medical matters with storylines centring on the personal lives of the doctors and nurses. Emergency Ward 10 attracted attention for its portrayal of an interracial relationship between surgeon Louise Mahler (played by Joan Hooley) and Doctor Giles Farmer (played by John White), showing the second kiss on television between black and white actors in July 1964, the first such kiss being in a Granada TV play You in Your Small Corner in 1962. However, the producers wrote Mahler out shortly afterwards by sending her to Africa, where she succumbed to snake bite. When ratings began to slide it was decided to convert the programme from a soap to a one-hour drama for Saturday nights, produced by Jo Douglas. It didn't work. Emergency Ward 10 ended in 1967 after the show had been on air for ten years. ATV executive Lew Grade later admitted that cancelling the series was one of the biggest mistakes he ever made in his career. The formula was subsequently revived with the (originally) afternoon series General Hospital (no connection with the American daytime soap General Hospital) which was broadcast between 1972 and 1979. Australia's Charles \\"Bud\\" Tingwell starred in the series as surgeon Alan \\"Digger\\" Dawson, enjoying a heart-throb status because of his role. The closing theme tune was \\"Silks and Satins\\" by Peter Yorke.  Releases  In March 2008, Network released a DVD set containing the 24 earliest surviving episodes which date from 1959 and 1960. A second 24-episode volume was released in July 2008, while a third 24-episode set was released in 2010. A 1966 episode was included on Network's Soap Box Volume One DVD as was the sole-surviving episode of spin-off Call Oxbridge 2000.

He was known especially for his works on the universities being a professor for all his life. More important than his writings, Zuleta is remembered by his conferences that were carefully recorded by his colleagues and pupils and published several times during his life and after his death in 1990. He dedicated especially to philosophy, Latin American economy, psychology and education. He let treaties on ancient and modern thinkers of a rich social and historical analysis over the Latin American cultural context. He was an adviser in the United Nations, the Colombian Ministry of Agriculture, the Colombian Institute for the Agrarian Reform (Incora), an adviser of former president Belisario Betancur Cuartas and a writer for Crisis Magazine of Medellín. He was rewarded by the Honoris Causa in psychology of University of Valle in 1980. The Estanislao Zuleta Foundation is the institution that keeps and promotes the legacy of the Colombian philosopher. Life Zuleta was born in Medellín on February 3, 1935 from a family of intellectuals. His father died on June 24, 1935 in the same plane crash that killed the famous Tango composer and singer Carlos Gardel in his visit to the Colombian Andean city. He was also a disciple of the Colombian philosopher Fernando González Ochoa. Zuleta who was to be one of the most famous Colombian lecturers, abandoned the school when he was just a teenager to become an autodidact. This led to a serious and passionate study philosophy reading many of the classics of universal philosophy, literature, history, art and social science. His deep knowledge the material read was expressed in his articles, books and his memorable conferences given in many universities of the nation. = Beginning = One of his most dedicated studies was Latin American political economy of which he started to make conferences in Bogotá in 1963 especially in the National University of Colombia and Universidad Libre. He became professor in both universities teaching law and philosophy. In 1969 he went to Cali to work in Universidad Santiago de Cali, where he became vice-rector. From Cali he returned to his native Medellín to teach in the University of Antioquia. = Professor and research = Zuleta was not only a professor, but he dedicated his life to investigation in different areas of like social economy and education at the centers where he was working. Finally he settled in the city of Cali where he worked at the University of Valle and Universidad Santiago de Cali. In 1980 the University of Valle gave him the Honoris Causa for his research in psychology and in the day of the ceremony he read one of the most famous treaties in Colombia: \\"Praise to Difficulty\\" (Elogio a la Dificultad). He remained at the University of Valle for the remainder of his life, and finally died in Cali on February 17, 1990 at the age of 55. Zuleta founded several newspapers and magazines, such as Crisis (1957), Agitacion (1962) and Estrategias (1963).

Invented by Charles Jewell, it is a relative of the solitaire game Spider in which all of the cards are dealt face up at the beginning of the game. The game seems easy at first, but when played, winning is difficult and it is rare to be able to complete the game successfully. Rules First the cards are dealt into thirteen columns of eight cards each. The player will then aim to form eight full suit sequences of 13 cards each. Every sequence should run from King down to Ace. To achieve this, the cards are built down regardless of suit. One card can be moved at a time, unless there are two or more cards of the same suit forming a sequence (such as ♠7-6-5-4) at which case they are moved as a single unit. Because all the cards are visible at the outset, Mrs Mop is arguably one of the most skill-based rather than luck-based solitaire games. When a suit sequence is formed on the same column, running from King down to Ace (such as ♣K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-A), the sequence is discarded. This game is won when all eight such sequences are removed. Like in Spider, it is generally a good idea for the player to build down in suit whenever possible because the earlier this is done, the sooner a sequence is removed, giving the player more space to maneuver. If you can make a couple of spaces you can sort many non- suit sequences into suit sequences. Making four spaces pretty much guarantees a win. Finding columns all of whose cards can be built on others is therefore a good tactic.  References  * Arnold, Peter. Card Games For One * Parlett, David.

On 1 July 2013, it was merged with Husie, forming Öster. In 2012, Rosengård had a population of 23,563 of the municipality's 307,758. Its area was 332 hectares. Rosengård is often incorrectly referred to as a suburb, although the area is located centrally in Malmö, neighbouring the former city district Centrum. Long a destination for immigrants, 86% of the population had some foreign ancestry in 2008. History Most of Rosengård was built between 1967 and 1972 as a part of the Million Programme although some parts, such as the mansion in Herrgården, and Östra kyrkogården, are older. Rosengård is to a high degree populated by minorities. In 1972, the percentage of immigrants was around 18%, with the majority of inhabitants being working-class people from rural Sweden. Since 1974, there has been a white flight out of the suburb as more immigrants were assigned there. By 2012, the figure for those of immigrant background was given as 86%. =Violence= Rosengård has also been the place for several violent clashes between gangs and between the resident youths and authorities. Fire crews and ambulance personnel have also been threatened and attacked, as well as the police. In June 2011, shots were fired at the lower floor of the police station in Rosengård. Nobody was arrested. In December 2008, riots occurred as youngsters confronted the police in which cars, wagons, kiosks, building sheds, recycling stations, and bicycle sheds were set ablaze. The background to the riots was the eviction of a local mosque. The riot was the most violent yet seen in a suburb in Sweden. The riot finally ended when police forces from Gothenburg and Stockholm were sent in.http://www.smp.se/nyheter/sverige/article1046376.ece In its December 2015 report, the Swedish Police Authority placed the southern half of the district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates. In the summer of 2016, Malmö in Sweden suffered a wave of vehicle fires where 70 vehicles were destroyed in a series of attacks. Around half the fires took place in Rosengård. In 2016, after a criminal family had been evicted in an effort by the housing company to reduce crime, the office of the housing company was subjected to three bomb attacks. = 2020 Riots in Malmö = In August 2020, the Riots in Malmö started in Rosengård. About 300 people rioted in the Rosengård of Malmö. The unrest broke out at 1900 in the evening after activists from the Danish Hard Line party had burned a Quran during the afternoon and posted a film of their action on social media. Swedish authorities had earlier denied Hard Line party leader Rasmus Paludan a permit to hold a demonstration featuring the burning of the Quran and he was stopped at the border. The rioters set fire to property and attacked police officers and police vehicle with rocks while chanting antisemitic slogans. =Film= The 2005 documentary ”Utan gränser – en film om idrott och integration\\" (Without Borders - A Film About Sports and Integration) was shot in Rosengård, and is a film described by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet as \\"a documentary on how to succeed with integration\\" of migrants into Swedish society. Osama Krayem, one of the protagonists, later went on to become one of the 2016 Brussels bombings perpetrators.

The government was formed following the suicide of Adolf Hitler on 30 April 1945 during the Battle of Berlin. It was headed by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as the Reichspräsident and Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk as the Leading Minister. The administration was referred to as the \\"Flensburg Government\\" because Dönitz's headquarters had been relocated to the port of Flensburg in northern Germany on 3 May 1945. At the time of its formation, forces loyal to the Nazi regime still held control of most of Austria and the Sudetenland, which had been annexed by Germany in 1938. In addition, the German military continued to occupy considerable non-German- speaking territories in disparate locations across Europe. However, in addition to losing most of its wartime conquests by this point, German forces had already been driven out of the vast majority of Germany's pre-Anschluss territory, in addition to Luxembourg as well as the Polish and French territories Germany had either annexed or placed under direct German administration in the early stages of the war. Therefore, due to the rapid Allied advance, the Flensburg government's nominal civil jurisdiction at its formation was essentially limited to those parts of Austria and the Sudetenland its forces still controlled as well as a narrow wedge of German territory running from the pre-1938 Austrian and Czechoslovak borders through Berlin to the Danish border. Since 25 April 1945, these lands had been cut in two by the American advance to join with Soviet forces at Torgau on the Elbe. Following the capitulation of all German armed forces on 8 May, the Flensburg government lost all direct territorial, military or civil jurisdiction, and all diplomatic relations were withdrawn. The western Allies allowed the Flensburg government to continue to meet and conduct what business it could until 23 May when they arrested its members as prisoners of war, effectively dissolving the government although the dissolution was not formally recognized by the Allied Powers until 5 June. Formation Karl Dönitz Once it became apparent that Hitler intended to stay and die in the besieged city of Berlin, effective overall command of German armed forces was exercised through the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command), which had relocated to Rheinsburg. Anticipating that German-held territory would be split, separate military and civilian commands had provisionally been established on 15 April; under Field Marshal Albert Kesselring at Pullach for forces in the south and west, and under Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz at Plön for forces in the north and east; but then Hitler had stalled on transferring executive military authority to them. On 27 April Wilhelm Keitel and Alfred Jodl, of the Army High Command, met at Rheinsburg with Karl Dönitz and Heinrich Himmler to discuss the war situation now that the fall of Berlin could not be averted. Himmler took the chair as the acknowledged deputy Führer; and, since the disgrace and dismissal of Hermann Göring, Hitler's expected successor. As they were leaving Rheinsberg on 28 April, Himmler asked Dönitz to confirm that he would be willing to serve in a successor government that Himmler might form. That day however, the British and Americans published Himmler's secret proposals for a separate peace in the West (which they had rejected). On 29 April Dönitz received a telegram from Martin Bormann announcing Himmler's dismissal from all posts, and ordering his arrest for treason. Dönitz went to Himmler's headquarters in Lübeck on 30 April to confront him with the accusations, but Himmler denied them as fabricated propaganda. When a further telegram from Bormann that day confirmed both the dismissal and Dönitz's appointment as Hitler's successor, Himmler's position became untenable, and Dönitz summoned him to Plön that night to tell him so. Situation of World War II in Europe at the time of Hitler’s death. The white areas were controlled by German forces, the pink areas were controlled by the Allies, and the red areas indicate recent Allied advances. With Himmler and Göring standing accused of treasonable negotiation with the enemy, Hitler in his political testament had named Grand Admiral Dönitz his successor as Reich President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, and designated Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels head of government as Reich Chancellor. Goebbels committed suicide in the Berlin Führerbunker on 1 May. The same day Dönitz accepted the offices of Supreme Commander and Head of State in separate broadcast addresses to the German armed forces, and German people. Residual ministers of the Hitler cabinet, who had fled from the fall of Berlin to join Dönitz at the Wehrmacht barracks near Plön in Holstein, resigned the next day. Suspecting that Bormann might also have escaped from Berlin and be intending to seize power, Dönitz met with Hitler's former Finance Minister Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk and asked him to constitute a new Reich government. Von Krosigk's cabinet first met in Eutin, to which he and his ministerial staff had been evacuated, on 2 May. Later on 2 May, and in view of the rapidly advancing British Second Army forces which were approaching Lübeck, Dönitz met with von Krosigk, Paul Wegener, Himmler and Keitel to discuss the urgent necessity of a further relocation. Himmler argued for a move to Prague, then the last major central European capital city in German hands, and closer to advancing American forces with whom he hoped to negotiate personally, but Dönitz refused to sanction any move outside the borders of Germany. Moreover, the political situation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was highly unstable. Dönitz decided instead to proceed to the Mürwik naval academy in Flensburg near the Danish border. The cabinet met in the Sportschool of the naval academy; while administrative offices and accommodation for the various ministries were established on the liner , moored in Flensburg harbour. The German High Command, which had moved from Rheinsburg to Neustadt in Holstein two days before, then also relocated to Flensburg, while the SS leadership had been gathering at Flensburg since 28 April. Cabinet Retaining some members from the previous Hitler cabinet and Goebbels cabinet, Karl Dönitz's government consisted of the following people: Dönitz avoided including prominent Nazi leaders in his cabinet other than Speer, but included several serving officers in the SS and others who had been closely involved in formulating and prosecuting the genocidal policies of the former regime. Herbert Backe had been the author of the Hunger Plan of 1941, a deliberate strategy for mass elimination by starvation of Soviet prisoners of war and 'surplus' Soviet urban populations. Speer's deputy in the Economics Ministry was Otto Ohlendorf, who had personally directed the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews and Communists in occupied Soviet territory. Wilhelm Stuckart had been a participant at the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, when the administrative responsibilities for the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Problem\\" had been agreed. Otto Ohlendorf had transferred across directly from directing Himmler's office as Reichsführer-SS; and overall, of 350 staff working in the offices of the Flensburg government, 230 had been members of the SS or other security services. Dönitz's cabinet picks were clearly circumscribed by who was available. Otherwise, and in spite of his subsequent claim that his government was 'unpolitical', the most consistent characteristic of those chosen was a virulent opposition to Bolshevism, and a determination to ensure that the revolutionary events in Germany attending the Armistice of 1918 would not be repeated in 1945. As Dönitz did not then intend any surrender to the Soviets or Poles and continued to identify \\"Jews and profiteers” as enemies of the German people, he had little compunction over including in his cabinet men with blood on their hands, so long as that blood was Russian, Eastern European or Jewish. For the first few days the post of Minister of the Interior was kept vacant. This had been the office of Heinrich Himmler, but Himmler had been condemned as a traitor, dismissed from all functions and ordered to be arrested in Hitler's Last Testament. Dönitz did not want Himmler's name associated with his new government, but nor could he afford to alienate the SS who remained armed and powerful. He tacitly set Hitler's instructions aside and continued to see Himmler on a daily basis without according him any formal appointment. It was only on 6 May 1945, while final negotiations were in prospect for a capitulation to U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower in the west, that Dönitz dismissed Himmler from all his posts, and appointed Stuckart in his place. = Armed Forces High Command = Wilhelm Keitel Dönitz had hoped to be able to appoint Field Marshal Erich von Manstein as Commander in Chief of the Army and Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht), to which the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres) had been subject since 28 April 1945, but he could not be contacted on 2 May, and so Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel was kept in the post; and in this capacity Keitel signed the act of surrender for the German High Command in Berlin on 8 May. A further factor favouring the continuation of Keitel as Commander in Chief was the support for him of Colonel General Alfred Jodl, the Chief of Operations Staff of the Wehrmacht, whose retention Dönitz recognised as essential. Jodl was to represent Dönitz in negotiations with the Allies in Reims, France. Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg was appointed to succeed Dönitz as Commander of the Kriegsmarine, and was promoted by Dönitz to the rank of Generaladmiral on 1 May. The Air Force had largely been destroyed or grounded due to lack of fuel, so no new appointment was made. Field Marshal Robert Ritter von Greim remained as Commander of the Luftwaffe. In spite of its repeated relocations, the Armed Forces High Command continued to function, its organisation and structures having been maintained. But the same was not true of any other arm of government. Starting in March 1945, the staff of the various ministries had been evacuated to resort hotels in the Bavarian and Austrian Alps – chiefly in the region of Berchtesgaden, leaving only the ministers themselves in Berlin. On 13 April, the remaining foreign embassies and the diplomatic corps were evacuated to Bad Gastein. Finally on 20 April all the ministers and their personal staffs had been ordered to make their way southwards; but as by then the roads had been cut and there were insufficient transport aircraft available, several ministers (like von Krosigk) had perforce headed north instead. Thus the government of Germany was, at the death of Hitler, split over six centres. The Propaganda Ministry, the personal fiefdom of Joseph Goebbels, had remained with him in Berlin, as had the Nazi Party Chancellery under Martin Bormann; while the Luftwaffe High Command had relocated to Berchtesgaden, having been until his abrupt dismissal on 23 April the counterpart fiefdom of Göring. Himmler had retained his personal powerbase in the offices of the SS and security apparatus, which had been established in Lübeck in the north and then relocated to Flensburg. Other government ministries and ministers were then variously located at Berchtesgaden and Dönitz's headquarters in Plön. With the Armed Forces High Command also located in the north – although many OKW personnel had gone south – there was, in consequence, no semblance any longer of a German central government, and most of the members of von Krosigk's cabinet lacked any support staff from their nominal ministries. Actions Heinrich Himmler Dönitz's initial priority was to open communication with the commanders of German armies, and to establish with them their acknowledgement of his new authority as sole Supreme Commander of all German armed forces. He also sought their agreement with his overall policy of negotiating successive partial surrenders with the Western Allies, while maintaining the war against Soviet forces in the east. Key to this was sidelining Heinrich Himmler, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg and other former Nazi grandees who had fled to Flensburg, but whose continued participation in government would preclude any negotiation with the western Allies. Dönitz's intentions in this were, if possible, to split the Allies, and to offer German military units as components of a common anti-Bolshevik front. Failing that, he sought to save as many German soldiers as possible from Soviet captivity by ordering units in the east to retreat westwards and surrender to the British, Canadians or Americans, and by redoubling Operation Hannibal, the maritime evacuation of units trapped on the Baltic coast. At Dönitz's urging, Field Marshal Keitel and General Jodl attempted to direct what was left of the Wehrmacht towards these goals. On 2 May, Dönitz obtained pledges of allegiance from the commanders of German armies in Norway, Courland, East Prussia and Bohemia; these pledges were made to him personally as Supreme Commander, and not as Head of State in a forthcoming government. Otherwise, however, Dönitz's policies chiefly demonstrated continuity with the previous regime: the Nazi party was neither banned nor dissolved; Dönitz kept a bust of Hitler in his office; and the uniforms, insignia and protocol of Nazi Germany were maintained, initially including even the 'Heil Hitler' greeting. Following a plea from Speer, Dönitz on 2 May rescinded the infamous 'Nero Decree' ordering scorched earth destruction of German infrastructure and industrial plants; but it was not until 6 May that counterpart destruction orders were rescinded for those territories remaining under German occupation, such as Norway. Moreover, neither summary courts for civil punishment, nor military discipline by summary courts martial were abolished, with military executions for insulting the memory of Hitler being confirmed even after the final capitulation on 8 May. While the presence of SS leaders and their staffs in Flensburg had provided Dönitz with a source of personnel to support his government, otherwise they presented problems. In particular, the SS leadership had access to armed forces that were not under Dönitz's control, and remained firmly loyal to Himmler, whom Dönitz had surmised was personally unacceptable now to both the Western Allies and to the Wehrmacht. Dönitz handled the issue by stringing Himmler along for as long as he could with vague prospects of a possible function in the government. Once serious negotiations were underway for surrender to Eisenhower, Himmler and the SS apparatus had to be got out of the way. On 5 May 1945 Dönitz informed Himmler of his forthcoming dismissal, promising false papers and identities for him and his leading lieutenants if they removed themselves promptly. Himmler called his fellow SS leaders together for a last time that day, and advised them to 'dive down within the Wehrmacht'. By the next day they had fled. This came too late for the concentration camp prisoners within the area who were now within Dönitz's nominal authority, while under the actual control of the SS. These had numbered around 10,000 when Dönitz assumed the presidency; mainly former inmates of the Neuengamme camp outside Hamburg, which had been shut down in preparation for the surrender of the city to the British. Between 16 and 28 April, the prisoners had been moved eastwards and concealed by the SS in a flotilla of unseaworthy ships anchored in the Bay of Lübeck, where they then remained without food or medical attention. At the time, this action had been opposed by Rear Admiral Konrad Englehardt on Dönitz's staff, but when the Flensburg government came into being, Dönitz made no attempt to free the prisoners, and his government avoided any subsequent acknowledgement that they had known they were there. On 3 May 1945, the prison flotilla was sunk by the Royal Air Force in the mistaken belief that the ships were being prepared to evacuate leading SS personnel. Over 7,000 prisoners drowned, mainly on the former liner Cap Arcona. = Partial capitulations in the West = On 2 May, while still at Plön, Dönitz was surprised to learn that German forces in Italy had surrendered unconditionally to the Western Allies. The capitulation had been negotiated without Hitler's knowledge or consent, and signed at Caserta on 29 April, but it did not come into effect for three days. While Hitler had been still alive, Dönitz had followed absolutely his commands to fight on to the last on all fronts. However, he now realized that the Wehrmacht's position in the West was untenable. He believed that surrendering German forces only to the Western Allies could present opportunities to split the British and Americans from the Soviets. Thereon he assumed direction of further German surrender initiatives, exploring opportunities for partial surrender in the West. In the East, however, he continued to order German armies to fight on. On 2 May, he tried unsuccessfully to countermand the decisions of the German commander in Berlin to surrender their forces to the Soviets; and on 3 May, issued orders to the besieged defenders of Courland and Breslau to maintain their resistance. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery On 3 May Dönitz sent Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg, his successor as naval commander in chief, to the headquarters of British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery at Lüneburg, with an offer to surrender the German forces in northwest Germany, together with the remaining elements of Army Group Vistula. Montgomery informed Admiral von Friedeburg that he could not accept the surrender of forces fighting on the Eastern Front, and that consequently Army Group Vistula would have to surrender to the Soviets, although British forces would accept the surrender of any German soldiers fleeing westwards. He proposed instead, following discussions between Eisenhower and the British government, that he would accept the surrender of all German military forces in Northwestern Germany, Schleswig-Holstein, the Netherlands and Denmark, including naval forces and warships in those areas. Von Friedeburg asked for 48 hours to consider this; Montgomery allowed him 24. The proposed inclusion of Denmark, and the German warships operating there, initially alarmed Dönitz, who wished at all costs to maintain Operation Hannibal, evacuating German troops across the Baltic to Danish ports; but on consideration, he reckoned he might secretly evade the obligation to surrender these ships if they were at sea on the date the surrender came into effect. Furthermore, as it was unlikely that Montgomery would promptly be able to deploy British forces to the Danish islands under German occupation, especially Bornholm in the central Baltic, there was every possibility that the evacuation proceeding there could continue in total disregard of the agreed surrender terms. Consequently, authorized by Dönitz, von Friedeburg returned on 4 May and signed an instrument of surrender for all German troops and ships in the Netherlands, Denmark and Northwestern Germany. This was accepted by Montgomery on behalf of Eisenhower. This 4 May surrender would become effective at 8:00 am on 5 May; so Dönitz ordered all ships involved in Operation Hannibal to undertake a covert final evacuation voyage, while also unilaterally ordering all U-boat actions to cease. One crew in the evacuation fleet refused to set sail; so Dönitz ordered the ringleaders to be arrested for mutiny, tried by summary court martial, and shot. Also, on 5 May 1945, all German forces in Bavaria and South West Germany signed an act of surrender to the Americans at Haar, outside Munich, coming into effect on 6 May. Montgomery, always seeking to boost his own public standing at the expense of other Allied commanders, had arranged extensive media coverage of the 4 May signing, but Dönitz and von Krosigk realised that, although he had supplied von Friedeburg with a prepared German text of the surrender documents, Montgomery had failed to issue this to the press. They consequently broadcast their own, doctored, German version, which differed significantly from that signed, specifically in that warships in the Baltic were not included nor was the territory in Schleswig around Flensburg itself; and especially, the surrender was described as a 'truce', not a capitulation. As was Dönitz's intention, this broadcast exacerbated Stalin's suspicions of the partial capitulations, especially as the greater parts of the 3rd Panzer Army and 21st Army had indeed been able to surrender to the British and Americans, rather than the Soviets. Realising this, Eisenhower determined that no further partial capitulations would be negotiated. The capitulations at Luneberg and Haar could do nothing, however, for the bulk of the German forces in Army Group Centre, fighting the Soviets in Bohemia and Saxony. On 4 May Dönitz, together with Karl Frank the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, conceived of a device whereby Army Group Centre might be able to surrender to General George Patton's American forces, who had been entering the Sudetenland areas of former Czechoslovakia from the west, and approaching Pilsen. Dönitz proposed that Frank should dissolve the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and resign in favour of a puppet Czech government, who would then declare Prague an open city and invite the Americans in. General Patton's virulent anti-communist views were well known to the German leadership, who reckoned that with Patton in Prague it would become much easier for Army Group Centre to negotiate surrender terms with him while maintaining their resistance to the Soviets, if possible dragging American and Soviet armies into direct confrontation. Frank had hopes that \\"we can engineer a disagreement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union even more serious than that of Poland\\". The ploy was proposed as being put into effect on 5 May, but was overtaken by the outbreak of the Prague uprising on that date; and over the succeeding three days, far from surrendering Prague as an open city, SS forces launched a savage response to the insurgents, with brutal reprisals against Czech civilians and widespread destruction in central Prague. Orders to fire- bomb the whole of the Old Town were only averted due to lack of fuel for Luftwaffe bombing units. Alerted to the German machinations through intercepted Ultra signals, Eisenhower ordered Patton to stand still in Pilsen in spite of ever more desperate calls for help from the insurgents. Prague was finally relieved by General Konev's forces on 9 May 1945. = General capitulation on all fronts = SHAEF commanders at a conference in London Following the success of the two partial surrenders of 4 and 5 May, Dönitz instructed von Friedeburg to go to the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) to negotiate with General Eisenhower terms for a general surrender of all remaining German armies to the Western Allies. Since von Friedeburg's meeting with Montgomery, Eisenhower's opposition to accepting a German surrender that excluded the Soviet Union had been made clear to the German High Command, but Dönitz hoped to change his mind. On the next day, 5 May, von Friedeburg arrived at General Eisenhower's headquarters at Reims, France, but learned that Eisenhower was resolute that only a total surrender on all fronts to all the Allies could be discussed. Jodl arrived a day later, ostensibly to sign such a general surrender. Dönitz had instructed him to draw out the negotiations for as long as possible so that German troops and refugees could move west to surrender to the Western Powers. Eisenhower made it clear that the Allies demanded immediate unconditional surrender on all fronts. When it became obvious that the Germans were stalling, Eisenhower threatened to close the western front to all surrendering Germans from the east. Had this happened, German soldiers attempting to cross the line to surrender would be fired on and all subsequent surrenders would have to be to the Soviets. When Dönitz learned this, he radioed Jodl full powers to sign the unconditional German Instrument of Surrender at 1.30 am on the morning of 7 May. Just over an hour later, Jodl signed the documents. The surrender documents included the phrase, \\"The German High Command will at once issue orders to all German military, naval and air authorities and to all forces under German control to cease active operations at 2301 hours Central European time on 8 May and to remain in the positions occupied at that time.\\" The Western Allies had a unified command structure, and formed a single expeditionary force, the \\"Allied Expeditionary Force\\". U.S. Army General Walter Bedell Smith (Eisenhower's chief of staff at SHAEF) signed on behalf of the Western Allies, and General Ivan Susloparov (the Soviet liaison officer at SHAEF) signed on behalf of the Soviets. French Major General François Sevez signed as the official witness. Although Eisenhower had sought to keep General Aleksei Antonov of the Soviet High Command fully informed of the progress of the surrender negotiations, no confirmation had been received from the Soviets that the text of the Act of Military Surrender was acceptable to them, or that Susloparov was empowered to sign it. Accordingly, Eisenhower extracted from Jodl an additional signed undertaking that the Chief of the German High Command, and the Commanders in Chief of all three German armed services would attend in person and sign a \\"formal ratification\\" of the Act of Military Surrender, at a place and date to be specified. Some six hours after the signing, a response came from Antonov that terms of surrender were unacceptable, and that Susloparov could not sign it. Eisenhower promptly agreed, and undertook to attend together with the rest of the SHAEF for the definitive signing in Berlin two days later. Antonov's response also noted that von Friedeburg had been referring matters back to Dönitz over the radio; and that Dönitz, in direct breach of the signed surrender terms, had still not issued orders for German forces in the east to remain in their positions but was instead instructing them to continue their resistance and flee westwards. Antonov stated that, while the internal discussions of the German military in no way obligated the Allied Powers, Jodl's signature could not be accepted as valid if he was doing so as Dönitz's representative since Dönitz himself was clearly acting in bad faith. He proposed that the definitive act of surrender should make it clear that the Commanders in Chief of each of the German armed services were, in signing it, surrendering their forces on the authority of the German High Command - and not as delegated by Dönitz or the purported Flensburg government. A second, amended, instrument of surrender was accordingly signed at Karlshorst, Berlin on 8 May shortly before midnight. Marshal Zhukov signed for the Soviet High Command, and the British Marshal of the Royal Air Force A.W. Tedder signed on behalf of the Western Allies (Tedder acted as Eisenhower's representative at the Berlin ceremony, and signed \\"on behalf of the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force\\", in his capacity as Deputy Supreme Commander). French General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny and U.S. Army Air Forces General Carl Spaatz signed as the official witnesses. The Allies had demanded that representatives of the German Army, Navy and Air Force, and the High Command of the Armed Forces, sign the ratification of unconditional surrender, and that they should present full powers authorizing them to do so on behalf of the German High Command. Complying with that demand Dönitz issued a telegraphed communication from his \\"Supreme Commander Headquarters\\" (Der Oberste Befehlshaber Hauptquartier) granting the necessary full powers,The text of the full powers, in German, was as follows: A b s c h r i f t. Der Oberste Befehlshaber Hauptquartier, den 7.5.45. der Wehrmacht /Bitte in der Antwort vorstehendesGeschaftszeichen, das Datum und kurzen Inhalt anzugegen./ICH BEVOLLMACHTIGE GENERALFELDMARSCHALL K E I T E L ALS CHEF DES OBERKOMMANDOS DER WEHRMACHT UND ZUGLEICH ALS OBERBEFEHLSHABER DES HEERES, GENERALADMIRAL VON FRIEDBERG ALS OBERBEFEHLSHABER DER KRIEGSMARINE, GENERALOBERST S T U M P F ALS VERTRETER DES OBERBEFEHLSHABERS DER LUFTWAFFE ZUR RATIFIZIERUNG DER BEDINGUNGSLKSEN KAPITULATION DER DEUTSCHEN STREITKRAFTE GEGENUBER DEM OBERBEFEHLSHABER DER ALLIIERTEN EXPEDITIONSSTREITKRAFTE UND DEM SOWYET-OBER-KOMMANDO. DONITZ GROßADMIRAL. Siegel. and accordingly the second Act of Military Surrender was signed by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel as Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces and as acting Commander in Chief of the Army; by Admiral von Friedeburg as the Commander in Chief of the Kriegsmarine (navy), by General Hans-Jürgen Stumpff as Deputy Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe (air force) as Field Marshal Robert Ritter von Greim, the Air Force Commander, had been injured. At the time specified, World War II in Europe ended. On 9 May, Dönitz issued orders to the German Armed Forces regarding the military surrender. The text of the definitive surrender document signed in Berlin differed from that previously signed at Reims, chiefly in that, to the second article, was added the words \\"..and to disarm completely, handing over their weapons and equipment to the local allied commanders or officers designated by the Representatives of the Allied Supreme Command\\"; which had the effect of requiring German troops facing Soviet forces to hand over their weapons, disband and give themselves up as prisoners. Otherwise neither the Reims nor Berlin surrender instruments provided explicitly for the surrender of the German State, because the draft surrender document prepared by the European Advisory Commission (EAC) was not used. Instead, a simplified, military-only version had been produced by the SHAEF, based largely on the wording of the partial surrender instrument of German forces in Italy that had been signed at Caserta. This definition of the surrender as an act of military capitulation side-stepped any Allied recognition of the German Government, or of Dönitz as Head of State. The question of the civil effects of the unconditional surrender was only settled later, when the Allies decided to dissolve the Flensburg Government (23 May) and issued the Berlin declaration, proclaiming the direct assumption of the supreme governmental authority in Germany by the Allied Powers (5 June). The text of the Berlin Declaration was widely based on the EAC's draft instrument of surrender of Germany. The said draft was reworked into a unilateral declaration with an extended explanatory preamble, that spelled out the Allied position that as a result of its complete defeat Germany had been left without a government, a vacuum that the direct assumption of supreme authority by the Allies would replace. Dissolution = Withdrawal of diplomatic recognition = Walter Schellenberg During 1944 and 1945 countries that had been neutral or allies of Germany had been joining the Allied Powers and declaring war on Germany. The German embassies to these countries had been closed down, and their property and archives held in trust by a nominated protecting power (usually Switzerland or Sweden) under the terms of the Geneva Conventions. There were counterpart arrangements for the former embassies of Allied countries in Berlin. The United States Department of State had prepared for the diplomatic consequences of the war ending on the assumption that there would have been an explicit statement of unconditional surrender of the German state in accordance with the terms of a draft surrender text jointly agreed by the Allied powers in 1944. In the final days of April 1945 the State Department had notified the protecting powers, and all other remaining neutral governments (such as Ireland), that following the forthcoming German surrender the continued identity of the German state would rest solely in the four Allied Powers. The Allied Powers would immediately recall all German diplomatic staff, take ownership of all German state property, extinguish all protecting power functions, and require the transfer of all archives and records to one or another of the embassies of the western Allies. On 8 May 1945, these arrangements were put into effect in full, notwithstanding that the only German parties to the signed surrender document had been the German High Command. The western Allies maintained that a functioning German state had already ceased to exist, and that consequently the surrender of the German military had effected the complete termination of Nazi Germany. The protecting powers complied fully with the Allied demands: Sweden, Switzerland and Ireland announced the breaking off of relations; consequently the German state ceased as a diplomatic entity on 8 May 1945. Imperial Japan, the only remaining Axis belligerent, had already denounced the German surrender and Flensburg government, and seized the German embassy in Tokyo and seven U-boats. Henceforward, although the Flensburg government had a nominated Minister for Foreign Affairs, it had no access to the diplomatic assets of the former German state and was not accorded diplomatic recognition by any of the former protecting powers or other remaining neutral countries. On 5 May Von Krosigk had dispatched Walter Schellenberg to Sweden as a personal emissary via Folke Bernadotte, hoping to establish diplomatic relations and to expedite a partial surrender of German forces in Norway. This mission was overtaken by the general capitulation of all German forces, and following 8 May all further approaches from the Flensburg Government to Sweden were ignored. Former armaments minister Albert Speer suggested that after the surrender the Flensburg government should dissolve itself. Instead Dönitz and his ministers chose to continue in hope of presiding over post-war Germany as a provisional government. Even though they could exercise no direct territorial authority, the cabinet still met daily at 10.00 a.m. Various papers on post-war reconstruction issues were proposed to be prepared, but the Western Allies showed no sign that they might receive them. Otherwise much time was devoted to discussion of how far the symbols, medals and insignia of the Hitler regime should be retained within the Flensburg headquarters. = Nazi war crimes = Some acknowledgement of Nazi war crimes became unavoidable. The departure of the SS leadership from Flensburg opened the way for the Dönitz government to offer its own version of how the murder squads, concentration camps and killing facilities had come into being. Their response was that all these atrocities had been undertaken in secret, and entirely by Himmler and the SS. Dönitz and Jodl issued a joint public statement \\"that neither the German Wehrmacht nor the German people had knowledge of these things.\\" While this statement was mostly untrue, the consequent myth of the \\"good Wehrmacht\\" as having been deceived and betrayed by the \\"evil SS\\" was to achieve wide currency for decades in post-war Germany. = Allied perspectives = While it had been agreed amongst the Allies that the Flensburg government should be accorded no official recognition, Winston Churchill proved reluctant to toe the line. In his speech announcing victory to the British people on 8 May, Churchill specified that the surrender had been authorised by “Grand Admiral Dönitz, the designated Head of the German State”. Equally, following the unconditional surrender, Churchill was instrumental in urging that the Flensburg Government should not immediately be closed down, saying that he could see \\"great advantages in letting things slide for a bit\\". Churchill's attitude in this was conditioned by his concern that Soviet forces might seek to establish themselves in Denmark; and he saw the temporary continuation of the Flensburg government in territory under British control as establishing a bargaining counter for the British in any negotiations regarding Soviet intentions in the western Baltic, while also facilitating the disbanding of German forces. Conversely, Soviet statements consistently characterised the Flensburg government as an anti-Soviet clique, pursuing a truce in the west only to maintain resistance against Soviet forces in the east. On 20 May, the government of the USSR made it clear what it thought about the Flensburg Government. It attacked the Dönitz Administration, calling it the \\"Dönitz Gang\\" and harshly criticised any idea of allowing it to retain any power. Pravda said: General Eisenhower tended rather to agree with the Soviet position (if not the reasoning behind it), suspecting that Dönitz and his cabinet could be a front, while the real German leadership, perhaps including Himmler, Martin Bormann and Hitler himself (whose remains were not then known to have been identified), remained operating behind the scenes, or otherwise plotting for their concealment and escape. With ill-disguised reluctance Eisenhower agreed to defer to the British view for a short period, but issued a clarifying statement that the continuation of the Dönitz government did not constitute his being recognised as a head of state \\"but only and temporarily under the instructions of the Allied Commanders to carry out duties concerning the feeding, disarming and medical care of the German Armed Forces.\\" Three members of the Flensburg Government, General Alfred Jodl, Dr Albert Speer, and Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, after their arrest by the Allies. = Final dissolution of the Flensburg Government = On 12 May, American Major General Lowell W. Rooks and his British deputy, Brigadier E. J. Foord, arrived in Flensburg and established their quarters in the passenger ship Patria, docked in Flensburg harbour, displacing the administrative offices of the Flensburg government that had been housed there. Their mission was to liaise with the Dönitz \\"acting government\\" (as it was then referred to by the SHAEF) and to impose the will of the victorious Allied Powers on the German High Command. Although the liaison mission arranged meetings with members of the Flensburg government, these only confirmed that neither Dönitz nor his ministers had been able to establish any degree of civil authority. Churchill withdrew his protection once it became clear that the Soviet High Command would otherwise have to be represented in the liaison mission. On 21 May the SHAEF acceded to Soviet proposals that the Flensburg Government be dissolved and its members arrested as POWs. The dissolution was carried out on 23 May. On that day, a British officer went to Dönitz's headquarters and asked to speak to the members of the government. Dönitz, von Friedeburg and Jodl were then taken aboard the Patria, where Maj. Gen. Rooks informed them of the dissolution of the government; placing them under arrest, and ordering that they be stripped and searched for concealed phials of poison.Chapter XV: The Victory Sealed. Globalsecurity.org.26 May 1945 – High Command Arrested. Trove.nla.gov.au (26 May 1945). The communication regarding the dissolution of the acting government and the arrest of its members was made in a formal manner, around a table on Patrias deck: Dönitz, Jodl and Von Friedeburg sat on one side, with Major General Rooks, British Navy Captain Mund and Soviet General Trusov on the other. Brigadier Foord remained standing, next to Maj. Gen. Rooks, and an official interpreter was also present at the proceedings, that were photographed. By the time Dönitz emerged from the ship, the town's main street was filled with British tanks and troops rounding up the Germans. Faced with the prospect of being strip-searched, von Friedeburg committed suicide, while Dönitz, Speer, Jodl and other members of the dissolved Flensburg Government were taken prisoner, under the responsibility of a RAF Regiment task force commanded by Squadron Leader Mark Hobden. The prisoners were later handed over to the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. Some Flensburg Government POWs such as Albert Speer were subsequently moved to the British POW camp Dustbin in Castle Kransberg, while others, including Dönitz, were transferred to the American-led Camp Ashcan. Later, all Camp Ashcan prisoners were moved to Nuremberg to stand trial. = Berlin Declaration: 5 June 1945 = Albert Speer (left), Karl Dönitz (center) and Alfred Jodl (right) after their arrest. With the arrest of the Flensburg Government on 23 May 1945, the German High Command also ceased to exist, with no central authority having been kept in place to govern Germany even in a nominal capacity, or to assume responsibility for complying with the demands and instructions of the victorious nations. This power vacuum continued for almost two weeks until 5 June 1945, when the representatives of the Allies signed the Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany and the Assumption of Supreme Authority by Allied Powers, also known as the Berlin Declaration. The Sport school in Mürwik, on the edge of the Naval Academy Mürwik, the seat of the Flensburg Government. The Nazi-era Reichsadler is still present to this day, but with the swastika removed. The declaration, issued in Berlin at 18:00 on 5 June 1945, and signed by General Eisenhower on behalf of the United States, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery on behalf of the United Kingdom, Marshal Georgiy Zhukov on behalf of the Soviet Union, and by General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny on behalf of the French Provisional Government, contained the following statement: Therefore, from 5 June 1945, Germany did not possess a native government; complete authority and sovereignty being thereafter assumed by the Allied Military Occupation Government. The contention of the Allied Powers that the German state ceased to exist as of 5 June 1945 was then generally accepted, but came subsequently to be challenged in legal and political debate. In any event, the Berlin Declaration maintained the continued existence of Germany as a national territory, implying the continuation of a German nation. During the initial stage of the occupation of Germany, supreme authority was discharged by the Four Powers jointly for all occupation zones via the Allied Control Council, so that this council was the immediate successor of the Dönitz Administration in the Government of Germany.

Gitarama Prefecture was created in 1959, increasing the number of prefectures of Rwanda from eight to nine. In 2002, it was renamed a province, as were the other prefectures of Rwanda. It had an area of 2,187 square kilometres and a population of some 851,451 (2002 figures) prior to its dissolution in January 2006. Gitarama was divided into 8 districts: Muhanga, Kayumbu, Kabagali, Ntenyo, Kamonyi, Ntongwe, Ndiza and Ruyumba; and two towns: Ruhango and Gitarama. Gitarama bordered the provinces Butare, Gikongoro, Kibuye, Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, Kigali- Ngali and Kigali City Tourist attractions included the Kamegeri rocks and the Busaga forest.  Rwandan genocide  On 16 April, leaders of the Rwandan genocide began to move against their local opposition. Up to this point, key military officers, and prefects had opposed the outbreak of genocidal violence; some were killed, while others eventually yielded under political pressure and threats of violence. On 16 April several key figures were taken down including Marcel Gatsinzi, Army Chief of Staff of the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR). Gatzini was promoted to general, along with Léonidas Rusatira, while Augustin Bizimungu took over as Army Chief of Staff; but not all opposition leaders lost their positions on 16 April. The prefect of Gitarama, Fidele Uwizeye, was one of those who managed to hold on to his position. According to a 1999 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, when the genocide began, many members of the Republican Democratic Movement (, MDR) had initially refused to participate. They saw the genocide as a power grab by rival political factions National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (, MRND) and Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (, CDR). Because the MDR refused to join the genocide, the MRND and CDR forces crossed the prefectural boundary of Gitarama as the violence spread outward from Kigali. Joseph Setiba led the Interahamwe militia, in attacks against the Taba commune and Runda. As militia members from the provinces of Kibuye, Gisenyi, and Ruhengeri also began to enter Gitarama, the people of the province attempted to repel them by force. Both Hutus and Tutsis, under Uwizeye's leadership, participated in the defense of Gitarama. The ranks of the militia continued to swell as the interim government relocated moved its base of operations from Kigali to Gitarama. According to HRW, Callixte Nzabonimana, who was affiliated with MRND and local to Gitarama, publicly admonished the of Rutobwe for refusing to participate in the genocide by publicly slapping him. One former from Nyamabuye testified before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda that the Presidential Guard and Interhamwe had swept through Gitarama \\"teaching the ideology of killing, of massacres. They incited the population to hate the local authority by saying that those who did not kill the Tutsi were accomplices of the Inkotanyi.\\" (Inkotanyi is a pejorative word used by some Hutu as a slur for Tutsi people.) On 18 April, a meeting was called by Uwizeye for the local leaders, which was reportedly also attended by members of the interim government including Nzabonimana, André Rwamakuba, Straton Nsabumukunzi, Eliézer Niyitegeka, Jean de Dieu Habineza and Justin Mugenzi. Jean Paul Akayesu, the of Taba, also attended this meeting. Taken from \\"Killing Neighbors\\" by Lee Ann Fujii: The Gitarama region was the founding place of Grégoire Kayibanda's Parmehutu, the party founded by Rwanda's first president. This region and the political elites involved, were also the source of much tension between the capital province of Kigali in the north, and the central and south province of Gitarama. This tension eventually played a role in the conflicts behind the Rwandan genocide.

SS20, codename Kodiak) is a discontinued Sun Microsystems workstation based on the SuperSPARC or hyperSPARC CPU. It is the last model in the SPARCstation family of Sun \\"pizza box\\" computers, which was superseded by the UltraSPARC design in 1995. Specifications =CPU support= SM71 SPARCstation MBus CPU Module The SPARCstation 20 has dual 50 MHz MBus ports that allow it to use faster CPUs than the SPARCstation 10. With two dual-CPU modules and updated firmware, the SPARCstation 20 supports a maximum of 4 CPUs. The fastest CPU produced for the SPARCstation 20 is the 200 MHz Ross hyperSPARC. The PROM in the SPARCstation 20 determines CPU compatibility. Version 2.25r is the last PROM release for the SPARCstation 20. =Memory= The SPARCstation 20 has 8 200-pin DSIMM slots, and supports a maximum of 512 MB of memory with 64 MB modules. Memory modules for the SPARCstation 20 are compatible with the SPARCstation 10, Sun Ultra 1, and some other computers in the sun4m and sun4u families, but they are physically incompatible with the SIMM slots found in PC computers. 2 of the 8 SIMM slots are wider than the others and can be used with non-memory peripherals like caching NVSIMM and video VSIMM cards. = Disk drives = SPARCstation 20 SCSI cradle with drive The SPARCstation 20 has two internal SCA bays, an external SCSI connector, and two bays for CD-ROM or floppy drives. Earlier revisions of the SPARCstation20 case contain a CD-ROM and floppy bays that are slightly shorter than a standard 3.5\\" bay and regular devices intended for PC compatible computers do not usually fit. Later revisions of the SPARCstation20 and SPARCstation5 have a narrower slot for the floppy drive so a more-standard CD-ROM can fit. The SCSI host controller is integrated with the motherboard. The SPARCstation 20 does not support IDE devices. A limitation in all releases of the OpenBoot PROM for the SPARCstation 20 prevents it from booting from a point on a disk past the 2 gigabyte mark. =Network= The SPARCstation 20 has one integrated AMD Lance 10baseT Ethernet interface. Additional Ethernet interfaces can be added with an SBus card. =Graphics= The SPARCstation 20 has a built in 13W3 video socket driven by an optional SX (CG14) framebuffer built onto a VSIMM. The VSIMM is available in 4MB or 8MB capacity, capable of up to 1280x1024 (8MB) or 1152x900 (4MB) in 24-bit color. If two VSIMMs are installed an auxiliary video board must also be installed to provide a second 13W3 video socket. Alternatively, SBus cards can be used, including the ZX (Leo), Turbo GX (CG6) and others. =Sound= The SPARCstation 20 has integrated sound with 4 standard 3.5 mm audio jacks for headphones, microphone, line in, and line out. NVRAM The SPARCstation 20 uses a battery-backed NVRAM module to hold data about the system, such as the host ID (serial number) and MAC address. If the battery on the chip dies, then the NVRAM module must be replaced (or modified to use an external battery), and the NVRAM must be reprogrammed with a MAC address and host ID. Optionally a M48T08-100PC1 can be used.http://www.obsolyte.com/sunFAQ/faq_nvram.htmlhttp://blog.bhargavaz.us/2010/12/idprom- nvram-battery-replacement-page.html Operating systems SunOS 4.1.3_U1B onwards, Solaris 2.3 to 9, Linux (Debian, Gentoo, SuSE 7.0 - 7.3, probably others), MirOS BSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD run on the SPARCstation 20. On certain CPU modules (Sun SuperSPARC only), NeXTSTEP 3.3 and OPENSTEP 4.x also run. Notable uses * 117 SPARCstation 20 Model HS11 units, 87 with two 100 MHz hyperSPARC processors and 30 with four 100 MHz hyperSPARC processors, plus a single octo-processor SPARCserver 1000 were used to render Toy Story.

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a semi-symmetric graph is an undirected graph that is edge-transitive and regular, but not vertex-transitive. In other words, a graph is semi-symmetric if each vertex has the same number of incident edges, and there is a symmetry taking any of the graph's edges to any other of its edges, but there is some pair of vertices such that no symmetry maps the first into the second. Properties A semi-symmetric graph must be bipartite, and its automorphism group must act transitively on each of the two vertex sets of the bipartition (in fact, regularity is not required for this property to hold). For instance, in the diagram of the Folkman graph shown here, green vertices can not be mapped to red ones by any automorphism, but every two vertices of the same color are symmetric with each other. History Semi- symmetric graphs were first studied E. Dauber, a student of F. Harary, in a paper, no longer available, titled \\"On line- but not point-symmetric graphs\\". This was seen by Jon Folkman, whose paper, published in 1967, includes the smallest semi-symmetric graph, now known as the Folkman graph, on 20 vertices.. The term \\"semi-symmetric\\" was first used by Klin et al. in a paper they published in 1978. Cubic graphs The smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph (that is, one in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges) is the Gray graph on 54 vertices. It was first observed to be semi-symmetric by . It was proven to be the smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph by Dragan Marušič and Aleksander Malnič.. All the cubic semi-symmetric graphs on up to 768 vertices are known. According to Conder, Malnič, Marušič and Potočnik, the four smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graphs after the Gray graph are the Iofinova-Ivanov graph on 110 vertices, the Ljubljana graph on 112 vertices,. a graph on 120 vertices with girth 8 and the Tutte 12-cage..

NatureServe reports being \\"headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, with regional offices in four U.S. locations and in Canada.\\" In calendar year 2011 they reported having 86 employees, 6 volunteers, and 15 independent officers. History The Nature Conservancy reports that in 2000 it spun off its 85-center Natural Heritage Network \\"into a new independent organization, the Association for Biodiversity Information (later renamed NatureServe).\\" NatureServe reports that it was established in 1994 as the Association for Biodiversity Information. In 2001 the IRS approved a name change to NatureServe that was requested in 1999, while maintaining the organization's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status granted in July 1995. NatureServe's website declares that it is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, tax-exempt corporation incorporated in 1999 as a Washington, DC Nonprofit Corporation. Programs NatureServe's programs focus on four main areas: * Documenting the conservation status and location of species and ecosystems * Producing analyses to guide conservation planning * Developing software tools to guide conservation planning * Managing natural heritage programs and conservation data centers NatureServe partners with IUCN Red List, the accepted standard for worldwide imperiled species classification, providing coordination assistance and data from their own assessments to the IUCN's conservation assessments, and working together on ongoing assessments. NatureServe Explorer is a web-based database provides public access to NatureServe's proprietary information on US and Canadian ecosystems and plant, animal, and fungus species. This includes ranked NatureServe conservation status assessment data on state, national, and global levels, considered a leading classification of imperiled species in the United States. Infonatura is a nearly identical service providing information on Latin American wildlife and ecosystems. NatureServe maintains the National Vegetation Classification Standard for the United States as well as the International Classification of Ecological Communities, currently focused on the Western Hemisphere. LandScope America (landscope.org) is an online resource bringing together diverse conservation- related data to assist in land and water use planning. It's a collaborative program from NatureServe and the National Geographic Society. The NatureServe network The natural heritage network now supported by NatureServe, began in 1974 with the creation of the South Carolina Heritage Trust. After working with Patrick Noonan, president of The Nature Conservancy (TNC), to arrange the donation of the Santee Coastal Reserve, Joseph Hudson, chairman of South Carolina’s Wildlife and Marine Resources Department, wanted to identify other preservation-worthy lands in the state. He provided TNC with initial funding to amass information that could inform conservation and land- use decision-making while accounting for impacts on biodiversity. While establishing that first program, TNC chief scientist Robert Jenkins, Jr., chose to focus on biological features in need of conservation, and to use this information to suggest priority sites for protection. Targeted features included both species and natural communities, or elements of natural diversity. Programs in West Virginia, Mississippi, and Oregon followed in 1975. By 1976, TNC had developed a model for expanding the emerging state network: go to the states and offer to hire and train a staff of biologists, establish an operating center, and, two years later, let the state take over operations. By 1993, the U.S. network consisted of organizations in all fifty states. Programs were formed in Latin American countries in 1982, and the Canadian programs first established in 1988 now extend to all provinces and Yukon Territory. By the early 1990s, a group of natural heritage program directors began to develop network-wide information products. This effort led to the establishment of an independent nonprofit organization devoted to promoting the products and services of the network. Incorporated in 1994 as the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI), this membership organization created the framework for network-wide coordination. In 1999, TNC’s natural heritage network and ABI formally joined forces, with the Conservancy transferring its databases, professional staff, and scientific standards and methodology to ABI. In 2001, having grown into its present form, this new, independent nonprofit became known as NatureServe. Financial information NatureServe Inc.'s 2011 IRS Form 990 lists total revenue of $8,680,216 and total expenses of $8,892,007. The corporation's fiscal year 2011 audited financial statement says that \\"the accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\\" It reports \\"total revenue, gains, and other support\\" of $9,499,301, and \\"total expenses\\" of $8,913,138. $7,932,133 of revenue came from grants and contracts, including a sizable portion in federal awards for mapping services, wildlife assessments, and other products and services. It also reports $186,290 in revenue from general contributions, $56,470 in revenue from membership dues, and $216,062 in fundraising expenses. Some major contributions are made in the form of grants for specific projects. The MacArthur Foundation reported that they awarded $1,191,500 in grants to NatureServe between 2003 and 2013, and NatureServe announced that the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation awarded two grants totaling nearly $800,000 in 2005. Between 2004 and 2009, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation donated $6.63 million, the Nature Conservency donated $3.43 million, the Knoblock Family Foundation donated $2.38 million, and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation donated $1.21 million.

The date of his birth is unknown. Chaka was the son of the Mongol leader Nogai Khan by a wife named Alaka. Sometime after 1285 Chaka married a daughter of George Terter I of Bulgaria, named Elena. In the late 1290s, Chaka supported his father Nogai in a war against the legitimate khan of the Golden Horde Toqta, but Toqta was victorious and defeated and killed Nogai in 1299. At about the same time Chaka had led his supporters into Bulgaria, intimidated the regency for Ivan II into fleeing the capital, and imposed himself as ruler in Tărnovo in 1299. It is not completely certain whether he reigned as Emperor of Bulgaria or simply acted as the overlord of his brother-in-law Theodore Svetoslav. He is accepted as a ruler of Bulgaria by Bulgarian historiography. Chaka did not long enjoy his new position of power, as the armies of Toqta followed him into Bulgaria and besieged Tărnovo. Theodore Svetoslav, who had been instrumental in assisting Chaka's seizure of power, organized a plot in which Chaka was deposed and strangled in prison in 1300. His head was sent to Toqta, which in turn secured Theodore Svetoslav's position as the new emperor of Bulgaria. It seems that Theodore Svetoslav's cooperation contributed to the withdrawal of Mongol interference in Bulgaria. Family It is not known if Chaka had children from Elena, daughter of George I of Bulgaria. He had at least one son, born probably by a concubine: # Kara Küçük, who led a fragment of the Nogai Horde until after 1301.

Made of gold and enamelled in red and green during the reign of King Rama I in 1782, the crown is 66 centimeters (26 inches) high and weighs 7.3 kg (16 pounds). In the reign of King Rama IV, a set of diamonds was added to the crown. Also added was a large cut diamond from India to decorate the top of the crown, called the Great Diamond (พระมหาวิเชียรมณี Phra Maha Wichian Mani). The crown is of a distinctive Thai design, being a multi-tiered conical diadem, terminating in a tapering spire. The crown is worn only when a king is crowned. He places the crown on his own head. The shape of the crown represents the concept of divine monarchy. The tall spire signifies divine authority and the right to rule over his subjects. The Great Crown of Victory is the most important of the five regalia of Thailand, yet at one time the crown was accorded the same importance as the other regalia.

They were active between 1994 and 2016 and recorded eleven studio albums, four live albums and two EPs. History Formed in 1994, Richmond Fontaine started touring the Pacific Northwest live circuit to support their first three albums released on Cavity Search Records. Gradually gaining attention in the UK and Europe the band began regularly touring there. Most of the core musicians and producer J. D. Foster have worked together for a decade, and produced several albums. The band is named after an American expat, \\"a burned out hippy\\", that had helped bassist Dave Harding when his car was stuck in the desert in the Baja California Peninsula. Richmond Fontaine first gained exposure outside the United State through a song that was included on a Vinyl Junkie Records 'Loose' compilation released in the UK. This was followed by the band's self-released fourth album, Winnemucca. The band signed with Decor Records in Europe during 2003 with their next two releases proving pivotal to the band's success. Both were made \\"Albums of the Month\\" in influential magazine, Uncut, which named both their fifth album Post to Wire (2004) and sixth The Fitzgerald (2005) \\"masterpieces\\". U.S. critics have been generally complimentary but have also cited the band's musical similarity to Uncle Tupelo. Underpinned by lead singer and songwriter Willy Vlautin's lyrics, Richmond Fontaine songs often evoke imagery of Reno, Nevada, Portland, the Western United States, and Mexico, while telling stories in a style that critics have compared to Raymond Carver.[ allmusic ((( Miles From > Overview )))] The group has cited influences such as Gram Parsons, X, Green on Red and Dave Alvin. Vlautin is also a published writer. His first novel, The Motel Life was published in 2006, followed by Northline in 2008 and Lean on Pete in 2010. Northline included a soundtrack CD by Willy Vlautin and Paul Brainard. The novel was well-reviewed by George Pelecanos. Vlautin has also had stories published in literary journals such as Zembla, Cold Drill, Southeast Review, and Chiron Review. The band's 2007 album, Thirteen Cities, received positive reviews across Europe. On August 17, 2009 the band released their ninth studio album, We Used to Think the Freeway Sounded Like a River. In September 2011, the band released their tenth studio album, The High Country. In March 2016, the band released their final album, You Can't Go Back If There's Nothing To Go Back To.

Written in Sesotho, it is a mythic fictional retelling of the story of the rise and fall of the Zulu emperor-king Shaka. Publication history Chaka was written in three years, from 1907 to 1910. To gather material for his novel, Thomas Mofolo made several trips to the South African province of Natal, including one in 1909 where he visited the grave of Shaka. The original Sotho manuscript was first submitted in 1910 to the Morija Sesuto Book Depot supported by the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society (PEMS), but was only published in 1925. The delay in publication was due to the publishers' being \\"disturbed by Mofolo's failure to condemn pagan tribal customs\\"; this led to a disheartened Mofolo's retirement from writing. According to translator Daniel P. Kunene, who translated Chaka from Sesotho to English, at least two chapters revolving around the traditions and history of the Zulu people were omitted from the published version of the novel. Chaka was first translated into English in around 1931, while the earliest French and German translations were published in 1940 and 1953 respectively; an Afrikaans translation was published in 1974. Reception The novel received a polarised reception initially, with some readers accusing the author of being anti-Christian, in contrast to others who felt that Chaka was \\"deeply Christian in inspiration and intent\\". Nonetheless, Chaka became a local and international bestseller. Moreover, especially since the publication of Mazisi Kunene's English translation of Chaka, the novel has become increasingly appreciated for its literary value. In a review for English in Africa, Neil Lazarus described Chaka as an \\"extraordinary and enigmatic work of literature ... demanding the close attention of all scholars of African literature.\\" In February 2002, Chaka was named one of the twelve best works of African literature of the 20th century by a panel organised by Ali Mazrui as part of the Zimbabwe International Book Fair.

An inscription above the porch dates the building to 1585. The mansion is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, first listed on 25 February 1952. History Slade, known anciently as Milkwall Slade, was an estate made up of in Rusholme and in Gorton, both in Manchester, England. From about the mid-13th century until the reign of Elizabeth I, it was held by a family who adopted Slade as their surname. They sold the estate to the Siddall family, who in 1583 began construction of Slade Hall. Work was completed by 1585, as evidenced by an inscription on a beam over the porch, which also has the initials of the builder, E. S., for Edward Siddall. The Siddals and their descendants occupied the house for the next 300 years. Slade Hall was offered for sale at auction in 2002, and was bought by property developer Mel Evans for £527,000. The hall was converted into flats, and as of 2017 is divided into shared accommodation for 14 residents. It is also the registered office of the Partington Housing Association. Description Slade Hall is an Elizabethan timber-framed house on a stone base, built to a hall and cross-wing plan. There are some brick extensions to the rear, a slate roof, and a 19th-century wing added to the right of the original. It is of two storeys, the upper one jettied. The stud- and-rail timber frame has zig-zag herring-bone bracing between the constructional timbers. A porch in the angle between the main gable and the southern wing has painted lozenges resembling quatrefoils. The main hall has two first-floor four-light wooden mullioned casements; the range to the left has a restored fourteen-light mullion and transom window, with a three-light window immediately to its right. The range of the cross-wing on the right has ten-light mullion and transom windows at the ground floor and twelve-lights at the first floor. The interior has some exposed timber work showing the house's original construction. Plaster friezes are still visible in the first-floor chamber above the hall, described by architectural historian Norman Redhead as crude 16th-century stuff. They depict mainly heraldic motifs, including the Elizabethan coat of arms and the Siddall family's crest, but also an \\"entertaining\\" hunting scene.

Mitchell Jr. (born September 2, 1963) is a former professional basketball player and coach. Playing at small forward, Mitchell's 18-year professional basketball career spanned three decades, and was most notable for his ten seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves (NBA), whom he also coached as an interim for the 2015-16 season. Mitchell coached for the Toronto Raptors 2004 to 2008 as well, winning Coach of the Year Award in 2007. Mitchell has since worked as an analyst for TSN, NBA TV, and works as a talk show co- host/analyst on SiriusXM NBA Radio. Early years Mitchell graduated from Columbus High School in 1981. He spent the next four years playing college basketball at Mercer University (1981–85), and scored nearly 2,000 points, becoming the leading scorer in Bears history. He led the team to both the regular-season and postseason Trans-American Atlantic Conference championships in 1985. Averaging 25 points and 8.2 rebounds per game as a senior, Mitchell led the Bears to just their second NCAA tournament in team history in 1985; they would not return for nearly 30 years, until the 2014 tournament. Mitchell had enlisted in the Army during his junior year, and at the conclusion of the 1985 NCAA tournament he went to boot camp at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He left one month later when he was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the 7th pick of the 3rd round (54th overall) in the 1985 NBA draft. However he was cut during final cuts and joined the Wisconsin Flyers of the Continental Basketball Association. Unhappy in the CBA, Mitchell quit the team midway through the season to return home to Georgia, where a former professor hired him a Special Education teacher for the remainder of the school year. With his summer off, he tried out for the U.S. Basketball League, and joined the Tampa Bay Flash, who he helped lead to the league title. He rejoined the Rockets for training camp afterwards, but was once again cut and joined the CBA, splitting the season between the Wisconsin Flyers and Rapid City Thrillers. He then joined the French LNB Pro A team of Montpellier Basket (coached by Pierre Galle) for the end of the 1987–88 and the whole 1988–89 season. Success overseas led to a renewed interest from the NBA, and Mitchell earned a contract with the newly formed Minnesota Timberwolves. He spent three years in Minnesota, before being traded to the Indiana Pacers. While having a smaller role with the Pacers than he did with the Timberwolves, Mitchell did help Indiana reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 1994-95. Following that season, he returned to the Minnesota. Kevin Garnett was drafted by the Timberwolves out of high school that year, and Mitchell has been credited with helping Garnett's development. Mitchell retired from the league following the 2001-02 season. Coaching career Mitchell returned to the NBA almost immediately after his retirement as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks for two seasons until 2004. He then briefly became a part of the expansion Charlotte Bobcats as their top assistant coach, until moving on to the Toronto Raptors when he was named as the sixth head coach in Raptors history after incumbent Kevin O'Neill was fired. Mitchell was named the coach of the month in January 2007 for his effort bringing the Toronto Raptors back to .500 and leading the Atlantic Division. On March 30, 2007, Mitchell got his 100th win as NBA coach when the Raptors defeated the Washington Wizards at the Verizon Center.Feschuck, Dave, \\"Mitchell turns millstone into personal milestone\\", thestar.com, April 1, 2007, accessed April 1, 2007. Mitchell, who witnessed his team struggle with rebuilding in his first years as coach, also led the Toronto Raptors to their first division title in franchise history as the team won the Atlantic Division in the NBA's Eastern Conference in the 2006–07 season. On April 24, 2007, he was named 2006–07 NBA Coach of the Year.\\"Sam Mitchell Named 2006-07 Coach of the Year\\", nba.com/raptors, April 24, 2007, accessed April 24, 2007.

On November 25, 2007 Mitchell surpassed Lenny Wilkens for the most wins in team history. Mitchell was the longest reigning head coach of the Toronto Raptors. On December 3, 2008, after leading the Raptors to a disappointing 8–9 start to the 2008–09 season, Mitchell was relieved of his duties as the team's head coach. Assistant coach Jay Triano took over the position of interim head coach of the Raptors, which later made him the first foreign-born player to coach a team in the NBA.Mitchell Fired, The Fan 590, December 3, 2008, accessed December 3, 2008. The firing was ridiculed by the TNT Overtime crew because the Raptors were only one game under .500 at the time of the firing. Chris Webber predicted that they would not be \\"as good under another coach.\\"Dismissal of Sam Mitchell, TNT Overtime crew, Accessed March 11, 2009. In fact, the Raptors went 25–40 the rest of the season. Mitchell was hired as an assistant coach by the New Jersey Nets on July 19, 2010. On December 6, 2011, Nets hired P.J. Carlesimo and Mario Elie as new assistant coaches and Mitchell was reassigned to a scouting position. On 2012, Sam Mitchell named head coach of USA select to 2012 William Jones Cup in Taiwan and his team finished bronze medal. On June 16, 2014, Mitchell was hired as an assistant coach by the Minnesota Timberwolves. On September 11, 2015, Mitchell became the Timberwolves' interim head coach after Flip Saunders had to take a leave of absence to receive treatment after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. On October 25, 2015, Saunders died at age 60. For the rest of the season, Mitchell became the official head coach, although he would still be treated as an interim coach. During his sole season coaching the Timberwolves, he would coach them to the fifth-worst record in the league with a 29–53 record. On April 13, 2016, Mitchell was relieved of his interim head coaching duties as the coach of the Timberwolves after the last game of the season, allowing them to look for a permanent coach. He would then be replaced by former Chicago Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau. On June 13, 2018, Mitchell was hired by the University of Memphis as assistant coach under Penny Hardaway.

The exhibits present a concise history and explanation of electricity and electromagnetism. Exhibits Unique in the world, the Bakken's collection is devoted to inspiring a passion for innovation by exploring the potential for science, technology, and the humanities to make the world a better place. Approximately 11,000 written works and about 2,000 scientific instruments are stored there, some specifically for electrophysiology and electrotherapeutics. The Bakken's former director David Rhees once identified the most significant holdings as works by Jean Antoine Nollet, Benjamin Franklin, Giovanni Battista Beccaria, Luigi Galvani, Giovanni Aldini, Alessandro Volta, Guillame Benjamin Amand Duchenne, and Emil Heinrich Du Bois-Reymond and the journals Annalen der Physik, the Philosophical Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society and Zeitschrift für Physik.

Exhibits include: Frankenstein’s Laboratory is an immersive object theater, featuring Frankenstein’s monster. The 12-minute show brings to life the tale of a mad scientist haunted by his creation. Deep Roots: Plants as Medicine fosters reflection and encourages lively discussion as it delves into modern preconceptions about the relationship between plants and wellness. Ben Franklin’s Electricity Party allows visitors to try out electric party tricks similar to those conducted by Ben Franklin and other scientists during electricity parties in the 1700s. Mary and Her Monster See Mary Shelley’s magic bookcase filled with artifacts and books from The Bakken collection, solve the puzzle of Frankenstein’s story illustrated by artist Zak Sally, and meet a living portrait of Mary that allows visitors to hear about the people, science, art and culture that inspired her. The Florence Bakken Medicinal Garden and a statue of Hermes or Mercury, the messenger god of ancient Greece and Rome, are focal points of the grounds. A newspaper reporter once said the venue, \\"seems a throwback to another time when skilled craftsmen shaped stone, wood and glass into places with lasting appeal\\". History Inventor Earl Bakken, co-founder of Medtronic The Bakken was founded by inventor Earl Bakken who was enamored with a movie version of Mary Shelley's work Frankenstein at a young age and grew up to build the first portable and implantable cardiac pacemakers. With his brother-in-law Palmer Hermundslie, Bakken founded the medical technology company Medtronic in 1949. Today the company produces cardiac rhythm, neuromodulation, spinal, biologic, diabetes, ear nose and throat and cardiovascular products and physio-controllers. At Bakken's suggestion in 1969, Dennis Stillings who at the time worked for Medtronic in its library, began to acquire books and devices. By 1974 the collection was well known among antiquarians and was offered two lots of early electrical devices. At first stored at the Medtronic headquarters in Saint Anthony Village, Minnesota, the collection by 1975 occupied a floor in the Medtronic branch office in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota and in 1976 began to be moved to its present location. Formerly funded by the museum, the Bakken Quartet performed chamber music on the premises. Today the group is named the Bakken Trio and performs in Saint Paul, Minnesota. and From 1992 to 2015, The Bakken was led by Dr. David Rhees. Upon Dr. Rhees' retirement in 2015, the museum hired museum professional Michael Sanders to be its new Executive Director. Facility Construction of the museum expansion - August 1997. Architect Carl A. Gage constructed the building between 1928 and 1930 as the home of William Goodfellow who is said to have wished to impress a female friend. Goodfellow is remembered as the party who sold his dry goods store in 1904 to George Dayton, founder of today's Target Corporation. A combination of 16th century English styles including Tudor and Gothic Revival, the home was named \\"West Winds\\" and contains \\"dark wood interior paneling, open-beamed ceilings, grouped and arched windows and stained glass\\". The original home had fifteen rooms and eleven bathrooms. When he died in 1944, Goodfellow donated the buildings to the Girl Scouts. The family of Richard Cornelius lived there between 1953 and 1976, after which the house became the Bakken museum. In 1999 the museum completed an expansion that doubled its size from to . A underground vault built in 1981 protects the collection with a constant temperature of and 55 percent relative humidity.

Rules The entire deck must be dealt into twelve piles of cards. Any arrangement will do, but for convenience, two rows of six piles each will be formed. During dealing, one ace and one king of each suit is removed, all of which will form the foundations. The aces are built up while the kings are built down, all by suit. During the process of dealing the twelve piles, cards that can be built on a foundation must be built. Also, none of the twelve piles should be left out, i.e. when a card is immediately built on a foundation, the next card is dealt on the pile the previous card left. No building is done during the process of dealing until all cards are dealt. Afterwards, the top cards of each pile are built on the foundations or on each other's piles. The cards on the piles are built on each other either up or down by suit. Building can go in both directions, but a king cannot be placed over an ace and vice versa. Only one card can be moved at a time, and any empty pile can be filled with any card. After the player has made all the moves he can make, the piles are collected in the reverse order the piles are dealt and the process is repeated. This redeal can be done twice in the game. The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations.

It stood at a height of 509 m, at the entrance to the magnificent gorge of the Tamina, about 5 km up which by carriage road were the extraordinarily placed Baths of Pfafers (674 m). Since 1840 the hot mineral waters of Pfäfers were conducted in pipes to Ragatz, which is in a more pleasant position. Consequently Ragatz much increased in importance since that date. In the churchyard is the grave of the philosopher Friedrich Schelling (d. here in 1854). About 3 km by road above Ragatz are the 17th- century buildings of the great Benedictine monastery, Pfäfers Abbey, to which all this region belonged until 1798; midway between them and Ragatz are the ruins of the 14th-century castle of Wartenstein. The monastery and baths were, after 1969, converted into museums and are open to the public. Johanna Spyri's classic book Heidi is shortly set in Ragatz.

Children who were eligible were provided with free or subsidised places to fee-paying independent schools - based on the child's results in the school's entrance examination (the fees contributions charged were based on an annual means test). The first school to introduce the scheme was Clifton College in Bristol, and the first pupils started in 1981. The numbers of places offered at each school varied considerably, public schools Charterhouse and Stowe School with under 2% of pupils on roll to Batley Grammar School and the newly independent Wisbech Grammar School, (one of the oldest schools in England), with about half of their annual intake as assisted places. By 1985, the scheme catered for some 6,000 students per year. The scheme, to a degree, replicated the effect of the direct grant grammar schools which had operated between 1945 and 1976. Between 1981 and 1997 an estimated 80,000 children participated in the scheme, costing a total of just over £800 million. In 1981, 4,185 pupils gained assisted places. By 1997 there were some 34,000 pupils and 355 schools in the scheme. Arguing the practice to be elitist and wasteful of public funds, the Labour government of Tony Blair, upon its election in 1997, abolished the Assisted Places Scheme. The government announced that the funds were instead to be used to reduce class sizes in state nursery schools. However, children already in receipt of an assisted place were allowed to complete the remainder of that phase of their education. Some argue that the result of abolition has been to reduce the social range of pupils educated at independent schools. Others point out that \\"fewer than 10 per cent of the selected children had fathers who were manual workers, compared with 50 per cent in service-class occupations such as teaching, and that although children from single-parent families made up the largest category, other disadvantaged groups, notably the unemployed, and black and Asian families, had poor representation.\\"  Legacy  Some independent schools, many of which have charitable status, have taken steps to provide their own funding for pupils from poorer backgrounds through their own Assisted Places schemes often referred to as bursaries. A number of studies have looked at the legacy of the Assisted Places Scheme. These include a Sutton Trust report. .

He currently serves as an assistant coach for the Ukraine national team. After making his Serie A debut with Lazio, he went on to play with Milan for 17 years. He won 17 major titles with Milan, including five Serie A championships and three UEFA Champions League tournaments, reaching five finals in total. He is mostly remembered for his role alongside Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta, Filippo Galli and Christian Panucci in the Milan backline under managers Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello, forming what is considered by many in the sport to be one of the greatest defensive lineups of all-time. An Italian international in the early 1990s, Tassotti only came into the national side under Sacchi, when he was already in his 30s, helping Italy to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Tassotti would go on to represent his nation at the final tournament, winning a runners-up medal, although he was banned for the latter half of the tournament. Prior to his Italy senior career, he had previously also represented Italy at under-21 level, and participated at the 1988 Olympics with the under-23 team, finishing in fourth place. After retiring in 1997, Tassotti remained connected to Milan in several positions: he worked as a youth coach, as an assistant manager, as a caretaker manager and subsequently as a talent scout, until he left the club in 2016 to join the Ukrainian national side as an assistant coach. Club career Born in Rome, Tassotti played his first professional season with local club Lazio in 1978–79, where he soon became a first team member the following season, making his Serie A debut on 5 November 1978. During his two seasons with Lazio, he made 41 appearances in Serie A and 47 in all competitions. Mauro Tassotti with Milan during the 1983–84 season. Following Lazio's and Milan's relegation to Serie B due to their involvement in the 1980 match-fixing scandal, he was called upon by the Milanese squad and transferred to the side, becoming a first-team member alongside captain and defender Franco Baresi, as well as Filippo Galli, during a dark period in Milan's footballing history, under manager Nils Liedholm. He made his Milan debut on 24 August 1980, in Serie B, in a 1–0 home win over Catania. Milan won the Serie B title that season to return to Serie A, with Tassotti emerging as one of the club's best performers. Despite winning the Mitropa Cup the following season, Milan were unable to remain in Serie A, finishing third last, and were relegated once again to Serie B. Milan were able to win Serie B again the following season to return to Serie A. Although this was a fairly bleak period in the club's history, as they failed to dominate in the league or capture a trophy, the squad did reach the Coppa Italia final during the 1984–85 season, and were able to regularly qualify for the European competitions, frequently finishing in the top half of the table. Tassotti became a central figure in the Milan squad of the late 1980s and early 1990s under Arrigo Sacchi, and subsequently Fabio Capello, usually wearing the number 2 shirt. Tassotti was a key component of a strong defence alongside Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta, playing predominantly as a right-back and on occasion as a centre-back, in front of goalkeepers Giovanni Galli, and subsequently Sebastiano Rossi. The back four of the Milan side of this period is regarded as one of the greatest of all-time. Under Sacchi, Tassotti was named vice- captain after Baresi, and he won the 1987–88 Serie A title, followed by the Supercoppa Italiana, and consecutive European Cup titles, in 1989, and 1990. In addition, Tassotti won two Intercontinental Cups (1989, 1990) and two UEFA Super Cups (1989, 1990), also reaching the 1989–90 Coppa Italia final. During the 1987–88 season, Tassotti helped Milan to only concede 14 goals in Serie A, finishing the year with the best defence. Under Capello, Tassotti would go on to reach three consecutive Champions League finals with Milan, winning the Champions League in 1994 as captain, due to the absence of Franco Baresi, and also reaching the final in 1993 and 1995.Mauro Tassotti; UEFA.com, 10 July 2003 He also won three consecutive Serie A titles with the club in the 1991–92, 1992–93 and the 1993–94 seasons, adding another during the 1995–96 season, in addition to the 1994 UEFA Super Cup and three consecutive Supercoppa Italiana titles between 1992 and 1994. In the 1991–92 season, Milan won the title unbeaten, scoring a record 74 goals, and remained undefeated for a record 58 matches in Serie A. In 1993–94, Tassotti once again helped Milan finish the league with the best defence, only conceding 15 goals. In his last few seasons at Milan under Capello, he began to be used less frequently, due to his advancing age and the emergence of Christian Panucci in his position. Along with his teammate Baresi, Tassotti retired from the club at the conclusion of the 1996–97 season. In total, he made 429 Serie A appearances with Milan, scoring 8 goals, and 583 total club appearances, scoring 10 goals. International career Tassotti did not win his first cap for Italy until age 32, under Arrigo Sacchi, in a 2–2 home draw against Switzerland in a 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 14 October 1992. This was partly because of an abundance of other world class Italian defenders, as he was constantly overlooked by Sacchi's predecessor Azeglio Vicini, who preferred to deploy full-backs he had worked with during his tenure as Italy's under-21 coach, despite Tassotti's excellent club performances. Tassotti had previously played for Italy at under-21 level, and he represented the nation at the 1988 Summer Olympics, alongside Paolo Maldini, where Italy reached the semi-finals, finishing in fourth place. Tassotti and Massimiliano Allegri during the game Milan–Real Madrid at Yankee Stadium in New York After featuring in Italy's 1994 World Cup qualifying matches and international friendlies under Sacchi, Tassotti played in the 1994 edition in the United States, where Italy went on to reach the final, losing to Brazil on penalties. This would be the only tournament in which he would participate with Italy. In the group stage, Tassotti started the 1–0 defeat to the Republic of Ireland and his next appearance was the quarter-final match against Spain. However, in the quarter- final match, Tassotti elbowed Spanish midfielder Luis Enrique in the face during stoppage time in the second half, breaking the Spaniard's nose. The gesture was not seen by the referee, and Tassotti was not called for a foul or cautioned at the time. Italy won the match 2–1. After reviewing the game, FIFA officials banned Tassotti for eight matches, the longest-such ban in World Cup history until Luis Suarez’s ban in 2014. Tassotti never played internationally again.Luis Enrique full of respect; BBC Sport, 20 June 2002 Tassotti later stated he had instantly and deeply regretted his actions, describing them as \\"stupid\\", although he would also state the gesture had not been premeditated but purely instinctive, as Luis Enrique had been pulling his shirt. He later personally apologised to Luis Enrique. In total, Tassotti made 7 appearances for Italy between 1992 and 1994. Managerial career =Milan= Tassotti assisting for Milan Following his retirement in 1997, Tassotti took up a coaching position in Milan's youth system, winning the Torneo di Viareggio with the Milan Primavera side in 1999 and 2001. In 2001, following the sacking of manager Alberto Zaccheroni, he served as a caretaker manager for the senior club and coached Milan for the remainder of the 2000–01 Serie A season, alongside Cesare Maldini, helping the club to qualify for the UEFA Cup, before being replaced by Fatih Terim at the end of the season. In the 2001–02 season, Tassotti joined Milan's coaching staff under former teammate Carlo Ancelotti as an assistant manager, and retained his post after the latter's departure, under Leonardo, Massimiliano Allegri, Clarence Seedorf and Filippo Inzaghi.All change in Milan; BBC Sport, 17 June 2001Maldini enjoying the moment; UEFA.com, 23 February 2007 In January 2014, he acted as caretaker manager for one match, a 3–1 home win over Spezia for the campaign's Coppa Italia following Massimiliano Allegri's dismissal and before Clarence Seedorf's appointment. In July 2015, he began working as a talent scout for Milan. =Ukraine national team= Tassotti terminated his contract with Milan on 12 July 2016, concluding his 36-year career with the club. his contract was due to expire in June 2017. It was later reported Tassotti had taken an assistant coaching position with the Ukraine national team, along with Milan Youth System coach Andrea Maldera, under the national team's former assistant manager Andriy Shevchenko, who formerly also played for Milan as a striker and who was named the team's new head coach. Style of play Tassotti was mostly used as a right-back, but he could also play as central defender when necessary, and often played in this role earlier on in his career. He even played as a central or defensive midfielder on occasion. Regarded as one of Italy's greatest defenders, and as one of the best full-backs of his generation, he is mostly remembered for his role alongside Maldini, Baresi, Galli and Costacurta in the legendary Milan backline of the late 1980s and early 1990s, under Sacchi and Capello, which is considered one of the greatest defences of all- time. Tassotti was a tenacious defensive minded full-back who was known for his strength, anticipation and defensive awareness, as well as his marking ability, positional sense and tactical intelligence. These attributes made him extremely adept at reading the game and at covering defensively for his teammates, and allowed him to excel in Milan's zonal marking system, which used a high defensive line and the offside trap. While at Lazio, he earned a reputation for being an aggressive and hard-tackling defender as a youngster, with a strong character. At Milan, he developed into a more cautious, composed and consistent player, which led to him being nicknamed \\"The Professor\\". Although Tassotti primarily excelled defensively, he was a modern and versatile full-back who was also one of the first players in his position to be capable of being an offensive threat, due to his pace, athleticism, stamina, technique, and distribution, as well as his ability to make attacking runs, dribble and provide accurate crosses and assists from the right wing. Although he was initially not known for being particularly skilful, Tassotti was later also highly regarded for his elegance on the ball and technical ability, which he was able to improve extensively under the tutelage of manager Nils Liedholm while at Milan. This later led his teammates to give him the nickname the new \\"Djalma Santos\\", in addition to his other nickname, \\"Il Tasso\\" (\\"The Badger\\" in Italian).

Created in 1875, it is one of the centers of the Italian immigration in Brazil. It is also known as the 'wine capital of Brazil' due to its vineyards and wine production. In 2016, its estimated population was 114,203 inhabitants. Ernesto Geisel, President of Brazil from 1974-1979 (under the military government), was born in Bento Gonçalves in 1907. Etymology The city changed names three times in history. Before the Italian immigration began, the place where the city downtown is located today was crossed by horsemen, and since there was well known north-south trail with a little wooden cross at the place, the name \\"Cruzinha\\" was used to name this region. After a decree of the effective governor of the province in 1870 decade, settlement Colônia Dona Isabel was named after the Brazilian princess Isabel de Bragança. At 1890, Colônia Dona Isabel emancipates from Montenegro, 45 years after the end of the Farroupilha Revolution, what makes the government at the time to give the name Bento Gonçalves to the city, named after Bento Gonçalves da Silva the main leader of the Farroupilha Revolution. History Bacchus wine fountain near Town Hall. The Maria Fumaça steam locomotive at the Bento Gonçalves train station. Riding the locomotive is one of the city's major tourist attractions. View of the Central Business District from the steep hills of Bento Gonçalves. Before 1870, the area where the city is located was known as Cruzinha. It was inhabited, as the rest of the region, by Indigenous people of the \\"jê\\" tribe. In 1875, the Brazilian government created, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, four settlements to receive Italian immigrants. In the Cruzinha area, a settlement was created called Dona Isabel. \\"Dona Isabel\\" received the first 25 families of Italian settlers in that same year. They mostly came from the region of Trento. During the next few decades, the region was settled by immigrants coming mostly from the Italian regions of Veneto, Trentino, and Lombardia. In 1890, Dona Isabel was elevated to the category of city, changing its name to Bento Gonçalves (named after the military leader of the Ragamuffin War). The Italian immigrants mostly worked in grape and wine production. During the first few decades of the 20th century, the city continued to receive immigrants. Besides the Italians, there were large groups of Polish, German, Swedish, French, and Spanish immigrants. At that time, there were already some functioning wine factories and the furniture and metallurgic industry was just starting to take off. The railways arrived at the city in 1919, helping to connect it with the capital of the state, Porto Alegre, and facilitating the transport of the city's economic production. There were regular passenger trains running until 1976; however, today the railways are used mostly to transport goods. The electric light distribution system was installed between 1919 and 1927. The Bartolomeu Tacchini Hospital was built during the same period. In 1950, the population was 22,600. Industrial activity expanded, especially in the wine, furniture, leather, chemical, metal, and mechanical sectors. In 1967, the city organized the first National Wine Festival (Fenavinho), receiving, for the first time, a visit from a Brazilian President. The city started to organize and receive many important national and international events. It is now home to the second largest exposition park in Latin America. Among these events are the Movelsul (Furniture Fair), FIMMA Brasil (Furniture Machinery Fair), Vino Brasil (Wine Machinery Fair), Avaliação Nacional de Vinhos (National Wine Assessment), Fenavinho e Expobento (Commercial Fair). Economy Bento Gonçalves is among the ten largest economies in Rio Grande do Sul. It is the largest producer of wine in Brazil and has the second largest furniture production industry in the country. It also has important metal, mechanical, plastic, and chemical industries. It has the highest Human Development Index of Rio Grande do Sul and the sixth among all Brazilian cities - 0,870 (PNUD/2000). Geography The average elevation of Bento Gonçalves is 690 meters above the sea level. Summers are warm and winters are mild. During the climatic winter frosts are common and snow is rare. The highest temperature officially recorded in the city was 36 °C and the lowest was -4,5 °C. Tourism The Maria Fumaça steam locomotive offers tourist trips in the rolling countryside of Bento Gonçalves, Garibaldi and Carlos Barbosa. Museums about the Italian heritage of the city include the Epopéia Italiana. The city is also part of Vale dos Vinhedos, a region with 82 km square located at the limits of Garibaldi, Monte Belo do Sul and Bento Gonçalves. Many restaurants and wineries can be found at Vale dos Vinhedos, making the region a well known enotourism route in Brazil. View of Bento Gonçalves from the Planalto neighborhood.

He followed the profession of arms but, not obtaining promotion so rapidly as he expected, he left the service and travelled through different parts of Europe. He stopped in Holland with the intention of publishing an account of his travels. But in the interval, at the request of his bookseller, he wrote and published several pamphlets, which were eagerly sought after, owing to the unceremonious manner in which he treated the ministry of France. Thus deprived of all hope of employment in his own country, he thought of forming a permanent establishment in Holland, and accordingly commenced a course of lectures on public law. The project succeeded far beyond his expectations and some useful compilations which he published in the same period made him well known in other countries. The emperor appointed him his historiographer, and some time afterwards conferred on him the title of Baron de Carlscroon. He died in Vienna. Dumont was also the author of Lettres historiques contenant ce qui se passe de plus important en Europe. This periodical, begun in 1692 with two volumes appearing annually, he edited until 1710, when it was continued by Jacques Basnage and others until 1728. The earlier volumes are much prized.

He is currently the goalkeeper coach of Fremad Amager. He has previously played for Danish Superliga clubs Odense BK, Vejle BK, Viborg FF, and F.C. Copenhagen, winning four Superliga championships and two Danish Cup trophies with F.C. Copenhagen. He has also played for Scottish Premier League club Rangers. Christiansen was named the 2005, 2006 and 2007 Danish Goalkeeper of the Year. He has played 11 games for the Denmark national football team, and represented Denmark at the 2002 and 2010 FIFA World Cup tournaments as an unused understudy of Thomas Sørensen. Club career =Danish breakthrough= Born in Roskilde, Christiansen competed with later national team player Peter Madsen to be the best forward on Zealand in his teenage years. At 17, he did not want the life of a professional footballer, and chose to play amateur football in Serie 3, the 4th lowest level of Danish football. For fun, he tried playing the position of goalkeeper, in which position he caught the attention of higher ranking clubs. Roskilde B 1906 offered him a contract in 1997, and he was Roskilde's goalkeeper for one season, before he followed his coach to Ølstykke FC. In 1998, he moved to Odense Boldklub (OB) in the second tier of Danish football, the Danish 1st Division. He helped OB win promotion to the top- flight Danish Superliga, where he got his national breakthrough. When OB legend Lars Høgh retired in January 2000, a string of strong displays by Christiansen showed a strong temper and good reflexes. He looked the long term replacement of Lars Høgh, though Christiansen never got the chance to make a decent bid for Høgh's record 817 games for OB. As Scottish club Rangers suffered injuries in their goalkeeping staff, the search for replacements turned to Christiansen, who was eager to move abroad at 22 years of age. =On the bench in Glasgow= In Glasgow, he played alongside fellow Dane Peter Løvenkrands, with whom he became good friends,FCK Balls #3, Advice A/S, Jesper Traunberg, 23 May 2006, pp. 100–108 and he played a handful of games in his first time at Rangers, including a few outings in the UEFA Champions League. His league debut was a 3–0 home defeat to Kilmarnock. When first choice goalkeeper Stefan Klos returned from his injury, he once again took control of the goalkeeper spot. Christiansen could not force his way into the starting line-up, and he was put on loan. His first loan deal with Danish Superliga club Vejle Boldklub in 2001 was a personal success for Christiansen. Though Vejle was relegated to the 1st Division, he was called up to the Danish national team. After the period in Vejle, Christiansen was loaned out to VfL Wolfsburg.\\"Dane leaves Ibrox on loan\\" BBC Sport website (23 July 2002) This period was one of the worst in his career, the result being that he was dropped from the national team. He did not play a single first team game for Wolfsburg, and did not make many friends in Germany. Christiansen later said he would rather warm the bench at Rangers, than in Wolfsburg. =Danish success= In the winter transfer window of the 2003–04 Superliga season, Christiansen returned to Denmark once more to play for Viborg FF, following a string of goalkeeper switches; former Viborg goalkeeper Arek Onyszko moving to Odense BK, replacing Karim Zaza who had transferred to Brøndby IF. At Viborg, Christiansen showed the impressive form that he had displayed for Odense and Vejle once more. Following one and a half year at Viborg, Christiansen moved to F.C. Copenhagen (FCK) in the summer of 2005. At FCK, he was assigned the no. 1 jersey as the club's first choice for the goalkeeping position. His debut in the FCK-jersey came on 20 July 2005, keeping a clean sheet as AaB were defeated 1–0 at Aalborg Stadion in Aalborg. In the autumn 2006, he was an important part of FCK's participation in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, producing many great saves. This brought renewed interest from foreign clubs, as he and teammate Michael Silberbauer were both rumoured on their way to English club Everton in the 2006 winter transfer window. Everton på jagt efter FCK-profiler, Bold.dk, 6 November 2006 The transfer never materialized, and in January 2007, Christiansen expressed his desire to further his career by moving to a club in a bigger league, Jesper Christiansen vil videre – fra FCK , B.T., 16 January 2007 but a new 5 year long contract cancelled every rumour. In the opening match of the 2007–08 season, against FC Nordsjælland at Farum Park, Christiansen was close to score on a header, as it hit the inside of the post, and was parried by Nordsjælland keeper Kim Christensen, after a corner kick deep into extra time. In May 2008 he was linked with a £1 million move to West Bromwich Albion. For the 2009–10 season, FCK bought Johan Wiland as a backup. When Christiansen was injured against Brøndby IF in the seventh Superliga game of the season, Wiland replaced him with such success that Christiansen was permanently demoted to the bench.http://tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/vm-2010/jesper-c-til-elfsborg Media reports suggested he wanted a transfer,http://tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/sas-liga/avis- jesper-c-paa-vej-vaek-fra-fck and when FCK bought Kim Christensen as a new backup keeper in the Summer 2010, Christiansen was expected to leave the club. He signed for IF Elfsborg of the Swedish Allsvenskan championship in June 2010. International career During his time with Vejle, Christiansen was called up for the senior national team by national team manager Morten Olsen. He was chosen for the Danish squad at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan as a backup for starting national team goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen, and was an unused substitute throughout the tournament. In his time at Viborg, Christiansen was recalled to the Danish national team, and made his national team debut on 2 June 2005, in a 1–0 friendly match win against Finland. He played his second game in October 2005, when he came on as a substitute in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification 2–1 win against Kazakhstan. He quickly established himself as an understudy for Thomas Sørensen, and made a number of appearances at times when Sørensen was injured. Before the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Christiansen lacked playing time at FCK, and found himself in contention with Kim Christensen for the spot as third goalkeeper in the squad for the finals. Eventually Morten Olsen chose Christiansen for his team,http://tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/vm-2010/chok-silberbauer-udeladt-af-vm-truppen and he spent his time at the tournament as an unused substitute.

By the early 1970s it was clear that this was far too large to allow the missile to be used as a tactical nuclear weapon -- by this time 400 kt was larger than most strategic warheads. The Pershing II had a high accuracy maneuverable reentry vehicle (MARV), equipped with a radar terminal guidance system and carrying a low yield W85 warhead. Like many US nuclear weapons, it was a development of the B61 nuclear bomb - in this case, a modification of the Mod 3/4 design. After the Pershing missiles were scrapped, all 120 of the W85 warheads produced were modified into B61 bombs, in this case the B61-10 free-fall weapon.

It is one of the oldest councils in the nation, and is one of two single-county councils left in Pennsylvania, the other being Chief Cornplanter Council in Warren, PA. Organization Council Office in 2016 The council is administratively divided into three districts: *Diamond Rock District *Horseshoe Trail District *Octoraro District History CCC 5th National Jamboree 1960 The Chester County Council was formed by a charter by the National BSA Council in 1919, and was charged with overseeing the Scouts in Chester County under the leadership of Dr. Arthur A. Schuck, who later became the third Chief Scout Executive in the BSA and who had previously been Deputy Chief Scout Executive under Dr. James West. In the early years, the council, forming in the wake of the armistice ending World War I, was able to consolidate the independent troops, despite most of the adults that were qualified being off in Europe. In the 1920s, the council, under the leadership of Charles Heistand, underwent a metamorphosis that resulted in the acquisition of a new Scout camp, and the formation of its own Order of the Arrow lodge. Prior to the acquisition of the Reynolds Farm property on the Mason–Dixon line near Rising Sun, Maryland and Oxford, Pennsylvania, Scouts attending summer camp were loaded up onto military trucks, and then shipped out to Camp Rothrock, the council's old summer camp property located near Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The council longed for a camp closer to home, and after being rejected by the former Philadelphia Area Council as being \\"too far\\", the council acquired the Reynolds Farm, then a moonshiner haven, and the new camp, the Horseshoe Scout Reservation, opened its doors in 1928. Just a year before, Heistand inquired about starting an Order of the Arrow lodge in the council, and contacted Dr. E. Urner Goodman, who was then serving as the Grand Lodge Chief (now the National Chief of the Order of the Arrow). After a failed attempt in trying to get the Philadelphia Council's OA Lodge, Unami Lodge, to install its chartered members, Goodman himself conducted the first induction ceremony, at Camp Hillsdale, near West Chester. Heistand, Joseph Brinton (who later became the National OA Conference Chief and Chief Scout Executive), and several other members were inducted, and Octoraro Lodge #22 was born. Since the opening of the camp and the founding of the OA lodge, the council has seen its fair share of growth throughout the county, eventually extending down into Cecil County, Maryland with the formation of several Boy Scout troops and Cub Scout packs as far south as Port Deposit, Maryland. Most of this achievement was under the direction of Lewis Lester, who was the longest serving Scout Executive of the council (in the 1940s and 1950s), and was influential in expanding the facilities at both Camps Horseshoe and Jubilee (later to become Camp John H. Ware, III). More recent additions to the council included the relocation of the council service center from downtown West Chester to an office building just off of the U.S. Highway 202 bypass in Westtown Township, Pennsylvania, and the opening of the \\"Cub Town\\" facilities at Camp Ware in 2004. Camps The Horseshoe Scout Reservation is a Boy Scouts of America camp, owned by the Chester County Council, and located on the Mason-Dixon line separating Pennsylvania and Maryland. The name of the camp derives from the Octoraro Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River, that makes a meandering 4-mile horseshoe through the property. Camp John H. Ware, III is a Boy Scout and Cub Scout summer, winter, and weekend camp located in Peach Bottom, Pennsylvania on the Horseshoe Scout Reservation. It is organized by Boy Scouts of America. It shares the reservation with Camp Horseshoe, located on the other side of the Octoraro River. The camp, formerly known as Camp Jubilee, offers a wide variety of activities for young men to participate in while earning merit badges and advancing in rank. The camp offers its accommodations in all seasons, however it is not staffed throughout the year. The only time when a full complement of staff is present is summer camp. During the winter camping season, the rangers staff the Trading Post, offering food and small souvenirs, including T-shirts and other supplies. Order of the Arrow Octoraro Lodge #22 is the local chapter of the Order of the Arrow affiliated with Chester County Council.Octoraro Lodge 22 Website Octoraro Lodge #22 supports Horseshoe Scout Reservation, including both Camp Horseshoe and Camp Ware, with thousands of annual volunteer hours of service and multiple fundraisers throughout the year. The purpose of Octoraro Lodge #22 is to support camping throughout Chester County Council. The council's Order of the Arrow lodge, Octoraro Lodge #22, was formed in 1927 under the leadership of Charles Heistand and Joseph Brinton, with its first members being inducted by Dr. E. Urner Goodman himself. Octoraro #22 celebrated it Diamond Jubilee in the 2001-2002 season. In 1946, in the spirit of the lodge's chartering by Dr. Goodman, members of the lodge traveled south to Norfolk, Virginia and inducted the first members of Blue Heron Lodge 349. Both Octoraro and Blue Heron share good relationships and invite members to each other's fall fellowship weekends in September (Octoraro Lodge) and October (Blue Heron). Octoraro Lodge, which takes its name from the Octoraro Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River, uses the Canada goose as its lodge \\"totem\\" or symbol. Early lodge patches and pocket flaps had white geese, with the \\"W.W.W.\\" stitched in the center and bisected with a horizontally-facing arrow, but since 1971, all flaps used real-colored geese, and a horseshoe (representing the Horseshoe Scout Reservation) diagonally bisected by a red arrow. Prized flaps include the \\"Cut-Edge Blue,\\" which is the very first pocket flaps issued by the lodge in the mid-1950s, and the gold-bordered 50th Anniversary flap, issued in 1976 for the lodge's golden anniversary. Both flaps fetch over $100 at auctions. Notable people Because of the council's history, members have gone onto higher office at the Area, Regional, and National levels of the BSA.

Prosperi, a keen endurance runner, took part in the 1994 Marathon des Sables (Marathon of the Sands) in Morocco. Part way through the six-day 233 kilometre event a sandstorm caused Mauro Prosperi to lose his way. He ended up disoriented and ran in the wrong direction, ultimately running several hundred kilometres into Algeria. After 24 hours he ran out of food and water. He arrived at an abandoned Muslim shrine, with the corpse of a holy man in it, and survived by drinking his own urine. He found bats on the low ceilings which he decapitated and then ate the guts and drank the blood from, and he waited for rescue. A helicopter and a plane passed, but they failed to see him.Run 151 miles in the desert? No sweat The Times, 13 April 2008, retrieved on 5 December 2010 Not wishing to die a long drawn out death, Prosperi attempted to commit suicide in the shrine by slitting his wrists with a pen knife he had with him. The attempt failed – lack of water had caused Prosperi's blood to thicken and ultimately clotted the wound. He then regained his composure, and followed a Tuareg's advice prior to the start of the race to set his compass in the direction of early morning clouds and walk towards them. He walked in the desert and ate reptiles, insects, and cacti from dried wadis, before stumbling on an oasis, with a footprint next to it, and then some goats, and then a little girl who ran away towards a tent with women in it who gave him goat's milk and laid him in the shade outside. After nine days alone in the desert, he was found and taken to an Algerian military camp and from there to a hospital. He was off route, and had lost in body weight.Running on empty MSN travel, retrieved on 5 December 2010 He received a hero's welcome back home in Italy, and media clamour. His survival story has since been depicted on the National Geographic Channel in a documentary titled Expeditions To The Edge: Sahara Nightmare, and within Episode 5 Lost in the Desert, of the 2019 Netflix series Losers. In 2014, British adventurer and survival instructor Bear Grylls also drew influence from Prosperi’s survival in the Sahara Desert, within an episode of his six part Discovery Channel series Bear Grylls : Escape from Hell. Prosperi’s story of endurance was also broadcast in a promotional campaign by 20th Century Studios in December of 2015, in support of the American drama film The Revenant, released the same year. In May 2020, Prosperi published his book, written in the Italian language, alongside his former wife and co-author Cinzia Pagliara, entitled “Quei 10 Giorni Oltre la Vita” (Those 10 Days Beyond Life).

Grolieri et Amicorum Jean Grolier de Servières, viscount d'Aguisy ( - 22 October 1565) was Treasurer-General of France and a famous bibliophile. As a book collector, Grolier is known in particular for his patronage of the Aldine Press, and his love of richly decorated bookbindings. Biography Grolier was born in Lyon; he encouraged the belief that he was older than seems plausible given the marriage of his parents in 1485, resulting in 1479 often being given as his date of birth. Based on recently discovered documentary evidence from July 1527, when he gave his age as 37 in legal proceedings, he is now regarded as born in 1489-90.Hobson, 5-6 His family was of Italian origin, from Verona, but was based in Lyon where Étienne Grolier, Grolier's father, was a wealthy merchant who also held a government post as a tax collector. His mother was Antonia Esbauda; there were four daughters of the marriage, but Jean was their only son. In 1506 Étienne obtained, probably by purchase, the post of Treasurer-General of Milan, then held by the French. Jean Grolier was to inherit this office at the age of 19 or 20 on his father's death in Milan in 1509.Hobson, 6,7 and 10; so Hobson concludes, though Grolier later said he had bought it himself. Grolier still owned the family house in Lyons in 1536, though he had not lived there as an adult.Hobson, 7 In 1508 Jean Grolier was a secrétaire du roi (\\"secretary to the king\\" - a junior aide in today's terminology) who had to accompany Louis XII and his court around France. His studies continued under the Renaissance humanist Gaspar Argilensis (or Gaspar d'Argile), who dedicated his edition of Suetonius to Grolier (Lyons 1508). Grolier was in Milan as treasurer from 1509 (at least) until the French were expelled in June 1512, and then returned with the French army, now under François I, in 1515 and remained until they were again thrown out in 1521, after the disaster of the Battle of Pavia, when he returned to France. In his second period in Milan he was at the centre of a humanistic literary circle, and met Aldus Manutius, printer of so many of his books, when he visited from Venice, probably in 1511. There is no evidence Grolier went to Venice, as is sometimes claimed.Hobson, 25 Many works were dedicated to him, and several letters to and from his circle survive, including ones from Erasmus.The Great Book-collectors, 70-71 Grolier later represented the French monarchy in Italy, though claims in older works that he had a formal appointment as ambassador to the Papacy are mistaken.Hobson, 3, 25 He was Treasurer of War from 1522–31, and after holding regional positions as treasurer he was made one of four Treasurers-General of France in 1537. He had married Anne Briçonnet, from a Tours family, who died in 1545 or so, and they had two daughters at least. He died in Paris and was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, the funeral arranged and the tomb paid for by two daughters and two grandsons.Hobson, 5 Book collection Grolier's books bore the inscription, Io. Grolieri et Amicorum (Latin for \\"the property of Jean Grolier and his friends\\"), early examples adding Lugdunensis (\\"of Lyon\\") after his name. There is some debate about how he shared books with his friends, but there is evidence that his generosity in lending to friends resulted in some items going missing, and the library was largely dispersed long before 1675, a date given in older sources. A work of 1620 already claimed that \\"the finest libraries both in Paris and elsewhere in France owe their adornment solely to Grolier's copies\\".Hobson, 3 Some 500 books can still be identified as having formed part of the library, and for centuries Grolier's reputation as a collector has increased the value of any book associated with him.Hobson, 3-4 Some of the books are in public collections such as the British Library and the National Library in Paris, the latter institution having the largest number of Grolier bindings. Grolier was particularly interested in the Latin classics, and his books were bound in different coloured leather according to subject matter. His first period in Italy already shows him taking an innovative interest in bookbinding, commissioning a series of \\"plaquette bindings\\" with large medal-like reliefs at the centre of the cover. Previously this style had only been used for special presentation volumes, and Grolier was the first collector to apply it systematically to books for his own library, which he seems to have begun to do in 1510.Hobson, 13-21 Most of his library was bound in France, but the designs continued to show Italian influence. Grolier gave his name to a style of bookbinding ornamented with geometric patterns, exemplified in those he commissioned, and perhaps helped to design.example at the John Rylands Library Grolier bindings were mostly produced in Paris between 1520 and 1555, and show a development in style: \\"Simple geometrical strapwork designs with fleurons at the corners of the central panel developed in the later bindings into elaborate curvilinear interlacings combined with arabesques sometimes enclosed in roll-produced borders\\".Harthan, 12 Analysis of the surviving bindings shows that Grolier patronised several workshops over the years. Only a limited amount of information is known about the bookbinders involved: some bindings are in an identifiable style (for example \\"Grolier's last binder\\"),Lettere di Meesser Horatio Brunetto while documentary evidence allows a few of the binders to identified by name: * Geoffroy Tory (d. 1533), a Parisian printer and bookbinder best known as a designer of type for printing * Jean Picard, a Parisian bookbinder and bookseller. Picard was active in the 1540s and, up to 1547, combined his bookbinding with holding the Paris agency of the Aldine Press. The Grolier Club of New York City was named after him by Walter Montgomery Jackson (1863–1923), who had also commemorated him in the publisher, Grolier, that he founded. Horology During his retirement he invented the “Turtle Clock”. This is a mysterious contraption consisting of a hidden clockwork oriented face up, like a 16th-century table clock, beneath a non-ferrous plate whose rim shows the twelve numbers of the hours. The hour hand rotating underneath the plate has a magnet which causes a man-made floating turtle (that has a longitudinal iron bar in its body) to point its head towards the appropriate hour.

It was developed by the same British teams as the original. The title music by Richard Joseph is a marimba-heavy rendition of the RoboCop film theme.http://www.mobygames.com/game/james- pond-2-codename-robocod/trivia James Pond 2 was originally released on the Amiga, Atari ST and Sega Genesis in 1991 by three different publishers. It was next ported to Amiga AGA, Amiga CD32, Game Gear, Commodore 64, Master System, PC, Acorn Archimedes, Game Boy and SNES. The SNES version was called Super James Pond in North America, and Super James Pond II in other regions. The Game Boy version was called Super James Pond in every region. It was later redeveloped and released as a budget title for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and as a download on the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network store. Plot The game takes place immediately after its predecessor, James Pond. Although Acme Oil Co. has been destroyed by James Pond, Pond's arch enemy Dr. Maybe survived and has retreated to the North Pole where he has taken over Santa's workshop. Dr. Maybe is holding Santa's workers hostage (in most versions of the game they are penguins, in some they are elves), and has turned many of Santa's helpers into his own twisted and dangerous assistants. James Pond is recruited to infiltrate Santa's grotto, free the captive penguins, retrieve the stolen toys for the children of the world, and defeat Dr. Maybe once and for all. This time, however, due to the greater risks involved in this mission, Pond is given a robotic suit and the code name \\"RoboCod\\" (a play on RoboCop). This suit gives Pond superhuman strength and agility as well as enabling him to stretch his midsection almost indefinitely and reach otherwise impossibly high areas. Gameplay James Pond outside Santa's toy factory James starts outside Santa's toy factory. There are many doors, each of which leads to a stage with many differently-themed levels, 50 in total. Hostile creatures lurk in these levels, and they come in many forms. There are no weapons in the game, so James must jump on them to defeat them. After completing two \\"doors\\", James goes on to another door where a boss awaits. James's body armor enables him to extend his body vertically to incredible lengths and grab hold of the ceiling or platforms above him. This allows him to travel along the ceiling and drop down on the top of an unsuspecting enemy, or to get to otherwise inaccessible areas. James can also pick up items that provide points. Power- ups include extra lives and wings that grant James the ability to fly. From time to time James may enter vehicles, namely cars, planes or flying bathtubs. Product placement In the original UK version of the game, the penguins featured as in-game product placement for the McVitie's biscuit company's Penguin Biscuits. The 1991 EA release in the U.S. and Euro market featured the penguin in a Christmas scene in box art by illustrator Marc Ericksen. According to a 1994 article in the UK edition of PC Gamer, Penguin outsold arch-rival KitKat for the first time in the product's history soon after the release of the game. Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation versions James Pond 2 was released for the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation in 2003, the Nintendo DS in 2005, the PlayStation 2 in 2006, and PlayStation Network in 2009. The handheld and PlayStation releases are identical except for the DS version, which features a map on the second screen. All these versions of the game are largely different from that of the original. The graphics have been improved to take advantage of the consoles' newer hardware, and while the levels retain some of the themes of the originals, their layout is entirely different. In the new versions, McVities' sponsorship branding has been removed from the game, and Robocod must rescue Santa's elves, rather than penguins. In addition, the hidden levels have been omitted entirely. These recent iterations are re-makes rather than ports of the original game. Reception UK magazine ACE gave the Amiga version a score of 934 out of 1000, calling it \\"polished, playable and (...) fun\\" and \\"completely excellent\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a 5 out of 10, commenting that \\"James's ability to make himself tall is quite interesting, but that is really the only special thing about him. Fans of JP may be better off with his Aquatic Games.\\" They gave the Amiga CD32 version a 5.5 out of 10. Though they praised the soundtrack, they remarked that the garishly colorful graphics tend to cause eye strain, the gameplay is mildly fun but unexciting, and that aside from the \\"extremely pixelated\\" full motion video intro, it is identical to the version on the less powerful Sega Genesis.

History The village has existed since at least 1749, when the decision was made to build a road from Warrenton (about east) to serve the growing number of farms along the river. With Fauquier County on the north side and Culpeper County on the south side, Waterloo is surrounded by relatively flat tracts of arable land. In 1829, construction began on a canal to eventually connect Waterloo with Fredericksburg, about to the southeast. Finished in 1849, the canal included 44 locks and 20 dams, with of dug canal. Commercial activities in Waterloo began to thrive as the canal was constructed, because the water also could power mills. Eventually there was a sawmill, a clothing mill, a blacksmith, and a plan for a group of shops and factories on the Fauquier side to serve the community and the canal. However, when the Orange and Alexandria Railroad commenced operation in 1852, canal traffic rapidly declined, and venture ceased to operate in 1853. During the Civil War, both Northern and South soldiers at various times occupied Waterloo. In 1861, CSA General Stonewall Jackson defeated USA General James Shields in an early skirmish; Shields' troops crossed the Waterloo Bridge from Culpeper to Fauquier on his retreat back to Washington, and in March 1862 he would return to help hand CSA General Jackson a rare tactical defeat at the Battle of Kernstown I (about to the north). On August 22, 1862, General J. E. B. Stuart's army started its ride around the army of USA General John Pope Pope in Waterloo. Stuart's force captured Pope's headquarters wagons and destroyed Union supplies and army material, shortly before the second battle of Manassas. By war's end, all but a couple of Waterloo's buildings were destroyed or dismantled. See also \\"Battle of Rappahannock Station I\\". The current Waterloo Bridge was constructed in 1878http://www.virginiadot.org/projects/culpeper/waterloo.asp for $7,050 by the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company. A one-lane, wrought iron bridge, it may be the oldest such bridge in Virginia. The counties of Fauquier, Culpeper, and Rappahannock all contributed to the funding, in order to enable local farmers and merchants to deliver goods to market. U.S. Route 211 was routed across the bridge from 1926 until about 1930. Modern Today, all that remains of the once busy nexus of commerce is a one-lane bridge, a home built around 1830 by John Spillman Armstrong, and the Waterloo Post Office (now a private residence) built on the Culpeper side in 1870 by Armstrong under contract to the U.S. Post Office. Local residents believe the post office was built by the U.S. government as a way of re-establishing its authority following the Civil War.

He was also one of the founders of the Hope 08 project, an initiative of the churches of Britain and Ireland which seeks to demonstrate Christian faith in action. He was ordained deacon in the Church of England at St Albans Abbey on 1 July 2012. Soul Survivor Pilavachi launched Soul Survivor in the summer of 1993.http://www.vineyardchurches.org.uk/resources/insights/the-soul-survivor- story/ The Soul Survivor Story The event is a 5-day long charismatic Christian festival aimed at youth and the initial Soul Survivor attracted 1,896 delegates. Under the guidance of Pilavachi, the event has grown to accommodate around 30,000 people over four weeks along with the fifth week, being Momentum (aimed at those in their twenties and thirties). Matt Redman, who had attended Pilavachi's youth club at St Andrews Church of England Chorleywood, was a worship leader at early Soul Survivor camps. Matt Redman returned as a worship leader in 2011. From summer 2014 a fifth week of Soul Survivor is held in Scotland.http://soulsurvivor.com/summer/soul-survivor-scotland In May 2018 Pilavachi announced that the Soul Survivor conference would be ending after the summer events of 2019.  Personal Life  On 28 December 2019, it was announced in the new years honours list that Pilavachi would be receiving an MBE for services to young people.

It is also known as cutaneous APUDoma, primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, primary small cell carcinoma of the skin, and trabecular carcinoma of the skin. Factors involved in the development of MCC include the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV), a weakened immune system, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Merkel-cell carcinoma usually arises on the head, neck, and extremities, as well as in the perianal region and on the eyelid. It is more common in people over 60 years old, Caucasian people, and males. MCC is less common in children. Signs and symptoms Small spot on the left arm is Merkel-cell cancer Merkel-cell carcinoma. Gross pathology specimen Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) usually presents as a firm nodule (up to 2 cm diameter) or mass (>2 cm diameter). These flesh-colored, red, or blue tumors typically vary in size from 0.5 cm (less than one-quarter of an inch) to more than 5 cm (2 inches) in diameter and may enlarge rapidly. Tumors can present as painless, tender or itchy, and other MCC manifestations as papules or plaques have also been reported. Although MCC may arise almost anywhere on the body, it is most commonly found in sun-exposed areas such as the head, neck or extremities. Five key attributes of MCC were summarized in 2008 in the acronym AEIOU (Asymptomatic/lack of tenderness, Expanding rapidly, Immune suppression, Older than 50 years, and Ultraviolet-exposed site on a person with fair skin). Ninety percent of MCC's have 3 or more of those features. MCC is sometimes mistaken for other histological types of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, lymphoma, and small cell carcinoma, or as a benign cyst. Merkel cell carcinomas have been described in children, however pediatric cases are very rare. Merkel-cell cancers tend to invade locally, infiltrating the underlying subcutaneous fat, fascia, and muscle, and typically metastasize early in their natural history, most often to the regional lymph nodes. MCCs also spread aggressively through the blood vessels to many organs, particularly to liver, lung, brain, and bone. Pathophysiology Merkel-cell carcinoma (arrow) infiltrating skin tissue, stained brown for Merkel cell polyomavirus large T protein. = Cell of origin = Although MCC was initially named for the Merkel cell due to histologic and physiologic similarities between MCC and Merkel cells, the cellular progenitor of MCC has been a heavily debated question. Merkel cells are highly specialized cells that act as pressure receptors in the epidermis. The origin of Merkel cells themselves is debated and proposed to be derived from neural crest cells or epidermal progenitors. MCC is similar to Merkel cells in its histological appearance (see below: Diagnosis) and shares many immunohistochemical markers with Merkel cells, including epidermal marker cytokeratin 20 and neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and chromogranin A. Furthermore, the ion channel Piezo2 and transcription factor Atoh1, both specific to Merkel cells, are also expressed by MCC. However, Merkel cells are post-mitotic cells with a low probability of cancerous transformation. Additionally, they have not been shown to support Merkel-cell polyoma virus infection, which is believed to drive oncogenesis in approximately 80% of MCC. Instead, it has been proposed the MCC may originate from a Merkel cell precursor, at which point it gains features similar to those of Merkel cells. One such precursor is the human fibroblast. Evidence for a fibroblast precursor includes its location in the dermis, which is thought to be the primary site of origin for MCC. Additionally, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that fibroblasts not only support MCV infection but can be induced into having a MCC phenotype by the expression of viral proteins. However, others have argued that MCC likely derives from an epithelial precursor cell due to its frequent presence in mixed tumors including epithelial neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma. While epithelial cells are not typically found in the dermis, hair follicles include epithelial cells that have been shown to have oncogenic potential, and have therefore been proposed as a possible site for a MCC precursor. Finally, the presence of B-cell surface markers on MCC in addition to the high correlation between MCC and B-cell lymphomatous cancers have also led to suggestions that MCC may share a progenitor with B-cells. Because of the differences in physiology and prognosis between MCV+ and MCV- MCC (see below), however, some have suggested that these two subtypes of MCC may actually derive from different progenitor cells. Several factors are involved in the pathophysiology of MCC, including a virus called Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure, and weakened immune function. = Merkel cell polyomavirus = The MCV is a small double-stranded DNA virus that is believed to contribute to the development of the majority of MCC. About 80% of MCC tumors are infected with MCV, with the virus integrated into the host genome in a monoclonal pattern. However, the majority of people with MCV infection do not develop MCC: MCV is a ubiquitous virus and infection commonly occurs during childhood but remains asymptomatic throughout an individual’s lifetime. MCC was first believed to be associated with MCV when it was observed to occur at a much higher rate in HIV patients during the 1980s. Since then, studies have demonstrated integration of the MCV genome into the genome of MCC tumor cells. Central to the our understanding of the pathogenicity of MCV are two viral proteins expressed in infected cells known as the large tumor antigen (LT) and small tumor antigen (sT). Normally, patients infected with MCV show low levels of antibodies to the LT protein, perhaps due to a nuclear localization domain in its C-terminal that limits its cellular dispersion. However, integration of the viral genome into the host genome can result in truncation of the LT protein proximal to this domain. This serves two oncogenic purposes: first, it prevents successful viral replication that would culminate in lysis of the infected cell. Second, it redistributes the LT protein to the cytoplasm, where it can interact with cytoplasmic signaling. The N-terminal LXCXE motif of the LT protein has been shown to interact with known oncogene Rb and is conserved in other cancer- causing viruses. Studies suggest that LT may also preserve cell proliferation signals such as c-Myc and cyclin E and cause DNA injury to the p53 tumor suppressor. Meanwhile, sT has been shown to induce cell proliferation through hyper-phosphorylation of the translation initiator 4EBP1 as well as inhibition of a ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for degradation of cellular proliferation signals. sT also contains a region known as the LT stabilization domain (LSD), which potentiates the LT protein's oncogenic function. Unlike LT, MCC samples have been identified that express sT alone, and sT expression in fibroblasts has been shown to cause MCC phenotype development. =UV light= About 20% of MCC tumors are MCV negative. In contrast to MCV-induced MCC, these tumors tend to have much higher mutational burdens with mutational signatures characteristic of UV damage. Genes frequently mutated in MCV- negative MCC include p53 and Rb, among others. The link between MCC and UV exposure has been demonstrated through various epidemiological studies indicating a higher incidence of MCC in fair-skinned people in areas of high UV exposure, as well as among those receiving UV phototherapy. The typical distribution of MCC in sun exposed regions and its co-occurrence with other skin cancers also indicate that UV exposure is a contributing factor to MCC development. It is unclear whether this is through direct mutational impact, immune down-regulation, or some combination of the two. =Immunosuppression= The incidence of MCC is increased in conditions with defective immune functions such as malignancy, HIV infection, and organ transplant patients, etc. Conversely, patients with brisk immune response have been shown to have improved prognoses. This is suspected to be due to the inability of the body to defend itself from infection by or reactivation of MVC. The body of data indicating the importance of immune function in MCC pathogenesis has been exploited for the development of immunotherapies discussed below. Diagnosis Photomicrographs of a typical Merkel-cell carcinoma at a 4x, b 40x, and c–d 100x objectives. Hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrates small, undifferentiated cells with high N/C ratio and scanty cytoplasm. Typical immunopanel demonstrates positive staining with e cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (100x oil immersion), f CK 20 (100x oil immersion), and neuroendocrine markers such as g chromogranin (100x oil immersion). Diagnosis of MCC begins with a clinical examination of the skin and lymph nodes. Following clinical exam, definitive diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) requires examination of biopsy tissue to identify its histopathologic features. An ideal biopsy specimen is either a punch biopsy or a full- thickness incisional biopsy of the skin including full-thickness dermis and subcutaneous fat. On light microscopy, MCC shows basaloid tumor nests with neuroendocrine features (\\"salt and pepper\\" chromatin, scarce cytoplasm, and brisk mitotic activity). In addition to standard examination under light microscopy, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is also generally required to differentiate MCC from other morphologically similar tumors such as small cell lung cancer, the small cell variant of melanoma, various cutaneous leukemic/lymphoid neoplasms, and Ewing's sarcoma. Neuroendocrine molecular markers such as synaptophysin or chromogranin A are characteristic of MCC and other neuroendocrine tumors, while other markers such as PAX5 or cytokeratin 20 can distinguish MCC from these tumors. Longitudinal imaging may also help in ruling out a diagnosis of metastatic small cell lung cancer. Once an MCC diagnosis is made, a sentinel lymph node biopsy as well as other imaging is recommended as a part of the staging work-up needed to determine prognosis and subsequent treatment options.  Prevention  Sunlight exposure is thought to be one of the causes of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). The World Health Organization, American Academy of Dermatology, and Skin Cancer Foundation recommend the following measures to prevent excessive UV exposure and skin cancer: * Limiting sun exposure between the hours of 10am and 4pm, when UV rays are the strongest * Seeking shade when UV rays are most intense * Wearing sun-protective clothing including a wide brim hat, sunglasses, and tightly- woven, loose-fitting clothing * Using sunscreen * Avoiding tanning beds and artificial UV exposure Treatment MCC is rare and expedient referral to radiation oncology is critical. MCC will quickly relapse following any attempted excisional biopsy. =Surgery= Surgery has a primarily historical role in management of MCC and its use in treatment is controversial, beyond gaining a biopsy proven diagnosis. Any area that has received surgical resection (excisional biopsy) will be covered with radiation therapy with a margin. Although there are no head to head trials studying the two treatment forms, MCC is exquistely radiosensitive and excellent locoregional control with radiation alone is achieved often better than with radiation therapy preceded by neoadjuvant surgery. In addition, MCC has a predilection for the head and neck region, a site in which surgery leads to substandard, generally mutilating effects. =Radiation = Radiation therapy is the primary management of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). The largest series we have are from Australia and have demonstrated that radiotherapy alone achieves equal outcomes with upfront or neoadjuvant surgery followed by radiation therapy. The role of surgery is largely historical and relegated to biopsy. There have been no head to head trials comparing the two treatment strategies, and in the absence of this, surgeons tend to most commonly perform excisional biopsy prior to referring for radiation therapy to eradicate MCC. MCC is exquisitely radiosensitive. The conclusion amongst published studies in the Radiation Oncology community is that MCC should be managed ideally with radiation therapy alone. =Chemotherapy= Because of its significant adverse effects, traditional chemotherapy has been saved for late-stage highly metastasized cases of MCC. While some chemotherapeutic regiments have been shown to have transient effects, studies have not found any significant long-term effect on recurrence rate or life expectancy. As of 2015, there were no FDA-approved standard chemotherapy regimens for MCC treatment. The most recent American guidelines do not recommend adjuvant chemotherapy, citing a lack of evidence to suggest improved outcomes. Instead, consideration of the need for chemotherapy on a case-by-case basis is recommended. = Drug therapy = Immunotherapies, namely inhibitors of the PD1-PDL1 checkpoint signaling pathway, are novel anticancer agents that have shown benefit in advanced-stage MCC or chemotherapy-resistant MCC. The PD-1 pathway is responsible for regulating the balance between T-cell activation and over-activation leading to T-cell exhaustion or autoimmunity. However, over-expression of PD-1 ligands (PDL1) have been observed in tumors as a method of evading immune attack. PD-1 inhibition therefore enhances the body's immune response, enabling it to target cancer cells for destruction. Due to their side effects, however, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend PD-1 inhibitors for people with disseminated rather than early-stage MCC. PD1/PDL1 pathway inhibitors approved or in clinical trials for use in MCC treatment include: * In March 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Avelumab, a PDL1 inhibitor, to treat adults and children above 12 years with metastatic MCC.FDA approves first treatment for rare form of skin cancer FDA News Release, March 23, 2017 * In December 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®, Merck & Co. Inc.) for all ages (adults and pediatrics) with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma FDA News Release, December 19, 2018 * Nivolumab (brand name Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb) is in phase III/IV clinical trials * Ipilimumab (brand name Yervoy, Bristol-Myers Squibb) is in phase II clinical trials for use in adults with metastatic MCC. Studies to date have shown a clinical response rate between 50-65% for MCC treated with PD-1 pathway inhibitors. Suggestions for further immunotherapy research areas have included therapeutic vaccines or epigenetic modification of HLA- receptors.  Prognosis  According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the natural course of MCC is “variable and depends heavily on the stage at diagnosis\\". Staging of MCC is classified according to the TNM staging system, a notation system that describes the stage of cancer according to the size of the primary tumor (T), the degree of spread to regional lymph nodes (N), and the presence of distant metastasis (M). A combination of T, N, and M stages dictate the final clinical stage group (0, I, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IV). Advanced stage (i.e. increased size of the tumor, spreading of the tumor into surrounding and/or distant tissue, and involvement of lymph nodes) is associated with lower survival rates. The National Cancer Data Base has survival rates collected from nearly 3000 MCC patients from year 1996–2000 with 5-year survival rates listed as follows: Stage IA: 80%. Stage IB: 60%. Stage IIA: 60%. Stage IIB: 50%. Stage IIC: 50%. Stage IIIA: 45%. Stage IIIB: 25%. Stage IV: 20%. 5 yr survival may be 51% among people with localized disease, 35% for those with nodal disease, and 14% with metastases to a distant site. Several other features may also affect prognosis, independent of tumor stage. They include MCV viral status, histological features, and immune status. In viral status, MCV large tumor antigen (LT antigen) and retinoblastoma protein (RB protein) expression correlates with more favorable prognosis, while p63 expression correlates with a poorer prognosis. Histological features such as intratumoral CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration may be associated with a favorable prognosis, while lymphovascular infiltrative pattern may be associated with a poorer prognosis. Immune status, especially T cell immunosuppression (e.g., organ transplant, HIV infection, certain malignancy) predicts poorer prognosis and higher mortality. The antibody titer in the blood to the Merkel cell polyomavirus oncoprotein can be used as a treatment response biomarker in people that have detectable antibodies at the time of diagnosis. Epidemiology Merkel cell carcinoma occurs most often in Caucasians between 60 and 80 years of age. Its incidence is about twice as high in males as in females. It is a rare type of skin cancer, with a 2013 incidence of only 0.7 per 100,000 persons in the U.S. As of 2005, roughly 2,500 new cases of MCC are diagnosed each year in the United States, as compared to around 60,000 new cases of malignant melanoma and over 1 million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Similar to melanoma, the incidence of MCC in the US is increasing rapidly. Worldwide, MCC is most commonly found in regions with increased sun exposure. Australia is the country with the highest incidence of MCC but has a lower incidence of MCV-positive MCC than observed in other countries. Since 2006, it has been known that other primary cancers increase the risk of MCC significantly, especially in those with the prior multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and malignant melanoma. Immunosuppression including HIV infection or immunosuppressant therapy following organ transplant or for autoimmune disease can also increase the odds of developing MCC. History Friedrich Sigmund Merkel (1845-1919) was a German anatomist and histopathologist who first described the Tastzellen (touch cells) in the skin in 1875. In 1878 the term Merkel cell was coined by the anatomist Robert Bonnet (1851–1921). Merkel-cell carcinoma was first described in 1972 by Cyril Toker. He reported five cases of 'trabecular carcinoma of the skin'.

Most scalds are considered first or second degree burns, but third degree burns can result, especially with prolonged contact. The term is from the Latin word calidus, meaning hot.Mosby's Medical, Nursing & Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book Inc., 1994, p. 1395. Causes Most scalds result from exposure to high-temperature water, such as tap water in baths and showers or cooking water, or from spilled hot drinks, such as coffee. Scalds can be more severe when steam impinges on the naked skin, because steam can reach higher temperatures than water and transfers latent heat by condensation. On the other hand when clothes are soaked with hot water the heat transfer is often of a longer duration since the body part cannot be removed from the heat source as quickly. The temperature of tap water should not exceed 38–45 °C to prevent discomfort and scalding.German and European norm DIN EN 806-2 asks for a maximum of 45 °C in public buildings. The temperature in care homes and childcare is not to exceed 43 °C with a maximum of 38 °C in showers. The German guideline VDI 3818 generally recommends 40 °C for public bathrooms and toilets. However, it is necessary to keep warm water at a temperature of 55–60 °C to inhibit the growth of legionella bacteria. Water at 60 °C can induce scalding injuries in less than 3 seconds, while it takes 10 seconds to get an injury at 57 °C and 1.5 to 2 minutes in 52 °C hot water.FAQ Thermostatic mixing valves – Why is it important to have a thermostatic mixing valve?, ESBE AB, Sweden Scalds are generally more common in children, especially from the accidental spilling of hot liquids.  Treatment  Applying first aid for scalds is the same as for burns. First, the site of the injury should be removed from the source of heat, to prevent further scalding. If the burn is at least second degree, remove any jewelry or clothing from the site, unless it is already stuck to the skin. Cool the scald for about 20 minutes with cool or lukewarm (not cold) water, such as water from a tap.Burns and scalds - NHS Choices, Treating Burns and Scalds. With second-degree burns, blisters will form, but should never be popped, as it only increases chances of infection. With third-degree burns, it is best to wrap the injury very loosely to keep it clean, and seek expert medical attention. =Treatments to avoid= Ice should be avoided, as it can do further damage to area around the injury,The Dos and Don'ts of Burns, What's the best way to treat a burn? as should butter, toothpaste, and specialized creams.

The Joy of Cooking. New York: Signet, 1973. . At this temperature, bacteria are killed, enzymes in the milk are destroyed, and many of the proteins are denatured. In cooking, milk is typically scalded to increase its temperature, or to change the consistency or other cooking interactions due to the denaturing of proteins. Recipes that call for scalded milk include café au lait, baked milk, and ryazhenka. Scalded milk is used in yogurt to make the proteins unfold, and to make sure that all organisms that could out-compete the yogurt culture's bacteria are killed. Milk is both scalded and also cooled in many recipes, such as for bread and other yeast doughs, as pasteurization does not kill all bacteria, and the wild yeasts that may also be present can alter the texture and flavor. In addition, scalding milk improves the rise due to inhibition of bread rise by certain undenatured milk proteins.Corriher, Shirley.

He was also a poet and songwriter and was widely admired for his excellent command of Sinhala. Abeysekera wrote the lyrics to over 2,000 songs, a record for a lyricist in Sri Lanka. His compositions are still covered by some of the island's top musicians to this day, introducing his lyrics to new audiences in South Asia, and his songs are played regularly by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Early years Abeysekera was born on 3 June 1930 in Ratmale near Matara in Southern Sri Lanka. He was educated at Nalanda College Colombo. Some of his notable classmates at Nalanda College were Dr Gunadasa Amarasekara, Stanley Jayasinghe, Dr Harischandra Wijayatunga, Dr Hudson Silva, Hon. Rupa Karunathilake, Hon. Dr Dharmasena Attygalle, Dr Henry Jayasena, Bernie Wijesekera. Siri Perera was Abeysekera's Sinhala language teacher at Nalanda. He was discovered by the children's radio programme Ḷamā Piṭiya (\\"Children's Field\\") hosted by Siri Aiya (also known as U.A.S. Perera - Siri Perera QC) and broadcast over Radio Ceylon, the oldest radio station in South Asia. Ḷamā Piṭiya was a showcase for young talents, and Abeysekera performed with his poems on the Radio Ceylon programme in the 1940s. He was an instant hit with the general public and remained a pop icon until his death. His younger brother Daya Abeysekara was a renowned journalist and an actor. He died on 29 March 2019 at the age of 80. Funeral will be held on 31 March 2019 at Kanatte Cemetery. A teenage broadcaster Abeysekera was a pioneering Sinhala broadcaster. He was a rare breed, a \\"teenage broadcaster\\" launching a broadcasting career with Radio Ceylon, which he joined in 1950 at the age of 20. In 1958 he was sent to London for specialist broadcasting training with the BBC. Studio 5 of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation has been named after him. Career Abeysekera was an announcer, compere, lyricist, dialogue writer, and poet - he also wrote children's stories. He worked very closely with another famous broadcaster, Vernon Corea. It was one of the most productive radio partnerships in Sri Lanka. His songs have been sung by a range of musicians, among them Pundit Amaradeva, Nanda Malini, H. R. Jothipala, Milton Mallawarachchi, J. A. Milton Perera and Mignonne Fernando and the Jetliners. Karunaratne Abeysekera won the prestigious Sarasaviya Awards for his lyrics on two occasions. The Government of Sri Lanka named a road after him in the capital city of Colombo. Pioneer Sinhala cricket commentator Abeysekera made history in the world of radio by being the first cricket commentator using the Sinhala language. He commentated on matches played by Ceylon against visiting English, Indian and Australian teams from the 1950s to the 1970s. He also commentated on local cricket matches. He had to devise cricket terminology to describe cricketing actions - this was uncharted territory in Sinhala; his words to describe various aspects of cricket are used to this day.

Known in classical antiquity as Sebennytos (), Samannud is a historic city that has been inhabited since the Ancient Egyptian period. As of 2019, the population of the markaz of Samannud was estimated to be 410,388, with 83,417 people living in urban areas and 326,971 in rural areas. Etymology Historically, Samannud was called Sebennytos or Sebennytus (, also in late Coptic ⲥⲉⲃⲉⲛⲛⲏⲧⲟⲩ and ⲥⲉⲃⲉⲛⲛⲉⲧⲟⲩ, ,Ptolemy iv. 5. § 50, Stephanus of Byzantium or ,Strabo xvii. p. 802 Egyptian: ṯb-(n)-nṯr). The name Samannud ultimately derives from the Ancient Egyptian name ṯb-(n)-nṯr, meaning \\"city of the sacred calf\\". The name was probably pronounced * in Old Egyptian and * or * in Late Egyptian.Loprieno, Antonio (1995) Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, , p. 34 Ancient history Samannud (Sebennytos) was an ancient city of Lower Egypt, located on the now-silted up Sebennytic branch of the Nile in the Delta. Sebennytos was the capital of Lower Egypt's twelfth nome—the Sebennyte nome (district). Sebennytos was also the seat of the Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt (380–343 BCE). Sebennytos is perhaps best known as the hometown of Manetho, a historian and chronicler from the Ptolemaic era, c. 3rd century BC. Sebennytos was also the hometown of Nectanebo II; he was its last ruler.Bill Manley, The Seventy Great Mysteries of Ancient Egypt\\" Thames & Hudson Ltd, 2003. p.101 A temple dedicated to the local god Anhur, or Anhur-Shu, and his lioness goddess mate Mehit, once existed at this location but is now reduced to ruins. A fragment from the location where kings would have made offerings to Anhur and his wife, is on display at the Walters Art Museum. Modern history Samannud violently resisted the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 639, and remained rebellious for some time thereafter; the city revolted four times in the first half of the eighth century. Three Coptic Patriarchs came from Samannud: John III, Cosmas II, and John V. The 12th-century Coptic philologist Yuhanna al-Samannudi also came from Samannud, and served as its bishop. Samannud's bishopric remained active through the late thirteenth century, indicating the presence of a large Christian population at the time. In 1843, John Gardner Wilkinson described it as a place of some size, with the usual bazaars of the large towns of Egypt, and famous for its pottery, which was sent to Cairo. The 1885 Census of Egypt recorded Samannud as a city in its own district in Gharbia Governorate; at that time, the population of the city was 11,550 (5,686 men and 5,864 women). In religious traditions In a Coptic tradition, Sebennytos was part of the route of the Holy Family during the flight into Egypt narrated in the Gospel of Matthew (2:13–23).

Plot Dean Youngblood, a 17-year-old farmhand from rural New York, has dreams of playing in the National Hockey League. Dean voices these dreams to his father who disapproves, however Dean's brother, Kelly, convinces their father to relent. Dean travels to Canada to try out for the Hamilton Mustangs where he demonstrates his offensive skills but displays a lack of physical toughness. Carl Racki, who is competing for a spot, engages him in a fight and quickly defeats him. Despite this, the Mustangs head coach, a former NHL All- Star, selects Dean for the team. Dean also begins a flirtation with the coach's daughter, Jessie. After his team mentor, Derek Sutton, is deliberately injured by Racki (now with a rival team), Dean returns home. His brother inspires him to keep playing, and his father teaches him some fighting skills. Dean returns to the team, ready to confront Racki in the final game of the Memorial Cup playoffs. The game ends with a game-winning goal by Dean with 3 seconds left. As time expires, he confronts and defeats Racki in a fight and is carried off the ice on the shoulders of his teammates. Cast *Rob Lowe as Dean Youngblood *Patrick Swayze as Derek Sutton *Cynthia Gibb as Jessie Chadwick *Eric Nesterenko as Blane Youngblood. A 20 year NHL veteran, Nesterenko was also the film's hockey consultant. *Jim Youngs as Kelly Youngblood *Ed Lauter as Murray Chadwick, the Mustangs Coach *Keanu Reeves as Heaver, the Mustangs goalie. Reeves had played goalie while in high school, earning the nickname \\"The Wall\\". *George Finn as Carl Racki (billed as George J. Finn). Finn was a former junior player in the Ontario Hockey League *Peter Faussett as Huey Hewitt *Simon Herring as Guard *Fionnula Flanagan as Miss McGill Many of the other team members in the film were actual junior or NCAA hockey players, including Steve Thomas, Peter Zezel (both of whom had lengthy NHL careers), Don Biggs, and James Richmond. Production The filming of Youngblood took place in the east end of Toronto in the summer of 1984. Ted Reeve Arena was used as the setting for the interior of the Hamilton Mustangs home rink while Scarborough Gardens Arena was used for the setting of the arena's exterior. St Michaels College School arena was used as well. Several of the cast and crew had actual hockey experience and skills, though star Rob Lowe had to learn to skate, and both he and Patrick Swayze, a better skater, used doubles for many of their on-ice skating scenes. Director and writer Peter Markle was a former minor-pro and international player for the USA. Cinematographer Mark Irwin, a Canadian, wore skates and a helmet and devised a special rig for shooting hockey scenes on the ice. The film's hockey consultant Eric Nesterenko was a two decade NHL veteran who also appeared as the father of the film's lead character. Keanu Reeves played goalie growing up and in high school. George Finn, who played villain Carl Racki, was a former OHL enforcer. Many of the other team members were actual NCAA or junior hockey players, some of whom went on to significant NHL careers. Lowe later said he \\"hated\\" learning how to skate. \\"I don't like any sport where you're already exhausted when you're done putting on the equipment. But that said, once I got the equipment on and was out on the ice, I loved that. I loved hitting people, being hit, skating. I love the exertion and competition, so that was all great. But it's a lot of work putting all of that shit on! Give me a surfboard and let me just paddle into the ocean.\\" Reception The film gained a mediocre reception, with critics finding the plot derivative. However, it became a popular VHS video rental and cable TV showing.

It publishes seven days a week, and contends for circulation and advertising in a 15-county area. History The Journal Gazette traces its origins to 1863 when The Fort Wayne Gazette was founded. It was originally founded to support Lincoln and oppose slavery. In 1899, The Fort Wayne Gazette merged with The Journal to create The Journal Gazette. The Journal Gazette has always been a privately owned newspaper. In 1950, in conjunction with the local owner of The News-Sentinel, The Journal Gazette entered into one of the first joint operating agreements for competing daily newspapers in the United States. That required a special act of Congress. (In 1970, Congress passed the Newspaper Preservation Act, codifying JOAs and exempting them from certain antitrust provisions.) Under the arrangement, The Journal Gazette and The News-Sentinel have independent editorial staffs and management, while a jointly owned corporation, Fort Wayne Newspapers, sells advertising, handles circulation, prints the newspapers and, since 1958, has been landlord to the newspapers' staffs. In 1980 Knight Ridder bought The News-Sentinel and The Journal Gazette (with new joint operating agreement provisions) agreed to extend the JOA through 2020. In 2003 the JOA was again renegotiated with additional protections for the minority owners and an agreement to build a new downtown press facility. In 2003, Knight Ridder sold all of its papers to The McClatchy Company, which in turn sold the NS to Ogden Newspapers of Wheeling, West Virginia. The JG had its third JOA partner, but remained locally owned and controlled. In October of 2017, The News-Sentinel's owners decided to cease publication of their print product, but The Journal Gazette agreed to publish a page of News-Sentinel content Monday through Saturday.

The afternoon News-Sentinel was politically independent. The papers last online edition was April 23,2020 and their last employee was terminated on April 28, 2020. Early history The News-Sentinel traces its origins to 1833, when The Sentinel was established as a weekly paper. The Sentinel was owned for a year and half in 1878-79 by Fort Wayne native William Rockhill Nelson who went on to found and make his fortune with The Kansas City Star. In 1918, The Sentinel merged with another local paper, The Fort Wayne Daily News, to form The News- Sentinel. The Foellinger years In 1932, Helene Foellinger joined her father's newspaper, The Fort Wayne News-Sentinel, as a reporter, feature writer and - after convincing her father of the need - the newspaper's first women's editor. She was a new college graduate, but she studied mathematics, not journalism. In 1935, her father named her to the board of directors, expecting her to advance into his shoes when he retired - but in October 1936, he died unexpectedly. She became the youngest publisher of a major daily newspaper in the United States, as well as one of the few females in that position. She was up to the challenge, though, increasing circulation about 20% - from 56,700 to 67,800 - in just five years. Ernest \\"Ernie\\" Williams, a reporter early in Helene Foellinger's reign, became editor, and a number of talented reporters from The News-Sentinel went on to positions on newspapers in larger cities and in broadcast journalism. In 1950, Foellinger formed a joint operating agreement with the rival morning newspaper, The Journal Gazette. Each newspaper is separately managed and has separate editorial staffs, but Fort Wayne Newspapers provides advertising sales, circulation, and printing services used by both newspapers, and in 1958, built a new printing plant with offices for both newspapers. On the strength of The News-Sentinel, they ended up with a 55% share of Fort Wayne Newspapers, and Foellinger served as president. Awards In 1983, The News-Sentinel was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for \\"its courageous and resourceful coverage of a devastating flood in March 1982\\". It was also honoured in 1992 as the Blue Ribbon Newspaper of the Year by the Hoosier State Press Association. Recent years Helene Foellinger was 70, and there was no family member poised to take over The News-Sentinel, in 1980, when she sold News Publishing, along with the 55% share of Fort Wayne Newspapers, to Knight-Ridder in 1980. In the 1980s, The News-Sentinel was still the dominant newspaper in Fort Wayne, with daily circulation in excess of 60,000, compared to about 10,000 less for The Journal Gazette. Moreover, their circulation was (and is) largely concentrated in Fort Wayne, making it especially attractive to city merchants. Circulation for large daily newspapers, particularly evening newspapers, has dropped in recent years. Today, The News-Sentinel has a daily circulation of 31,213 while The Journal Gazette has used its Sunday edition to build daily circulation to 73,058. In 2003, a 30-year extension to the joint operating agreement was inked. At that point, Knight Ridder boosted its ownership from 55% to 75%, at a cost of $42 million. Fort Wayne Newspapers is spending $34.8 million to upgrade their printing presses, just west of the current plant at 600 W. Main Street. In 1997, Knight Ridder bought The Kansas City Star, completing a circle of sorts. Knight Ridder was bought by The McClatchy Company in June 2006. On August 24, 2017, it was announced that the News-Sentinel will cease daily production of a physical print edition, with a focus on digital content. The morning delivery Fort Wayne paper, The Journal Gazette, will carry some articles using The News-Sentinel content in its daily printed morning delivery. The two papers have a contract with each other that dates back to 1950, and runs through 2075. Purchase by Ogden Newspapers On March 14, 2006, McClatchy announced that it would sell 12 of the Knight Ridder newspapers, including The News-Sentinel, that are in markets not growing rapidly. Current and former News-Sentinel staffers disagreed on the significance. Mary Jacobus, publisher of The News-Sentinel, joined The Boston Globe on January 2006 as president and general manager. During her four-year tenure, newsroom employment dropped 29%. Like The News-Sentinel, The Boston Globe was experiencing tough times, with 8% losses in daily and Sunday circulation in the prior year. McClatchy reached an agreement to sell The News-Sentinel to Ogden Newspapers of West Virginia. Michael J. Christman, who was publishing two newspapers in Parkersburg, West Virginia was named the new publisher. The closing took place on June 27, 2006, simultaneously with the completion of McClatchy's acquisition of Knight Ridder. Ogden Newspapers is privately owned by members of the Nutting family. In the week prior to the sale, internet classified advertising giant Craigslist entered the Fort Wayne market. On August 10, 2018, seven of the remaining eight employees were laid off. Attributing the staff reduction to a \\"business decision\\", publisher Michael Christman said, “We'll still have a website. We'll still have a page in The Journal Gazette every Monday through Saturday. And we'll still have a presence at key events in the area.” Scott Stanford was named by Ogden Newspapers as the new publisher February 27, 2019.

Founded as a one-sheet (later to expand to four to six pages) by Bill Landis, an NYU graduate, projectionist, and devotee of the crime-ridden sleaze houses, the magazine not only captured the genre affections but the whole Times Square milieu of drugs, violence and prostitution. Typical films featured in the magazine, which centered 42nd Street, included Bamboo House of Dolls, The Corpse Grinders, Mad Monkey Kung Fu, Miss Nymphet’s Zap-In and The Ultimate Degenerate. Approximately 48 issues were published over a five-year period, the first issue being dated June 18, 1980, and the last issue appearing in the fall of 1985. In 1999, Bill Landis and Michelle Clifford (co-author of the Kenneth Anger biography, Anger) began to publish Sleazoid Express again. Seven issues of the revamped magazine were published, each issue running more than 70 pages. The seventh issue from 2005, never mentioned on the magazine’s website and only advertised via private email correspondence, was a biography of Bloodsucking Freaks director Joel M Reed. This was followed in 2007 by ’30 Years on the Deuce: The Wicked Die Slow’, a collection of older articles written by Landis in the 1980s and 1990s for The Soho Weekly News, The Village Voice, Swank and the original Sleazoid Express. In 2002, excerpts from old issues, along with new material from Landis and Clifford, were compiled into the book Sleazoid Express: A Mind Twisting Tour Through the Grindhouse Cinema of Times Square, released by Simon and Schuster.

He served as the fourth Prime Minister of Barbados from 1987 to 1994. As of 2010, Sir Lloyd is serving as Barbados' first resident ambassador in Beijing, China. Biography Sandiford was born in Barbados and educated at the Coleridge and Parry School, Harrison College and the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, where he received his Bachelor of Arts in English. He then studied at Britain's University of Manchester, receiving his Master's degree in economics and social studies. Sandiford returned to Barbados, where he joined the Democratic Labour Party (DLP). In 1967, one year after independence, he was appointed to the Senate. Sandiford left the Senate to run in the 1971 election, in which he won a seat in the House of Assembly. The DLP, under Errol Barrow, formed the government; Sandiford served in many cabinet positions including as Minister of Education. The DLP lost the 1976 election to the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) and formed the opposition. In 1986, the DLP was again voted into power, with Sandiford defeating BLP MP Lionel Seymour Craig in the Saint Michael South constituency. Sandiford was made Deputy Prime Minister under Barrow. In 1987, Barrow died prematurely and Sandiford was appointed as Prime Minister. He led the DLP to victory in the 1991 elections. In 1994 Sandiford narrowly lost a no confidence motion brought against him by the opposition when a number of members of his own party broke ranks and voted in support of the motion. Sandiford then called elections for 1994, two years before they were constitutionally due, but lost to the BLP led by Owen Arthur. He remained in parliament until 1999 and is currently a tutor at the Barbados Community College, where he teaches economics and Caribbean Politics. In 2000 Sandiford was conferred the highest honour in Barbados; he was made a Knight of St. Andrew (KA) of the Order of Barbados. In April 2008 under Prime Minister David Thompson a resolution was brought to the Parliament of Barbados that the building now called the Sherbourne Conference Centre, which in fact was the idea and brainchild of Sir Lloyd, should be renamed the Sir Lloyd Erskine Sandiford Conference Centre. Sandiford was later appointed as Ambassador to China, presenting his credentials on 3 March 2010.

It commemorates Union Army soldiers and sailors who served in the American Civil War. It is an enlarged version of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, and was designed by the firm of Stoughton & Stoughton with Paul E. M. DuBoy. The monument was completed in 1902. History =Early history= The monument was first suggested in 1869. However, little was done to create the monument until 1893 – at a time the memory of the war was fading and there was a wave of nostalgia for the Civil War in the country – when the New York State legislature established a Board of Commissioners for a monument to the soldiers and sailors who had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Originally set to be built at Fifty-ninth Street and Fifth Avenue then at Mount Tom (83rd Street and Riverside Drive) the project was delayed for many years because many organizations in the city could not agree on a site for the monument. When the final site was selected, the winning design for the monument had to be redesigned for the new site. Ground was broken for the monument on September 21, 1900. Mr. Guggenheimer turned the first spadeful of dirt. About 200 people were present at the ground breaking ceremony. The first stone was laid in January 1901. On the cornerstone was a simple inscription saying that the monument was erected by the citizens of New York. It was finally dedicated on Memorial Day in 1902 with President Theodore Roosevelt officiating. During the dedication, the monument was unveiled following a parade of Civil War veterans up Riverside Drive. The memorial bears the simple inscription: \\"To the memory of the brave soldiers and sailors who saved the Union\\". The monument cost $300,000 to erect. Granite quarried from the Lacasse Quarry located at Derby, Orleans County, Vermont, was used in the construction.T. Nelson, The Commercial Granites of New England, USGS Bulletin 738, 1923:101. The white marble monument was designed after a public competition won by architects Charles and Arthur Stoughton. Their design was known as the \\"Temple of Fame\\". The ornamental features were carved by Paul E. M. Duboy (1857–1907), who also was the architect of The Ansonia, an apartment building also on the Upper West Side. Inspired by Greek antiquity, the monument is based on the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens. The monument takes the form of a peripteral Corinthian temple raised on a high base, with a tall cylindrical rusticated cella, that carries a low conical roof like a lid, ringed by twelve Corinthian columns. Plinths at the entrance to the raised terrace are incised with the names of the New York volunteer regiments and the battles in which they served, as well as Union generals. =Repairs and reconstruction= The monument c. 1908 By 1907, there were already reports by Mayor George B. McClellan Jr., that the Monument was in need of repair. At that time there were marble slabs in danger of falling from their place; three had already fallen. The building badly leaked, cement was constantly falling from the walls and ceiling, and stone was chipped in many places. He requested $20,000 for the repair of the monument. A large adjustment to the monument took place in the 1930s, when the plaza's yellow brick, which nicely contrasted with the white marble trim, was replaced with the orange-colored stone common to Parks Department projects of the period. However, these have since chipped and are splitting. The memorial was also given a complete coating of protective paraffin, used at that time to preserve the memorial. In 1962, the City spent over $1 million in extensive repairs to the monument, including a new roof, which had deteriorated, and portions of the monument were replaced with more durable granite. The Parks Department had proposed a $1.2 million restoration in 2002. The effort was to restore the monument's steps and sidewalks. It does not appear this was ever completed, because the effort failed when a private donor pulled out. In July 2005, the New York Times reported \\"up close the dilapidation is clearly visible. Pave-stones, many damaged by skateboarding and soccer playing, need replacing. The paint covering the many splotches of graffiti is tacky. And the tomblike interior, which is leaking, has long been closed to the public. Major work last took place in 1962.\\" In 2007, Gale Brewer, a member of the City Council, committed $650,000 in city money to a redesign of the potholed asphalt plaza south of the monument, with its three Civil War-era cannons. However, that effort bogged down in disagreement on the exact nature of the designs and was never completed. A fence was put up to keep people off the entry stairs because they were in very poor condition in 2008.Manhattan CB7 meeting notes, nyc.gov (January 2, 2008) In March 2014, an attempt to raise $5.5 million was attempted by the Riverside Park Conservancy following a $1.5 million survey done by the park system. The monument currently has many coatings of anti-graffiti paint. The ornamental bronze doorway has been damaged by vandals. At some point the richly sculptured bronze flagpole base, which featured ship forms, wreaths and other elements, was removed. The park system noted, \\"the monument is awaiting funding to repair loosened joints, chipped stone, and the damage generally wrought by time if not vandalism.\\" =Landmark status= The monument was designated a New York City landmark in 1976. The New York Landmark Commission designated the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument a state landmark in 2001. Design The central structure of the monument in 2016 The monument was intended to stand at the center of a complex sequence of balustraded formal paved terraces and stairs that would have rationalized the steep natural slopes to north and west, but were eliminated in the execution.The paved plaza that leads to it was renovated in 1937 and again in 2008; three bronze cannon, each weighing 8508 pounds, are inscribed with their weight, the maker's initials (S.C.L. S. McM. & CO) and the date 1865. Its siting at a curve in Riverside Drive makes it visible from a distance, a desirable feature for a monument in the City Beautiful movement, of which this Beaux-Arts monument is a prime example. Originally, there was a planned stairway to the river and a battlemented wall to the south but these were never built. It appears that the area south of the plaza was simply paved, or perhaps treated with pebbles. On the south side of the monument are two mounted cannons. On the west side of the memorial, the back steps to the terraces offer views of the Hudson River. The monument measures approximately tall and deep.Staff (ndg) \\"Riverside Park Soldiers and Sailors Monument\\" New York City Department of Parks and Recreation The initial design called for the monument to be crowned with a statue of Peace \\"of heroic size\\" but this was not done. The sculptured bronze door at the base of the monument, now kept locked, was originally open to visitors. Currently, the interior is open one day annually at Open House New York. The interior is entirely revetted with the same veined white marble used on the exterior. The interior is in two stages, with six niches in the lower stage, corresponding to the exterior basement, and an upper stage of tall Corinthian pilasters flanking plain panels; above is a ribbed interior dome with a central lantern. The mosaic on the floor is a star centered on a bronze relief medallion of the US arms, with crossed oak and laurel sprays. The exterior colonnade carries an entablature adorned with a full frieze containing the inscriptions \\"To the memory of the Brave Soldiers and Sailors Who Saved the Union,\\" A cresting of eagles alternating with cartouches surmounts the cornice. The monument terminates in a low conical roof crowned by a richly decorated marble finial. The Riverside Park Conservancy maintains the plantings in the area surrounding the monument. Use =Parades and celebrations= Many huge Memorial Day celebrations have been centered on this monument. The number of people and interest in the Memorial Day celebrations at this monument has varied greatly and at times has been very significant. On Memorial Day 1907, 16,000 men marched in a GAR Parade. However, in 1910, in a celebration headed by President Taft, only 1,500 showed up. In 1911, 20,000 men and 150 organizations took part in the Memorial Day parade. Then in 1914, 9,000 men were noted in the New York Times article, in a parade from 72nd street to the monument. In 1922, the Memorial Day parade attracted 14,000 participants. The numbers dwindled down and in the 1990s attracted only a few dozen people. After the September 11 attacks, the numbers grew. =Backdrops= In addition to annual Memorial Day celebrations, the monument has been used in the scenes and as a backdrop of movies such as The Odd Couple,The Odd Couple Film Locations.

This is the centre (Km 0) of the radial network of Spanish roads. The square also contains the famous clock whose bells mark the traditional eating of the Twelve Grapes and the beginning of a new year. The New Year's celebration has been broadcast live since 31 December 1962 on major radio and television networks including Antena 3 and RTVE.  History  Tiled street-sign of Puerta del Sol with a historic depiction of the square The Puerta del Sol originated as one of the gates in the city wall that surrounded Madrid in the 15th century. Outside the wall, medieval suburbs began to grow around the Christian Wall of the 12th century. The name of the gate came from the rising sun which decorated the entry, since the gate was oriented to the east. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, the area was an important meeting place: as the goal for the couriers coming from abroad and other parts of Spain to the Post Office, it was visited by those eager for the latest news. The stairs to the Saint Philip church at the square were known as the Gradas de San Felipe, and were among the most prolific mentideros de la Corte (this Spanish idiom sounds as \\"lie-spreaders of the Court\\", but it is related with the verb mentar, \\"to say about someone\\", not mentir, \\"to lie\\", so it is more appropriately translated as \\"places of the City where people gossip\\"). The House of the Post Office was built by French architect Jacques Marquet between 1766 and 1768. The building was the headquarters of the Ministry of Interior and State Security in Francoist Spain. It is currently the seat of the Presidency of the Madrid Community.  Famous buildings and landmarks  The Puerta del Sol contains a number of well known sights both domestically and internationally associated with Spain. On the south side, the old Post Office now serves as the office of the President of Madrid, the head of the regional government of the Autonomous Community of Madrid (not to be confused with the Madrid City Council, which is housed elsewhere). Also on its south side, the square holds a mounted statue of Charles III of Spain, nicknamed \\"el rey alcalde\\" (\\"the mayor-king\\") due to the extensive public works program he set in motion. The famous Tío Pepe lighted sign was above the square's eastern building between the Calle de Alcalá and the Carrera de San Jerónimo (Apple store today) for a long time, now is on top of the former Paris Hotel. Also on the east side lies the statue of The Bear and the Strawberry Tree (in Spanish, el Oso y el Madroño), the heraldic symbol of Madrid. Until 2009, the statue stood on the north side at the entrance to Calle del Carmen. The Mariblanca (a female figure named for its white marble) is a copy of a statue (possibly of Venus, and so the restored pedestal claims), which marks the place of a former fountain displaying that figure. The kilómetro cero is a plaque on the ground directly north of the Post Office serving as the symbolic center of Spain. In addition to signalling the basis of numbering in the Spanish road system, the symbolic nature of the plaza ensures that it is the site of many rallies and protests, particularly against violence and war. Sol has seen protests against the terrorism perpetrated the March 11th attacks on commuter trains, and Spain's involvement in the Iraq War . In 2011, the square became established as a focal point and a symbol for the ongoing Spanish democracy demonstrations. The demonstrations included camping in the middle of the plaza (@acampadasol), which began on 15 May 2011 amidst the election campaign for city halls and Autonomous Communities governments and which was fueled by social media, particularly Twitter and Facebook. The demonstrations then spread to more than sixty other cities throughout Spain. Since 12 June 2011, the square has held a free-standing domed structure made from pallets, which served as an information point for the 15-M Movement. This continued throughout the summer of 2011 until the dawn of 2 August, when the national police decided to evict the structure and protestors. Currently, dozens of committees have their assemblies in the iconic square.  Location in Madrid  Real Casa de Correos at Puerta del Sol, Madrid. Puerta del Sol, Madrid. The Puerta is located in the very heart of Madrid. It serves as the kilometre zero from which all radial roads in Spain are measured. This is demonstrated by a plaque on the floor of the square, marking the exact point of Km.0. The old plaque was replaced in 2009, after the old one had become faded after years of foot traffic. It is also the reference for street numbers in Madrid, which begin at the street-end that is closest to Puerta del Sol. MadridPuertaDelSol Km0.jpg Km cero.JPG Immediately to the southwest lies the Plaza Mayor; the Palacio Real, the official home of the Royal Family, is further west. Parliament and the museum district are to the east and the train station Atocha is to the southeast. Under the square lies a public transport hub served by lines 1, 2 and 3 of the Madrid Metro. A commuter service was inaugurated on 27 June 2009, four years behind schedule. The lateness of the construction was in part due to the discovery of the remains of the Church of Our Lady of Good Success during the excavation of the main chamber. The new station connects the Puerta to Madrid's commuter rail system and, by extension, to Spain's railroads via direct connections to Atocha and Chamartín railway stations . The square connects several commercial and recreational areas together, and thus both it and the surrounding streets consist mainly of shopping establishments catering to locals and tourists alike, like the several El Corte Inglés department store buildings in Preciados Street, La Mallorquina cafe, and numerous, ever-changing restaurants. The area remains active late into the night and early morning since nearby bars and dance clubs often only start entertainment at 1 am. Street music is also common in the area. Side streets close to the square also contain residential flats, some small offices, and tourist hostels.  Other events  During New Year's Eve 2018-2019, the clock of the Puerta del Sol for the first time in history rang the bells according to the schedule of the Canary Islands. After the traditional twelve strokes of midnight, the clock delayed one hour its needles to adjust to the Canary hour and also gave the chimes at the same time as this archipelago.El reloj de la Puerta del Sol dará por primera vez este Fin de Año las campanadas para Canarias Gallery Image:Madrid Bear at Puerta del Sol.jpgBear and the Madroño Tree, heraldic symbol of Madrid File:Puerta del Sol de Madrid The statue by sculptor Antonio Navarro Santafe Madrid Spain Bear Statue.jpgNight time photo of the Bear and the Madroño Tree, heraldic symbol of Madrid File:El Oso y el Madroño and the Tio Pepe Neon Advertisment in the distance.JPGA sunset, the Bear and the Madroño Tree and the Tio Pepe Neon Advertisement in the distance File:Puerta del Sol in Madrid, Spain ' Tio Pepe Neon Advertisment ' photographed at Sunset.JPGPuerta del Sol, Tio Pepe Neon Advertisement photographed at Sunset File:Puerta del Sol Madrid King Carlos and Tio Pepe.jpgPuerta del Sol in Madrid with King Carlos III statue and Tio Pepe sign Image:Estatua ecuestre de Carlos III - 03.jpgMonument to King Charles III in front of the House of the Post Office Image:Tío Pepe Madrid 2008.jpgThe Tío Pepe advertisement is a landmark File:Street performer at Puerta del Sol in Madrid and Tío Pepe advertisement in the distance ' photographed at sunset.JPGA Street artist at Puerta del Sol and the Tio Pepe Neon Advertisement photographed at Sunset.

Early life and family  Born in Brooklyn, New York, Troccoli was raised in Islip Terrace, Long Island, New York,Troccoli, 2001, p.5. where she graduated from East Islip High School. Her father died of colon cancer when she was 15; her mother died of breast cancer in 1991, shortly before the release of her album Pure Attraction and its mainstream chart selection, \\"Everything Changes\\". Troccoli was raised in a Catholic family, who was not particularly religious. As of 1998, she was a practicing Roman Catholic, but currently identifies as a non-denominational Christian. As of 2020, she continues to sing, speak and minister to the Church worldwide.  Musical career  After graduating from high school, Troccoli studied jazz and opera at the Berklee College of Music in Boston for a year, then returned to Long Island to major in voice at Suffolk County Community College (SCCC) also singing with a SCCC-based jazz band and later singing in Long Island clubs. In the summer of 1978, while working a \\"day job\\" to help cover her college expenses, Troccoli formed a friendship with a born again Christian co-worker; this led to Troccoli herself becoming a devout Christian. Troccoli's alto voice gained prominence when she opened for Ed Nalle's group, GLAD, when the group performed at the Long Island church Troccoli attended in 1980. Approximately six months afterwards, Nalle invited Troccoli to record a demo tape, with his band's backing, and Kathy accepted. After she and GLAD had recorded it, the tape was submitted to Michael Blanton and Dan Harrell (Amy Grant's brother-in-law); these two, as a result of hearing it, formed the Reunion Records label, in Nashville, specifically to record Troccoli, and Kathy herself, in turn, moved to Nashville to reside with Harrell and his family. Troccoli's debut album, the 1982 release Stubborn Love, was reportedly the best-selling debut album by a contemporary Christian music female artist. A second album, Heart and Soul, was released in 1984; it led to her receiving her first Grammy nomination a year later, in 1986, in which year Images followed it. Troccoli then withdrew from her musical career returning to Long Island for a six-year sojourn, giving singing lessons and sang at weddings. In 1989, Troccoli was prominently featured on the selection \\"I'll Be Your Shelter\\", a Diane Warren-penned song which Taylor Dayne recorded for her album Can't Fight Fate. \\"I'll Be Your Shelter\\" became a Top Ten single in 1990. After her mother's death, Troccoli returned to the Reunion Records label in 1991 for her secular album debut, Pure Attraction, whose lead single, \\"Everything Changes\\", Warren had written and composed for Taylor Dayne. Dayne had turned the selection down, however, and Joe Galante, then president of RCA Records, through which Reunion releases were distributed, offered it to Troccoli, who recalled: \\"He played it, and I knew I could own it. This was something I wanted to say.\\" Peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 in Billboard, \\"Everything Changes\\" also charted on the magazine's Adult Contemporary chart reaching No. 6. \\"Help Myself To You\\" became Troccoli's first No. 1 hit in her ten-year career, and began a string of GMA Music Awards nominations, including numerous attempts at Female Vocalist. Numerous hit songs came afterwards, including 1994's \\"My Life is in Your Hands\\", jointly written and composed with Bill Montvilo, which defined her career and inspired the devotional book of the same title, written in 1997, and 1995's \\"Go Light Your World\\", which began the rise of writer Chris Rice and was used for charity efforts that year. In 1996, Troccoli was featured on the Beach Boys's now out-of-print album Stars and Stripes Vol. 1, singing lead vocals on a cover of their 1969 song \\"I Can Hear Music\\", itself a cover of a Phil Spector song. The Beach Boys sing on the track as well, providing harmonies and backing vocals.  Media appearances  Over the years, Kathy has appeared on The Tonight Show, Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, The 700 Club, Entertainment Tonight, among others. She also appeared on Focus on the Family's video for teens, Sex, Lies, & The Truth. She has also been a regular co-host of the TV show \\"Red Letter Christians\\" with Tony Campolo. In 2010, she co-hosted a one-hour television program called The Mark and Kathy Show with Mark Lowry, on The Inspiration Network (later called INSP).

The result of this operation quickly removes all data from a table, typically bypassing a number of integrity enforcing mechanisms. It was officially introduced in the SQL:2008 standard. TRUNCATE TABLE removes all rows from a table, but the table structure and its columns, constraints, indexes, and so on remain. To remove the table definition in addition to its data, use the DROP TABLE statement. The \`TRUNCATE TABLE mytable\` statement is logically (though not physically) equivalent to the \`DELETE FROM mytable\` statement (without a \`WHERE\` clause). The following characteristics distinguish \`TRUNCATE TABLE\` from \`DELETE\`: * In the Oracle Database, \`TRUNCATE\` is implicitly preceded and followed by a commit operation. (This may also be the case in MySQL, when using a transactional storage engine.) * Typically, \`TRUNCATE TABLE\` quickly deletes all records in a table by deallocating the data pages used by the table. This reduces the resource overhead of logging the deletions, as well as the number of locks acquired. Records removed this way cannot be restored in a rollback operation. Two notable exceptions to this rule are the implementations found in PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server, both of which allow \`TRUNCATE TABLE\` statements to be committed or rolled back transactionally. * You cannot specify a \`WHERE\` clause in a \`TRUNCATE TABLE\` statement—it is all or nothing. * \`TRUNCATE TABLE\` cannot be used when a foreign key references the table to be truncated, since \`TRUNCATE TABLE\` statements do not fire triggers.

It is a special case of engineering overhead. Overhead can be a deciding factor in software design, with regard to structure, error correction, and feature inclusion. Examples of computing overhead may be found in functional programming, data transfer, and data structures. Software design =Choice of implementation= A programmer/software engineer may have a choice of several algorithms, encodings, data types or data structures, each of which have known characteristics. When choosing among them, their respective overhead should also be considered. =Tradeoffs= In software engineering, overhead can influence the decision whether or not to include features in new products, or indeed whether to fix bugs. A feature that has a high overhead may not be included – or needs a big financial incentive to do so. Often, even though software providers are well aware of bugs in their products, the payoff of fixing them is not worth the reward, because of the overhead. For example, an implicit data structure or succinct data structure may provide low space overhead, but at the cost of slow performance (space/time tradeoff). =Run- time complexity of software= Algorithmic complexity is generally specified using Big O Notation. This makes no comment on how long something takes to run or how much memory it uses, but how its increase depends on the size of the input. Overhead is deliberately not part of this calculation, since it varies from one machine to another, whereas the fundamental running time of an algorithm does not. This should be contrasted with algorithmic efficiency, which takes into account all kinds of resources – a combination (though not a trivial one) of complexity and overhead. Examples =Computer Programming (run-time and computational overhead)= Invoking a function introduces a small run-time overhead. Sometimes the compiler can minimize this overhead by inlining some of these function calls. =CPU Caches= In a CPU cache, the \\"cache size\\" (or capacity) refers to how much data a cache stores. For instance, a \\"4KB cache\\" is a cache that holds 4KB of data. The \\"4KB\\" in this example excludes overhead bits such as frame, address, and tag information. Presentation for course in Computer Architecture. =Communications (data transfer overhead)= Reliably sending a payload of data over a communications network requires sending more than just payload itself. It also involves sending various control and signalling data (TCP) required to reach the destination. This creates a so-called protocol overhead as the additional data does not contribute to the intrinsic meaning of the message.Common Performance Issues in Network Applications Part 1: Interactive Applications, Windows XP Technical Articles, MicrosoftProtocol Overhead in IP/ATM Networks, Minnesota Supercomputer Center In telephony, number dialing and call set-up time are overheads. In 2-way (but half-duplex) radios, the use of \\"over\\" and other signalling needed to avoid collisions is an overhead. Protocol overhead can be expressed as a percentage of non-application bytes (protocol and frame synchronization) divided by the total number of bytes in the message. =Encodings and data structures (size overhead)= The encoding of information and data introduces overhead too. The date and time \\"2011-07-12 07:18:47\\" can be expressed as Unix time with the 32-bit signed integer \`1310447927\`, consuming only 4 bytes. Represented as ISO 8601 formatted UTF-8 encoded string \`2011-07-12 07:18:47\` the date would consume 19 bytes, a size overhead of 375% over the binary integer representation.

DC's first funny animal superhero, the Terrific Whatzit first appeared in Funny Stuff #1 (Summer 1944), and was created by Martin Naydel. Fictional character biography McSnurtle is a turtle and shopkeeper who lives in the town of Zooville and is famed for both his honesty and his laziness. He is granted superpowers by two powerful, otherworldly entities (the nice Prince Highness and nasty Prince Lowness) who want to see how a completely honest person would handle being granted superpowers. When in action as the Terrific Whatzit, McSnurtle removes his shell and dons a costume almost identical to that of the Golden Age Flash save that the lightning bolt emblem is replaced by a \\"TW\\" in a yellow circle. The name \\"Terrific Whatzit\\" stems from the fact that without his shell, it is hard to tell what kind of animal McSnurtle is. McSnurtle's last Golden Age appearance as the Terrific Whatzit was in Funny Stuff #17 (January 1947), although he continued to appear from time to time as McSnurtle the shopkeeper in other features. His superheroic identity would not appear again until Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew #9 in November 1982, in which he is seen helping the Allies during \\"the Second Weird War.\\" The series reveals in an earlier story that the Terrific Whatzit is the uncle of Zoo Crew team member Fastback.Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew #4, June 1982 Powers and abilities As the Terrific Whatzit, McSnurtle possessed super-speed powers similar to those of the Golden Age Flash. These powers, while primarily based on superspeed, also include some superstrength (enough to bend a tank's main gun barrelCaptain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew #9, November 1982) and the ability to fly. McSnurtle also gains a ghost- like \\"automatic conscience\\" who won't relent until he goes into action against the threat of the story.Funny Stuff #1, Summer 1944 Other versions An ordinary turtle wearing the classic Terrific Whatzit costume is seen in DC Super Friends #14 (June 2009), as the adopted pet of the Flash. A redesigned version of the Terrific Whatzit appeared in the DC Super-Pets children's book Salamander Smackdown, as a superpowered pet of the present day Flash. Unlike the previous versions, this version of the Terrific Whatzit wears a costume similar to the modern Flash's. In other media \\"McSnurtle the Turtle\\" appears as the childhood stuffed animal of Iris West in the \\"Revenge of the Rogues\\" episode of The Flash. Later, in the episode \\"Borrowing Problems From The Future\\", HR gives Barry a turtle named McSnurtle as a housewarming gift.

The term typically, though not always, refers to financial, law, and management consulting firms, traditionally those based in the Northeastern United States, including New York City and Boston. John Oller, author of White Shoe, credits Paul Drennan Cravath with creating the distinct model adopted by virtually all white-shoe law firms, the Cravath System, about 50 years before the term came into use. The phrase \\"white shoe\\" has a distinctly different meaning and history in Australia. United States =Etymology= The phrase derives from \\"white bucks\\", laced suede or buckskin shoes with a red sole, long popular in the Ivy League colleges. A 1953 Esquire article, describing social strata at Yale University, explained that \\"White Shoe applies primarily to the socially ambitious and the socially smug types who affect a good deal of worldly sophistication, run, ride and drink in rather small cliques, and look in on the second halves of football games when the weather is good.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary cites the phrase \\"white- shoe college boys\\" in the J. D. Salinger novel Franny and Zooey (1957) as the first use of the term: \\"Phooey, I say, on all white-shoe college boys who edit their campus literary magazines. Give me an honest con man any day.\\" =Usage= The term originated in the Ivy League colleges and originally reflected a stereotype of old-line firms populated by White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs). The term historically had antisemitic connotations, as many of the New York firms known as \\"white shoe\\" were considered off-limits to Jews until the 1960s. The phrase has since lost some of this connotation, but is still defined by Princeton University's WordNet as \\"denoting a company or law firm owned and run by members of the WASP elite who are generally conservative\\". A 2010 column in The Economist described the term as synonymous with \\"big, old, east-coast and fairly traditional.\\" In the 21st century, the term is sometimes used in a general sense to refer to firms that are perceived as prestigious or high-quality; it is also sometimes used in a derogatory manner to denote stodginess, elitism, or a lack of diversity. =Examples= The following US firms are often referred to as being white-shoe firms: Accounting firms * Deloitte * Ernst & Young * KPMG * PricewaterhouseCoopers Banks, investment banks, and merchant banks Historical white-shoe banks * Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. * First Boston (acquired by Credit Suisse, 1990) * J.P.

Many of these firms were founded as a direct result of the exclusionary tendencies of the original white-shoe firms, which provided limited opportunities for Jewish and Catholic lawyers, as well as other non-WASPs, and include: * Cahill Gordon & Reindel * Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton * Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson * Greenberg Traurig * Jones Day *Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel * O'Melveny & Myers *Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison * Proskauer Rose * Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan * Reed Smith * Steptoe & Johnson * Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom * Squire Patton Boggs * Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz * Weil, Gotshal & Manges Management consulting firms * Bain & Company * Boston Consulting Group * McKinsey & Company * Kearney (consulting firm) Australia A similar term in Australia, \\"white shoe brigade\\", has been used in the past to describe a group of Queensland property developers who backed, and benefitted from, former Queensland State Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. The term is a contemptuous allusion to the lower social class antecedents of such men, revealed by their gaudy and tasteless choice of clothing, which included brightly coloured or patterned shirts, slacks with white stripes or in pastel shades, and shoes and belts of white leather, these often having gold or gilt buckles. They became known for shady deals with the government concerning property development, often with dire consequences for heritage buildings.

Venomous mammals are animals of the class Mammalia that produce venom, which they use to kill or disable prey, to defend themselves from predators or conspecifics or in agonistic encounters. Venomous mammals are now rare. Mammalian venoms form a heterogeneous group with different compositions and modes of action, from three orders of mammals, Eulipotyphla, Monotremata, and Chiroptera. It has been proposed that some members of a fourth order, Primates, are venomous. To explain the rarity of venom delivery in Mammalia, Mark Dufton of the University of Strathclyde has suggested that modern mammalian predators do not need venom because they are able to kill quickly with their teeth or claws, whereas venom, no matter how sophisticated, requires time to disable prey. In spite of the rarity of venom among extant mammals, venom may be an ancestral feature among mammals, as venomous spurs akin to those of the modern platypus are found in most non- therian Mammaliaformes groups.Jørn H. Hurum, Zhe-Xi Luo, and Zofia Kielan- Jaworowska, Were mammals originally venomous?, Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 51 (1), 2006: 1-11 Venom is much more common among other vertebrates; there are many more species of venomous reptiles (e.g. venomous snakes) and fish (e.g. stonefish). Some birds are poisonous to eat or touch (e.g. hooded pitohui). There are only a few species of venomous amphibians; certain salamandrid salamanders can extrude sharp venom-tipped ribs. Definitions Several definitions of venomous animals have been proposed. Bücherl states that venomous animals must possess at least one venom gland, a mechanism for excretion or extrusion of the venom, and apparatus with which to inflict wounds. Mebs states that venomous animals produce venom in a group of cells or gland, and have a tool, the venom apparatus, which delivers the venom by injection during a bite or sting. The venom apparatus in this definition encompasses both the gland and the injection device, which must be directly connected. Fry et al. stated that a venom is a secretion produced in a specialized gland in one animal and delivered to a target animal through the infliction of a wound. This secretion must contain molecules that disrupt normal physiological processes so as to facilitate feeding or defense by the producing animal. Additionally, the feeding secretion of hematophagous specialists (e.g. vampire bats) may be regarded as a specialized subtype of venom. Evolutionary history and paleontology Venomous mammals may have been more common in the past. Most non-therian mammals possess tarsal spurs akin to those of the modern platypus, suggesting that this feature was very widespread, with gobiconodontids and Zhangheotherium being among the clearer examples. The absence of venom spurs in non-Mammaliaformes cynodonts suggests that venom was an ancient mammalian synapomorphy and ancestral characteristic. Canine teeth dated at 60 million years old from two extinct species, the shrew-like Bisonalveus browni and another unidentified mammal, show grooves that some palaeontologists have argued are indicative of a venomous bite. However, other scientists have questioned this conclusion given that many living non-venomous mammals also have deep grooves down the length of their canines (e.g., many primates, coatis and fruit bats), suggesting that this feature does not always reflect an adaptation to venom delivery. Examples =Insectivores= With the exception of vampire bats, insectivores are the only mammals so far observed to produce toxic saliva. These species have significantly enlarged and granular submaxillary salivary glands from which the toxic saliva is produced. The Cuban solenodon (Solenodon cubanus) and Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus) look similar to large shrews. They both have venomous bites; the venom is delivered from modified salivary glands via grooves in their second lower incisors. It was reported that death was frequent among Hispaniolan solenodons kept together in the same enclosure, with bite marks on their feet being the only observable cause. Such use in competition may be a secondary aspect of the insectivore venom. The northern short-tailed shrew is one of several venomous shrews. The northern short- tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda), Mediterranean water shrew (Neomys anomalus), and Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens) are capable of delivering a venomous bite. Other American short-tailed shrews: the southern short-tailed shrew (Blarina carolinensis), Elliot's short-tailed shrew (Blarina hylophaga), and Everglades short-tailed shrew (Blarina peninsulae) and the Transcaucasian water shrew (Neomys teres) possibly also have a venomous bite. Shrews cache various prey in a comatose state, including earthworms, insects, snails, and to a lesser extent, small mammals such as voles and mice. This behaviour is an adaption to winter. In this context, the shrew venom acts as a tool to sustain a living hoard, thus ensuring food supply when capturing prey is difficult. This is especially important considering the high metabolic rate of shrews. Arguments against this suggest that the venom is used as a tool to hunt larger prey. Insectivores have an enhanced dependence on vertebrate food material, which is larger and more dangerous than their power to weight ratio would allow, thus requiring an extra asset to overcome these difficulties. Extant shrews do not have specialized venom delivery apparatus. Their teeth do not have channels, but a concavity on the first incisors may collect and transmit saliva from the submaxillary ducts, which open near the base of these teeth. The European mole (Talpa europaea), and possibly other species of mole, have toxins in their saliva that can paralyze earthworms, allowing the moles to store them alive for later consumption. =Male platypus= The calcaneous spur found on the male platypus's hind limb is used to deliver venom. Both male and female platypuses (Ornithorhyncus anatinus) hatch with keratinised spurs on the hind limbs, although the females lose these during development. The spurs are connected to the venom-producing crural glands, forming the crural system. During the mating season these glands become highly active, producing venom to be delivered by the channeled spur. Echidnas, the other monotremes, have spurs but no functional venom glands. Although not potent enough to be lethal to humans, platypus venom is nevertheless so excruciating that victims may sometimes be temporarily incapacitated. Platypus envenomation was fairly common when the animal was still hunted for its fur. Nowadays any close contact with the animal is rare and restricted to biologists, zookeepers and fishermen (who occasionally catch them in lines or nets). When platypuses attack, they drive their hind legs together with considerable force so that the spurs are embedded in the flesh caught between and if venom is being produced, a few milliliters are injected by repeated jabbing. The spurs have enough strength to support the weight of the platypus, which often hangs from the victim, requiring assistance for removal. Most of the evidence now supports the proposition that the venom system is used by males on one another as a weapon when competing for females, taking part in sexual selection. During this season, males become more aggressive and are found with punctures in their bodies, especially in the tail region. Adult male platypuses largely avoid each other, outside of this mating rivalry. Platypus venom is likely retained from its distant non-monotreme ancestors, being the last living example of what was once a common characteristic among mammals. Proteins derived from platypus venom are being studied for potential analgesic properties. =Vampire bats= The definition of venom by Fry et al. (see Definitions) regards the feeding secretions of hematophagous (blood eating) specialists as a particular subtype of venom. In this context, the subfamily Desmodontinae represents the venomous mammals from the order Chiroptera. This group comprises the most well known venomous bat, the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) and two other rare species, the hairy-legged vampire bat (Diphylla ecaudata) and the white-winged vampire bat (Diaemus youngi). These bats produce toxic saliva with anticoagulant properties and have a series of anatomical and physiological adaptations to allow nourishment based solely on blood. The majority of their prey do not perish from the attack or contact with the venom. = Primates = Slow lorises (of the genus Nycticebus) are accepted as the only known venomous primate. Slow loris venom was known in folklore in their host countries throughout southeast Asia for centuries; but dismissed by Western science until the 1990s. There are nine recognised species of this small-bodied nocturnal primate. They possess a dual composite venom consisting of saliva and brachial gland exudate, a malodourous fluid forming from an apocrine sweat gland on the animal's forearm. Both fluids have been demonstrated as being venomous individually and creating a more potent venom when mixed. Slow loris brachial gland exudate (BGE) has been shown to possess up to 142 volatile components, and possesses a variant of the cat allergen protein Fel-D1. The BGE has several ecological functions including anti-parasitic defence and communication. Slow loris saliva has been shown to be cytotoxic to human skin cells in laboratory experiments without the administration of BGE. The venom is administered through morphologically distinct dentition in the form of an adapted toothcomb. In the wild envenomation occurs from intraspecific competition; whereby two slow lorises fight for mates, food or territory. Slow loris inflicted wounds are a major cause of premature death in zoo and wildlife slow loris populations; often resulting in festering and necrotic wounds. Slow loris envenomation in humans is rare, and can result in near fatal anaphylactic shock. A suite of additional effects of the venom have been documented including mild to permanent disfigurement and mobility loss. The study of slow loris venom was brought to the public attention in 2012 by the research of the primatologist Prof. K.A.I Nekaris and in her BBC documentary 'The jungle gremlins of Java'.  Arguably venomous mammals  = Eulipotyphla (previously known as insectivores) = Hedgehogs (Erinaceinae) anoint their spines with a range of toxic and irritating substances. They will sometimes kill toads (Bufo), bite into the toads' poison glands and smear the toxic mixture on their spines. Tenrecs, which are similar in appearance to hedgehogs but from a different line of evolutionary descent, may also have separately evolved self-anointing behaviour. = Rodentia = The African crested rat smears toxins on its flank hairs. The African crested rat (Lophiomys imhausi) has a mane of long, coarse black-and-white banded hairs which extends from the top of the animal's head to just beyond the base of the tail. This mane is bordered by a broad, white- bordered strip of hairs covering an area of glandular skin on the flank. When the animal is threatened or excited, the mane erects and this flank strip parts, exposing the glandular area. The hairs in this flank area are highly specialised; at the tips they are like ordinary hair, but are otherwise spongy, fibrous, and absorbent. The rat is known to deliberately chew the roots and bark of the Poison-arrow tree (Acokanthera schimperi), so-called because human hunters extract a toxin, ouabain, to coat arrows that can kill an elephant. After the rat has chewed the tree, it deliberately slathers the resulting mixture onto its specialised flank hairs which are adapted to rapidly absorb the poisonous mixture, acting like a lamp wick. It thereby creates a defense mechanism that can sicken or even kill predators which attempt to bite it.  Chemical defense  Skunks can eject a noxious fluid from glands near their anus. It is not only foul smelling, but can cause skin irritation and, if it gets in the eyes, temporary blindness. Some members of the mustelid family, such as the striped polecat (Ictonyx striatus), also have this capacity to an extent. Pangolins can also emit a noxious smelling fluid from glands near the anus. The greater long-nosed armadillo can release a disagreeable musky odor when threatened.

Portrayed by Sue Cleaver, the character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 3 May 2000. Her storylines have often included her relationships with Dennis Stringer (Charles Dale), Ed Jackson (Chris Walker), Pat Stanaway (Sean Hughes), Jerry Morton (Michael Starke), Jesse Chadwick (John Thomson), Paul Kershaw (Tony Hirst), Adrian Mortimer (Mark Moraghan) and Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis), as well as her marriage to serial criminal mastermind Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). The character also appeared in the mini-episode crossover between Coronation Street and rival soap EastEnders entitled East Street screened on 19 November 2010 in aid of children's charity Children In Need. In 2011, it was revealed that she and half-sister Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) were related to Coronation Street icon, Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix), as Elsie's first cousin, Arnley Grimshaw, was their paternal grandfather. In 2018, Cleaver took a temporary break from the show. Storylines Eileen first appears on 3 May 2000. Vikram Desai (Chris Bisson) gives Eileen a ride in his cab and, impressed by her local knowledge, ends up employing her to operate the radio at his taxi firm, StreetCars, which he runs with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). She demands £5.50 an hour. A feisty single mum, Eileen comes from a family of eight. She rents Steve's house and moves in with her teenage sons, Jason (Ryan Thomas) and Todd (Bruno Langley). In the early days, she does not approve of Jason's aspirations to be an athlete. A couple of years later, Todd comes out as gay. Eileen has had many relationships since the character's introduction. Her relationship with biker Dennis Stringer (Charles Dale) ends when he admits he is love with Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle), resulting in Eileen punching Janice. Following Jason and Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson) placing an ad for her in a lonely hearts column in a newspaper, she dates cleaner Harry Flagg (Iain Rogerson) but they decide to remain friends. She dates Ernest Bishop's killer, Ed Jackson (Chris Walker), despite disapproval from most of the Street. It is during this relationship with Ed, a born-again Christian, that Eileen comes to the conclusion that she is agnostic. In 2007, she meets Pat Stanaway (Sean Hughes), who she assumes is married and has an \\"affair\\". Pat is not married as he does not like serious relationships as he was dating six other women at the time. She dates kebab shop owner Jerry Morton (Michael Starke), but dumps him in 2008 after he begins taking more of an interest in his children rather than her. Eileen's arch enemy is Gail Rodwell (Helen Worth) and they have had several fights in the street. The pair constantly spar whenever they cross paths. The feud begins when her son, Todd, moves in with Gail's daughter, Sarah (Tina O'Brien) as Eileen feels that Sarah, a single mother, is holding Todd back from achieving in life. This seems to be proved when Sarah falls pregnant, but the baby, a boy named Billy, died shortly after being born prematurely following a placental abruption. Todd's announcement that he is gay and having an affair with Karl Foster causes a catfight in the street. The two women are at loggerheads again when they are attracted to reflexologist Phil Nail (Clive Russell); Gail eventually wins his affections. This rivalry results in Eileen being the prime suspect when Gail is stalked by someone claiming to be her late husband, Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), in 2006. Eileen is cleared when David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) is revealed as the true culprit. Eileen's son Jason married Gail's daughter Sarah in October 2007, and divorced in 2010. On Christmas Day 2006, Eileen is surprised when a young woman drops a baby off, claiming that Jason is the father. Eileen takes responsibility for the little girl, whom they call Holly because she arrives during the Christmas period. Jason does not want her and tells Eileen that she is not his but Eileen refuses to believe him, so Jason ends up calling Children's Services in desperation. He admits that he called them but he is fond of baby Holly. However, Eileen is shocked on 9 April 2007 when Holly's mother returns as she has realised that Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) is Holly's real father, after seeing his picture in the paper during Tracy Barlow's (Kate Ford) trial. She tells Eileen that he introduced himself as Jason Grimshaw and asks Eileen to give Holly back but Eileen refuses and throws her out, threatening to call the police. Knowing that Eileen has no legal claim to the woman's daughter, she calls Children's Services and they tell Eileen that they will be coming to collect Holly so Eileen decides to run away with her. Eileen's nemesis, Gail Platt, finds out and persuades her to return Holly to her mother. A tearful Eileen returns Holly on 25 April 2007. On 12 December 2008, Eileen's father Colin (Edward DeSouza) arrives. He meets Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) in the bookies and as he places a bet, Eileen phones him wanting to know where he is and he lies, claiming to be on the bus to Weatherfield. He was known for his betting and drinking and this causes a row when they meet. In February 2009, Eileen is stunned to discover that an old school friend of hers, Paula Carp (Sharon Duce), left school early after falling pregnant at fourteen years old. When she learns that Street resident, Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh), is Paula's daughter. When Paula finds out that Julie and Eileen live on the same street, she begins acting strangely and is hostile to Colin when she sees him. On 27 April 2009, during Colin's seventieth birthday party in The Rovers, Eileen is horrified to learn that Colin is Julie's father after a drunken Paula reveals the truth, making Julie and Eileen half-sisters. Struggling with this bombshell, Eileen blames Paula for wrecking her parents' marriage as Eileen had blamed her mother but realises that Paula was a victim of abuse and makes amends with her a few days later. When Colin visits, trying to explain his actions, Eileen is disgusted. During the visit, Colin suffers a stroke, but Eileen refuses to take him to hospital. He is released from hospital and Jason and Julie convince Eileen to let him stay with her until they can find him somewhere to live but he dies of a heart attack. In 2009, Eileen starts dating children's entertainer, Jesse Chadwick (John Thomson). He moves into Eileen's house, along with his parrot named John. In 2010, cracks begin appearing in the relationship after Eileen suspects he is attracted to Julie and he takes his parents on holiday instead of her, following a bet that he wins. Eileen throws him out but he returns, attempting to reconcile with her but Eileen insists that he leave after she discovers that he made a pass at Julie. In July 2010, builder Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) catches Eileen's eye and she is delighted when they date a few times and does some admin work at the builder's yard. However, Owen is more interested in Eileen's friend, Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) and he starts dating her behind Eileen's back. Eileen is disgusted when she discovers that Owen and Liz are an item and plots revenge on Owen for the way he used her. In January 2011, Eileen discovers that her roof has been damaged after the tram crash and asks Owen to have a look. He tells her that the tiles are damaged and there is water damage in the interior walls, costing about £3,000 to fix. Eileen gets an insurance inspector to have a look but Jason thinks he is spying on his girlfriend, Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan), and punches him so the inspector refuses to help Eileen; who steals a cheque for £10,000 that Carla Connor (Alison King) has left for Owen and cashes it. Owen finds out and offers to have a look at the house and tells Eileen that he knows she has taken his money and she will pay for it. Upset, she tells Julie what has happened and they devise a plan to break into the builder's yard to get documents that prove that Owen has been committing tax evasion for years. The sisters successfully blackmail Owen with this so he agrees to fix the roof. Several weeks later, Owen gets revenge for Eileen's blackmail by letting himself into her house and retrieving the paperwork Eileen stole after she tells Sunita Alahan about his dodgy business practices. He destroys the evidence and calls the police, reporting Eileen for the cheque she stole and she is arrested for fraud. Eileen admits her guilt and, as it is her first offence and she returned the money, she is released with a caution. Eileen meets Paul Kershaw (Tony Hirst), a fireman, when her head is caught in the railings on her birthday on Underworld's roof. They start dating, but Marcus sees Paul with another woman in Freshco's, making Eileen angry so she visits Paul to demand answers and Paul's wife, Lesley (Judy Holt), answers the door. Eileen shouts at Lesley but she is confused. Paul comes to the door and tells Lesley to go inside, explaining to Eileen that Lesley has Alzheimer's disease, which explained why she didn't understand Eileen's question. Eileen and Paul stay friends and Paul helps Eileen when Eileen told Sunita that she would get somebody for the local school's safety day. Eileen invites Paul and Lesley to her house for Christmas dinner but they pull out after Lesley has a fall. Eileen goes on a speed dating night at Nick Tilsley's (Ben Price) Bistro and meets a man called Hank. They soon argue which ends up in Eileen pushing Hank into the fire alarm. Paul comes to the scene expecting a fire but Eileen asks him for a drink. One day, Paul asks Eileen if she would take care of Lesley while he is at work. Eileen does so, but she later regrets it when Lesley beats her up and physically throws her out of her own home. Jason takes Eileen to the café to calm down, but while she is at the café, Lesley dies after being electrocuted by the toaster. After Lesley's funeral, Paul and Eileen become a proper couple. Eileen becomes suspicious that Paul is having an affair with his work colleague Toni, but he is actually planning a romantic proposal. Paul walks out and goes to The Rovers soon followed by Eileen who asks for forgiveness. Paul gets down on one knee and asks her to marry him. As Paul, Jason and other men from Weatherfield take part in The Full Monty evening at the Bistro for charity, The Rovers is set on fire by Karl Munro, as part of an elaborate plan he has devised to win back ex-fiancée Stella. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) alerts the Bistro, and Eileen is horrified when she witnesses Paul risk his life to save Stella Price (Michelle Collins) and Karl Munro (John Michie) from the burning building. Luckily, Paul manages to save himself, Stella and Karl from the flames, but Paul's friend Toni Griffiths (Tara Moran) perishes as the roof collapses on her. The next day, Paul grieves for Toni, and Eileen is petrified of Paul returning to work in case he dies like Toni did. After numerous arguments and several weeks off work, Paul finally returns to work at the fire station, worrying Eileen. Convinced Paul is not ready to return to work after Toni's death, Eileen visits Paul's boss and asks if he can have more time off. Unfortunately for Eileen, Paul walks in on her and his boss discussing this. The pair return home where they have an explosive argument and Paul decides to move in with Julie and her partner Brian Packham (Peter Gunn). This infuriates Eileen, leading to her rowing with Julie in the café. Eileen discovers the tickets for her and Paul's holiday to Egypt come through the door, and decides to take Julie on the holiday instead. She later regrets this when Julie says she wants to have an adventure with Eileen, whereas Eileen just wants to relax and forget all her troubles on the holiday. Paul reveals he is leaving the Street to work in North Yorkshire, upsetting Eileen. Her friend Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) convinces her to go and find Paul and tell him not to leave her. She does so, and Paul and Eileen reunite as a couple, much to Deirdre and Julie's pleasure. Eileen finds it difficult to get to sleep at night, worrying about Paul and whether he has died in a fire whilst at work. She decides to take some sleeping pills, but ends up falling asleep at work. When she wakes up she is rude to Gary Windass (Mikey North) and is confronted by her colleagues, Steve and Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles). Eileen hears from her lodger Sean and son Jason that there has been a large house fire in Weatherfield and asks Paul whether he had been called to it when he returns. He tells Eileen he had been on a hoax call, but then reveals to Sean and Jason that he had been saving people from the house fire. The next day, a young boy named Paddy Kinsey (Sonny Cusworth), his mother Megan (Louise Atkins) and news reporter Will Reade (Dominic Doughty) arrive at Eileen and Paul's house and Eileen discovers that Paul was in fact at the house fire, and not at a hoax call. Paddy, Megan and Will reveal how serious the fire was, which stuns Eileen, Jason and Sean. This infuriates Eileen, as Paul decided to lie to her instead of telling her the truth. Eileen eventually comes to terms with Paul working at the fire station. Whilst playing darts at the Rovers with Jason and Steve, an oblivious Paul makes a racist comment just as Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) and his daughter Jenna Kamara (Krissi Bohn) enter the pub, which angers them both as they are black. Paul is infuriated when Lloyd casts him a racist, and the pair nearly come to blows in The Rovers. Soon, the whole Street assume that Paul is racist, which makes Eileen feel ashamed. Paul will not apologise to Lloyd as he fears he will actually be considered a racist if he does. Eileen and Lloyd's partner Mandy Kamara (Pamela Nomvete) both agree that the pair should put it behind them, which it appears to be, before Jenna's girlfriend Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) calls Paul's work and reports him for racism. Paul's boss pays him a visit at Eileen's house, suspending him from work until further investigation. Paul sees red and punches Lloyd in the street, as many locals watch in horror. Before the pair descend into fighting, two policemen arrive and split them up. Paul is arrested and questioned, but the whole event leads to further strain on his and Eileen's relationship. Eileen later watches as Paul shouts at Sophie in the street, which leads to Eileen and Sophie's mother Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) sharing a scrap in The Rovers. The feud puts pressure on Lloyd and Mandy's relationship too, which results in Mandy leaving Weatherfield. Paul invites Lloyd, Steve and Brian to a few drinks in town, but is furious when his mates from the fire station do not attend. He says it is because they think he is a racist, and he shouts at Lloyd when a group of men approach them. Later, as Lloyd is leaving the pub, the group of men attack him, pinning him up the wall and it transpires that they are a gang of racists. Paul arrives and saves Lloyd, which puts the arguing behind them. They arrive back in Weatherfield to reveal the good news to Eileen, but she is not impressed as Paul did not do anything about it sooner. They discuss how supportive she was when Lesley was alive, and how Paul would have left Eileen if Lesley did not have Alzheimer's disease. She then runs upstairs in anger. There is further upset for Eileen when Paul leaves Weatherfield for good. Eileen is thrilled when her son Todd returns, although it becomes clear he has changed while he has been in London and she is forced to give him £500 so that he can pay back the people he has scammed money off. Eileen then learns that Todd cheated on his former boyfriend Jools Creme (Ben Allen) as he had an affair with a man named Alex. She is later shaken when Jason's estranged father Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard) returns to the street in 2014, and is not very pleased when Liz begins flirting with him. She is later unhappy when she discovers that Todd has had sex with Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou), who is in a serious relationship with Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie). She later begins a feud with Liz when she learns that she has entered a relationship with Tony, and is later ashamed of Todd when his affair with Marcus is revealed. She has several arguments with Liz over Tony, and Liz later thinks that Eileen is jealous. As the feud progresses, Liz and Eileen eventually forgive one another. Eileen is later concerned when her friend Lloyd suffers a heart attack during Hayley Cropper's (Julie Hesmondhalgh) charity fun run. After an argument with Todd, Eileen orders him to leave the family home, and while he is walking the streets in town, Todd is violently mugged and beaten up by a gang of thugs. He is rushed to hospital, and is told that he may have permanent scarring on his face. He blames Eileen and Jason for the attack, however keeps this to himself. In 2015, Eileen begins internet dating and meets a man named Adrian Mortimer (Mark Moraghan). She goes out with Adrian on numerous occasions, but Todd – attempting to exact revenge on his mother and brother for his attack – sets up a fake account on the same website and pretends to be a man named Jeff who lives in Dubai. Eileen soon decides that she prefers Jeff to Adrian, much to Todd's delight. Todd also makes Jason believe that his girlfriend Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) is having an affair with Tony, leading to Eva moving to New York to live with her mother as she believes Jason does not trust her. After Eileen reveals to Adrian that things are not working out, Todd arrives and reveals to a heartbroken Adrian that Eileen has met somebody else, and reveals that he is Jeff. He also reveals that he broke Jason and Eva up, leading to Jason punching Todd in the face. Todd then leaves Weatherfield after the heated argument, and Eileen is distraught at how evil Todd has become. Eileen allows Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis) to move in with her after he discovers that his wife, Gail, lied to her about his son, Gavin (Mark Holgate), and discovering that Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) has been pretending to be his son. After a public argument with Gail, Michael gets drunk with Eileen, leading to them kissing. As they begin to have sex, Michael collapses and suffers a heart attack, leaving Eileen heavily humiliated. Michael admits the kiss to Gail out of guilt, but she storms over to the salon and starts throwing hair conditioner bottles at Eileen. The fight spills into the street, with Gail throwing her shoe at Eileen and Eileen pushing Gail to the ground. In July 2015, Eileen is informed by Gail that her good friend Deirdre has died. She and Liz recollect their fond memories of Deirdre, before attending her funeral. Development =Personality= Eileen has been described as \\"a down-to-earth, pragmatic type of character\\". Sue Cleaver has expressed how much she likes the variation in Eileen's development, with storylines ranging from \\"comic capers\\" to \\"serious\\": \\"I lurch between the light-hearted and serious. There's been lots of heavy drama stuff with [Eileen's sons] Todd and Jason. So it's really nice to have the relief of the scenes in the taxi office, [Eileen's workplace], where it's more upbeat. I get to play the whole spectrum, which is fun [...] As an actor, you do not often get an opportunity to keep building on your character and finding new aspects to them. If you're doing a film or TV series, it's over in three months, whereas in something long-running, I can really understand my character and know them inside out like another human being. The challenge is to delve a little bit deeper into Eileen's psyche, which I really enjoy doing.\\" Cleaver has stated that there are similarities between her own personality and Eileen's: \\"On a soap, you can't come in and create a character that's very far removed from yourself, because it's such a lot of work, so of course there are elements to Eileen that I've brought in. But I think we're very different. She's more generous than I am quite frankly!\\" She has added, \\"I think Eileen is happy. She's a very together person [...] She's got a very realistic view [...] I think there are a lot of women who would aspire to be like her, how she holds everything together and juggles her job, the kids and everyone else's problems.\\" =Friends and enemies= The character has been involved in various feuds since her introduction in 2000. Eileen's most prominent and long-running feud has been with Gail Platt, played by Helen Worth. The characters have a long history of catfights and insults between them, animosity that stems from the acrimonious break-up of Eileen's son, Todd and Gail's daughter, Sarah. In one famous scene, Gail flings herself at Eileen after being soundly slapped and told to \\"Go home, Gail!\\" Despite this, various things, including the 2010 tram crash, have caused them to put aside their differences. In 2015, Eileen knew Gail past and discover that it her feud with her was like her former mother-in-law Ivy Tilsley. Cleaver has commented, \\"Eileen's relationship with Gail is horrendous [...] I love all the scraps in the street with Gail. Helen Worth (who plays Gail) and I love doing all that – we have such a laugh with the abusive comments we make for each other. The constant battle is fun. It's a love-hate relationship.\\" Worth has suggested that Gail probably thinks she is \\"a little better than Eileen\\" Jenny Platt, who played Violet Wilson between 2004 and 2008 has noted that \\"Gail's found her nemesis in Eileen, but it's so stupid because actually they are so similar. They are both single mums looking out for their kids.\\" Media critic Grace Dent has summarised the dislike that exists between the characters in a review in The Guardian in 2006: \\"Like most fine inter-family feuds, no one knows the true beginning, but it's safe to say that Coronation Street's Eileen Grimshaw and Gail Platt have hated each other for ages. Eileen sees Gail's daughter Sarah Lou as a giant, repugnant, mascara-clad Venus flytrap, suckering in baby-daddies for her illegitimate brat Bethany. Gail Platt thinks Eileen's kids Todd and Jason are scummy, duplicitous, gutter-dwellers and their mother a snivelling apologist for their catalogue of spite. When Eileen's son, Todd, dated Sarah-Lou, he passed up the chance to study at Oxford University [...] When eventually Eileen stopped fantasising about trapping Sarah-Lou's head in Fred Elliott's bacon slicer, Sarah-Lou had set her eye on Todd's half-brother Jason. Both Gail and Eileen took this news with deep umbrage. Eileen knew Jason could do much better than this drippy, yo-yo- knickered little strumpet. Meanwhile, Gail knew Sarah-Lou was worth more than that slack-jawed, apostolic follower of Charlie Stubbs.\\" One of Eileen's most enduring on-screen relationships has been her friendship with her boss Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). Cleaver has said that she enjoys Eileen's \\"constant bickering with Steve\\". She has revealed that she and Gregson play jokes with the bookings diary on Eileen's desk during filming of the cab office, where both characters work: \\"We write comments about each other in it. When you see me scribbling in the book, think of the rudest things possible and they're in there\\". In 2007, both characters were featured in a special week of off-set episodes, filmed on location in Malta. The friends decide to take a trip together amid Steve's relationship problems with Michelle Connor. A Coronation Street spokesperson said: \\"We're excited about going out to film this storyline in Malta. Both Steve and Eileen's love lives are looking pretty bleak, so they decide to escape to the sunshine. It'll be great fun.\\" Press rumours began to circulate about a possible romantic pairing between the characters; however, this proved to be a red herring, Eileen spends the night in bed with a drunken Steve to avoid sleeping in discomfort on the floor. During the episodes, some of Malta's historic streets and churches, landscapes and Gozo's red sand beach Ramla Bay were featured. It was predicted in the media that British tourism trade to Malta would significantly increase due to the screening of the episodes. When discussions about filming on the island began, UK-based site YourMalta.com commented, \\"it could be a major boost [...] A half hour episode on Malta will reach more people over a longer period of time than a tourist authority could hope to with a series of twenty or thirty second advertisements, it would be worth millions in equivalent advertising.\\" Property website easier.com stated that \\"viewers have been captivated by the sun-soaked honey-coloured buildings, the charming historic streets and churches and beautiful landscapes not to mention the glorious red sand beach of Ramla Bay. It was hard not to be envious as Eileen and Steve sipped cocktails next to the pool in the gleaming sunshine and this life-style was all the more alluring when the camera’s panned back to the dreary streets of Weatherfield.\\" =Romances= The character's history includes numerous failed romances. Eileen's first known screen partner was Dennis Stringer (Charles Dale), who left her in 2001 following an affair with her best friend at the time, Janice Battersby. Next, Eileen fell for Ed Jackson (Chris Walker) in 2006, before discovering he had served time in prison for killing Emily Bishop's husband Ernest in a storyline that screened in 1978. Commenting on Eileen's relationship with Ed, Sue Cleaver has said, \\"She'd have loved it to work with Ed but she knew it wouldn't while he was on a mission to absolve himself of his sins. It would be great if Chris came back. I loved working with him, and he really would like to come back.\\" It was announced in 2007 that comedian Sean Hughes would be joining Coronation Street as Pat, a love interest for Eileen. A source told Daily Mirror, \\"They meet in the [Rovers Return] and get on like a house on fire. It's not very long before they are enjoying steamy sessions. It's a great coup to have Sean play the role. It's a mixture of serious and comical. He and Sue have a good chemistry to make the story work really well\\". However, the relationship soured when Eileen discovered he was a serial womanizer. A romance with Jerry Morton fizzled out on-screen in 2008, when Eileen dumped him. Actor Michael Starke, who was axed from his role as Jerry Morton in 2008, has been critical about the way Eileen and Jerry's romance \\"died such an early death\\". In an interview, he commented, \\"There was even talk of babies! But it fizzled out – it went absolutely nowhere. It was never explained to me\\". It has been noted that Eileen has \\"not had much luck in love\\", although Sue Cleaver maintains that viewers should not feel sorry for her character, adding that Eileen is \\"very happy\\" and \\"together\\". She adds, \\"People forget that she's had proposals of marriage and turned them down.\\" Reception Eileen Grimshaw has been described as \\"a firm favourite with fans\\". Actress Sue Cleaver has commented on her character's popularity to the Belfast Telegraph in 2007: \\"Everyone seems to love Eileen. I've never had anybody come up and say they don't like her, so I suppose that's a good thing. She's an accessible character and I think everybody knows an Eileen. There's an Eileen in every street.\\" Low Culture columnist Ruth Deller has included the character as one of the best soap creations during the 2000s. She stated, \\"Eileen arrived as the decade was just beginning and she’s kept us entertained throughout. Sue Cleaver is great and so is the character. A classic soap matriarch she has the potential to be one of the most enduring and popular characters the Street has ever seen.\\" In 2007, actress Sue Cleaver was recognised for her role as Eileen with a TV Now award for 'Favourite Female Soap Star'. Sue Cleaver has revealed that she received letters of complaint from viewers when Eileen was shown to have a one-night stand with a boilerman: \\"I had so many letters of complaint about the one night stand she had with the boiler man. People said she wouldn't do that. She bloody well would! She's got two kids, she's been around the block a bit.\\" In 2009, Digital Spy editor Kris Green praised Sue Cleaver's part in the Julie/ Paula/ Colin reveal when he stated; 'The outstanding performances from Katy Cavanagh (Julie) and Sharon Duce (Paula) mixed with Street legend Barbara Knox (Rita) and the still criminally underused Sue Cleaver (Eileen) make for compelling viewing' Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap opined that \\"poor\\" Eileen should join a convent because all of her romances end badly.

It is a cubic graph: every vertex touches exactly three edges. It was discovered by Marion C. Gray in 1932 (unpublished), then discovered independently by Bouwer 1968 in reply to a question posed by Jon Folkman 1967. The Gray graph is interesting as the first known example of a cubic graph having the algebraic property of being edge but not vertex transitive (see below). The Gray graph has chromatic number 2, chromatic index 3, radius 6 and diameter 6. It is also a 3-vertex-connected and 3-edge-connected non-planar graph. Construction The Gray graph can be constructed from the 27 points of a 3 × 3 × 3 grid and the 27 axis-parallel lines through these points. This collection of points and lines forms a projective configuration: each point has exactly three lines through it, and each line has exactly three points on it. The Gray graph is the Levi graph of this configuration; it has a vertex for every point and every line of the configuration, and an edge for every pair of a point and a line that touch each other. This construction generalizes (Bouwer 1972) to any dimension n ≥ 3, yielding an n-valent Levi graph with algebraic properties similar to those of the Gray graph. In (Monson, Pisanski, Schulte, Ivic-Weiss 2007), the Gray graph appears as a different sort of Levi graph for the edges and triangular faces of a certain locally toroidal abstract regular 4-polytope. It is therefore the first in an infinite family of similarly constructed cubic graphs. As with other Levi graphs, it is a bipartite graph, with the vertices corresponding to points on one side of the bipartition and the vertices corresponding to lines on the other side. Marušič and Pisanski (2000) give several alternative methods of constructing the Gray graph. As with any bipartite graph, there are no odd-length cycles, and there are also no cycles of four or six vertices, so the girth of the Gray graph is 8. The simplest oriented surface on which the Gray graph can be embedded has genus 7 . The Gray graph is Hamiltonian and can be constructed from the LCF notation: :[-25,7,-7,13,-13,25]^9.\\\\ As a Hamiltonian cubic graph, it has chromatic index three. Algebraic properties The automorphism group of the Gray graph is a group of order 1296. It acts transitively on the edges the graph but not on its vertices : there are symmetries taking every edge to any other edge, but not taking every vertex to any other vertex. The vertices that correspond to points of the underlying configuration can only be symmetric to other vertices that correspond to points, and the vertices that correspond to lines can only be symmetric to other vertices that correspond to lines. Therefore, the Gray graph is a semi-symmetric graph, the smallest possible cubic semi- symmetric graph. The characteristic polynomial of the Gray graph is :(x-3) x^{16} (x+3) (x^2-6)^6 (x^2-3)^{12}.\\\\  References  * . * . * . * . * . *  External links  * * The Gray Graph Is the Smallest Graph of Its Kind, from MathWorld.

The area was first colonized by German immigrants in the first half of the 19th century, and the strong German influence can still be seen in each of the towns and villages. The Germanic roots are visible in the architecture, gastronomy and occasionally in the accent and language (Riograndenser Hunsrückisch) of the region. The Rota Romântica is approximately 184 km (about 114 miles) in distance and extends from São Leopoldo to São Francisco de Paula.

The signal from the auxiliary send is often routed through outboard audio processing effects units (e.g., reverb, digital delay, compression, etc.) and then returned to the mixer using an auxiliary return input jack, thus creating an effects loop. This allows effects to be added to an audio source or channel within the mixing console. Another common use of the aux send mix is to create monitor mixes for the onstage performers' monitor speakers or in-ear monitors. The aux send's monitor mix is usually different from the front of house mix the audience is hearing. Purpose The routing configuration and usage of an aux-send will vary depending on the application. Two types of aux-sends commonly exist: pre-fader and post-fader. Pre-fader sends are not affected by the main fader for the channel, while post-fader sends are affected by the position of the main fader slider control for the channel. In a common configuration, a post-fader aux-send output is connected to the audio input of an outboard (i.e., an external [usually rack- mounted] unit that is not part of the mixer console) audio effects unit (most commonly a temporal/time-based effect such as reverb or delay; compressors and other dynamic processors would normally be on an insert, instead). The audio output of the outboard unit is then connected to the aux-return input on the mixing console (if the recording console has one), or, alternatively, it can be looped back to one of the console's unused input channels. A post-fader output is used in order to prevent channels whose faders are at zero gain from \\"contaminating\\" the effects-return loop with hiss and hum. Mixing consoles most commonly have a group of aux-send knobs in each channel strip, or, on small mixers, a single aux-send knob per channel, where one knob corresponds to each aux-send on the board. The controls enable the operator to adjust the amount of signal that will be sent from its corresponding channel into the signal bus routed to its corresponding aux-send output. The largest, most expensive mixers have a number of aux-send knobs on every channel, thus giving the audio engineer the flexibility to create many live sound and/or recording applications for the mixer. This Alto S-8 mixer has two knobs for controlling the aux-send mix (the third and fourth knobs from the bottom). A benefit of using an aux-send is that it enables the signals from multiple channels on a mixing console to be simultaneously routed to a single outboard device. For instance, audio signals from all the channels of a sixteen-channel mixing console can be routed to a single outboard reverb unit so that all channels are heard with reverb. The aux-sends from a group of inputs can also be routed to an amplifier and then sent to monitor speakers so that the onstage musicians can hear their singing or playing through monitor wedge speakers on the stage or through in ear monitors. The benefit of using the pre-fader aux- send function is that the volume of the vocals or instruments in the monitor mix does not have to be the same as the \\"front-of-house\\" mix for the audience. Musicians whose voices are barely present in the \\"front-of-house\\" mix, such as backup vocalists, can have their sound clearly and loudly sent through a monitor speaker so that they can hear themselves singing and ensure that their pitch and timing is correct.

It is the capital city of Sabaragamuwa Province, as well as the Ratnapura District, and is a traditional centre for the Sri Lankan gem trade. It is located on the Kalu Ganga (Black River) in south-central Sri Lanka, some southeast of the country's capital, Colombo. Ratnapura is also spelled as Rathnapura. The name 'Ratnapura' is a Sanskrit word meaning \\"city of gems\\", from the Sanskrit words pura (town) and ratna (gemstone). Over 2000 years ago, when the first Buddhist monks arrived here from the north eastern provinces of India namely Bodh-Gaya, Varanasi and Pataliputra, they not only brought with them the Buddhist religion, but since their teachings were mainly in Sanskrit and Pali they also influenced the local language. While candy produced from the jaggery palm is traditionally known in this region as ratnapura, it is more likely that the candy was named for the locale rather than vice versa. It is the centre of a long-established industry of precious stone mining including rubies, sapphires, and other gems. Apart from gem mining, the city is known for the production of rice and fruit. Large plantations of tea and rubber surround the city. Tea grown in this region is called low-country tea. There is a well-established tourism industry in Ratnapura. Nearby Sinharaja Forest Reserve, Udawalawe National Park, Kitulgala, and Adam's Peak are especially popular among tourists. In 1901, the town of Ratnapura had a population of 4,084, and by 2011, it had increased to 52,170, with Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Muslims each constituting a significant portion of the population.  Political  The city is governed by a municipal council headed by a mayor. The council is elected by popular vote and has 15 seats. There were 29,159 registered voters in the 2006 local authorities elections.  Health  Ratnapura hospital, upgraded to a Teaching Hospital in early 2019, is equipped with three surgical units, three medical units, two orthopedic units, three Obstetrics and gynaecology units, two paediatrics units, an ENT unit, a neurology unit, a neurosurgical unit, a rheumatology unit, a urosurgical unit, a nephrology unit with dialysing fascilities, a dermatology unit, a psychiatric unit, an A&E; unit, and a cardiology unit. It has theatre fascilities for routine surgeries, and for 24/7 casualties. It also has two ICU units catering 12 ICU beds at the moment. It is also a post graduate training center for surgical and paediatric pg trainees. It was upgraded as a teaching hospital, with the establishment of Medical faculty in Sabaragamuwa university.  Economy  =Gem trade= The people of the town depends on the gem trade. Gem pits common sights in the surrounding area. Most of the large-scale gem businessmen of Sri Lanka operate from Ratnapura. There are considerable numbers of foreign gem traders in the city too who have recognised the value of the gems found there. Among the foreign traders, Thai (Thailand) traders are in the majority. Every day, a large number of traders from suburbs and other towns gather in the town centre to sell or buy gemstones. Large-scale merchants collect gemstones from locals and sell them in the international market. Some traders go out of the city to buy gems. This includes neighboring towns like Kalawana, Bogawantalawa, and Ela-era. After the discovery of world-class alluvial sapphire deposits in the valley of Ilakaka in Madagascar, many Ratnapura merchants travel out of the country to Madagascar to buy gems. There are three main Gem market places in Ratnapura .\\"Abagahamula Gem Market \\",\\"Clock Tower Gem Market \\",\\"Demuwamawatha Gem Market \\" These markets operate in different hours in the day = Agriculture = The city's agricultural industry is also well developed. Large plantations of tea and rubber surround the town. Although rice fields also used to be a common sight around the town, rice cultivation presently faces an uncertain future in Ratnapura because many farmers are giving up their rice cultivation and switching to gem mining which is a more productive way of earning money. If many farmers give up on agriculture, it would be harder for farmers to harvest enough food for them and to trade in the markets. Many delicious fruits (like mango and papaya) and vegetables are grown as market products.  Transport  Ratnapura city is located in the A4 Highway which connects capital Colombo to Kalmunai in the Eastern Province. Another Highway A8 connects the town with Panadura in the western coast of Sri Lanka. During the British occupation of the Island, narrow gauge train track was laid in 1912 connecting Colombo – Avissawella – Ratnapura – Opanayake however line Avissawella onwards removed in 1976. Thus reducing the mode of transportation to road. In 2006, construction started on a new broad gauge railway line to Rathnapura only. In 2014, the government gave approval to the E06 Ruwanpura Expressway which will connect Rathnapura with Sri Lanka's Expressway Network.  Climate  Ratnapura features a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification. The city is located in the south-western part of Sri Lanka, the so-called wet zone. The town receives rainfall mainly from south-western monsoons from May to September. During the remaining months of the year, there is also considerable precipitation due to convective rains. The average annual precipitation is about 4,000 to 5,000 mm. The average temperature varies from 24 to 35 °C, and there are high humidity levels. The city is above sea level. = Floods = Much of the city of Ratnapura is situated in the flood plain of the Kalu River. As a result, it experiences regular floods, usually during the month of May. There are no large-scale dams upstream on the Kalu to control Spring runoff. Proposals to reduce flood risk in the city have yet to reach the feasibility stage. In May 2003, the town experienced the largest flood since the independence of Sri Lanka from Britain in 1947.  Places of worship  Ratnapura Maha Saman Devala premises There are a number of places of worship in and around Ratnapura, including: *Maha Saman Devalaya – a shrine dedicated to the god Saman. The god Saman is (a Buddhist deity) considered to be the guardian of Ratnapura. When the Portuguese captured Ratnapura, the ancient shrine that stood at this location was destroyed and a Portuguese church was constructed on top of it. When the Kandyan kingdom recaptured Ratnapura, the Portuguese church was destroyed and the shrine was rebuilt. Although there is no direct evidence to support the existence of the old shrine, indirect evidence supports the existence of a shrine that looked like a Hindu temple at the current location before Portuguese times. Currently this shrine is a very important place for Buddhists. * Saints Peter and Paul's Cathedral – The history of Catholics in Ratnapura begins with Portuguese rule in Ratnapura. Very few Catholics lived in the town in the 17th century. Many of them are the descendants of Portuguese and locals that they married. There is evidence to suggest that the Portuguese built a church on top of a destroyed Buddhist temple. That Portuguese church was destroyed when the Kandyan kingdom recaptured Ratnapura from the Portuguese. The current church was built in a different location along the main street of Ratnapura (inside the town). The Church building being used now is said to be inspired by St. Joseph Vaz (Apostle of Ceylon) during the 17th century when he visited Ratnapura as a part of his apostolic mission to Sabaragamuwa. After Sabaragamuwa became a diocese on 2 November 1995 SS. Peter-Paul's Church was raised to the status of the Cathedral of the diocese. * Pothgul Viharaya - Rathnapura Pothgul Rajamaha Viharaya (පොත්ගුල් විහාරය) is a picturesque cave temple built on top of a hill believed to be built by king Vatta Gamini Abhaya better known as king Walagamba ( (89-77 BC) in the 1st century. It had been renovated during the days of King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe (1747 – 1781) of the Kandy period. There are two temples belonging to these two periods within the Pothgul Viharaya. * St. Luke's Church (Church of England) * Siva Temple (Hindu) = Sri Pada (Adam's Peak) = Ratnapura is the starting point for the 'classic' or hard route up Adam's Peak, via the Gilimale and Carney Estates. The pilgrimage season starts on Poya (full moon) day in December and runs until the start of the south-west monsoon in April. It has been a pilgrimage centre for over 1,000 years. King Parakramabahu and King Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa provided ambalamas or 'resting places' for weary pilgrims along the mountain route. The other more popular route is through Dalhousie (pronounced 'Del-house') close to Dickoya.  Education  Schools in Ratnapura include: * Convent of Infant Jesus * Dharmapala Maha Vidyalaya * Ferguson High School * Kalawana National School * Malwala Navodya School * Mihindu Vidyalaya * Prince College, Ratnapura * Rambuka eVillage School * Sivali Central College * St. Aloysius College * St. Luke's College * Sumana Balika Vidyalaya * Sumana Central College * Sumana Saman Maha Vidyalaya * Sussex College * Lyceum Ratnapura * Ratnapura Tamil Maha Vidyalayam  Attractions  =Waterfalls= *Katugas Ella (කටුගස් ඇල්ල) – a waterfall, located at Mahawalawatta, away from Ratnapura. *Kirindi Ella (කිරිඳි ඇල්ල) – a waterfall (the seventh highest in Sri Lanka), located away from Ratnapura, on the Ratnapura – Pelmadulla road. *Rajanawa Ella (රජනෑ ඇල්ල) – a waterfall located adjacent to the Ratnapura–Kalawana road, at the village of Marapana. The scenery around the waterfall has been captured in several Sinhala films. = Gem Mines = There are numerous gem mines located around the area, especially in paddy fields on lower ground. The mines are generally around to deep. Portable hand operating tools used for the mining process, include shovels, picks, pans (specially made from bamboo) and cradles. Once the soil is extracted from the mine, water is used to wash the dirt and mud away using pans and any gemstones, which heavier than normal stones, will remain at the bottom of the pan.  Local heroes  =Ehelepola Nilame= In the time of the Last king of Sri Lanka \\"Sri Vikrama Rajasinha\\", Ehelepola Nilame was sent to Sabaragamuwa (Ratnapura) as \\"Disawe\\" or local governor of Sabaragamuwa. He built a small reservoir and water canal to support local rice farms. The works of this hero are still visible around the Ratnapura area and local people benefiting from his works even today. His house which is situated in the middle of Ratnapura city is now being used as the national museum building. The portrayal of Ehelepola as a hero is quite controversial. Once he conspired with British and betrayed the Kandy king. The King ordered the execution of his family unless Ehelepola surrendered to the king (according to the prevailing laws). He became a coward and he let king execute his whole family in Kandy. His younger son became a child hero by bravely facing death by guillotine, while his elder brother was hiding behind his mother (who was drowned).

He was the founder and leader of the Civil Defence Forces, commonly known as the Kamajors. The Kamajors supported the government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah against the Revolutionary United Front(RUF), which was led by Foday Sankoh. On 7 March 2003 Hinga Norman was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He died on 22 February 2007 in Dakar, Senegal while undergoing medical treatment. Youth Sam Hinga Norman was born January 1, 1940 in Mongeri, Bo District, in the Southern Province of Sierra Leone. He joined the Sierra Leone Army in 1959 and served until 1972, ascending to the rank of captain. He also attended school during this time and received a diploma from the Officer's School of Aldershot in the United Kingdom. Before his death, which entails controversy within, he was survived by an elder brother Michael H. Norman who was a distinguished Educationists in Ghana and notable among Michael Norman children is Fred Michael who is presently a director with the Global Resources Inc. Accra Ghana. Political service to Sierra Leone Entering politics, Hinga Norman became Deputy Minister of Defence, serving from April 20, 1998 to May 21, 2002). He then served as Minister of the Interior from May 21, 2002 to March 10, 2004, overlapping his indictment at the Special Court. He also served as the national director of the CDF, and tapped the traditional groups called the Kamajors to serve as a militia. Kamajors The Kamajors are a group of traditional hunters from the south and east of the country. They were originally employed by local chiefs, but under the leadership of Hinga Norman were used by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in 1996 to replace mercenaries (Executive Outcomes and Sandline International, both of whom helped train the force) as the security force of the government. At that time members of the Sierra Leone Army (SLA), calling themselves the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), were supporting Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader Foday Sankoh against the Kabbah government. The Kamajors integrated themselves into the ECOMOG (a Nigeria led force) counteroffensive to reinstate Kabbah in 1998 after Freetown was taken by the RUF (backed by Charles Taylor and led by Foday Sankoh) in combination with the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, led by Johnny Paul Koroma. The force eventually consisted of over 20,000 men, dwarfing the size of the army and the rebel groups. =Problems of the Kamajors= The Kamajors were not a professionally trained army. They were also made up by soldiers whose allegiances were not always clear. Many fighters in the civil war fought on different sides at different times. This led to the coinage of the term sobel or soldier by day, rebel by night, especially in connection with the SLA. The Kamajors too have been accused of pillaging, terrorizing, and killing. Less ambiguous is the accusation of recruiting soldiers under the age of 15, in clear violation of the Geneva Conventions. Trial at the Special Court for Sierra Leone Sam Hinga Norman was indicted on March 7, 2003 by the Special Court for Sierra Leone (TSSL). He was arrested on March 10 and plead not guilty on the 15 of the same month. His indictment accused him of * crimes against humanity for: inhuman murders and acts; * violations of Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions as well as Additional Protocol II for: acts of terrorism and collective punishment against the civilian population, reached with the physical and mental integrity and the life in particular cruel treatment, plundering; * other serious violations of the international humanitarian law due to enrolment of children of less than 15 years in the armed forces Norman's trial then began on June 3, 2004 along with those of Moinina Fofana and Allieu Kondewa. At the outset of his trial, Norman dissolved his legal team and stated that he wished to represent himself. He later assented to standby counsel representing him.

Painted white, and roofed with slate, it was established in 1788. The cathedral lies in the north of the peninsula of Tinganes and is one of the main attractions of the town. Like most churches of the country it belongs to the Evangelical-Lutheran national church of the Faroe Islands. Since 1990, it has been the seat of the Bishop of the Faroes and is therefore known as a cathedral. Early churches The early history of the church is quite complicated. To all appearances there was no church in the strict sense in Tórshavn in the Middle Ages, only perhaps a \\"prayer house\\". It has been suggested that services were held in the Munkastovan in Tinganes. It was only in 1609, that a proper church, built on a stony hill, known as \\"úti á Reyni\\" was built on Tinganes, when King Christian IV directed the Lord Lieutenant at Bergenshus \\"to bestow upon the Faroese people some timber for the construction of their church...\\". In 1780 Rasmus Jørgen Winther became minister in Tórshavn and in 1782 seized the initiative to build a new church. However it was only in 1788 that Johannes Poulsen, to the building master in Torshavn. The church of Christian IV was demolished in 1798 following the consecration of the new church, and the timber was sold at an auction. Part of the furniture was transferred to the new church. In 1788 the population of Torshavn numbered approx. 600 people and in 1865 approx. 900 people. The present church Cathedral and harbourside buildings Faroese postage stamp showing the cathedral Though it completely changed the appearance of the church, the rebuilding in 1865 seems in fact to have only marginally affected the structural parts of the 1788 church. The church has on the whole preserved its structure from 1865. In 1935, however, the choir was extended by four metres and a new sacristy was built. The choir was also extended with an office and other secondary rooms in 1968. The nave itself contains 44 benches, the gallery 14. =Altarpiece= The altarpiece from 1647 is fitted on the north wall of the nave, with a painting of the Last Supper and the words of institution. The inscription reads: Gud Allermechtigste Hans Hellige Ord och Sacramenter Till Ere och denne Steed til Zirat haffuer Hans Sevrensen fordum Kiøbmand her paa Ferøe foraerit denne Altertaffle til Torßhaffns Kiercke 1647. ('For the Glory of God Almighty's Words and Sacraments and to ornament this Place, Hans Sevrensen, former Merchant on the Faroes, bestowed this altarpiece on the Church of Torshavn in 1647'). It is a rather simple piece of work from the late Renaissance, with a central section flanked by degenerated pilasters, a pedestal section and a small top section. The painting of the central section, the Last Supper, belongs to the large group of Danish 17th-century paintings derived from the painting of the Last Supper by Peter Candid – the Court painter to Wilhelm V – for the Franciscan house in Munich, and popularised through prints by Sandeler. It was restored in 1961 by Ernst and Holmer Trier together with the local painter Fraser Eysturoy. The painting measures 100 x 100 cm. The Bell From \\"Norske Löve\\" The bell is said to have been acquired in 1708. It originates from the ship \\"Norske Löve\\" (Norwegian Lion), which went down in Lambavík on New Year's Eve, 1707. The bell is decorated with palmettes and bears the inscription: \\"Danscke Ostindische Compagnies Scheb Nordische Löwe\\" (The Danish East India Company’s ship Nordische Löwe, 1704), and the crowned monogram of the Company. It is 30 cm tall, and the diameter of the outside rim is 41.5 cm.

In 1963 he was one of the ten founding members of the Creation Research Society.  Biography  In his youth, Marsh desired to become a physician, but lacked the financial means, so he became first a nurse, then a teacher instead. He studied geology at Emmanuel Missionary College under George McCready Price, whose protégé he became. While teaching at a Seventh- day Adventist school in the Chicago area, Marsh studied advanced biology at the University of Chicago and in 1935 obtained an M.S. in zoology from Northwestern University. He joined the faculty of Union College in Lincoln, Nebraska, later completing a PhD in botany on plant ecology at the University of Nebraska in 1940. In his book Fundamental Biology, Marsh described himself as a \\"fundamentalist scientist\\". He argued that modern human races are degenerate forms of first-created man and warned that the living world is the scene of a cosmic struggle between the Creator and Satan. Marsh claimed that Satan is a \\"master geneticist\\" and speculated that amalgamation and hybridization are his ways of destroying the original harmony and perfection among living things. Marsh viewed dark skin color as one the \\"abnormalities\\" engineered in this way. In Fundamental Biology, Marsh coined the term baramin for the Genesis \\"kind\\"., f28, pp 480–481 In Evolution or Special Creation? (1947), Marsh argued for the scientific accuracy of the Bible and concluded: \\"surely the time is ripe for a return to the fundamentals of true science, the science of creationism\\". From the publication of this work onward, Marsh avoided mentioning Ellen G. White, co-founder of Seventh-day Adventism, as he believed such references would repel non-Adventist readers. Marsh concluded finally that \\"The Bible knows nothing about organic evolution. It regards the origin of man by special creation as a historical fact... In view of the subjectivity of the evidence upon which a decision on the matter of origins must be made, creationism and evolutionism should be respected as alternate viewpoints\\". His creationist views have been criticized by biologists for having no scientific basis. For instence, Dpobzhansky said that Marsh assumes that all dogs, foxes, and hyenas are members of a single kind descending from a common ancestor in less than 6000 years, a speed of evolution far faster than any evolutionists could conceive.Dobzhansky, Theodosius.

It was created by John Finch and made by Granada Television for ITV. The original producer was Richard Doubleday, and with 13 directors during the series. The series examined the lives of the lower middle-class Ashton family of the city of Liverpool and their experiences from 1938 and through the Second World War. Despite being set in Liverpool, only one of the regular characters (David Ashton) spoke with a Liverpudlian accent. Fifty-two episodes were produced, all but eight of them in colour. Episodes numbers 25 to 32 were recorded in black and white because of the ITV Colour Strike. The memorable theme tune is from the end of the First Movement (Allegro) of Vaughan Williams's Sixth Symphony. The programme opening titles show a scene of a beach with a child's sand castle, with Union Flag flying, slowly being approached by the encroaching tide, symbolic of a beleaguered Britain standing alone in 1940–1941. Other interpretations of the titles are of a Britain whose empire the war accelerated the collapse of, triggering a long decline in the nation’s fortune which continues today, indicated by the incoming tide washing away the sandcastle. Plot summary The families Ashton, Briggs, and Porter live in Liverpool in 1938 and later. Edwin Ashton, the son of a mineworker, has moved up to the middle class by working for a printing company and by marrying Jean, the sister of company owner Sefton Briggs. The latter is a hard businessman who appoints his son Tony as the new manager of the workplace, rather than the experienced Edwin. Edwin and Jean have five children: Philip, David, Robert, Margaret, and Freda. Philip is a leftist who fought as a volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. David joins the RAF because he cannot find another job. He is married to Sheila, but he impregnates Peggy. Robert, the youngest son, wants to join the Navy. Margaret, the eldest Ashton daughter, marries John Porter, but she has a troubled relationship with her mother-in- law Celia. All these events take place against the backdrop of the political conflict leading to the Second World War, which will have a major impact on their lives.

It is located close to the River Stour and the border with Essex, around north of Manningtree, and around southwest of Ipswich. History The name Brantham is of Anglo Saxon origin - Brant for 'hill' and ham 'village' — hence, 'village on the hill'. Another possible translation may be 'burnt village', a name given after a Viking invasion coming up from the River Stour. Evidence of the village's Saxon heritage can be found in the form of some ninety silver coins from the time of Edward the Elder (899-924) in what has become known as the Brantham Hoard, found in the village in 2003. Brantham is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday book as having 38 households and under the lordship of Aelfric of Weinhou. Until 1887 the local economy was almost entirely agricultural. This changed in 1887 when British Xylonite Ltd. purchased the Brooklands Farm and built their factory, which was later renamed BX Plastics. There was insufficient accommodation available locally for the workforce, so the company also built Brantham New Village, consisting of about 60 new houses. Recreation Brantham Leisure Centre is a community-interest company providing venues for football, bowls, netball, cricket, and tennis, plus bar and function facilities.Welcome to Brantham Leisure Centre Official site The village's football club, Brantham Athletic, competes in the Premier Division of the Eastern Counties League. Residents participate in a variety of recurring charitable events, including an annual Guy Fawkes Night fireworks event. Historical buildings and notable former residents The Brantham Bull pub Brantham's parish church of St. Michael and All Angels dates back to the 14th century, although it is believed a religious building has been on the site for over 1,000 years. The church also has connections with Dodnash Priory (founded in 1188). When the priory was dissolved at the time of the Reformation, it is thought that some of the priory's medieval glass was fitted in one of the south facing nave windows. The church underwent extensive repairs in 2004 after fundraising efforts and a £23,000 grant from the UK National Lottery. St Michael's owns one of only two known religious paintings by John Constable. \\"Christ blessing the children\\" was presented to the church by the artist himself in 1805. A reproduction hangs on display in the church today but the original is kept at the Ipswich Museum. Brantham is generally acknowledged, along with Flatford, Dedham and East Bergholt, to be part of \\"Constable Country\\". The artist chose a cottage in the village overlooking the Stour as a subject to one of his sketches 'Fisherman's cottage in Brantham with a view of Mistley Hall' in 1796. The drawing, which is in the V&A; museum in London is one of the earliest dated drawings by Constable of which the whereabouts are now known. The Tudor didactic poet Thomas Tusser settled at Katwade (now Cattawade) and is believed to have written his most famous work A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie at Brantham Hall. The lord of the manor of Brantham in the 15th century was 'shire knight of Suffolk' Sir John Braham (d.1420). The village's oldest pub, the Brantham Bull, is a 16th-century grade 2 listed building. Some of the beams from the building are thought to have come from the wreckage of the Spanish Armada, and over the centuries the building has also been used as a court house and a prison. Witchfinder general Matthew Hopkins, once hanged a lady by the name of Nancy on the green outside the front of the building. A passage used by smugglers used to run from the pub's cellar out to the River Stour. Transport Brantham is about half a mile from Manningtree station. A long railway cutting runs past the village. At one point near Brantham Bull, it is the deepest railway cutting in Suffolk. There was once a siding to Marsh Farm, where fresh fruit and vegetables were loaded for London, and a siding going into the old BX Plastics factory (now derelict) for loading and unloading materials. The former was disused by the end of the 1930s. The BX siding was active until the early 1960s for coal deliveries.

This class of jokes has its roots in the early part of the 20th century, prior to the regular availability of milk in supermarkets. At that time, milk in glass bottles was delivered directly to customers' houses by milkmen, generally in the morning (at which time empty bottles were also collected). Men were commonly the main financial supporters of their families, and a man's wife tended to remain at home to care for their children and home. As the milkman would visit the home at a time when the husband would be away at work, this created an opportune situation for adultery. Oftentimes, a different profession will replace the milkman in various jokes. For instance, in Spain, 'milkman' jokes are told about butaneros: persons who deliver butane, bottled fuel gas, to households without a pipeline gas hookup. Similar jokes referring to other professions, such as postmen, plumbers, pizza delivery drivers, and swimming pool cleaners, are also known. Example > Sam pulled up a stool at his favourite bar and announced, \\"My wife must love > me more than any woman has ever loved any man!\\" \\"What makes you say that?\\" > the bartender inquired. \\"Last week,\\" Sam explained, \\"I had to take a couple > of sick days from work.

In 1739, Sackville played for London Cricket Club which was having selection problems at the time.Buckley, p.15 In the 1744 English cricket season, Lord John challenged an All-England side to play against his Kent team and Kent won the game with one wicket to spare, largely thanks to Sackville himself taking a memorable catch to dismiss Richard Newland.His effort was eulogised in Cricket, An Heroic Poem (1745) by James Love The match details were recorded and preserved in what is now cricket's second oldest known scorecard.Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744–1826), Lillywhite, 1862CricketArchive – scorecard. Retrieved on 14 July 2009. In 1745, Sackville wrote a letter to the Duke of Richmond after Sussex had lost to Surrey and said: \\"I wish you had let Ridgeway play instead of your stopper behind it might have turned the match in our favour\\". Evidently, Sackville had wagered on Sussex to win. Family and personal life Sackville was a notorious rake in his salad days. He was compelled to marry Lady Frances Leveson-Gower, daughter of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower and sister of the Duchess of Bedford in 1744, after she gave birth to his child at Woburn. They eventually had issue two sons and one daughter.SACKVILLE, Lord John Philip (1713–65 Published in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1715–1754, ed. R. Sedgwick, 1970. Only one son is known to peerage directories so their other son might have been born out of wedlock. The couple's parents were furious, and the Prince of Wales compensated Sackville for any loss of income, making him a lord of his bedchamber in 1745, and thus securing him as a recruit to his party.History of Parliament Their son, John Frederick, later 3rd Duke of Dorset, was a member of the Hambledon Club and a leading supporter of cricket in the latter half of the eighteenth century. Sackville's son-in-law, the 8th Earl of Thanet, was an early member of the Marylebone Cricket Club. His grandsons John Tufton and Henry Tufton were noted amateur players at the end of the 18th century. Sackville was also disappointed when Lord Wilmington the late Prime Minister (d. 1743) declined to leave him his Sussex estates, worth £3-£4,000 a year. It is not clear if Wilmington's decision was made because of Sackville's messy private life, or his political inconstancy. He was also a coward, and refused to join the Guards when sent abroad. Finally, he was committed to a private lunatic asylum circa 1746, then sent abroad to exile on a very small allowance in Lausanne where Lord Shelburne met him in 1760, and commented on his dirty condition but lucid conversation. According to his descendant Robert Sackville-West, 7th Baron Sackville in his book Inheritance he became insane later in life, dying in Geneva, Switzerland, aged 52. However, his brother lived long enough to allow John Philip's son to inherit his title and become the next Duke of Dorset.

Certain goals are defined and the service level gives the percentage to which those goals should be achieved. Fill rate is different from service level. Examples of service level: * Percentage of calls answered in a call center. * Percentage of customers waiting less than a given fixed time. * Percentage of customers that do not experience a stockout. * Percentage of all parts of an order being fulfilled completely (Explanation) if one component part of an order is not filled the Service Level for that order is Zero, If all the component parts of an order are delivered except one is filled at 51%, the service level for that order is 51% (This system is often used in supply chain delivery to manufacturing), This is a very different from a simple order fill measurement which does not consider line items on the order. Service level Service level is used in supply-chain management and in inventory management to measure the performance of inventory replenishment policies. Under consideration, from the optimal solution of such a model also the optimal size of back orders can be derived. Unfortunately, this optimization approach requires that the planner knows the optimal value of the back order costs. As these costs are difficult to quantify in practice, the logistical performance of an inventory node in a supply network is measured with the help of technical performance measures. The target values of these measures are set by the decision maker. Several definitions of service levels are used in the literature as well as in practice. These may differ not only with respect to their scope and to the number of considered products but also with respect to the time interval they are related to. These performance measures are the key performance indicators (KPI) of an inventory node which must be regularly monitored. If the controlling of the performance of an inventory node is neglected, the decision maker will not be able to optimize the processes within a supply chain. =α service level (type 1)= The α service level is an event-oriented performance criterion. It measures the probability that all customer orders arriving within a given time interval will be completely delivered from stock on hand, i.e. without delay. Two versions are discussed in the literature differing with respect to the time interval within which the customers arrive. With reference to a demand period, α denotes the probability that an arbitrarily arriving customer order will be completely served from stock on hand, i.e. without an inventory-related waiting time (period \\\\alpha_p service level): \\\\alpha_p = Prob\\\\\\\\{Period~demand \\\\le \\\\; {Inventory~on~hand~at~the~beginning~of~a~period}\\\\\\\\} . In order to determine the safety stock that guarantees a target \\\\alpha_p service level, the stationary probability distribution of the inventory on hand must be known. This version of α is also called ready rate. If an order cycle is considered as the standard period of reference, then α denotes the probability of no stockout within an order cycle which is equal to the proportion of all order cycles with no stockouts (cycle \\\\alpha_c service level): \\\\alpha_c = Prob\\\\\\\\{Demand~during~replenishment~lead~time \\\\le Inventory~on~hand~at~the~beginning~of~the~lead~time\\\\\\\\} This second definition, which is often used in operations management textbooks, is based on the idea of not running out of stock during the time between re-ordering and order arrival (the leadtime). That is, the probability of demand during that leadtime being less than or equal to the amount of stock you had left when you ordered. It assumes your reorder point is positive, that orders are in unit increments and inventory is monitored continuously so you cannot stock out prior to reordering. =β service level (type 2)= The β service level is a quantity-oriented performance measure describing the proportion of total demand within a reference period which is delivered without delay from stock on hand: \\\\beta = 1- \\\\frac{ Expected~backorders~per~time~period} {Expected~period~demand} This is equal to the probability that an arbitrary demand unit is delivered without delay. This approach usually involves calculating a loss integral, whose values are tabulated for the normal distribution.Donald Bowersox, David Closs, M. Bixby Cooper, Supply Chain Logistics Management, McGraw-Hill 2012 Because, contrary to the variations of the \\\\alpha service level, the \\\\beta service level does not only reflect the stockout event but also the amount backordered, it is widely used in industrial practice. Also, by the definitions, comparing service levels we have \\\\alpha \\\\le \\\\beta whenever the probability of zero demand equals 0. =γ service level= The γ service level, a time- and quantity-related performance criterion, serves to reflect not only the amount of backorders but also the waiting times of the demands backordered. The γ service level is defined as follows: \\\\gamma= 1- \\\\frac{ Expected~backorder~level~per~time~period} {Expected~period~demand} The γ service level is rarely used in industrial practice. Service rate *In business, service rate is a performance metric used to measure the customer service in a supply organization. One example of a service rate measures the number of units filled as a percentage of the total ordered and is known as fill rate. If customer orders total 1000 units, and you can only meet 900 units of that order, your fill rate is 90%. *In statistics, notably in queuing theory, service rate denotes the rate at which customers are being served in a system. It is the reciprocal of the service time. For example, a supermarket cash desk with an average service time of 30 seconds per customer would have an average service rate of 2 per minute. In statistics the Greek letter \\\\mu is used for the service rate. Terminology The term \\"Service Level Agreement\\" (SLA) is frequently used for all aspects of a service level, but in more precise use one may distinguish: * Service Level Indicator (SLI): measures of service level, like availability (uptime); * Service Level Objective (SLO): objectives based on these indicators, like 99.95% availability; * Service Level Agreement (SLA): contract based on these objectives; a sample clause may be \\"if availability is 99% to 99.95% in a given month, the customer gets 10% off their monthly bill\\".For example, SLIs form the basis of SLOs, which in turn form the basis of SLAs. If an SLO is missed, customers will typically receive a credit or rebate, as stipulated by the SLA. A missed SLO is sometimes casually referred to as an SLA violation, but this is actually within the scope of the SLA; if an SLA itself is violated (e.g., by not giving a rebate for a missed SLO), it is instead likely to result in a court case for breach of contract.

Adequate safety stock levels permit business operations to proceed according to their plans.Monk, Ellen and Bret Wagner. Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning. 3rd Edition. Boston: Course Technology Cengage Learning, 2009. Safety stock is held when uncertainty exists in demand, supply, or manufacturing yield, and serves as an insurance against stockouts. Safety stock is an additional quantity of an item held in the inventory to reduce the risk that the item will be out of stock. It acts as a buffer stock in case sales are greater than planned and/or the supplier is unable to deliver the additional units at the expected time. With a new product, safety stock can be used as a strategic tool until the company can judge how accurate its forecast is after the first few years, especially when it is used with a material requirements planning (MRP) worksheet. The less accurate the forecast, the more safety stock is required to ensure a given level of service. With an MRP worksheet, a company can judge how much it must produce to meet its forecasted sales demand without relying on safety stock. However, a common strategy is to try to reduce the level of safety stock to help keep inventory costs low once the product demand becomes more predictable. That can be extremely important for companies with a smaller financial cushion or those trying to run on lean manufacturing, which is aimed towards eliminating waste throughout the production process. The amount of safety stock that an organization chooses to keep on hand can dramatically affect its business. Too much safety stock can result in high holding costs of inventory. In addition, products that are stored for too long a time can spoil, expire, or break during the warehousing process. Too little safety stock can result in lost sales and, in the thus a higher rate of customer turnover. As a result, finding the right balance between too much and too little safety stock is essential. Reasons for keeping safety stock Safety stocks are mainly used in a \\"make-to-stock\\" manufacturing strategy, which is employed when the lead time of manufacturing is too long to satisfy the customer demand at the right cost/quality/waiting time. The main goal of safety stocks is to absorb the variability of customer demand. Indeed, production planning is based on a forecast, which is (by definition) different from the real demand. By absorbing these variations, safety stock improves the customer-service level. Creating a safety stock will also prevent stockouts from other variations, like an upward trend in customer demand. Safety stock is used as a buffer to protect organizations from stockouts caused by inaccurate planning or poor schedule adherence by suppliers. As such, its cost (in both material and management) is often seen as a drain on financial resources that results in reduction initiatives. In addition, time-sensitive goods such as food, drink, and other perishable items could spoil and go to waste if held as safety stock for too long. Various methods exist to reduce safety stock; these include better use of technology, increased collaboration with suppliers, and more accurate forecasting.The IOMA Handbook of Logistics and Inventory Management By Bob Donath, Institute of Management and Administration (Ioma), Institute of Management & AdministrationS. P. Meyn, 2007. Control Techniques for Complex Networks , Cambridge University Press, 2007. In a lean supply environment, lead times are reduced, which can help minimize safety stock levels, thus reducing the likelihood and impact of stockouts.A Stitch in Time: Lean Retailing and the Transformation of Manufacturing By Frederick H. Abernathy Due to the cost of safety stock, many organizations opt for a service level-led safety stock calculation; for example, a 95% service level could result in stockouts, but is at a level that is acceptable to the company. The lower the service level, the lower the requirement for safety stock. An enterprise resource planning system (ERP system) can also help an organization reduce its level of safety stock. Most ERP systems provide a type of production planning module. An ERP module such as this can help a company develop highly accurate and dynamic sales forecasts and sales and operations plans. By creating more accurate and dynamic forecasts, a company reduces its chance of producing insufficient inventory for a given period, thus should be able to reduce the amount of safety stock required. In addition, ERP systems use established formulas to help calculate appropriate levels of safety stock based on the previously developed production plans. While an ERP system aids an organization in estimating a reasonable amount of safety stock, the ERP module must be set up to plan requirements effectively.Rooney, C., & Bangert, C. (2001, April). Developing the Right Approach to Requirements Planning Under ERP. Adhesives Age, 44(4), 49. Retrieved November 19, 2008, from Corporate ResourceNet database. Inventory policy The size of the safety stock depends on the type of inventory policy in effect. An inventory node is supplied from a \\"source\\" which fulfills orders for the considered product after a certain replenishment lead time. In a periodic inventory policy, the inventory level is checked periodically (such as once a month) and an order is placed at that time as to meet the expected demand until the next order. In this case, the safety stock is calculated considering the demand and supply variability risks during this period plus the replenishment lead time. If the inventory policy is continuous policy (such as an order point-order quantity policy or an order point-order up to policy) the inventory level is continuously monitored and orders are placed with freedom of time. In this case, safety stock is calculated considering the risk of only the replenishment lead time. If applied correctly, continuous inventory policies can lead to smaller safety stock whilst ensuring higher service levels, in line with lean processes and more efficient overall business management. However, continuous inventory policies are much harder to implement, so most of the organisations using traditional planning processes and tools opt for periodic inventory policy. Methods for calculating safety stocks = Reorder point method with demand and lead time uncertainty for type I service = A commonly used approach calculatesRonald H.Ballou, Business Logistics/Supply Chain Management, Fifth Edition the safety stock based on the following factors: * Demand is the number of items consumed by customers, usually a succession of independent random variables. * Lead time is the delay between the time the reorder point (inventory level which initiates an order) is reached and renewed availability. * Service level is the desired probability of meeting demand during the lead time without a stockout. If the service level is increased, the required safety stock increases, as well. * Forecast error is an estimate of how far actual demand may be from forecast demand. Assuming that demand during successive unit time periods are independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from a normal distribution, the safety stock can be calculated as: > SS=z_\\\\alpha\\\\times\\\\sqrt{E(L)\\\\sigma^2_D + (E(D))^2\\\\sigma^2_L} where, *\\\\alpha is the service level, and z_\\\\alpha is the inverse distribution function of a standard normal distribution with cumulative probability \\\\alpha; for example, z_\\\\alpha=1.65 for 95% service level. The service level can be easily calculated in Excel by typing in the formula =normsinv(probability%). For eg entering =normsinv(95%) will return 1.65 as the answer.http://media.apics.org/omnow/Crack%20the%20Code.pdf *E(L) and \\\\sigma_L are the mean and standard deviation of lead time. *E(D) and \\\\sigma_D are the mean and standard deviation of demand in each unit time period.W. J. Hopp, M. L. Spearman, Factory Physics, 3rd ed. The reorder point can then be calculated as: > ROP = E(L)\\\\cdot E(D)+SS The first term in the ROP formula E(L)E(D) is the average demand during the lead time. The second term ss is the safety stock. If the lead time is deterministic, i.e. \\\\sigma_L=0, then the ROP formula is simplified as ROP = L\\\\cdot E(D) + z_\\\\alpha \\\\sigma_D \\\\sqrt{L}. Issues with this approach No universal formula exists for safety stock, and application of the one above can cause serious damage. It makes several implicit assumptions: * The assumption that demand is a succession of independent normal random variables: First, real demand cannot be negative. If the ratio of standard deviation to mean is quite high, this will skew the distribution (compared to the normal distribution), leading to consistent overestimation of safety stock by this formula. Second, and more importantly, demand is often influenced by external random factors which persist for more than one time period, so that the successive demands are not independent. With a very large number of sources (for example, consumers of a central retail warehouse), that may not be an issue, but otherwise it is (for example, for a manufacturer that supplies these retail warehouses) * The use of average and standard demand assumes it is constant. For seasonal demand (for example high in summer, low in winter), the formula will consistently produce stock outs in summer and waste in winter. Similar errors apply for demand that grows or declines. That does not invalidate the formula, but it influences the parameters to be input into the formula in each time period. * Lead time is extremely hard to quantify in complex manufacturing and/or purchase environment, which has become the norm in global supply chains that span many independent partners. In practice, lead time is estimated by a rule of thumb that hardly improves on estimating safety stock with a rule of thumb. Even when lead time is correctly quantified, the formula assumes supply (production and purchase) is statistically constant, which is not always the case. = Type II service = Another popular approach described by NahmiasSteven Nahmias, Production and Operation Analysis, Irwin 1989 uses the standardized unit loss integral L(z), given by: L(z)=\\\\int_{z}^{+\\\\infty }\\\\left ( t-z \\\\right )\\\\phi(t)dt Where \\\\phi(t) is cumulative distribution function for the standard normal. Let β be the proportion of demands met from stock (service level), Q the order quantity and σ the standard deviation of demand, then the following relationship holds: L(z)=(1-\\\\beta)Q/\\\\sigma In this case, the safety stock is given by: SS=z_\\\\beta\\\\sigma and the expected number of units out of stock during an order cycle is given by σL(z).Ronald H.

Early life and naval career Decoux was born in Bordeaux, one of three children of a family originally from Upper Savoy. In 1901, at about 16, he entered the École navale. He was promoted to aspirant second class in 1903, to aspirant first class the following year, ship-of-the-line ensign (sub-lieutenant) in 1906, ship-of-the- line lieutenant (lieutenant) in 1913, corvette captain (lieutenant-commander) in 1920, frigate captain (commander) in 1923, ship-of-the-line captain in 1929 and rear admiral (one-star rear admiral) in 1935. He was appointed commander of the defence sector at Toulon in 1938 and promoted to vice-admiral (two-star rear admiral). Indochina Medals in Saigon 1942 with the name of Jean Decoux. On 13 January 1939, Decoux was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Naval Forces in the Far East by President Albert Lebrun. He assumed his new appointment, with the rank of squadron vice-admiral (vice admiral), on 12 May. From 25 June 1940 he served as interim Vichy French Governor-General of Indochina, succeeding General Georges Catroux. His functions were established on 29 August the same year. Like his predecessor, Decoux initially wished to continue the fight against the Axis powers, but he swore allegiance to Pétain's regime after realizing that his meager armed forces were no match for the Japanese. Decoux reportedly received demands from the Japanese in early August for permission to move troops through Tonkin (later Vietnam) in order to build air bases and block Allied supply routes to China. Decoux cabled his Vichy superiors for aid, but when no help was forthcoming, he signed a treaty on 20 September 1940 that opened Haiphong Harbour to the Japanese and gave them the right to station troops in the region. Decoux worked to improve relations between French colonists and the Vietnamese. He established a grand federal council containing twice as many Vietnamese members as Frenchmen and installed Vietnamese in civil-service positions with equal pay to that of French officials. The Indochinese Federal Council, which was composed only of Indochinese, and later the Grand Federal Council were the formal structures that Decoux felt he needed to build to develop the Indochinese federal consciousness simultaneously with the elevation of the elite. Rather than a legislative or executive body, the Federal Council in both its forms was a body consisting of non-elected indigenous elites. They gave their opinions to the Governor General to assist him in his decision-making and served as a forum to strengthen relations between these elites and the authorities. The GFC replaced the IFC in 1943 by introducing 23 French representatives (from the economy's principal sectors, making it, according to Decoux, more representative) and adding five local members, thereby ensuring that the Indochinese presence outnumbered the European. Decoux believed that would reverse the reluctance of the local population to accept the politics of collaboration. In addition, he apparently wished to show goodwill toward the Indochinese peoples after Roosevelt's public statement that maintaining French sovereignty in Indochina was not a principal objective of the United States. The French colonial authorities learnt of the policy through BBC broadcasts. Decoux's first wife, Suzanne Humbert, died in a traffic accident in 1944. She is buried in the Domaine de Marie Church convent in Da Lat. Decoux enforced the discriminatory Vichy laws against Gaullists and Freemasons, as well as the Vichy anti-Jewish legislation, but he decried the impact on the French colonial regime and society.Jennings, Eric Vichy in the Tropics: Petain's National Revolution in Madagascar, Guadeloupe, and Indochina, 1940–44 Stanford University Press, 2004 One writer claims that Decoux remained unconcerned by the famine of 1945. Over one million Vietnamese died of starvation in the countryside and urban cities and the author asserts that the Decoux government did nothing to help the Vietnamese peasants, farmers, and poor, despite soliciting and courting the Vietnamese elite.Khanh, Huynh Kim \\"Vietnamese Communism, 1925–1945\\" Cornell University Press, 1986 However, archival records show that Allied bombardment of railways and the requisitioning of boats by the Japanese made it impossible to transport rice from Cochinchina to Tonkin. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese took direct control of the government and ousted Decoux, establishing the Empire of Vietnam. Arrested, he is tried by Justice High Court and placed under house arrest. There, he is tortured for 2 days by former French Communist Partisans and left for dead. Cared for in the Val de Grâce Military Hospital in Paris, he is finally declared innocent of all charges in 1949 and restored to his rank and prerogatives. He later wrote the book A la barre de l'Indochine. He died in Paris in 1963 and is buried in Annecy.

Before returning to Pearl Harbor to escort convoys to and from west coast ports, she steamed as far as New Guinea, supporting airstrikes on Bougainville, Salamaua, and Lae. Guadalcanal Macdonough returned to the western Pacific to prepare for the Guadalcanal invasion. Operating with Saratoga, she provided cover for the landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi, 7 August 1942. She remained in the area, taking part in the Battle of Savo Island and fighting aircraft and shipping during the landing of reinforcements on the island. At the end of September, she commenced escort work between New Guinea, Espiritu Santo, and Pearl Harbor until reporting to Mare Island, 22 December, for overhaul. Aleutians Campaign Macdonough next steamed north for the assault and occupation of Attu Island in the Aleutian Islands. Arriving at Adak, Alaska, 16 April 1943, the destroyer patrolled northeast of Attu until the assault. On 10 May, while maneuvering in heavy weather to guard the attack transports, she collided with Sicard and was forced to retire under tow. The ship remained in the repairs dock at Mare Island until 23 September, when she prepared to get underway for the Gilbert Islands. Arriving for the invasion of Makin Island, 20 November, she acted as control vessel for the landing craft, and following the completion of that phase of the operation, entered the lagoon to bombard Japanese installations. On 23 November Makin was declared secure and Macdonough returned to Pearl Harbor. Marshall Islands Macdonough in 1943. In January 1944, she joined the Northern Attack Force staging for the assault on the Marshall Islands. As the primary fighter director ship for the initial transport group, Macdonough at first operated off Kwajalein Atoll. On 29 January, she proceeded to Wotje Atoll and participated in the shore bombardment there until returning to Kwajalein on the 31st for the occupation of Root and Namur Islands. The destroyer then took up radar picket duties until proceeding on to Eniwetok Atoll. On 21 and 22 February, Macdonough shelled Japanese positions on Parry Island at the deep entrance to Eniwetok lagoon. A month later, she was a reference and rendezvous ship for carrier TF 58, then striking the Palau Islands. Continuing her varied pace, she was at Hollandia, New Guinea, by 21 April, providing fire support for the landings there. Then, at the end of the mouth she steamed eastward to take up radar picket duty south of Truk. During this assignment, Macdonough, with Monterey and Stephen Potter, sank Japanese submarine RO-45, 30 April 1944. Marianas Campaign On 4 May, the destroyer arrived at Majuro to join the forces gathering for the invasion of the Marianas. Departing the Marshalls 6 June, Macdonough operated with the fast carrier force during the Saipan invasion. She performed screening and picket duties and was part of the bombardment group firing on Japanese installations on the west side of the Island. She next took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, 19 to 20 June, firing at the few enemy planes which got through the combat air patrol. Ordered to Guam, she covered underwater demolition teams reconnoitering the beaches and provided harassing fire to prevent repairs to beach defenses on the island. On 21 July, the destroyer patrolled the waters off Guam to protect the assault craft from enemy submarines, continuing that role until departing for Hawaii 10 August. Philippines After a brief stay at Pearl Harbor, Macdonough departed for the Admiralty Islands. She arrived at Manus on 15 September and commenced escort duties. On 14 October, she accompanied troop transports to Leyte and remained through the Battle of Leyte Gulf, 24 to 25 October. She then steamed back to Manus for another convoy to Leyte, 3 November, and upon her return to Philippine waters patrolled Leyte Gulf and the southern Surigao Strait area. The next mouth, Macdonough resumed escort duty. Operating out of Ulithi, she guarded fleet oilers on their refueling runs in the Philippine, Formosa, and South China Sea areas. In January 1945, the destroyer sailed for Puget Sound and a 3-month overhaul period. Returning to Ulithi, she was assigned to radar picket station off that island until 5 July, when she resumed screening convoys. For the remainder of the war, she protected Allied shipping between Ulithi and Okinawa. End of World War II and fate At Guam when hostilities ended, Macdonough soon received orders to return to the United States. She arrived at San Diego 3 September, continuing on the next week to the New York Navy Yard, where she decommissioned 22 October 1945. On 20 December 1946, she was sold to George H. Nutman of Brooklyn, New York. Macdonough received 13 battle stars for World War II service.

It has numerous membership divisions, interest groups, publications and websites.  Focus  In the United States, many university journalism departments-- particularly at Midwestern, Western and Southern state universities--evolved into schools or colleges of mass communication or \\"journalism and mass communication\\". In addition to studying practical skills of journalism, public relations or advertising, students also may major in \\"mass communication\\" or \\"mass communication research\\". The latter is often the title given to doctoral degrees from such schools, whether the focus of the student's research is journalism practice, media economics, history, law or media influence. Departmental structures within such colleges may separate research and instruction in professional or technical aspects of newspaper and magazine publishing, radio, television, and film. Mass communication research topics include media institutions and processes, such as diffusion of information, and media effects, such as persuasion or manipulation of public opinion. Outside of media history and communication law, research methods in mass communication fields have leaned toward empirical research, experimental studies and quantitative methods, such as public opinion polling and content analysis of news media. However, qualitative research, including ethnographic case studies, interviewing, and focus groups, has growing support in some specialties. Critical-cultural theory is less popular than in other \\"communication studies\\" programs. Such programs are accredited by the ACEJMC Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications. The International Communication Association (ICA) and National Communication Association (formerly the Speech Communication Association) include divisions and publications that overlap with those of AEJMC, but AEJMC historically has stronger ties to the mass communication professions in the United States.

They have released 13 studio albums, plus a variety of live albums, collaborative albums, and side projects. They have been described as evolving from underground musicians who subverted Communism to international artists who \\"upend convention\\". History Czech musicians have long been interested in Americana, bluegrass, folk, and early country music, leading to the development of the Czech bluegrass genre in the mid-1960s. A regional tour by Pete Seeger in 1964 was a particular inspiration to Czech musicians.[ allmusic.com biography of Druhá Tráva], retrieved 7 Mar 2013 The Communist regime was hostile to such music, and Czech musicians with Western folk and rock influences helped advocate for the country's eventual independence. Singer/songwriter/mandolinist Robert Křesťan had been a fan of American roots music since age 10 in the late 1960s, listening to records that had been smuggled into the then-Communist Czechoslovakia; Křesťan was particularly fond of bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe. Křesťan went to great pains to find records and learned how to play the music on homemade instruments. He joined the band Poutnici in 1979. Křesťan and another member of Poutnici, banjo player Luboš Malina, formed Druhá Tráva in 1991. The original lineup of Druhá Tráva also included dobroist/guitarist Luboš Novotný, bassist Jiří Meisner, and guitarist Pavel Malina. The band's lineup has changed considerably over its history, though Křesťan, Malina, and Novotný have been in the band consistently since 1991. The current lineup also includes guitarist Emil Formanek and bassist Tomas Liska. The band's first album, Robert Krestan & Druha Trava, was released in 1991. Druhá Tráva has been noted as the preeminent band in the Czech bluegrass scene, and critics have cited the band's unique mix of Americana and Central European influences. Druhá Tráva has toured internationally and has performed with Ricky Skaggs, Peter Rowan, Davy Spillane, and Béla Fleck. The band's international appearances attracted attention for their ability to master many different genres and eras of American roots music. Their 1999 album Czechmate was their first to be released in the United States, and gained attention from international critics for its covers of jazz standards, opera numbers, and Appalachian folk songs. Several of their later albums were released by Universal Music Group, and their most recent album Pojd'me se Napít was released by EMI in 2013.

Born in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, he volunteered for military service in 1916, enlisting with the Royal Welch Fusiliers before being transferred to the Cheshire Regiment. Upon completing training, in 1917 he was posted to the Western Front where he was transferred again, to The East Yorkshire Regiment. During the German Spring Offensive of 1918 his unit, the 1/4th Battalion the East Yorkshires, was sent to reinforce the line at Béthune. The Germans used infiltration tactics, where stormtroopers aimed to infiltrate weak points in defences, bypassing strongly held front line areas. Troops with heavier weapons would then attack the isolated strongpoints. Lawton, with troops from the Durham Light Infantry, did indeed become isolated in a forward trench during the assault; when they ran out of ammunition and food after three days' fighting, they surrendered. He was imprisoned at a prisoner of war camp at a fort in Lille and afterwards in Minden, Germany. After the war, he completed a Master's degree in French at the University of Wales in Bangor, and received a doctorate in Latin and French from the Sorbonne in 1926. He became a lecturer, then a Professor of French at the University College Southampton. He later took the position of Professor of French, and was promoted within the university administration as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Pro Vice- Chancellor, at the University of Sheffield. During World War II, he briefed behind the lines operatives and was listed in The Black Book of key people to be arrested upon a successful Nazi invasion of Britain. He published a Handbook of French Renaissance Dramatic Theory in 1950, and Poems, Selected with Introduction and Notes (on the work of Joachim du Bellay) in 1961. In 1999, Lawton received the Légion d'honneur of the French Republic, honouring his services in World War I. He died on Christmas Eve 2005 at the age of 106.

They live a hunting and foraging lifestyle and have resisted outside contact, making them one of the so-called uncontacted peoples of the world. In addition to Tagaeri, the area is home to their kin, the Taromenane, another eastern Huaorani group.

Obituary: Elizabeth Young, The Guardian, 23 March 2001.) was a London-based literary critic and author, who wrote principally on cult writers for a range of British newspapers and magazines. In particular she championed transgressive fiction, for which she received some criticism in the press, not least for her defence of A. M. Homes' The End of Alice, which dealt with themes of paedophilia from what was seen as an uncomfortably neutral perspective. Biography Born to Scottish parents in Lagos, Nigeria where her father was an executive for Rowntrees, Elizabeth Young's parents were members of the Free Church of Scotland (sometimes referred to as the Wee Frees) and she was educated at The Mount School, York where she boarded. Young discovered at the age of 11 the works of Nelson Algren, Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac when an uncle sent her some books by these writers. The enduring fascination with the Beats was to stay with her. Young studied English at York University. She moved to London in the 1970s to attend a demonstration and never left. Before becoming a literary critic, Young worked in Compendium Books in Camden Town and was noted for her Goth appearance. In addition to literary criticism, Young's attraction to the counterculture saw her pen articles on drugs, music and pornography. She also appeared as Ray Gange's girlfriend in Rude Boy, the 1980 film about a roadie for The Clash. Young was as a champion for the US cult literary scene, with authors such as Bret Easton Ellis, Dennis Cooper and A. M. Homes receiving regular praise in her reviews. She also promoted the early talents of Poppy Z. Brite. In 1992, she and Graham Cavaney published Shopping in Space: Essays on American 'Blank Generation' Fiction (Serpent's Tail), which dealt extensively with the US literary underground, from Joel Rose, David Wojnarowicz, Dennis Cooper, Catherine Texier, Mary Gaitskill, Poppy Z Brite and grindhouse movies. In terms of UK writers, she acted as an enthusiastic supporter of the talents of Stewart Home, Alasdair Gray, Alan Warner and Irvine Welsh. In 2001, Young died from Hepatitis C. Later that year, a selection of her reviews and articles were collated in a volume published by Serpent's Tail, Pandora's Handbag: Adventures in the Book World, for which her friend Will Self penned the introduction. Young was buried in the family plot in the graveyard in Tighnabruaich, a village on the Kyles of Bute in Argyll and Bute, Scotland where she also owned a small cottage in the later years of her life.

McClatchy, \\"John Hollander, The Art of Poetry No. 35\\", Paris Review (Fall 1984). and then Columbia College of Columbia University, where he studied under Mark Van Doren and Lionel Trilling, and overlapped with Allen Ginsberg (Hollander's poetic mentor),Yezzi, David, The New Criterion, vol. 32, October 2013. Jason Epstein, Richard Howard, Robert Gottlieb, Roone Arledge, Max Frankel, Louis Simpson and Steven Marcus. At Columbia, he joined the Boar's Head Society. After graduating, he supported himself for a while writing liner notes for classical music albums before returning to obtain a Ph.D. in literature.Keillor, Garrison. Writer's Almanac . October 28, 2006. Hollander resided in Woodbridge, Connecticut, where he served as a judge for several high-school recitation contests, and said he enjoyed working with students on their poetry and teaching it. With his ex-wife, Anne Loesser (daughter of pianist Arthur Loesser; married 1953–77), he was the father of writer Martha Hollander and uncle of the songwriter Sam Hollander. He married Natalie Charkow in 1981. Hollander died at Branford, Connecticut, on August 17, 2013, at the age of 83. Poetic career Hollander stressed the importance of hearing poems out loud: 'A good poem satisfies the ear. It creates a story or picture that grabs you, informs you and entertains you.Boynton, Cynthia Wolfe, \\"Venerable Poet's Words To a Pop Music Beat\\", The New York Times, Connecticut and the Region section, February 10, 2008, p. 6. The poet needing to be aware of the \\"sound of sense; the music of speech\\".Essay: \\"The Poem in the Ear\\", Vision and Resonance: Two senses of Poetic Form (1975). To Hollander, verse was a kind of music in words, and he spoke eloquently about their connection with the human voice. Also known for his translations from Yiddish. Hollander usually wrote his poems on a computer, but if inspiration struck him, he offered that, \\"I've been known to start poems on napkins and scraps of paper, too.\\" Hollander was also considered to have technical poetic powers without equal,Howard Richard, Alone in America: Essays on the art of poetry in U.S.since 1950, 1969. as exampled by his \\"Powers of Thirteen\\" poem, an extended sequence of 169 (13x13) unrhymed 13-line stanzas with 13 syllables in each line.Breslin, Paul, Review of Powers of Thirteen, Poetry, vol. 145, no. 3, December 1984. These constraints liberated rather than inhibited Hollander's imagination, giving a fusion of metaphors that enabled Hollander to conceive this work as \\"a perpetual calendar\\".Lehman, David - article in Newsweek, January 23, 1984. Hollander also composed poems as \\"graphematic\\" emblems (Type of Shapes, 1969) and epistolary poems exampled in (Reflections on Espionage, 1976)Hollander, John - interview by email with Paul Devlin March/April 2003. and, as a critic (in Vision and Resonance: Two Senses of Poetic Form, 1975), offered telling insights into the relationship between words and music and sound in poetry, and in metrical experimentation,Attridge, Dennis, Review of Vision and Resonance: Two senses of Poetic Form, MLR, vol. 72, no. 3, July 1973. and 'the lack of a theory of graphic prosody'.Rothman, David, \\"Verse, Prose speech, Counting and the Problem of Graphic Order\\", Versification, vol. 1, no. 1, March 21, 1997. Hollander influenced poets Todd LaRoche and Karl Kirchwey, who both studied under Hollander at Yale. Hollander taught him that it was possible to build a life around the task of writing poetry. Kirchwey recalled Hollander's passion: 'Since he is a poet himself ... he conveyed a passion for that knowledge as a source of current inspiration.' Hollander also served in the following positions, among others: member of the board, Wesleyan University Press (1959–62); editorial assistant for poetry, Partisan Review (1959–65) and a contributing editor, of Harper's Magazine (1969–71). and also commenced his other role as a poetry critic.Hollander, John, Review \\"Stanley Cavell and the claim of Reason\\", Critical Inquiry, vol. 6, no. 4, U of C P, Summer 1980. Hollander's poetry has been set to music by Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter, and others;Readings in Contemporary Poetry, December 1995 in 2007 he collaborated with the Eagles, allowing them use of his poem \\"An Old Fashioned Song\\" to create the song \\"No More Walks in the Wood\\".Sam Hollander, \\"The Lives they Lived\\", New York Times Magazine, December 21, 2013.

It was started on June 15, 1990 in response to the low wages and minimal health- care coverage that janitors received. Justice for Janitors includes more than 225,000 janitors in at least 29 cities in the United States and at least four cities in Canada. Members fight for better wages, better conditions, improved health-care, and full-time opportunities. The Justice for Janitors campaigns are organized under a larger union known as the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). SEIU has almost two million members and is a large part of the labor movement. SEIU assists in organizing Justice for Janitors campaigns. SEIU retains constructive partnerships with the corporations employing the janitors to ensure that these corporations receive no negative impact due to the campaigns. In the United Kingdom a similar movement is called \\"Justice for Cleaners.\\" Cleaners in Australia, through their union United Voice, are running a similar campaign called Clean Start: Fair Deal for Cleaners. This landmark campaign has won the support of community, faith and political leaders and has helped improve the jobs and lives of thousands of cleaners across Australia. Clean Start began in 2006 with cleaners working in city office buildings. It has now moved to cleaners working in Australia's big shopping malls.  Background  As the labor movement was struggling to gain membership to unions, new models for organizing workers were developed. The Justice for Janitors campaign uses a bottom-up model in which they organize workers based on geographical area rather than just their worksite. This structure improves the visibility of workers by grouping them together. The structure used by SEIU for its Justice for Janitors campaigns has been widely recognized for its innovativeness and success. Justice for Janitors was founded on June 15, 1990, when Janitors in Los Angeles, CA had a peaceful march to protest low wages of janitors.https://search.proquest.com/docview/30534630 The Janitors for Justice campaign began with Stephen Lerner, a former United Farm Workers (UFW) organizer and later head of SEIU's janitorial division in D.C. Lerner was placed in Denver for his first janitor's organizing drive. Lerner acknowledges the influence of his work with United Farm Workers, and Justice for Janitors \\"was enormously influenced by the tactics…of the farmworkers movement.\\" Janitors for Justice employed UFW tactics, such as vivid imagery of the exploitation of workers, demonstrations, street theater, hunger strikes, vigils, blockades, clergy-labor alliance, and community organizing. Justice for Janitors even adopted the rallying cry of the United Farm Workers: \\"¡Sí se puede!\\" Shaw, Randy. Beyond the Fields: Cesar Chavez, the UFW, and the Struggle for Justice in the 21st Century. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California, 2008. Print.  Campaigns  The Justice for Janitors campaigns often use strong tactics to get their point across. SEIU sends trained organizers to local unions in order to organize campaigns. The campaigns of Justice for Janitors also use master contracts that are market-wide. One contract in a certain market will apply to all union janitors across that market. This allows union workers to fight for different rights while applying any accomplishments to all workers in that market. = Los Angeles campaign = During the 1980s, janitors working for large real estate owners had become victims of competition and lowered wages. The large real estate companies sent out cleaning services to the building service contractors. These contractors were in high competition with each other and therefore cut wages for their cleaning services. In 1983, an average janitor working in LA had a salary of over $7.00 an hour ($17.20 in 2017 dollars adjusted for inflation) and full health insurance coverage for the janitor and his/her family. By 1986, the janitorial wages had been cut to a mere $4.50/hour ($10.05 in 2017 dollars adjusted for inflation), and health insurance coverage was no longer an option. By the late 1980s, janitors began to fight against these large owners and contractors. Janitors that were members of the SEIU joined together in the Justice for Janitors campaign using militant and direct action tactics. They wanted to hold both the owners and the contractors accountable. The Los Angeles campaign has been notable for the fact that many of the janitors are immigrants, most of them are women, and almost all are Latina/o all groups which have traditionally been viewed by unions as difficult to organize. Unions made deep connections in immigrant communities involving community groups, immigrants rights groups, and the personal networks that already existed among workers. The Justice for Janitors campaign showed how unions changed their strategies to organize women, this strike wasn't only about wage cuts, but also about gender equality for women and Immigrants rights. The Los Angeles Justice for Janitors union movement is well known for its mass protests where hundreds of mostly undocumented immigrant women and men from Mexico, and other central and South American countries disrupt the private and public spaces surrounding the buildings where they work. The Justice for Janitors campaign came from Denver to LA in 1988. They worked in downtown to represent the union base and organize the non-union companies. The Justice for Janitors organizers focused on \\"double-breasted\\" companies, which were \\"firms with both union and nonunion operations under different names.\\" The first campaign was directed toward Century Cleaning. The official strike of Janitors for Justice in Los Angeles began on April 3, 1990.Service Employees International Union, United Service Workers West Records at UCLA Special Collections The janitors marched and held demonstrations during the daytime for the 3 weeks. To help their cause, many religious leaders, community leaders, and politicians joined the action of the janitors and supported their protests. The archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony, held a special mass for the janitors. Also, mayor Richard Riordan joined the campaign by voicing his support for the janitors and their union. The janitors in Los Angeles stayed on strike until April 22. By this time, they had reached a contract that guaranteed at least a 22% raise over the next three years. The Los Angeles strike was significant to the future of Justice for Janitors as it spurred a nationwide campaign involving over 100,000 SEIU janitors in 2000. The campaign sought to raise wages for all janitors as well as improve overall working conditions. SEIU's Los Angeles Justice for Janitors campaign was portrayed in the motion picture Bread and Roses. =Houston campaign= Currently, many janitors in Houston, Texas are organizing through the Justice for Janitors campaigns. In July 2005, Houston janitors secured a check and neutrality agreement from the five largest cleaning contractors in Houston. In November 2005, four of the five contractors recognized SEIU as representing a majority of each contractor's workers, and in December, the fifth contractor did as well. In 2005 in Houston, the average janitor was earning an hourly salary of $5.25, compared to $20 in New York City and $13.30 in Philadelphia and Chicago. The success of the Houston campaign was surprising due to the South's history of resistance to unionization and hostility to labor. The success of service employees was decreasing in 2005, as the percentage of private-sector workers dropped to 7.9. Julius Getman, a labor law professor at the University of Texas, says the Justice for Janitors effort is \\"the largest unionization campaign in the South in years.\\" The AFL-CIO attempted a campaign in the 1980s known as the Houston Organizing Project, as the companies fought hard during a suffering economy to defeat the unionization effort. The Houston campaign succeeded with the help of prominent allies in the community, a common tactic used by the SEIU. They received the support from the mayor of Houston, several congressmen, clergymen, such as Joseph Fiorenza, the Roman Catholic archbishop. The clergy-labor alliance is a strong tactic first used by the UFW and Cesar Chavez, and it has been adopted by numerous labor groups because it helps gain support from the community by legitimizing the effort as a spiritual quest for justice. For example, Archbishop Fiorenza said in an interview about the Houston campaign that it is \\"basic justice and fairness that the wages should be increased.\\" He held a special mass for janitors and spoke at the union's kick-off rally.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Janitors' Drive in Texas Gives Hope to Unions.\\" New York Times. 28 Nov. 2005. Web. 08 Nov. 2009. The workers in Houston were also aided by pickets in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and elsewhere, where workers for the same employers refused to cross picket lines in solidarity with their fellow janitors in Houston. On November 20, 2006, a few days after dozens of strikers and their supporters were arrested by Houston police while engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience, a tentative agreement was reached between striking Houston janitors and employers. The proposed settlement included many concessions from employers, and SEIU was quick to declare victory. =Miami campaign= The University of Miami Justice for Janitors campaign officially began in February 2006. However, the precursors to this effort began as early as October 2001, when the University of Miami Faculty Senate began passing declarations to the University of Miami president, Donna Shalala. The declarations suggested that the university comply with the Miami-Dade County Living Wage Ordinance. At this time, there was little response to the resolutions provided. In February 2005, SEIU janitors began organizing at both Miami Beach condominiums, employed by Continental Group, as well as janitors working for the University of Miami. SEIU also used the help of the South Florida Interfaith Worker Justice (SFIWJ). By the fall of 2005, they had also enlisted the help of students at the University of Miami. An organization called STAND, Students Toward a New Democracy, had members attend direct action training workshops in San Francisco, paid for by SEIU. STAND had managed to rally over 300 students for an email list and received 800 signatures from undergraduates on a petition demanding better worker pay. On February 26, 2006, the janitors issued an unfair labor practice strike that would last nine weeks. Many of the professors at the University of Miami signed a pledge to support the strike. This meant that the professors would be holding classes off-campus in order to avoid crossing the janitors' picket lines. On March 16, 2006, Shalala capitulated and announced a wage raise of at least 25%. SEIU celebrated this gain, but they contained to prepare for further action at the University of Miami. On March 28, the tactics began to receive significant media attention. Clergy and students began blocking traffic on U.S. Route 1. 17 of the activists were arrested for blocking a major highway. At the same time, students were infiltrating the University of Miami admissions office. Here, the students argued with Shalala for four hours until she finally agreed to attend a meeting to discuss the current situation. The last stage of the campaign consisted of hunger strikes that led the University of Miami to feel a sense of crisis. Many of the strike's participants were hospitalized as a result of their extensive fasting. Due to the escalating sense of crisis on the university's campus, Shalala finally gave in. She proposed an even higher pay increase along with health benefits and a generous holiday break including paid personal days and paid holidays. = Boston Campaign = In an effort to demand higher wages, janitors in Boston under the SEIU 254 Justice for Janitors campaign had been planning to strike in the beginning of September 2002, but due to Mayor Thomas M. Menino’s intervention, the plans were delayed. The walkout was then planned for and took place on September 30, 2002. Around 2,000 janitors walked out and walked the streets of Downtown Boston, holding signs and chanting in both English and Spanish. The janitors participating in the march were employed by UNICCO, and walked out of their places of employment such as institutions like Harvard and Northeastern University. Janitors were joined by students who supported the movement. Former maid, Rocio Saenz, of the Local 254 of the SEIU in Boston, said “'janitors in New York, Chicago and San Francisco have health insurance, and when you consider that Boston is a world class city and has the second-highest rents in the nation, we don't understand it when the cleaning contractors say they can't afford to pay health insurance. This initial strike in Boston did not achieve the success its predecessor campaigns did, which some people expected. Some later campaigns at MIT were more successful in obtaining workers higher wages. Accomplishments The multiple Justice for Janitors campaigns have made many developments for janitors across the country. SEIU has worked with immigrant janitors, providing English language programs. SEIU also provides classes for janitors to help improve their computer skills. So far, 27 master contracts have been made with commercial cleaning contractors across the country. These contracts have helped to increase wages as well as health benefits for the janitors. The contracts have also created full-time jobs for some previously part-time workers. All of these accomplishments have led to an ensured stability for the labor force, however, janitors continue to be poorly paid and to work without benefits in many cities, both in the United States and in countries such as Canada.  Criticism  Criticism of the Justice for Janitors campaign is typically centered around non-democratic union processes and quick, trigger agreements.Luff, Jennifer. \\"Justice for Janitors.\\" Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working Class History. 2006 edition. p 730 When local Service Employees International Union officials refused to participate in Justice for Janitor campaigns, their supervisors would remove them from office, and replace them with \\"trustees to run the locals, then running the trustees for the presidency.\\"Luff, Jennifer. \\"Justice for Janitors.\\" Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working Class History. 2006 edition. p 731 At this time, the SEIU merged many smaller city or local offices, into regional or state wide offices, reaching multiple industries, making it difficult for rank and file individuals to compete for organizational and office positions with the more formal, staff run organizations. Those concerned over trigger agreements worried that the agreements were too lenient, giving too many concessions to the contractors. Criticism of the trigger agreements was quickly snuffed out after the SEIU won a rolling strike for healthcare benefits in 2000. Furthermore, despite successes elsewhere, Justice for Janitors has struggled to create and maintain campaigns in the American South and in suburban areas where janitorial services have grown at rate beyond the organizing capacity of SEIU. Another criticism of the SEIU is they unfairly use tactics against companies that cost jobs, diverting company resources into expensive legal battles.

It has been a municipality until 1 January 2009 when it fused with Sandavágur into Vága kommuna. Located on the south coast of the island of Vágar, Miðvágur is the largest town on this Faroese island. For years, Miðvágur has been known as a good location for whaling and traditionally, bells would ring with the cry \\"Grindaboð!\\" - \\"Pilot whale ahoy!\\" History Miðvágur has been inhabited since at least the Viking period—as excavations have demonstrated. Since these early times, there has been a local \\"Thingstätte\\" (local community council), or \\"Várting\\". The most interesting building of the village is Kálvalíð, a house which was probably built at the end of the Middle Ages.

It lies north, west and east of Kingston, and stretches into the Blue Mountains. In the 2011 census, it had 573,369, the highest population of any of the parishes in Jamaica. George William Gordon (d. 1865), one of Jamaica's seven National Heroes, was born in this parish. It contains many attractions, historical sites, famous residents, and the country's financial capital. The parish has a rich musical tradition, with numerous well-known musicians and developing popular types of Jamaican music. The Studio One studio founded by Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd is in Saint Andrew. Mavado, Sean Paul, Buju Banton, Elephant Man, The Mighty Diamonds, Monty Alexander, Beres Hammond, Lady Saw, Sugar Minott, Bounty Killer, Mr. Vegas, Richie Spice are some of the parish's current musician residents. The area of Trenchtown became famous for such residents as The Wailers (Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh and Bob Marley), and Toots Hibbert, who created reggae music. Waterhouse is another hometown to many musicians, including Keith Hudson, King Tubby's, U Roy, Sir Jammy's, Black Uhuru, Dennis \\"Senitor\\" Allen, Early B. Super Cat, Shabba, and Beenie Man. It is also the home of Olympic gold medalist, Shelly-Ann Fraser. The residence built in 1881 by George Stiebel, Jamaica's first black millionaire, is known as Devon House. Steibel gained his wealth in Venezuela and returned to Jamaica. He was appointed as the Custos, a high civic post, of Saint Andrew. His residence has been restored and is operated as a house museum; it is open to the public for tours and special events. Concessions include a Devon House ice cream shop. The grounds of the Hope Estate, built in the 17th century, now support Hope Gardens (Royal Botanical Gardens), one of the oldest in the Western Hemisphere. The University of the West Indies is located on the estate and uses some of the historic buildings. Part of the navigable aqueduct is still intact. Vale Royal, the residence of the Prime Minister, and King's House, the Governor General's residence, are significant historic buildings.The Right To Be Proud: A Brief Guide To Jamaican Heritage Sites The area of Norbrook was once the plantation of George William Gordon. The Bob Marley Museum is located in a mansion on Hope Road that was once owned by businessman Chris Blackwell. It is now open for guided tours. Geography St. Andrew was one of the first parishes to be established by law in 1867. Before being established, it was known as Liguanea. St Andrew is located at and covers an area of . The parish lies just north of Kingston, bounded in the west by St. Catherine, north by St. Mary, northeast by Portland along the Blue Mountain range, and east by St. Thomas. In 1923, the parishes of St Andrew and Kingston were administratively merged to form the Kingston and St Andrew Corporation (KSAC), with a single elected council and a mayor. Parts of the geographic area of Saint Andrew is often referred to as the \\"Corporate Area, town, Kingston Metropolitan area, uptown Kingston, Kingston 2-20\\". The current mayor of KSAC is Delroy Williams. St Andrew has one major river, that being hope river at 19.6 Kilometres Cross Roads, New Kingston, Half-Way-Tree, Matilda's Corner, and Constant Spring are important commercial centres in St. Andrew, but may be regarded as suburbs of Kingston. Coronation Market bordering both Saint Andrew and Kingston, is one of the largest, if not the largest outdoor market in this part of the island provides a venue for farmers throughout Jamaica. West St. Andrew, however, is a populous residential area. Total population of the parish was 573,369 in 2011.

Its principal products include coffee, mangoes, cocoa, peas, beans, sugarcane, cattle, dairy goods, cigar and cigarette, vegetables and ground provisions. To encourage the movement of industrial plants from the business areas of Kingston, and to facilitate the establishment of new industries with local and overseas capital, the government has established an industrial estate in St. Andrew, bordering on Western Kingston. This industrial estate is over 1.2 km2 (300 acres) in size. Tourism plays a major part in the economy of the parish. The major hotels in this southeastern part of the country can be found on Knutsford Boulevard, also known as The Strip. The area of New Kingston is seen as the financial capital of the island, with its large headquarters for banks and investment companies. The commercial areas, with their many malls, plazas and stores, provide employment for many in the urban area of the parish. Gypsum is found in large quantities, in eastern St. Andrew, the largest deposits being in the area of Bull Bay, a mile and a half of the coast. At the south of Papine, several miles northeast of Kingston is the University of the West Indies, occupying of the Liguanea Plain at the foot of Long Mountain. The University of Technology, Jamaica, formerly the College of Arts, Science and Technology, is located nearby. So too is the United Theological College of the West Indies. The Edna Manley School for the Visual Arts is also located in Saint Andrew, not far from the National Stadium. The parish of Saint Andrew also has some of the top high schools on the island. Campion College, Camperdown High School, Jamaica College, Calabar High School, Ardenne High School, Immaculate Conception High School, St Andrew High School for Girls, Holy Childhood High School, Meadowbrook High School, St. George's College, St Hugh's High School, Convent of Mercy “Alpha” Academy, Excelsior High School, and a campus of Kingston College, in Rollington Town, are some of those schools. Saint Andrew provides the vibrancy that creates a city environment, nightlife, many restaurants, outdoor facilities, and tourist attractions, making the city of Kingston what it is today. Government and infrastructure The St. Andrew Juvenile Remand Centre of the Department of Correctional Services, Jamaica is located in Stony Hill, St. Andrew Parish. Transportation =Road= The primary roads through Kingston to the rest of the island all pass through St Andrew including the A1 to Lucea, A3 to Saint Ann's Bay, A4 to Annotto Bay and B1 to Buff Bay via Newcastle.

Ngoyo tradition held that the kingdom's ancestors were among the earliest settlers in the area, leading their chiefs to title themselves the nfumu nsi (\\"lords of the earth\\"). The capital was Mbanza Ngoyo. By 1700, Cabinda had become the leading slave port north of Luanda, and Ngoyo's economy rested heavily on the sale of slaves. In 1783, Ngoyo joined forces with the neighboring state of Kakongo to destroy a Portuguese fort. However, the kingdom was soon undone by the growing financial burden that the kingship entailed. With fewer and fewer possible claimants seeking the office, the kingdom effectively disintegrated in the 1830s after the nobles failed to elect a new king. In 1885, the Ngoyo signed the Treaty of Simulambuco with Portugal, and became a protectorate of that nation.

A church tax is imposed in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Sweden, some parts of Switzerland and several other countries. In Spain and Portugal paying a church tax is optional.The Economist, 12 September 2019, Why so many non- religious Europeans pay church taxes The constitution of a number of countries such as the United States could be and have been interpreted as both supporting and prohibiting the levying of taxes unto churches; prohibiting church tax could separate church and state fiscally, but it could also be favorable treatment by the government. It is explicitly prohibited in India for the state to levy taxes on religious grounds under Article 27 of the Constitution of India. In Australia there is no specific constitutional exemption. Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e., the Federal parliament) from making laws for establishing any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, but it does not make any specific reference to taxation. Religious organisations are however exempt by virtue of legislation by the various Federal & State parliaments giving them charitable status.  Austria  Every recognized religious group in Austria can collect church tax at a rate of 1.1%, though currently only the Catholic Church makes use of that opportunity. Church tax is compulsory for Catholics in Austria. This tax was introduced by Adolf Hitler in 1939. After World War II, the tax was retained in order to keep the Church independent of political powers.  Denmark  The members of the national Church of Denmark pay a church tax, called \\"kirkeskat\\". The rate varies among municipalities with a minimum of 0.4% and a maximum of 1.3% of taxable income in 2019. The tax is generally around 0.7% of taxable income. The collection of the church tax is administered by the Danish tax authorities, but the church tax is not considered as a genuine tax by, for example, Statistics Denmark, but as a \\"voluntary transfer from households to the state\\". The church tax does not cover the entire budget of the Church of Denmark. An additional 9% is paid by the government through block grants (\\"bloktilskud\\"), which means that people who are not members of the Church of Denmark also finance its activities through taxes.  Finland  All members of either the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and the Finnish Orthodox Church (the two state churches of Finland) pay an income-based church tax of between 1% and 2%, depending on the municipality. On average the tax is about 1.4%. Formerly, to stop paying church tax, one had to formally leave the church by personally going to local register office and waiting during an allowance of time for reflection. This requirement was removed in 2003 and currently a written (but not signed) statement to the church suffices. The majority of resignations since 2005 are now handled through a web site, Eroakirkosta.fi. If one is a member of the church when the year begins, they will pay taxes for the whole year. Studies show that church membership resignations in Finland are mainly due to the general secularization of society, not because of tax avoidance.  Germany  Receipt dated September 17, 1923 About 70% of church revenues come from church tax (Kirchensteuer), also called worship tax (Kultussteuer) when referring to non-Christian religious bodies such as Jewish synagogues. This is about €9.2 billion (in 2010). Article 137 of the Weimar Constitution of 1919 and article 140 of the German Basic Law of 1949 form the legal bases for this practice. In Germany, on the basis of tax regulations passed by the religious communities and within the limits set by state laws, communities may either * require the taxation authorities of the state to collect the fees from the members on the basis of income tax assessment (then, the authorities withhold a collection fee), or * choose to collect the church tax themselves. In the first case, membership in the religious community is stored in a database at the Federal Tax Office which employers receive excerpts of for the purpose of withholding tax on paid income. If an employee's data indicate membership in a tax- collecting religious community, the employer must withhold church tax prepayments from their income in addition to other tax prepayments. In connection with the final annual income tax assessment, the state revenue authorities also finally assess the church tax owed. In the case of self- employed persons or of unemployed taxpayers, state revenue authorities collect prepayments on the church tax together with prepayments on the income tax. If, however, religious communities choose to collect church tax themselves, they may demand that the tax authorities reveal taxation data of their members to calculate the contributions and prepayments owed. In particular, some smaller communities (e.g., the Jewish Community of Berlin) choose to collect taxes themselves to save collection fees the government would charge otherwise. Collection of church tax may be used to cover any church-related expenses such as funding institutions and foundations or paying ministers. The church tax is only paid by members of the respective church. People who are not members of a church tax-collecting denomination do not have to pay it. Members of a religious community under public law may formally declare their wish to leave the community to state (not religious) authorities. The obligation to pay church taxes ends once such a declaration has been made. Some communities refuse to administer marriages and burials of (former) members who had declared to leave it. The money flow of state and churches is distinct at all levels of the procedures. The church tax is not meant to be a way for the state to directly support churches, but since expenses for church tax are fully deductible (as are voluntary expenses for the Church, for charity or a bundle of other privileged aims) in fact such support occurs on a somewhat large scale. The effort of collecting itself, done by the State, is entirely paid for by the Churches with a part of the tax income. The church tax is historically rooted in the pre-Christian Germanic custom where the chief of the tribe was directly responsible for the maintenance of priests and religious groups. During the Christianization of Western Europe, this custom was adopted by the Christian churches (Arian and Catholic) in the concept of \\"Eigenkirchen\\" (churches owned by the landlord) which stood in strong contrast to the central church organization of the Roman Catholic Church. Despite the resulting medieval conflict between emperor and pope, the concept of church maintenance by the ruler remained the accepted custom in most Western European countries. In Reformation times, the local princes in Germany became officially heads of the church in Protestant areas and were legally responsible for the maintenance of churches. Not until the 19th century, were the finances of churches and state regulated to a point where the churches became financially independent. At this point, the church tax was introduced to replace the state benefits the churches had obtained previously. The church tax was reaffirmed in Article 13 of the Reichskonkordat between Nazi Germany and the Vatican, where it is understood that the right of the Church to levy taxes is guaranteed. Taxpayers, whether Roman Catholic, Protestant or members of other tax-collecting communities, pay an amount equal to between 8% (in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg) and 9% (in the rest of the country) of their income tax to the church or other community to which they belong. For example, a single person earning €50,000 may pay an average income-tax of 20%, thus €10,000. The church tax is then an additional 8% (or 9%) of that €10,000 (€800 or €900) for a total of €10,800 or €10,900 in taxes.\\"German Catholics lose church rights for unpaid tax \\", BBC News In 2017, Germany’s Catholic church recorded approximately €6 billion split across its 27 different dioceses, also known as church districts. This is in spite of the massive dip in attendance. According to the national German newspaper Handelsblatt, church attendance has dropped by more than 2.2 million attendees since the start of the millennium. Contrasted to 50 years prior, where attendance totaled over 11 million, the numbers are now a mere 2.5 million Catholics. The German Church also has a total fortune of at least €20 billion. The three highest profiting dioceses are Paderborn, at €3.5 billion, Munich at €2.8 billion, and Cologne at €2.6 billion. Despite the extreme success of this bill on forcing tax payment, many citizens still find ways to stay away from paying for it. When moving to Germany, one must fill out a form declaring religious affiliation and denomination. One can also manage to opt out of the tax at a later date, if they are a non-practicing member of their faith. This has led to many people declaring they have abandoned the religion of their birth. There is currently no data available regarding what proportion of those making such a declaration have in fact abandoned their religion, or whether they make the claim only to avoid paying the tax.  Iceland  Taxpayers in Iceland who belong to an officially registered religious group or secular humanist organization must pay a congregation tax (Icelandic: sóknargjald, plural sóknargjöld) which is deducted from income taxes and goes to the individual's respective organization. In the past, the sóknargjald of those who do not belong to any recognized religious organization went to the University of Iceland, but this was changed in 2009. In cases of individuals not belonging to a registered religious group or secular humanist organization, the amount that would otherwise be used for the sóknargjald remains now part of the income tax budget. In 2015, the monthly sóknargjald amounted to 824 Icelandic krónur, about $US6. The Church of Iceland receives governmental support beyond the congregation taxes paid by its members.  Italy  Taxpayers in Italy pay a mandatory eight per thousand tax, and have the option to choose to whom they will assign the monies. This tax amounts to 0.8% of the total income tax (IRPEF) and every taxpayer can choose the recipient of the contribution on their tax form. Regardless of whether the taxpayer expresses a preference or not, the 0.8% is already included in their tax levy. Currently the choices are: * Italian State * Catholic Church * Waldensian Evangelical Church * Seventh-day Adventist Church * Assemblies of God in Italy * Union of the Jewish Communities in Italy * Lutheran Evangelical Church in Italy * Baptist Evangelical Christian Union of Italy * Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy * Apostolic Church in Italy (Pentecostalism) * Italian Buddhist Union * Italian Hindu Union If the choice is not expressly declared on the tax form, the tax is distributed according to the percentages of the taxpayers who have declared their choice of beneficiary. While it was intended that the state should use its own share of the 0.8% tax for social or cultural purposes, in practice it has employed it for general purposes including its military mission in Iraq in 2004\\"In Iraq l'8 per mille destinato all'arte\\" - Corriere della Sera 10 November 2006 and the upgrading of prison infrastructure in 2011.  Sweden  The members of Church of Sweden pay church fee, which varies between municipalities, but can be as much as 2%. Church and state are separated as of 2000; however, the burial tax (begravningsavgift) is paid by everyone regardless of membership. In a recent development, the Swedish government has agreed to continue collecting from individual taxpayers the annual payment that has always gone to the church. But now the fee will be an optional checkoff box on the tax return. The government will allocate the money collected to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish and other faiths as well as the Lutherans, with each taxpayer directing where his or her taxes should go.  Switzerland  There is no official state church in Switzerland. However, except Geneva and Neuchâtel, each canton (state) financially supports at least one of the three traditional denominations – Roman Catholic, Old Catholic (in Switzerland Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland), or Evangelical Reformed – with funds collected through taxation. Each canton church tax may formally have to leave the church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax. In Geneva and Neuchâtel there is no church tax : each taxpayer is free to make a voluntary tax deductible contribution or gift to his church, either directly to the beneficiary or using the canton (state) tax system.  United States  In the United States, the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution prevents the US federal government and (through incorporation doctrine) the 50 state governments from imposing church taxes. In 1947, the US Supreme Court ruled in Everson v. Board of Education that \\"No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.\\" Prior to American independence, Massachusetts and Connecticut supported the Congregational church through tax. In colonial South Carolina, the Anglican Church benefited from church taxes.

Announced in May 1992, it was Sun's first desktop multiprocessor (being housed in a pizza box form factor case). It was later replaced with the SPARCstation 20. The 40 MHz SPARCstation 10 without external cache was the reference for the SPEC CPU95 benchmark. Specifications =CPU support= MBus module for the SPARCstation 10 The SPARCstation 10 (SS10) contains two MBus slots running at either 36 MHz (33 MHz for the earliest models) or 40 MHz (set via motherboard jumper). Each MBus slot can contain single or dual SPARC CPU modules, permitting expansion to up to four CPUs. Both SuperSPARC and hyperSPARC CPU modules were available. Single SuperSPARC modules without external cache were sold by Sun; they ran at the clock speed of the MBus (uniprocessor Models 20, 30 and 40; dual processor Model 402). Single and a few dual SuperSPARC modules with 1 MB external cache were also sold; they were independently clocked, and ran at a higher rate than the MBus, most commonly 40.3 MHz or 50 MHz (uniprocessor Models 41 and 51; multiprocessor Models 412, 512 and 514). Sun's dual 50 MHz SuperSPARC modules (the only dual MBus modules supported by Sun for this system) were double-width, physically occupying one SBus slot per module in addition to an MBus slot. SuperSPARC modules with and without external cache could not be mixed. SuperSPARC modules with external cache could be mixed, even with different clock speeds, but this was not a Sun-supported configuration. Ross hyperSPARC modules were also available from third party vendors. The SS10 had reasonable cooling capacity given the cramped \\"pizzabox\\" case, but it was not designed for some of the higher-speed hyperSPARC modules, and so heat issues were common when these modules were used, particularly in four CPU configurations . = Memory = The SS10 can hold a maximum of 512 MB RAM in eight slots. = Disk drives = The SS10's enclosure can hold two 50-pin SCSI hard drives and a floppy disk drive. Other SCSI devices can be attached via the external SCSI port. There is no ATA disk support. =Network support= There is one onboard Ethernet interface, which can be accessed from a built-in 10BASE-T jack or via a special 26-pin port that provides both AUI and audio connections; only one of these network ports can be active at a time. A special cable or adapter is needed to convert the latter port to a standard DA-15 connector. There are also two Basic Rate Interface (BRI) ISDN connectors; the system shipped with plastic blocking plugs inserted in these connectors. Additional SBus network cards can also be added. =Graphics support= Most SPARCstation 10 systems lack integrated graphics. A very few, referred to as the SPARCstation 10SX, include the SX, or CG14, framebuffer used on the SPARCstation 20, requiring a 4MB or 8MB VSIMM to operate. All SPARCstation 10s seem to have the VSIMM slots, a cutout in the case and solder pads for the SX's 13W3 connector. Other options include the CG6 (GX, GX+, Turbo GX and TGX+) 8-bit SBus framebuffers, capable of up to 1280×1024 resolution in 8-bit color, and the ZX (Leo). The ZX is a 24-bit card with hardware-accelerated 3D operations, offering high speeds and resolutions, however, it's poorly supported, takes up two SBus slots, and runs extremely hot. Its faster cousin, the Turbo ZX, requires a fan card, taking up all four SBus slots. Full support is only available in Solaris 2.4 through 2.6, though the 2.6 drivers can be made to work in Solaris 7, 8 and 9. Linux includes an accelerated driver for it which supports 2D acceleration features, but no 3D.

Khosa completed elementary school in Sofala, and high school in Zambezia. In Maputo he attended Eduardo Mondlane University, receiving a bachelor's degree in History and Geography. He then worked as a high school teacher. In 1982, Khosa worked for the Ministry of Education for over a year. Six months after leaving the Ministry of Education, he was invited to work for the Writer’s Association. He initiated his career as a writer with the publication of several short stories and was one of the founders of the magazine Charrua of the Associação dos Escritores Moçambicanos (AEMO). It was his experiences in Niassa and Cabo Delgado, where poorly organized reeducation camps were located, that gave him the urge to write and expose this reality.

Published works *Ualalapi (1987) :Ualalapi is the name of a warrior nguni who is destined to kill Mafemane, brother of Mudungazi (later called Ngungunhane). This fictional story, a collection of six loosely related episodes, describes the life of hosi (king, emperor, in the Tsonga language) Ngungunhane, celebrity of the resistance to the Portuguese at the end of nineteenth century. Ualalapi´s telling of the story creates an epic ambience; however, an oral tradition describes the emperor as a tyrant rather than a hero. The author tracks Ngungunhane's rise to power over his murdered rivals and his eventual decline. The story is a disguised warning against tyranny. The book was translated into English in 2017. In 2002, Ualalapi was announced by a panel of judges in Accra, Ghana as one of Africa's 100 best books of the twentieth century. *Orgia dos loucos (1990) *Histórias de amor e espanto (1999) *No reino dos abutres (2002) *Os sobreviventes da noite (2005) *Choriro (2009) *Entre as Memórias Silenciadas (2013) *Cartas de Inhaminga (2017) Bibliography *Chabal, Patrick.

It aims to assess whether medical school students or graduates can apply important concepts of the foundational sciences fundamental to the practice of medicine. US medical students who wish to seek licensure to practice medicine in the US typically take Step 1 at the end of the second year of medical school. Graduates of international medical schools (i.e., those outside the US or Canada) must also take Step 1 if they want to practice in the US. Graduates from international medical schools must apply through ECFMG, and the registration fee is $915. ECFMG Fees For 2020, the NBME registration fee for the test is $645, with additional charges for applicants who choose a testing region outside the United States or Canada. USMLE Fees During COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd Protests, the medical community criticized the USMLE for their refusal to revert Step 1 scoring to pass/fail before 2022 and for the gross mishandling of Step examinations during the pandemic, creating \\"chaos,\\" further \\"disadvantages,\\" \\"harm,\\" \\"bias\\" and \\"inequity;\\" and called for an emergency committee (that included student representatives) who could address these issues in a timely manner without financial or other conflict of interests.https://www.ama-assn.org/residents-students/usmle/delays- miscommunications-add-even-more-stress-usmle-step-exams https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/932366https://www.ama-assn.org/residents- students/usmle/delays-miscommunications-add-even-more-stress-usmle-step- examshttps://thesheriffofsodium.com/2019/02/01/a-non-mbas-guide-to-nbme- revenue-in-9-simple-chartsCurrent recommendations under consideration include retroactive step 1 pass/fail reporting for the class of 2022, or having each student choose how their Step 1 score is reported on their ERAS transcript (pass/fail or scored) beginning with the class of 2021.https://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/class-of-2023-step-1-scores- possibly-may-be-converted-to-p-f-on-residency-application-per-usmle-town- hall.1413758https://www.usmle.org/incus As per an official announcement from USMLE, scores will never be retroactively masked. The announcement reads “ All scores for Step 1 exams taken prior to the date of the policy change will continue to be reported using the three-digit numeric score on all USMLE transcripts.” https://covid.usmle.org/announcements/usmle-score-reporting- policy-updates History Prior to 1992, the NBME Part I examination served as the staple basic science examination for medical students at the end of their second year. Upon the launch of the three-part United States Medical Licensing Examination, NBME Part I exam was carried forward in its new format, the USMLE Step 1 examination, which has since evolved to become an increasingly clinically-applied examination of the foundational sciences. The exam became computer based several years later. In May 2015, the USMLE began emphasizing of concepts regarding patient safety and quality improvement across all parts of the USMLE exam series, including Step 1.http://www.usmle.org/pdfs/Changes_to_USMLE_handout.pdf While the USMLE Step 1 has traditionally been taken after students complete foundational sciences and before core clinical clerkships, in recent years a number of medical schools have reformed their medical school curriculum, moving to having students take the USMLE Step 1 after core clinical clerkships or preliminary clinical training. Top medical schools such as Harvard Medical School, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Penn State College of Medicine, UCSF School of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, Stanford School of Medicine, University of Michigan, Yale School of Medicine, Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine at the University of Iowa and New York University School of Medicine have instituted these changes, requiring completion of the exam in the third year of medical school.

Eight Institutions Share Their Experiences Moving United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 After Core Clinical Clerkships, Academic Medicine 2017 Nov;92(11):1515-1524. doi:10.1097/ACM.0000000000001714. Format The exam is currently an eight- hour computer-based test taken in a single-day, composed of seven 40-question sections with a maximum 280 multiple-choice questions. USMLE General Announcements One hour is provided for each section, allotting an average of a minute and thirty seconds to answer each question. USMLE Announcements Between test sections, the test taker is allotted a cumulative 45 minutes (during the test day) for personal breaks. (There is a 15-minute tutorial at the beginning of the exam, which the test-taker can choose to skip and have that time added to break time.) If the taker finishes any section before the allotted one hour time limit, the unused time is added to the break time total. USMLE Testing Bulletin The test is administered at any of several Prometric computer testing sites. Starting in 2022, the USMLE Step I examination will be reported as pass/fail rather than a three-digit score https://www.usmle.org/inCus/. Subjects Step 1 is designed to test the knowledge learned during the basic science years of medical school as applied in the form of clinical vignettes. This includes anatomy, behavioral sciences, biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology, and physiology, as well as to interdisciplinary areas including genetics, aging, immunology, nutrition, and molecular and cell biology.http://www.usmle.org/Examinations/step1/step1_content.html Epidemiology, medical ethics and questions on empathy are also emphasized. Each exam is dynamically generated for each test taker; while the general proportion of questions derived from a particular subject is the same, some test takers report that certain subjects are either emphasized or deemphasized. Scoring Currently, students receive a three-digit score following sitting for the Step 1 examination. In 1999, the USMLE phased out the use of a percentile-based system in favor of a three-digit and two-digit scaled scoring system. In October 2011, two-digit scaled scores were no longer reported to any parties besides the examinees. In April 2013, the two-digit score was eliminated completely from the score report. While the USMLE program does not disclose how the three-digit score is calculated, Step 1 scores theoretically range from 1 to 300, most examinees score in the range of 140 to 260, the passing score is 194 and the national mean and standard deviation are approximately 229 and 20, respectively.http://www.usmle.org/pdfs/transcripts/USMLE_Step_Examination_Score_Interpretation_Guidelines.pdf Rise in the national mean Step 1 score has been observed with time, as shown in the table below. According to the National Resident Matching Program, the mean score for U.S. allopathic seniors who matched to residency programs in 2016 was 233.2 (sd = 17.4).http://www.nrmp.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/09/Charting-Outcomes-US-Allopathic-Seniors-2016.pdf It was announced on February 12th, 2020 that beginning no earlier than January 2022, USMLE Step 1 would transition to a pass/fail scoring system. Mean and median USMLE scores have increased significantly from 2003 to today leading to the testing board having to increase the score it takes to pass; independent research cited that Practice-question usage was self-reported as a completion fraction of UWorld, USMLE-Rx, or Kaplan question banks or self- assessments.https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/Fulltext/2017/11001/Study_Behaviors_and_USMLE_Step_1_Performance_.12.aspx The USMLE has decided that three digit score results for Step 1 exams taken prior to January 1, 2022 will \\"continue to be reported using the three-digit numeric score on all USMLE transcripts.\\" https://www.usmle.org/frequently- asked-questions/#step1 { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" + National Step 1 means among US and Canadian first time test-takers by year ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"50pt\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"90pt\\"  Mean Score ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"90pt\\"  Standard Deviation - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2016  align=\\"center\\" 228  align=\\"center\\"  21 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2015  align=\\"center\\" 229  align=\\"center\\"  20 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2014  align=\\"center\\" 229  align=\\"center\\"  20 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2013  align=\\"center\\"  226  align=\\"center\\"  21 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2012  align=\\"center\\"  224  align=\\"center\\"  21 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2011  align=\\"center\\"  224  align=\\"center\\"  22 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2010  align=\\"center\\"  222  align=\\"center\\"  24 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2009  align=\\"center\\"  221  align=\\"center\\"  24 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2008  align=\\"center\\"  221  align=\\"center\\"  23 - } USMLE mishandling during COVID-19 With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the USMLE and NBME were met with tremendous criticism by the medical community--including their parent organizations AMA and AAMC as well as letters and petitions from physicians and students-- for lack of flexibility and adaptability during COVID and for mishandling testing and refusing to revert step 1 scoring pass/fail before 2022.https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/929899 A summary of current complaints surrounding the USMLE mishandlings can be found here and include the USMLE's \\"failure to take responsibility,\\" \\"lack of communication,\\" \\"day-of cancellations,\\" and unequal access for test takers that created \\"inequity,\\" \\"bias,\\" \\"chaos\\" and \\"harm\\" to students and \\"shortchanging their clinical experience.\\" By not reverting to remote P/F during COVID, the USMLE is \\"distracting students from their medical education,\\" said a doctor at a Stanford. Because of overemphasize of Step 1, students study for months, often at the expense of classes and clinical training. These further delays will further exacerbate that problem. For the few that were able to test during COVID, many of those students reported taking a day or more off of clinical rotations to fly to their exam, only to find out their exam was cancelled day- of and had to scramble for a new date months later, meaning they would miss more months of their medical education to study for Step 1.https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/93236 The medical community was upset that despite the chaos, harm, and damages to the integrity of the test created by USMLE, the USME's concern was their stakeholders, not students. Despite numerous letters, petitions on change.org and the medical community's public pleas, Michael Barone, VP of NBME Licensure Programs, said that the USMLE would not consider moving up the anticipated pass/fail Step 1 scoring before 2022 because it would affect their \\"stakeholders\\" (implying that their stakeholders were residency programs, not medical students). The medical community was upset that the USMLE prioritized residency programs (who want to keep scores visible) over students and doctors (who believe score reporting should be pass/fail as originally intended). The Step scores were not designed to be used as a residency admissions metric; the scores we intended for medical licensing purposes only and have no meaning beyond pass/fail designation. While it is ultimately the Residency programs fault for misusing the step scores, the USMLE/NBME are aware of and directly enabling the misuse. The overemphasis of Step would not occur if the exam was scored as originally intended. https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/932366 The resulting \\"harm and chaos\\" has created inequity and bias and damaged the integrity of the Step exams. To have the most \\"unbiased and equitable\\" exam, the medical community has asked the AAMC, ERAS, and USMLE to allow medical students to choose how their score would be reported (scored or P/F) on their ERAS transcript during this transition or retroactively report scores as pass/fail beginning with the class of 2022. To avoid the potential financial conflict of interest of the NBME and USMLE,https://thesheriffofsodium.com/2019/02/01/a-non-mbas-guide-to- nbme-revenue-in-9-simple-charts the Coalition for Physician Accountability launched workgroups to address the downstream implications of COVID-19. https://www.ama-assn.org/residents-students/usmle/delays-miscommunications- add-even-more-stress-usmle-step-exams Numerous memes have gone viral regarding these matters. Changes to Step 1 scoring =Misuse of Step 1 Scoring to grant residency interviews= The medical community criticized the USMLE and residency programs for using an exam that is originally Pass/Fail to be used as the main screening tool in selecting applicants a residency interview, creating a \\"barrier that was never meant to exist.\\" Residency directors are “overweighting a screening test in a manner not supported by evidence and for which the test was not specifically designed. Step 1 was designed as a pass/fail exam, and beyond the pass/fail designation, the scores were not meant to have meaning.https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/05/why-are-medical- students-non-essential.html For state licensing purposes, the exam always has been pass/fail, but over the past few years, its three-digit numeric score has been used as the main determination in granting medical interviews. https://drmerl.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/step-1-scores-should-not-be-the- number-1-barrier-to-a-good-residency-or-fellowship In recent years, an applicant's Step 1 score has been cited by residency program directors as their most important criterion in selecting graduating medical students for their residency program, despite lack of evidence or data to support that perversion. Average USMLE Step 1 scores for various residencies are available in Charting Outcomes in the Match. Studies on Step 1 performance found that \\"Step 1 is neither precise nor does it predict student performance as residents beyond a certain threshold. With a standard error of eight points, two applicants with scores as far as 15 points apart may not be meaningfully different and yet several programs use singular cutoff points as screening tools.\\"https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/08/make-step-1-test-pass-fail-medical- students https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/transcripts/USMLE_Step_Examination_Score_Interpretation_Guidelines.pdf This, as well as the negative impact on student learning, cost, gross misuse of student time, and attempt to decrease racial bias, are amongst the many reasons that the USMLE announced it would revert to pass/fail reporting of Step 1 beginning 2022. =Unintended consequences= In a 2017 study, students started studying for Step 1 during their preclinical curriculum and increased the intensity of their study time until it reached a maximum of 11 hours a day over the period of a month before the exam. Instead of relying on their medical school curriculum, the students instead focused heavily on third-party study materials. While this “parallel curriculum” did lead to an increased Step 1 score, it often did not help them learn the medical school curriculum, because students were skipping lectures and classes.\\" https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristenmoon/2020/04/07/usmle-step-1-is-now- passfailwho-benefits-from-this-big-change/#23fde8c94873 =Racial bias and lack of diversity in specialities= Since 2001, there has been a strong plea to remove the Step 1 score barrier that affects all students but especially those of specific racial and ethnic groups. \\"Using Step 1 scores to screen residency applications puts students who are underrepresented in medicine at a disadvantage.\\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/14/cheers-and-jeers-as-med- schools-step-1-test-becomes-pass-fail Step 1 scores create unfortunate racial disparities. For Step 1, black and Latino students receive markedly lower scores than white students.https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/05/why-are- medical-students-non-essential.html A 2001 study in internal medicine residency showed that \\"when Step 1 scores were used to screen applicants for interviews, a significantly greater proportion of Black students were refused interviews.\\" A 2019 study on Orthopedic Surgery residency programs (the specialty with the lowest percentage of underrepresented students) showed that between 2005 and 2014, Black and Latino applicants were accepted into residency programs at a significantly lower rate (61%) than white applicants (71%). Further studies showed lack of diversity within specialities and that that underrepresented students were more likely to go into specialities that have lower Step 1 cut offs like Primary Care.https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/14/cheers-and-jeers-as-med-schools- step-1-test-becomes-pass-fail =Public support for USMLE changes= The USMLE parent organizations, including the AAFP, AMSA,https://www.aafp.org/news/education-professional- development/20200220usmlechange.html and AAMC wrote letters to the USMLE recommended broad, systemic changes to the medical program including changing Step 1 to Pass/Fail. \\"The current overemphasis on USMLE Step 1 is having overwhelming negative impact on students. This should be addressed immediately. A pass/fail score will help provide a more meaningful learning environment, improved emotional climate, and better student-student interactions, which can lead to better academic performance that includes USMLE tests (see Cause or effect?). Additionally it will decrease racial bias for programs that use USMLE Step 1 scores to grant interviews.\\" https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/incus/American%20Academy%20of%20Family%20Physicians.pdf Further, they supported the move to Step 1 pass/fail citing unintentional negative impact of a single standardized exam on career exploration and selection.https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/press-releases/aamc-statement- police-brutality-and-racism-america-and-their-impact-healthThe AAFP wrote that changing Step 1 to pass/fail creates a \\"more equitable student evaluation and residency selection process, as it will reduce the impact of racial and other biases on residency selection. Factors that impact student experience with standardized testing (such as access to test preparation) perpetuate inequities and disparities that impact test performance, but do not predict or capture competency or skills for future physicians.\\"https://www.aafp.org/media-center/releases- statements/all/2020/usmle-step-1-scoring-change-removes-a-harmful-barrier-to- holistic-specialty-selection.html The AMSA recommended immediate pass/fail to \\"Reduce the adverse impact of the current overemphasis on USMLE performance in residency screening\\" and reduce racial bias.\\" https://www.amsa.org/2019/07/29/amsas-response-to-usmle-scoring-change- recommendations The ECFMG and AMA support this transition as well. https://www.usmle.org/incus As part of a public plea for systemic changes to the misuse of USMLE STEP exams, STAT wrote that the Harmful impact of an exam that was designed to be pass/fail has caused so much unnecessary anguish.... \\"This multimillion-dollar industry has exploited the opportunity to extract thousands of dollars from already overly indebted students (registering for STEP exams test cost $645-$1300, while Step 1 preparation materials and courses run much higher).https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/08/make-step-1-test- pass-fail-medical-students = Public objection to USMLE changes = Immediately following the announcement by USMLE that Step 1 would become pass/fail in 2022, student outcry from the IMG (International Medical Graduate) community began over Twitter as well as several different international USMLE Step 1 groups and forums. International students expressed frustration and anger with ECFMG's statement, \\"The ECFMG supports the informed decision making of the NBME and FSMB Boards on these policy changes. We are looking forward to continually advocating for international graduates as well as participating in the important future conversations on residency selection and transition\\" due to growing concerns that the change will further decrease IMG chances of matching into US residency programs. Historically, IMGs have been at a significant disadvantage when applying to residency programs in the US. Program directors have been known to place a high emphasis on letters of recommendation, clinical grades, and research. Since international medical students come from medical schools with different grading systems and do not usually have access to well-known faculty and American research opportunities, USMLE Step 1 is often seen as a major opportunity to boost IMG residency applications with a high score. Without a numerical score on the USMLE Step 1, there is speculation that IMG's will be further be pushed out of the race for residency program spots. =Response from Katsufrakis and Chaudhry= Peter Katsufrakis, CEO of the NBME, and Humayun Chaudhry, CEO of the FSMB, argued that numerical scores can help residency programs differentiate among thousands of applicants for a limited number of slots. In an early version of the essay, they noted that if students spent less time preparing for Step 1 and \\"more time to activities that make them less prepared to provide quality care, such as binge-watching the most recent Netflix series or compulsively updating their Instagram account, this could negatively impact residency performance and ultimately patient safety.\\" Within a few days, Katsufrakis and Chaudhry issued an apology and removed the phrase, but the comment fueled a Twitter storm, bringing Step 1 scoring to the forefront.https://www.medpagetoday.com/hospitalbasedmedicine/graduatemedicaleducation/84914 While the NBME, USMLE, and FSMB were originally against these changes (which critics argued may have been from potential monetary loss), as of 2020 (and after the formation of INCUS), they have changed their stance in support of public opinion. Humayun Chaudhry, the President of the FSMB, (who was originally in opposition to the STEP changes), later said that “although the primary purpose of the exam is to assess the knowledge and skills essential to safe patient care, the new policies will “address concerns about Step 1 scores impacting student well-being and medical education.” Because students put so much emphasis on getting a high USMLE Step 1 score, they often skimmed the medical school curriculum that they deemed to be not as relevant in order to get the maximum score on the USMLE Step 1. https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristenmoon/2020/04/07/usmle-step-1-is-now- passfailwho-benefits-from-this-big-change/#72ce397b4873 =Formation of INCUS= The current use of Step 1 scoring as a major determinant for granting residency interviews has been met with tremendous criticism by the medical community. The public outcry led to the formation of a committee and investigation in early 2019 called InCUS. https://www.usmle.org/incus In February 2020 (almost a year later), InCUS concluded that residencies were overemphasizing the Step 1 and not using it for its original purpose for which it was designed as a means of licensing. The Step 1 exam was designed to be one of a four tests for granting a medical license. It was never intended to be used as a predictor of medical knowledge for which cutoffs or barriers could be justified or to enable racial bias.https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/medicaleducation/86427 In comparing the four USMLE licensing exams, the Step 1 is least clinically relevant. The Step 1 focuses on basic sciences and is not an accurate representation of clinical knowledge. The Step 1 is generally taken before beginning of clinical rotations, meaning that at the time of Step 1, most students have not \\"stepped foot in a hospital\\" or worked with patients in a clinical setting. As such, it cannot accurately measure medical knowledge and has little clinical relevance, yet disproportionately determines a student's specialty. Further that the misuse of Step 1 scores by residencies was negatively impacting students medical education including but not limited to taking away from clinical experience, unnecessary anxiety, gross misuse of student time, and an inaccurate measure of clinical knowledge. The decision to move to pass/fail was also an effort to decrease racial bias of STEP exams. https://www.ecfmg.org/news/category/incus/ A list of InCUS participants can be found at InCUS participants =Incus outcomes= In response to public outcry, in February 2020, the USMLE program announced a plan to change Step 1 score reporting to a pass/fail system in an effort \\"to reduce overemphasis on Step 1 performance while allowing licensing authorities to use the exam for its primary purpose of medical licensure eligibility.\\" However, because of pressure from its \\"stakeholders,\\" the USMLE posted on its website and twitter that this transition will occur no earlier than January 1, 2022.https://www.staffcare.com/physician-blogs/usmle-step-1-moves-to-pass- fail-medical- education/?mobile=0https://www.usmle.org/incushttps://www.usmle.org/usmlescoring/faq.html As of June 2020, the USMLE has not yet decided how the STEP 1 will be reported on the ERAS transcripts for the Class of 2022 or later when applying to residency. The USMLE wrote on their website that if you received a score on the STEP before 2022, the \\"USMLE program has not yet determined how the policy change will impact score reports and transcripts.\\" https://www.usmle.org/usmlescoring/faq.htmlhttps://www.usmle.org/usmlescoring/faq.htmlhttps://students- residents.aamc.org/applying-residency/article/specialty-response-covid-19 The USMLE changes were met with mostly positive responses. \\"In becoming pass/fail, Step 1 is reverting to what it was meant to be from the get-go: a minimum competency assessment.

This systemic change have been \\"long overdue and further delay only adds to the problem'\\" with a major complaint being that the intense pressure attached to one's numerical Step 1 score has been causing unhealthy levels of anxiety and stress for medical students during their first and second years. This is particularly problematic, considering that much of the material covered in Step 1 may not be especially relevant to the practice of these future doctors.\\"http://www.savvypremed.com/savvy-pre- med/2020/2/16/pros-and-cons-of-the-new-passfail-step-1-of-usmle Despite pleas by the medical community to move to pass or fail immediately, the USMLE responded they would not do so before 2022 to accommodate their \\"stakeholders.\\" The USMLE met heavy criticism for the suggestion that residency programs are the stakeholders, not medical students. Further, their refusal to change the score reporting Not only acknowledges that they recognize the overemphasis and misuse of their exam but that they are also actively enabling the misuse. The other concern was that this will put more emphasis on Step 2. However, critics agree that in a choice between Step 1 or 2, Step 2 would be a \\"more accurate predictor of medical knowledge as it is usually taken after third year when the student has had a year of clinical experience, having worked with patients in a hospital.\\" In Feb 2020, the Harvard Crimson wrote, \\"the fact that the Step 2 is a more clinically relevant exam than Step 1, makes it a better proxy for clinical acumen.\\" https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/2/18/nolen-pass-fail-step-1 Effect on residency matching The USMLE score is one of many factors considered by residency programs in selecting applicants. The median USMLE Step 1 scores for graduates of U.S. Medical Schools for various residencies are charted in Chart 6 on page 9 of \\"Charting Outcomes in the Match\\" available through the NRMP Website. Many residency programs use a \\"cutoff\\" score for Step 1, below which applicants are unlikely to be considered, although in some cases individuals with significantly higher Step 2 CK scores may still receive further consideration. The NRMP Residency Program Director survey contains more information, both overall and by specialty, regarding \\"cutoff\\" scores (i.e., scores below which programs generally do not grant interviews).http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NRMP-2016-Program- Director-Survey.pdf Studies on Step 1 performance found that \\"Step 1 is neither precise nor does it predict student performance as residents beyond a certain threshold. With a standard error of eight points, two applicants with scores as far as 15 points apart may not be meaningfully different and yet several programs use singular cutoff points as screening tools.\\" https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/08/make-step-1-test-pass-fail-medical- students https://www.usmle.org/pdfs/transcripts/USMLE_Step_Examination_Score_Interpretation_Guidelines.pdf This, as well as the negative impact on student learning, cost, gross misuse of student time, and attempt to decrease racial bias, are amongst the many reasons that the USMLE announced it would revert to pass/fail reporting of STEP 1 beginning 2022. However, the delay in changes until 2022 does not come soon enough and will not help the current classes who will be unaffected by this future change.http://www.savvypremed.com/savvy-pre-med/2020/2/16/pros- and-cons-of-the-new-passfail-step-1-of-usmlehttps://aamc- orange.global.ssl.fastly.net/production/media/filer_public/0f/7b/0f7b547e-65b5-4d93-8247-951206e7f726/updated_dermatology_program_director_statement_on_2020-21_application_cycle_.pdf  Controversies  =USMLE response to COVID= The USMLE was met with heavy criticism for their lack of adaptability during the COVID. https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/03/amid-covid-19-please-usmle-step-1-pass- fail-now.htmlhttps://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2020/05/how-the-usmle-fails- covid-19.htmlhttps://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/929899 https://in- training.org/step-1-in-a-time-of-covid-19786 Students and physicians were upset that the USMLE refused to move up the 2022 deadline of making Step 1 pass or fail, in light of the testing barriers created by COVID.

The Hackney Central area is focused on Mare Street and the retail areas to the north of it including Narrow Way and surrounding local area around Hackney Downs railway station. As such it extends north from Regent's Canal (with Bethnal Green), takes in most of Broadway Market and London Fields, and follows each side of Mare Street till it terminates in the vicinity of Hackney Central railway station. The area also includes the central retail area which extends from Hackney Downs station in the west to the Hackney Walk Outlet Village, on Morning Lane and goes in between Wick Road (Homerton) and Cassland Road (South Hackney) till meeting Hackney Wick, to the east. Hackney Central is the area that once would have been known as Hackney Village. This was a place that flourished from the Tudor period, when principal members of the Court had their houses in the surrounding area, and King Henry VIII of England had a palace (located near the modern Lea Bridge Road roundabout). Hackney Central remained a popular resort for Londoners until the end of the Georgian era, when this suburb of London began to be completely built up. Railways, trams and factories brought an end to Hackney's rural atmosphere during the Victorian era, and its fortunes declined. The industries of nearby Homerton and the Lee Valley have largely disappeared, leaving the NHS and local council as the largest employers. Successive waves of immigrants, both from abroad and within the United Kingdom, make modern Hackney a culturally vibrant part of inner London, with both the benefits and challenges that this brings. Extensive post-World War II redevelopment replaced much of the housing stock, but the Georgian housing and Victorian terraces that remain have become popular again. History St Augustine's Tower. Dating back to the 13th century, this is Hackney Central's oldest building. It is all that remains of the original medieval parish church, which was demolished in 1798 (September 2005) In 1727 Daniel Defoe said of the villages of Hackney =Early origins= In Roman times Ermine Street passed to the west of what is now Hackney Central. The land was covered with open oak and hazel woodlands, with marshland around the rivers and streams that crossed the area. Hackney lay in the Catevallauni tribal territory. The name Hackney derives from a 5th- or 6th-century Saxon settlement known as Haca's ey – or raised ground in marshland. The settlement was near Hackney Brook, and was probably on the higher ground around the later St Augustine's Tower. Hackney is not mentioned by name in the Norman Domesday Book; at that time it formed a part of the manor of Stepney. =Tudor village= Little remains of early Hackney, except the Tudor St Augustine's Tower, which survives as Hackney's oldest building. The churchyard, Hackney Brook, and the surrounding villages prevented Hackney's expansion, and by 1605 the village had a lower rateable value than the other divisions of the parish. In Tudor times there were a number of fine houses along Church Street, but many Tudor courtiers lived in nearby Homerton. On the site of Brooke House college, in Clopton was sited one of Henry VIII's palaces, where his daughter Mary took the Oath of Supremacy. Her guardian was Henry's Principal Secretary of State Ralph Sadleir, a resident of Bryck Place, Homerton. A further cluster of houses existed in medieval times, where Well Street enters Mare Street. The Loddiges family founded their extensive plant nursery business on open ground to the north-east of here in the 18th century. =Georgian period= By 1724, while still consisting of a single street, there is an unbroken line of buildings, except by the churchyard and by the brook, with large gardens behind for the finer houses and inns. The 16th- century church, despite galleries being installed, became too small for the needs of the parish, and parliament was petitioned in 1790 for a modern larger church to be built. This began in 1791 on a field to the north east of the old church, but was bedeviled by builders' bankruptcies and not finally completed until 1812–1813 when the tower and porches were added. Further disaster struck in a fire of 1955. In the churchyard stands the tomb of Francis Beaufort, deviser of the Beaufort wind force scale; and that of John Hunter, the second governor of New South Wales, Australia. The Loddiges family also has a tomb in the churchyard and memorials within the church. The parish burial register records the death of \\"Anthony, a poore old negro, aged 105\\" in 1630. This is all that is known of Anthony, the first recorded black resident of Hackney. Loddiges' family vault in St John's Church Gardens The villages of Hackney, Lower Clapton and Homerton remained separated by fields into the 19th century. The fine houses remained, with large gardens behind. Artisans and labourers lived in cottages established in these gardens. There was not the room, or the will, for major rebuilding in the village. By 1800, St Thomas' Square, a Georgian square was laid out on the southern end of Mare Street. By the 20th century, these buildings had declined and were replaced with public housing. An early 18th-century mansion, now the New Landsdown Club, but once the headquarters of Elizabeth Fry's British Ladies' Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners remains at 195 Mare Street. It is Grade II* listed, but in poor condition and on the English Heritage register of buildings at risk. In neighbouring Homerton, (to the east of the churchyard) Sutton Place was built by 1806, near Sutton House. The rebuilding of the Church, on a field to the north of the village, altered the course of the road and allowed the establishment of Clapton Square in 1816, in nearby Lower Clapton. Much of the area to the north and east of the churchyard now forms the Clapton Square Conservation Area, designated in 1969. =Victorian Hackney= 1830 Map of Hackney village A map showing the Hackney ward of Hackney Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916. During the Victorian era, many of the old buildings were swept away and the estates broken up to form streets of terraced housing. The change from rural suburb to firmly urban, was marked by the arrival of the railway in 1850, with a great iron rail bridge crossing Mare Street. Trams began to make their appearance on the streets in the 1870s, and a tram depot opened in 1882 on Bohemia Place.The North Metropolitan Tramways Co. from Bishopsgate ran through Mare Street, and thence to Clapton, opened in 1872, and was extended to Clapton Common in 1875, reaching Stamford Hill in 1902 Increased access and the culverting of Hackney Brook in 1859–1860, brought about the present road layout. Many older buildings were pulled down to intensify development and to make room for street widening and the railway. In 1802 the parish vestry hall on the Narrow Way was rebuilt. In 1900 it was re-faced in stone and given a pediment inscribed 'Hackney Old Town Hall'. A new town hall was built on a different site in 1866; it was in turn superseded by today's Town Hall, built in 1937. By the turn of the 20th century, only St Johns Gardens, and Clapton Square, the areas around the 1791 church, remained as public open space. Governance There is a Hackney Central ward electoral ward for Hackney Council, which, as electoral wards require roughly equal electorates, corresponds only very roughly to the area after which it is named. Geography Districts within the London Borough of Hackney. Hackney Central is the geographic, administrative and retail core of Hackney and is based on the village that grew up within the pre-existing parish of Hackney which had been in existence, with consistent boundaries, from the medieval period. The term Hackney Proper was often applied to that wider district which also includes Hackney Wick, South Hackney, West Hackney, Homerton, Dalston, De Beauvoir Town, Stamford Hill and Upper and Lower Clapton. In 1965 the term Hackney was used to name the London Borough of Hackney, however the borough also includes Shoreditch and Stoke Newington. Hackney Town Hall is about north-east of Charing Cross; and from the GLA City Hall near Tower Bridge. Landmarks The refurbished Hackney Empire is one of the oldest surviving music halls in Britain. (September 2005) The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art & Natural History near the Regents Canal, opened 2015 South of Hackney Central railway station Mare Street slices through Hackney's 'cultural quarter' of Town Hall Square. Its north side is dominated by Frank Matcham's Grade II* listed 1901 Hackney Empire music hall, on whose stage appeared Charles Chaplin and Marie Lloyd – who lived in nearby Graham Road. On the west side of Town Hall Square is the 1934–1937 Grade II Hackney Town Hall in Portland Stone, fronted by an open space created when its predecessor, the Hackney Vestry Hall of 1860 was demolished. A new town hall complex is being constructed behind the existing building. Opposite on the East side, is the 2001 refurbishment of the Central Library and Methodist Hall, combined to form the Ocean Music Venue. The Hackney Museum contains Hackney's first fire engine. Church of St John-at-Hackney The square is completed by the 2002 Learning and Technology Centre. This houses the new Hackney Central Library, the Hackney Archive, the local museum and the offices of the Hackney Learning Trust. North of the railway bridge, Mare Street continues as The Narroway (originally known as Church Street). By St Augustine's Tower, a Grade I landmark, is the 'Old Town Hall' built to serve the Parish of Hackney in 1802. It is now a betting shop. To the east are St Johns' Church Gardens. In 2009, they were awarded Heritage Green Flag status. Within the gardens stands the Church of St John-at-Hackney (built 1792). The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art & Natural History opened in 2015, the museum and bar is situated in a former call centre on Mare Street that is run by Viktor Wynd, which is a part of the Last Tuesday Society and funded by Kickstarter. It's galley includes classic curiosities such as hairballs, Sebastian Horsley nails from his crucifixion and drawings and archive material to do with Stephen Tennant, a collection of human remains including shrunken heads, dead babies in bottles and parts of pickled prostitutes, as well as condoms used by the Rolling Stones and tribal art, in among an art collection which spans several centuries. The Ash Grove bus depot was built by London Buses in 1981 as part of a program to build more garages. The roof is of unusual design, carried by ten 35-ton triangular trusses supported on reinforced concrete columns, and was developed at a cost of £3.5 million. Ash Grove has also been used at various times as part of the London Transport Museum to house stored vehicles.Arriva London – News – Ash Grove garage fully operational again Transport = Rail = The area is north-east of the City of London with frequent trains from Hackney Downs railway station to Liverpool Street. Hackney Central railway station is a London Overground station with westbound trains to Richmond and Clapham Junction via Dalston Junction, and eastbound trains to Stratford via Homerton. = Buses = London bus routes 30, 38, 48, 55, 106, 236, 242, 253, 254, 276, 277, 394, D6, N38, N55, N253 and W15 serve Hackney Central. Route N277 also serves here when the 277 route was withdrawn between Dalston and Highbury Corner and the N277 was retained. Economy The Narrow Way (Church Street) remains a busy shopping area, and there is a large Tesco supermarket in nearby Morning Lane (Money Lane). This international store group was founded in Hackney, from a market stall in Well Street market in 1919. A planning application for a multi-storey shopping centre (with parking beneath, and housing above) on the Hackney Tesco site was refused permission in 2010, and the future of the site remains uncertain. A former Burberry factory building is also located off Morning Lane, with a 'factory outlet' that is considered to be Hackney's most visited tourist attraction. This site is currently being redeveloped, in two phases, that will see the retention of the showroom, but add housing above. The primary local employers are the council and the NHS at Homerton University Hospital; there are also two London Transport garages, one at the foot of the Narroway, and another about 1 mile south at Ash Grove. Between Ash Grove and London Fields there is a small industrial estate. Education Schools in the area include The Urswick School (formerly known as Hackney Free and Parochial Church of England Secondary School) and BSix Sixth Form College.

History SameSun Backpackers' Lodge originally Glenaird Hotel =19th century= The community was known as \\"Gastown\\" (Gassy's Town) after its first citizen - Jack Deighton, known as \\"Gassy\\" Jack. \\"To gas\\" is period English slang for \\"to boast and to exaggerate\\". In 1870, the community was laid out as the \\"township of Granville\\" but everybody called it Gastown. The name Granville honours Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, who was British Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time of local settlement. In 1886, it was incorporated as the city of Vancouver, named after Captain George Vancouver, who accompanied James Cook on his voyage to the West Coast and subsequently spent two years exploring and charting the West Coast. =20th century= The last few remaining pornography and peep show stores on Granville Street The shutdown Granville Book Company, an independently owned Granville Street bookstoreLady Luck (dated circa 1946); note the Commodore Ballroom on the left. The beginning of the end: small businesses on Granville Street Looking North at 12th and Granville past the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage. Orpheum Theatre, advertising the Vancouver Symphony Orcherstra The Vogue TheatreDuring the 1950s, Granville Street attracted many tourists to one of the world's largest displays of neon signs. Towards the middle of the twentieth century, the Downtown portion of Granville Street had become a flourishing centre for entertainment, known for its cinemas (built along the \\"Theatre Row\\", from the Granville Bridge to where Granville Street intersects Robson Street), restaurants, clubs, the Vogue and Orpheum theatres, and, later, arcades, pizza parlours, pawn stores, pornography shops and strip clubs. By the late 1990s, Granville Street suffered gradual deterioration and many movie theatres, such as \\"The Plaza, Caprice, Paradise, [and] Granville Centre [...] have all closed for good\\", writes Dmitrios Otis in his article \\"The Last Peep Show.\\" In the early 2000s, the news of the upcoming 2010 Winter Olympic Games, to be hosted in Whistler, a series of gentrification projects, still ongoing as of 2006, had caused the shutdown of many more businesses that had heretofore become landmarks of the street and of the city. =21st century= Also, Otis writes that \\"once dominated by movie theatres, pinball arcades, and sex shops [Downtown Granville is being replaced] by nightclubs and bars, as [... it] transforms into a booze-based 'Entertainment District'.\\" In April 2005, Capitol 6, a beloved 1920s-era movie theatre complex (built in 1921 and restored and reopened in 1977) closed its doors (Chapman). By August 2005, Movieland Arcade, located at 906 Granville Street became \\"the last home of authentic, 8 mm 'peep show' film booths in the world\\" (Otis). On July 7, 2005, the Granville Book Company, a popular and independently owned bookstore was forced to close (Tupper) due to the rising rents and regulations the city began imposing in the early 2000s in order to \\"clean up\\" the street by the 2010 Olympics and combat Vancouver's \\"No Fun City\\" image. (Note the \\"Fun City\\" red banners put up by the city on the lamp-posts in the pizza-shop photograph). Landlords have been unable to find replacement tenants for many of these closed locations; for example, the Granville Book Company site was still boarded up and vacant as of July 12, 2006. While proponents of the Granville gentrification project in general (and the 2010 Olympics in specific) claim that the improvements made to the street will only benefit its residents, the customers frequenting the clubs and the remaining theatres and cinemas, maintain that the project is a temporary solution, since the closing down of the less \\"classy\\" businesses, and the build-up of Yaletown-style condominiums in their place, will not eliminate the unwanted pizzerias, corner-stores and pornography shops - and their patrons - but will simply displace them elsewhere (an issue reminiscent of the city's long-standing inability to solve the problems of the DTES).

She was named for Rear Admiral Thomas O. Selfridge (1804–1902) and his son, Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr. (1836–1924). Selfridge was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden in New Jersey on 18 December 1933, launched on 18 April 1936 and commissioned at Philadelphia on 25 November 1936, Commander H. D. Clarke in command. Shakedown Selfridge conducted her shakedown cruise in the Mediterranean in January and February 1937 and returned to the east coast, via the Caribbean, in March. From April into August, she underwent post-shakedown overhaul at, and conducted training exercises out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In September, Presidential escort duties took her to Poughkeepsie, New York; and, in October, she proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, whence she got underway for the Panama Canal Zone and duty with the Battle Force in the Pacific. Diverted back to Norfolk for another Presidential escort mission in early November, she got underway again for the west coast on 9 December 1937. Pearl Harbor Selfridge transited the Panama Canal and joined the Battle Force as flagship of Destroyer Squadron (Des-Ron) 4 on 13 December 1937 and reached San Diego, California on the 22nd. Except for fleet problems and exercises, she remained in the southern California area for the next two years. In 1940, she was reassigned to Pearl Harbor, whence she operated until after the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. That day, Selfridge, having just completed an escort run from Palmyra Island, was moored in berth X-9. Within five minutes of the start of the bombing, Selfridge's guns were firing on the Japanese planes. By 1300, manned by a mixed crew from various ships, she was underway and soon thereafter joined other ships in patrolling off Oahu. During the remainder of the month, Selfridge patrolled the Hawaiian area and, screening Saratoga, participated in the abortive attempt to reinforce Wake Island. In January 1942, she continued operations in the Saratoga group until that carrier was torpedoed some 500 miles southwest of Oahu on the 11th. Selfridge then screened the carrier back to Pearl Harbor. Exercises and patrols in the Hawaiian area followed until 20 January when she assumed escort duty for a merchant ship on a Canton Island run. After arriving at Canton on the 27th, she patrolled off the island until the merchant ship completed offloading, then started back to Hawaii. En route, on the 30th, Selfridge depth charged and may have damaged an enemy submarine. Guadalcanal Selfridge returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 February 1942 and was under way again on the 9th to escort Saratoga to Bremerton, Washington for permanent repairs. In mid-March, she returned to Hawaii in the screen of a convoy and, by the end of the month, had escorted more supplies to Canton. In April, she carried Marine Corps personnel and mail to Palmyra and Christmas islands, and then proceeded to Bora Bora in the Society Islands, to rendezvous with and escort convoys carrying reinforcements to the Samoan and Tonga groups. On 21 May 1942, she departed the latter group for the New Hebrides and Australia; where, by the end of the month, she had commenced coastal escort work. A unit of TF 44, she remained in Australian waters into July; then, with others of the force, proceeded to the Fiji Islands to rehearse for Operation Watchtower, the assault and occupation of Guadalcanal and Tulagi. Soon after 0120 on 7 August 1942, TF 44, now designated TG 62.6, the screening group for the transports, arrived in the Guadalcanal area. At 0620, Selfridge opened fire on a small gasoline carrier entering Tulagi harbor. A few hours later, the transports moved in toward the beaches. At 1320, the Japanese sent in a high level bombing attack. Shortly thereafter, they followed that strike with a dive bomber attack. On the 8th, Selfridge continued to screen the transports and, after a noon bombing attack, picked up two Japanese airmen. On the morning of the 9th, she assisted survivors of the Battle of Savo Island and, with Ellet, scuttled the badly-damaged Australian cruiser, Canberra; then, toward evening, departed the area to escort the transports to Noumea. For the remainder of the month, the Australian group (TF 44) screened the carriers of the air support group. On 31 August 1942, the ships headed back to Brisbane; and, for the next nine months, Selfridge continued to operate with that force in the Coral Sea to prevent a Japanese landing at Port Moresby and to cover Allied shipping to the Papuan Peninsula. O'Bannon at Noumea after the battle. Battle of Vella Lavella In May 1943, Selfridge was reassigned to the 3rd Fleet. On the 12th, she arrived at Nouméa. Through the summer, she operated with cruisers of TF 36, later TF 37, and participated in exercises with TF's 38, 39, and 34. In late September, as a unit of the 3d Fleet's amphibious force, she escorted an LST convoy to Vella Lavella, then commenced nighttime patrols in the Solomon Islands up “the Slot” to intercept Japanese shipping. On the night of 6 October 1943, Selfridge, O'Bannon, and Chevalier intercepted an enemy force of six destroyers, three destroyer transports, and smaller armed craft some 12 miles off Marquana Bay as it attempted to evacuate land forces from Vella Lavella. In the ensuing Battle of Vella Lavella, Chevalier was torpedoed and damaged beyond repair. She was sunk on the 7th by an American torpedo. Selfridge and O'Bannon were both heavily damaged; Selfridge by an enemy torpedo, O'Bannon by enemy action compounded by collision with Chevalier just after the latter had gone dead in the water. Personnel casualties on board Selfridge amounted to 13 killed, 11 wounded, and 36 missing. 1944 Temporary repairs to Selfridge were made at Purvis Bay and at Nouméa. Permanent repairs, including the installation of a new bow and a complete new gun armament, were made at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard; and, after refresher training out of San Diego, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 May 1944 in time to join the forces staging for the invasion of the Marianas Islands. Initially assigned to TG 50.11, she joined TF 58, the fast carrier force, at Majuro in early June; and, on the 11th, screened Bunker Hill as sweeps were conducted over Guam. On the 13th, she participated in a shore bombardment of Saipan to cover minesweeping operations off that target island; then shifted to night fire. On the 14th, she joined the fire support unit; and, on the 15th, screened the transport area as the assault troops landed on Saipan. From then to the 17th, she rotated between daytime screening activities and nighttime harassment duty. On the latter date, word of a Japanese force moving in from the Philippines reached the assault force, and Selfridge rejoined TF 58 and took station as the linking vessel between TG's 58.7 and 58.3. On the 19th, the Battle of the Philippine Sea raged; but none of the enemy's aircraft came within range of Selfridge's guns. On the 20th and 21st, the Japanese proceeded westward. On the 24th, Selfridge rejoined the transport screen off Saipan; and, on the 26th, resumed fire support duties. Selfridge after her rebuilding, April 1944. Selfridge departed Saipan on 11 July 1944; and, screening the transports, arrived at Eniwetok on the 15th. Three days later, she was underway again to return to the Marianas with reinforcements for the Guam assault. She arrived off Agat on the 22d, the day after the initial assault and, for the next three weeks, provided screening and fire support services and conducted anti-boat and barge patrols. On 10 August, she sailed for Eniwetok, whence, she returned to Pearl Harbor. On 21 August, she received orders back to the Atlantic. 1945 Transiting the Panama Canal on 7 September 1944, Selfridge proceeded to New York for an abbreviated overhaul after which she joined TF 65; and, serving as flagship, commenced transatlantic escort duty for convoys plying between the east coast and Tunisia. On 23 April 1945 she was in Casco Bay, Maine when USS Eagle 56 (PE-56) exploded. After assisting in rescuing survivors, she dropped nine depth charges on a suspected U-boat. A Court of Inquiry initially attributed the loss of Eagle 56 to a boiler explosion, but in 2001 the cause was revised to a torpedo from . Continuing escort duty until after the fall of Germany in May 1945, she completed her last run at New York on 7 June. Upkeep and training exercises in the Caribbean and off the Maine coast took her through August; and, on 15 September, she returned to New York to prepare for inactivation. On 15 October 1945, Selfridge was decommissioned, struck from the Navy list on 1 November 1945 and scrapped in October 1947. She earned four battle stars during World War II.

It is based on the sun4m architecture, and is enclosed in a pizza-box chassis. A simplified, cheaper version of the SS5 was released in 1996 as the SPARCstation 4. Sun also marketed these same machines under the \\"Netra\\" brand, without framebuffers or keyboards and preconfigured with all the requisite software to be used as web servers. Specifications =Release Price= Sun rolled out the SPARCstation 5 for under $4000.Sun Micro rolls out low-cost workstations =CPU support= The SPARCstation 5 may incorporate one of the following processors: 70, 85, or 110 MHz Sun Microsystems microSPARC-II, or a 170 MHz Fujitsu Microelectronics, Inc. (FMI) TurboSPARC. Fujitsu also provided a 160 MHz TurboSPARC CPU Upgrade Kit for upgrading 70, 85 and 110 MHz microSPARC-II models. The SPARCstation 5 has no MBus and thus is limited to use as a single- processor machine. = Memory = The SPARCstation 5 has eight DSIMM slots for memory expansion. Slots can be filled individually with either 8MB or 32MB modules giving a maximum of 256MB memory. The memory used is identical to that of the SPARCstation 4. = Disk drives = The SPARCstation 5 can hold two internal 80-pin SCA, single ended, fast-narrow SCSI drives, a SCSI CD-ROM drive and a floppy. It also supports external SCSI devices. There is no IDE/ATAPI support. =Network support= The SPARCstation 5 comes with an on- board AMD Lance ethernet chipset providing 10BaseT networking as standard and 10Base2 and 10Base5 via an AUI transceiver. A 10/100Mbit/s hme \\"Happy Meal\\" NIC can be added for faster connections. The OpenBoot ROM is able to boot from network, using RARP and TFTP. Like all other SPARCstation systems, the SS5 holds system information such as MAC address and serial number in NVRAM. If the battery on this chip dies, then the system will not be able to boot. =AFX= The SPARCstation 5 had three SBus expansion slots which are typical of Sun computer equipment of this era. The third of these shared its expansion backplate and physical space with a special AFX connector which was unique to the SPARCstation 5. Only one card was released for this slot, known as the S24 or TCX. This was a framebuffer that allowed the use of 24-bit colour graphics instead of the eight bit colour of the SBUS CG6 card, also known as the LEGO or low end graphics option. The TCX was also used as the on-board framebuffer of the SPARCstation 4, but this version was less advanced and only supported eight bit colour. SPARCstation 4 The SPARCstation 4 was introduced in 1995 to provide a lower price point than the SPARCstation 5. Although offered with the same 110 MHz microSPARC-II processor as the SPARCstation 5, it only has one SBus expansion slot instead of three, a single 1.05 GB hard drive, and maximum memory capacity of 160 MB instead of 256 MB. Instead of the built-in audio of the SPARCstation 5, the SPARCstation 4 requires an optional module, installed in its own dedicated slot. The system includes a built-in 8-bit pixel-accelerated graphics adapter, and a new lower-cost 17\\" monitor was introduced as an option. There is no AFX graphics port. The SPARCstation 4 has a standard AUI Ethernet connector, unlike the SPARCstation 5 which requires a special cable to mate with a non-standard connector. SPARC Xterminal 1 Sun used the same enclosure as the SPARCstation 4 for the SPARC Xterminal 1, which was, as the name implies, marketed as an X terminal, with no local storage. Unlike the earlier SPARCclassic X, it did not use the same motherboard as the workstation it was derived from, instead using a lower-powered 50 MHz microSPARC processor and expansion from its base memory of 8 MB to 128 MB rather than 160 MB. Rather than running Solaris, the SPARC Xterminal 1 and SPARCclassic X loaded and ran special software over the network. Sun offered an upgrade kit to a full workstation that included a swap to a SPARCstation 4 motherboard, a hard drive and additional memory.

He was the first director of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, the first planetarium in the western hemisphere. Biography Fox was born and raised in Manhattan, Kansas, by Simeon and Esther (née Butler) Fox. He attended Kansas State University, where he earned a B.S. in mathematics in 1897. The next year he enlisted in the U.S. Army and fought in the Philippines with the 20th Kansas during the Spanish–American War. When he was mustered out in 1899, Fox had achieved a rank of second lieutenant but he was disabled and was expected to die within a year. He recuperated completely, however, thanks to nursing by his mother. While recovering, Fox earned a master's degree at Kansas State and taught math at St. John's Military School in Salina, Kansas. Invited to Dartmouth College in 1901 by his cousin Ernest Fox Nichols, Fox soon departed for that school, where he earned a second B.S., this time in physics. While at Dartmouth, Edwin Brant Frost persuaded Fox to pursue a career in astronomy, and in 1903 Fox became a Carnegie Research Assistant at Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago. His primary interest at the observatory was in solar research. While in Chicago, Fox met his future wife, Ethel Snow, and they were married in 1905. The couple would have four children. In 1905, Fox travelled to the University of Berlin for graduate studies in astronomy. He returned to Chicago the next year, where he worked as an assistant astronomer at Yerkes Observatory and earned a Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Chicago. In 1909 Fox joined the Northwestern University department of astronomy, eventually receiving promotion to Chairman of the Department. While at Northwestern, Fox also served as the Director of the University's Dearborn Observatory. During this fruitful time Fox also authored several books, and served as Secretary of the American Astronomical Society. After the start of World War I, Fox returned to active duty in the Army, becoming a major of infantry in France. He was later promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and became assistant chief of staff, 7th Infantry Division. Following the war he remained in the reserve, where he rose to the rank of Colonel and held command of the 43rd Infantry, 86th Infantry Division. In May 1929, Fox was appointed as the first director of the Adler Planetarium, which would open a year later. He ran the planetarium for eight years, also serving during this time as the first (interim) director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles when it opened in 1935. In May 1937, Fox left this job to become the director of the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry, a position he retained until 1942. With the entry of the United States into World War II in 1941, Fox again returned to the Army, but did not perform overseas duty. Instead he was the commandant of the Army Signal Corps at Harvard University for part of 1942, then became commandant of the Army Electronics Center at Harvard. He retired from the army in 1943, and continued to lecture at Harvard until his death from a cerebral hemorrhage. The crater Fox on the far side of the Moon is named in his honor.

Presented in a trivia gameshow style supporting up to four players, it consists of about 1,000 questions spread out over 20 episodes. Much of the game involves watching live-action video footage of young women in bikinis, and as the player succeeds in the game the women eventually expose their breasts. The game garnered much controversy and was the subject of a lawsuit.  Gameplay  After every question there is video footage—shot during spring break festivities on South Padre Island—of host Matt Sadler giving the same question to young females in bikinis (referred to as \\"hotties\\"). If they answer incorrectly, they are required to show their breasts. Before they give their answers, the footage is paused and the player is asked to guess whether the hotties answered correctly or not. In the \\"TitWitz\\" portions of the game, the player is told that they were wrong, and asked to guess what wrong answer they gave. The more times the player is able to correctly predict the outcome, the higher the \\"Flash-O-Meter\\" rises, and the more exposed the breasts become. At first, the breasts are obscured by a Guy Game logo (\\"Soft and Squishy\\" level), then just digitally blurred (\\"Sorta Chubby\\" level), and finally fully uncensored (\\"Super Stiff\\" level, maxed-out meter). Once the player reaches the uncensored level, the episode can be played again with no visual censorship. As the game progresses, the players are ranked as President, Vice President, Treasurer, or Asshole. Also included are the \\"Ballz\\" minigames which can give players extra points during an episode. Before the game, each player chooses a female avatar (called cheerleaders) to represent them. Based on how often the player correctly guesses the outcome of each hottie's response, the more clothes the cheerleader removes. At the end of the episode, a short video montage is shown of the cheerleader belonging to the player who reached the rank of President. Many other rules can be enabled, most inspired by drinking games.  Lawsuit  Four months after the game's release a lawsuit was brought against Topheavy Studios, Gathering of Developers, Sony, and Microsoft. A woman known as Diane in the game (who is found in Set 5, Episode 20) explained that she was not informed that footage would be used to promote the video game. At the time the footage was recorded, Diane was only seventeen years old, making her underage. A temporary injunction was granted, prohibiting the further production of copies of the game that contained the girl's image, voice, and name.

Regents of the University of California, 17 Cal. 3d 425, 551 P.2d 334, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14 (Cal. 1976), was a case in which the Supreme Court of California held that mental health professionals have a duty to protect individuals who are being threatened with bodily harm by a patient. The original 1974 decision mandated warning the threatened individual, but a 1976 rehearing of the case by the California Supreme Court called for a \\"duty to protect\\" the intended victim. The professional may discharge the duty in several ways, including notifying police, warning the intended victim, and/or taking other reasonable steps to protect the threatened individual. History Prosenjit Poddar was a student from Bengal, India. He entered the University of California, Berkeley as a graduate student in September 1967 and resided at International House. In the fall of 1968, he attended folk dancing classes at the International House, and it was there that he met Tatiana Tarasoff. They dated, but apparently had different ideas about the relationship. He assumed their relationship was serious. This view was not shared by Tarasoff who, upon learning of his feelings, told him that she was involved with other men and that she was not interested in entering into an intimate relationship with him. This gave rise to feelings of resentment in Poddar. He began to stalk her. After this rebuff, Poddar underwent a severe emotional crisis. He became depressed and neglected his appearance, his studies, and his health. He kept to himself, speaking disjointedly and often weeping. This condition persisted, with steady deterioration, throughout the spring and into the summer of 1969. Poddar had occasional meetings with Tarasoff during this period and tape-recorded their various conversations to try to find out why she did not love him. During the summer of 1969, Tarasoff went to South America. After her departure, Poddar began to improve and at the suggestion of a friend sought psychological assistance. Prosenjit Poddar was a patient of Dr. Lawrence Moore, a psychologist at UC Berkeley's Cowell Memorial Hospital in 1969. Poddar confided his intent to kill Tarasoff. Dr. Moore requested that the campus police detain Poddar, writing that, in his opinion, Poddar was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, acute and severe. The psychologist recommended that the defendant be civilly committed as a dangerous person. Poddar was detained but shortly thereafter released, as he appeared rational. Dr. Moore's supervisor, Dr. Harvey Powelson, then ordered that Poddar not be subject to further detention. In October, after Tarasoff had returned, Poddar stopped seeing his psychologist. Neither Tarasoff nor her parents received any warning of the threat. Poddar then befriended Tarasoff's brother, even moving in with him. Several weeks later, on October 27, 1969, Poddar carried out the plan he had confided to his psychologist, stabbing and killing Tarasoff. Tarasoff's parents then sued Moore and various other employees of the university. Poddar was subsequently convicted of second- degree murder, but the conviction was later appealed and overturned on the grounds that the jury was inadequately instructed. A second trial was not held, and Poddar was released on the condition that he would return to India. Opinion of the court The California Supreme Court found that a mental health professional has a duty not only to a patient, but also to individuals who are specifically being threatened by a patient. This decision has since been adopted by most states in the U.S. and is widely influential in jurisdictions outside the U.S. as well. Justice Mathew O. Tobriner wrote the holding in the majority opinion. \\"We conclude that the public policy favoring protection of the confidential character of patient-psychotherapist communications must yield to the extent to which disclosure is essential to avert danger to others. The protective privilege ends where the public peril begins.\\" Justice Mosk wrote a partial dissent, arguing that (1) the rule in future cases should be one of the actual subjective prediction of violence on the part of the psychiatrist, which occurred in this case, not one based on objective professional standards, because predictions are inherently unreliable; and (2) the psychiatrists notified the police, who were presumably in a better position to protect Tarasoff than she would be to protect herself. Justice Clark dissented, quoting a law review article that stated, \\"…the very practice of psychiatry depends upon the reputation in the community that the psychiatrist will not tell.\\" Subsequent developments As of 2012, a duty to warn or protect is mandated and codified in legislative statutes of 23 states, while the duty is not codified in a statute but is present in the common law supported by precedent in 10 states. 11 states have a permissive duty, and six states are described as having no statutes or case law offering guidance. Despite initial commentators predictions of negative consequences for psychotherapy because of the Tarasoff ruling, court decisions show otherwise. An analysis of 70 cases that went to appellate courts between 1985 and 2006 found that only four of the six rulings in favor of the plaintiff cited Tarasoff statutes; courts ruled in favor of the defendant in 46 cases and sent 17 cases back to lower courts. However, courts do rule in victims' favor in clear-cut cases of failure to warn or protect, such as the case of a psychiatrist who committed rape during a child psychiatry fellowship, for which he was recommended even after telling his own psychiatrist about his sexual attraction to children. In 2018, the Court held that universities should protect students in the Regents of University of California v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County.

She is the younger sister of fellow country singer Barbara Mandrell, and older sister of actress Irlene Mandrell. Louise had a successful singing career in country music from the 1970s, with a string of hits during the 1980s. Early life Thelma Louise Mandrell was born July 13, 1954 to Mary Ellen (née McGill; born 1931) and Irby Matthew Mandrell (October 11, 1924 - March 5, 2009) in Corpus Christi, Texas. She is the second of three daughters. Sister Barbara is five and a half years older; sister Irlene is one and a half years younger. Her mother, Mary, was a homemaker and musician hailing from rural Wayne County, Illinois. Her father Irby was a World War II naval veteran and Texas police officer from Garland County, Arkansas. Irby Mandrell was an accomplished musician and entrepreneur as well. He used his impeccable social skills and knowledge of the music industry to manage all three of his daughters' careers for over 3 decades. Although Louise Mandrell never developed the scale of fan base or the worldwide recognition that her older sister Barbara gained in country music, she is still credited as one of country music's more successful female vocalists of the 1980s. With their parents coming from a musical background, Barbara started off working as a singer, and playing the steel guitar and other instruments, and toured with Patsy Cline in the early 1960s. Louise learned to play the guitar and bass. Soon, their parents founded the Mandrell Family Band, which toured the United States and Asia. Barbara's professional recognition in country music in the early 1970s with hits like \\"Treat Him Right\\", \\"Show Me\\" and \\"The Midnight Oil\\" gave Louise opportunities at success. She started performing in Barbara's band The DoRites, which toured with Merle Haggard in the early 1970s. Her first time in the studio was on the recording \\"Always Wanting You\\", a no. 1 hit for Haggard in 1975. In 1978, Louise signed with Epic Records. Music career Mandrell released her first single in 1978, called \\"Put It on Me\\", which entered the top 100 country music singles in the USA. In 1979 she released her next single, a cover version of \\"Everlasting Love\\", which also entered top 100. She started singing duets with her husband R.C. Bannon, such as \\"I Thought You'd Never Ask,\\" which entered the top 50, and a cover of the number one song by Peaches & Herb, \\"Reunited\\", which went to number 13, her first significant hit. In 1980, following two more solo efforts that did not see the same success, she joined sisters Barbara and Irlene on the TV variety show Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters. This show showcased not only her singing, but her multi-instrumental and comedy talents as well. In 1981, she signed with RCA Records. In 1982, Mandrell had two top 40 hits, as well as the top 20 hit \\"Some of My Best Friends Are Old Songs\\". 1983 turned out to be her most successful year. She entered the top 15 with \\"Runaway Heart,\\" and had the two top 10 hits \\"Save Me\\" (originally recorded by Northern Irish singer Clodagh Rodgers) and \\"Too Hot to Sleep\\". In 1984, Mandrell had two other Top 40 hits, \\"Goodbye Heartache\\" and \\"I'm Not Through Loving You Yet,\\" and in 1985 the song \\"I Wanna Say Yes\\" entered the top 5. In 1985, RCA released her first video for the hit single \\"Some Girls Have All The Luck\\". Her songs at this time focused on the popular Countrypolitan sound that was coming out of Nashville from many country artists, Barbara Mandrell included. Mandrell's last studio album \\"Dreamin'\\" was released in 1987, with the single \\"I Wanna Hear It from Your Lips\\" and having her last top 40 hit with the single \\"Do I Have To Say Goodbye\\". Her last charted single came in 1988, a cover of the song \\"As Long As We Got Each Other\\", a duet with Eric Carmen. RCA dropped Mandrell in 1988. During the 1990s she released the videos and songs \\"Jean Paul\\" and \\"Down Home Christmas\\". Personal life Her marriage to Ronald Shaw on July 1, 1971, ended in divorce in 1973. She subsequently married Gary Lamar Buck of the country music group The Four Guys on July 23, 1975. They later divorced in 1978. In 1978, Mandrell met R.C. Bannon. They married on February 26, 1979. He would later co-write songs for Barbara. \\"One of a Kind, Pair of Fools\\" is a 1983 single written by Bannon and John Bettis and recorded by Barbara Mandrell. \\"Only One Love in My Life,\\" written by R.C. Bannon and John Bettis, would be Ronnie Milsap's tenth number one. Louise and R.C. adopted Nicole Mandrell Shipley in 1986. Louise was divorced from R.C. in 1991 and married John Haywood on July 16, 1993. Louise became a grandmother for the first time in 2013.

It is the 100th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are the sole heirs to a grandiose inheritance, but the money is in the hands of an underhanded broker named Icabod Slipp (Kenneth MacDonald). One by one the Stooges confront Slipp in his office. He in turn accuses first Larry, then Moe, then Shemp, of being that crook, and successfully flees his office with the money. The Stooges follow Slipp on board a train. To avoid a conductor after them for tickets they hide out in a large crate in the baggage car. A lion is also in the crate, and the Stooges run, hiding in a sleeping berth. Moe sticks his foot out through the curtain and the lion licks it, then climbs up in the berth. After bickering with each other the Stooges escape, pulling down all the curtains to the berths and waking everyone up. As they make their getaway in the confusion, the Stooges spot Slipp and take off after him. They chase him to the baggage car and finally defeat him, reclaiming their inheritance. Production notes Hold That Lion! was filmed on January 28–31, 1947, the first film produced after the new year. The film premiered the final version of \\"Three Blind Mice\\" as the Stooges' theme music, an updated, faster version arranged by Spud Murphy in the key of F major (the Curly period featured versions in G major, making it easy to differentiate between the two eras). With minor variations (all in F), this version was used through the end of Stooges' short subject releases in 1959. Although Hold That Lion! was the third film released featuring Shemp after his return to the Stooges, it was filmed after Squareheads of the Round Table and The Hot Scots, both which still utilized the \\"sliding strings\\" version of \\"Three Blind Mice\\" featured in the previous Shemp entries Fright Night and Out West, and in the final 12 entries starring Curly. The film title is a parody of the football term, \\"Hold that line!\\" Icabod Slipp's name appears on the door as \\"I. Slipp.\\" This is a semantic parody on the Long Island town of Islip, New York. Shemp Howard (a man of many phobias) was reportedly so frightened of the lion that he insisted a glass plate be placed in between him and the animal while filming the scene in the crate, and the Stooges' reflection in the glass can be seen as they are hastily exiting the crate. Apparently, though, Columbia Pictures hired a lion who was getting on in years. Emil Sitka later commented that the feline was \\"so sickly, he would fall asleep in the middle of a take.\\" There is an audio goof in the film during a scene that featured Dudley Dickerson reacting to the lion. The laughing of a crew member can be heard in the background. =Curly Howard returns= Hold That Lion! is notable for a cameo appearance by former Stooge Curly, younger brother of Shemp and Moe. He appears as a snoring passenger who the Stooges think is Icabod Slipp, the man they are looking for. This was the only film that featured not only all four of the original stooges together but also the three Howard brothers — Moe, Curly, and Shemp — in the same film. This also marks the first time Curly is shown on camera with a full head of hair, and his only film appearance following the stroke that ended his career as a full-time Stooge. Director Jules White remembers: > It was a spur of the moment idea. Curly was visiting the set; this was some > time after his stroke. Apparently he came in on his own since I didn't see a > nurse with him. He was sitting around, reading a newspaper. As I walked in, > the newspaper, which he had in front of his face, came down and he waved > hello to me. I thought it would be funny to have him do a bit in the > picture, and he was happy to do it.Okuda, Ted; Watz, Edward; (1986). The > Columbia Comedy Shorts, p. 69, McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. =Recycling template= Hold That Lion! would be the template for recycled films starting in 1953. Three films in a row utilized footage from this short: *First, Booty and the Beast recycled the second half of Hold That Lion! consisting of scenes on the train (including Curly Howard's cameo); *Next, Loose Loot recycled the first half, consisting of scenes in various offices; *Finally, Tricky Dicks recycled the only segment from Hold That Lion! not previously used: the filing cabinet sequence from the early office scenes. Due to this successful practice, director Jules White would begin recycling entire scenes (rather than re-film them) as a cost-saving tactic for the remainder of the Stooges' tenure in Columbia Pictures' short subject department.

It was released on August 25, 2005 in the United States and filmed in Los Angeles, California. The film was given a rating of PG-13 for \\"crude humor, sexual content, language, teen partying/sexual references, and some violence\\". Plot High school student Zach Harper (Milo Ventimiglia) sets out to complete the \\"Dirty Deeds\\" - an outrageous list of ten challenges that must be completed between dusk and dawn on the Friday night of his high school's homecoming weekend. The only student to complete the entire list, Duncan Rime (Todd Zeile), did so in 1989 when only 8 tasks composed the list. Rime later reveals that whenever someone completes the entire list, more are added to it. Zach attempts to complete the deeds for his classmate Meg Cummings (Lacey Chabert). Meg's younger brother, Kyle (Wes Robinson), wants to do the challenge to earn the respect of the school's jocks, who are constantly bullying him. Meg is concerned for her brother, and insists that Zach stop him from trying to do something so foolish. While Meg had no intention of Zach attempting the deeds in place of her brother, Zach decides to take on the challenge. The night begins, and Zach easily checks off the first item on the list, drink beer in front of the cops, by pouring a beer into a coffee cup and consuming it in front of them. This way, the cops, who are determined to stop all those who attempt the deeds, have no idea of Zach's intentions of completing the list. As Zach attempts the nine remaining deeds, the jocks do everything in their power to prevent him from completing it. Throughout his crazy night, Zach enlists the help of those around him to accomplish the difficult tasks. Along the way, Zach meets Duncan Rime who tries to warn him about how hollow the victory can be. Afterwards, Zach refuses to continue, but Dan and JD (the tough kid from Deed #2) decide to try to ruin the carnival so that Zach will be blamed. With some last-minute help from Vincent Scarno (the owner of the car from Deed #8), Zach is able to turn the tables in time. In the midst of everything, Zach and Meg begin to develop feelings for each other, and Zach and Meg end up falling in love over the list of \\"Dirty Deeds\\".

He was Principal Viola of the Gewandhaus Orchestra from 1820 until 1843, where he also appeared as soloist on 27 occasions (playing trombone?). He was also the violist in the Gewandhaus String Quartet. When Mendelssohn became conductor of the orchestra in 1835 he was so impressed that he promised to write Queisser a concerto. Owing to his busy schedule and new lover, he persuaded his orchestra's leader Ferdinand David (and 1st violinist in the Gewandhaus String Quartet) to write him a piece. This Concertino remains the most popular 19th-century solo piece for trombone and is dedicated to Queisser. Queisser was known throughout Germany and performed at many music festivals where other virtuosi included Franz Liszt, Clara Schumann and Nicolò Paganini. It has been suggested that Queisser was responsible for annoying Mendelssohn by putting a 'turn' in the opening trombone phrase of the 'Lobgesang' 2nd Symphony.

Following his retirement he published his memoirs entitled With A Machine Gun to Cambrai in 1969. Early years George Coppard was born on 26 January 1898 and left school to work for a taxidermy firm at the age of 13. World War I Following the outbreak of War in 1914, towards the end of August he attempted to enlist at Mitcham Road Barracks in Croydon. After telling a recruiting sergeant his real age he was told to clear off and \\"come back tomorrow and see if you're nineteen\\". He returned the next day and lied about his age, stating that he was nineteen, and was enlisted. It was 27 August 1914 and he was sixteen years and seven months old. He joined the 6th Battalion Royal West Surrey Regiment (now part of The Queen's Regiment). Having completed training in Guildford, the Battalion was posted to France in 1915, where they soon found themselves involved in the battle of Loos. At this stage Coppard had become a member of one of the machine gun teams. He fought in the front line almost continuously through the campaigns of 1916 and 1917 with the exception of a period of convalescence after he was accidentally shot by a colleague on 17 October 1916. This included most of the battle of the Somme (1916) and the battle of Arras (1917). He was wounded again on 22 November 1917 during the Battle of Cambrai, nearly killed by a machine gun bullet which passed through his left thigh and severed his femoral artery. His life was saved by his colleagues, who quickly applied a tourniquet. By this time Coppard had been promoted to Corporal and awarded the Military Medal for gallantry before Cambrai. On the day that he was wounded his promotion to sergeant was to have been recorded in company orders, but this did not happen due to his wound. He was invalided to England, to Birkenhead Borough Hospital, where he remained until June 1917. He was discharged to the Machine Gun Corps convalescent camp at Harrowby in Yorkshire, where he was still recovering when the Armistice was signed. Later years With the armistice Coppard was discharged in 1919 and, following a period of unemployment, sought employment as an assistant steward at a golf club and thereafter in various sundry appointments. He retired in 1962 having worked at the Ministry of National Insurance since 1946. He was married and had two daughters. During retirement Coppard sought and received encouragement from the Imperial War Museum to have his wartime diaries published. Published in 1969, With a Machine Gun to Cambrai proved an instant success, prompting his contemporaries to publish their own wartime accounts.

The Senate is made up of twenty-one Senators,ConstitutionChapter V; Section 35 while the House consists of thirty Members of Parliament (MPs) in addition to the Honourable Speaker of the House. Members to serve in the Cabinet of Barbados may be chosen by the Prime Minister from either the House of Assembly or Senate,Constitution, Chapter VI, Part 3; Section 65(2) (the Prime Minister alone who must be chosen by the Governor-General must come from the House of Assembly.)Constitution, Chapter VI, Part 2; Section 65(1) In theory, supreme legislative power is vested in the Queen-in-Parliament; in practice during modern times, real power is vested in the House of Assembly, as the Governor-General generally acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and the powers of the Senate have been limited. The Parliament of Barbados is originally patterned after the Parliament of England, so the structure, functions, and procedures of the parliament are based on the Westminster system of government. Sittings of both House and Senate are usually held once per month, with other meetings called as necessary. The House sits on Tuesdays beginning at 10:30am, and are broadcast live on the local radio station, Quality 100.7 FM. Sittings of the Senate take place on Wednesdays. History Established on 26 June 1639.Greetings to (British) House of Commons to commemorate the Ter-centenary of the House of Assembly of Barbados, Sir Harold Austin, Speaker of the House of Assembly of Barbados. British Hansard The Parliament of Barbados is the third oldest legislature in the Americas (behind The Virginia House of Burgesses, and Bermuda House of Assembly), and is among the oldest in the Commonwealth of Nations. The genesis of a legislature in Barbados was introduced by Governor Henry Hawley, creating a structure of governance to Barbados, itself patterned after the Parliament of England). The then unicameral Parliament originally was tasked with establishing a system of laws and was completely under the domination of the island's planter-class. The first meeting of the Barbados Assembly was held in 1639. The initial location known as the \\"Sessions House\\" which was situated in the Marlhill, which is now known as Spry Street. Built by Captain Henry Hawley, the building may have originally accommodated his Courts of Law. (On 25 June 1989, a monument was unveiled to commemorate the site outside of the current Central Bank.) By 1653, the Assembly moved to the State House then located in Bridgetown area known as Cheapside (then encompassing Broad Street). In 1668 the State House was destroyed by a great fire started by an explosion of the Bridgetown military magazine. Over the next century, the colony’s elected officials assembled at various locations all over Bridgetown, which were rented taverns and homes of local merchants and landlords. The Roebuck Tavern located on Roebuck Street was a favourite assembly point and was also owned by Henry Hawley. The movement of the Assembly among the various taverns in the town eventually presented an irony for the thriving colony. Governor Atkins, who was attending a meeting at Gwynn’s Tavern in 1674 commented, \\"I must confess I am a little astonished to see so honourable an Assembly to meet in a place so considerable as the island is, and have no house to receive us but a public tavern\\" (TOB 71). For many years the Barbados Assembly continued to meet in various places. In 1724 an Act was passed providing for a building for the Council and Assembly, Law Courts and gaol. The building located on Coleridge Street was completed in 1731-1732, yet the House of Assembly still often met at times at different private houses and taverns. The current Parliament Buildings were built in the neo-Gothic style in the early 1870s on the site of what was known as the \\"New Burnt District\\", which was part of a 10-acre area in the town that was destroyed by the great fire in 1860. In 1968 the Barbados Parliament was presented two complete libraries of Parliamentary and constitutional works of reference from the British House of Commons to celebrate political Independence with membership to the Commonwealth. The Parliament of Barbados in its current form was first introduced following the 1961 general elections. In 1963 the colonial era Legislative Council was disestablished. In its place came the Senate in 1964 (due to Barbados' status as a colony of Great Britain). As the years went by, governance in Barbados continued to change in structure until both of the present chambers assumed their present numbers. Legislative functions Parliament is empowered by Article 35(l) of the Constitution to make laws for the Peace, order, and good government of Barbados.Constitution of Barbados Section 48(1) The Constitution also empowers Parliament to: * Determine the privileges, immunities, and powers of the Senate and the House of Assembly and the members thereof;Section 48(2)(3) * alter or amend any of the provisions of the constitution;Section 49(1) Enactment clause  Members in Parliament  As of the election held on 25 May 2018, the Barbados Labour Party won all 30 seats of the Assembly, reducing the Democratic Labour Party's seats to zero. As is required under the Constitution of Barbados one (1) member must be appointed as Leader of the Opposition, Bishop Joseph J.S. Atherley voluntarily opted to be appointed as the Opposition in the current Parliament. Election date The next general election in Barbados is constitutionally due on 24 May 2023. According to the Constitution of Barbados elections can take place no longer than every five years from the first sitting of Parliament.Constitution: Section 61 (3): \\"Subject to the provisions of subsection (4), Parliament, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for five years from the date of its first sitting after any dissolution and shall then stand dissolved.

It is located in the Inner City of Baku, Azerbaijan and, together with the Maiden Tower, forms an ensemble of historic monuments inscribed under the UNESCO World Heritage List of Historical Monuments. The complex contains the main building of the palace, Divanhane, the burial- vaults, the shah's mosque with a minaret, Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's mausoleum (the so-called \\"mausoleum of the dervish\\"), south of the palace, a portal in the east, Murad's gate, a reservoir and the remnants of a bath house. Earlier, there was an ancient mosque, next to the mausoleum. There are still ruins of the bath and the lamb, belong to the west of the tomb. In the past, the palace was surrounded by a wall with towers and, thus, served as the inner stronghold of the Baku fortress. Despite the fact that at the present time no traces of this wall have survived on the surface, as early as the 1920s, the remains of apparently the foundations of the tower and the part of the wall connected with it could be distinguished in the north-eastern side of the palace. There are no inscriptions that survived on the palace itself. Therefore, the time of its construction is determined by the dates in the inscriptions on the architectural monuments, which refer to the complex of the palace. Such two inscriptions were completely preserved only on the tomb and minaret of the Shah's mosque. There is the name of the ruler who ordered to establish these buildings in both inscriptions is the – Shirvan Khalil I (r. 1417–1462). As time of construction – 839 (1435/36) was marked on the tomb, 845 (1441/42) on the minaret of the Shah's mosque. The burial vault, the palace and the mosque are built of the same material, the grating and masonry of the stone are the same. The complex used to occupy more area. There were rooms for court servants and services. The main buildings of the ensemble were built at different times. Despite this fact, these buildings are linked by unity of scale, by rhythm and proportionality of the basic architectural forms – cubic volumes of buildings, domes, portraits. The builders of the ensemble relied on the traditions of the Shirvan-Absheron architectural school. In 1964, the palace complex was declared a museum-preserve and taken under the protection of the state. In 2000, this ensemble, along with the fortified walls of the historic part of the city and the Maiden Tower, was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Зодчество Азербайджана XII-XV вв. и его место в архитектуре Переднего Востока / Главная редакция восточной литературы. – Наука, 1966.. – c. 401. – 556 с. century the Shirvanshah dynasty, under Ibrahim I of Shirvan, transferred his capital from Shemakha to Baku following a devastating earthquake. He committed himself to the construction of the \\"palace\\". The building is believed to be a memorial complex built around the sacred place of worship (pir) and tomb of Seyyid Yaxya Bakuvi who was a Helwati Sufi saint. The Shirvanshahs were patrons of the Helwati Sufiye order, and Shirvanshah Khalilullah I was buried with his family in the grounds of the palace. Other historians argue that the building was used as the ruler's palace. Both theories suffer from the absence of evidence. It is known that wells inside the grounds of the \\"palace\\" were considered to have healing qualities until recent times, as was the hill where the palace was built. After the Safavid conquest of Baku in 1501, the Sufi order was expelled. Over centuries the \\"palace\\" fell into ruin and was known in Baku as Baku Khans palace; this toponym moved into Russian historiography, first cited by Bartold. Until 1501, there was not any information found about the building of the palace. According to one of the Persian chronicles, in 1501 the troops of Shirvanshakh Farrukh-yessar, the son Khalil-ully I, were defeated in Shemakha by the troops of Shah Ismail I from the Safavid dynasty. Farrukh-yessar was killed in the Battle of Shirvanshah; the troops of Ismail I, having defeated near Shemakha, moved to Baku, besieged it and after several assaults took the city. Then, a tall building of Shirvanshahs was destroyed due to the order of Shah Ismail I. After a while, the city of Baku and its entire district, as well as Shirvan, were governed by the governors who were placed by the Safavids. There is not any detailed information about the people who lived in the palace and in what state it was in the first half of the XVI century. In the second half of the 16th century, there was a war between the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire. In 1578, the Turks conquered Baku. From the time of the rule of the Ottoman Empire in the palace area, the gate in the palace wall surrounding the palace from the east has been preserved. From the inscription placed on the portal of this gate, it follows that they were built during the reign of the Turkish sultan Murad III (1574–1595 years of rule). Due to the literary works, there were Turkish pashas living in the palace at that time. The East Gate is a witness of this. Since the XVII century, the palace was empty, and there were not any government officials. The abbot of the monastery and the representative of the Isfahan mission Capuchin Pater Raphael du Mans in his essay in 1660 described Shirvanshah Palace in Baku fortress and gave information about its desolation and destruction. In 1723, Baku was besieged by the troops of Peter I, and the city was bombed. In this regard, the south- eastern facades of the palace suffered much. The palace was transferred to the Russian military department in the middle of the 19th century. The Russian military department made a partial renovation of the palace. At the same time, the significant restructuring was carried out, which adapted the palace facilities to warehouses for military equipment. Repairs carried out by the military department, along with the restoration of the destroyed parts, and led to the destruction of a number of parts required for the restoration of the palace. By adapting the building of the palace to the warehouse, the military department demolished a number of walls separating the rooms in the second and first floors, and there were semi-circular arches supporting the roof instead of them on the second floor. The remains of domed, lancet and cross-slabs were destroyed in all the rooms on the second floor; they were replaced by flat beams. And window openings (double-glazed windows) of the second floor were laid out so that only small windows remained. New wide doorways were pierced. During this period, the Eastern Orthodox Church in Baku sought the demolition of the palace to build a Baku cathedral in its place. However, this petition was rejected by the tsarist authorities only because the premises of the palace were used for large warehouses. There was an entrance made to the second floor of the northern facade of the palace and a huge opening was punched in the wall. This was done so that the cart drawn by the horses from the street could enter the second floor of the palace. After making the above-mentioned reorganization, the military department attached a ladder to the eastern facade of the palace, and the entire southern (or lower) courtyard was surrounded by a stone wall with loopholes. This wall was erected from a foundation left from the old walls surrounding the palace. The palace ensemble is now protected by fortress walls erected in the first half of the 19th century. During existence of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918–1920), a number of measures were taken to study and fix architectural monuments. Thus, at the end of 1918, the dimensional drawings of the Shirvanshahs Palace were made by the Ishmael Bek Nabi oglu, the architectural engineer. At the beginning of 1920, several cycles of lectures on the fate of the palace were read in the \\"Society for the Study of the Muslim East\\" by Ismail bek Nabi oglu. The periodical press indicated that the report was illustrated by various photographs and drawings of the palace. After the reports and debates, the presidium of the society was elected, which included chairman Professor Zimin, Comrade chairman I Belyaev, secretary-teacher Seidov and Kazioni Subkhanverdikhanov. The meeting instructed the presidium to organize an excursion to the palace in the near future. In 1920, the government of the Azerbaijani SSR began to take measures to protect the monument. Since 1920, the cleaning of the palace from the age-old layers of garbage and partial repairs began, accompanied by archaeological reconnaissance. In 1924 the works were continued. After the extensive repair and restoration works of 1932–1934, conducted by AzCUOP together with the Moscow State Restoration Workshops for projects designed by architect Boris Zasypkin, the building of the former Shirvanshah palace was given to the Azerbaijan History Museum AzFAN. Since the clay floors were fragile, and the building of the palace was intended for the organization of a museum in it, during the repair and restoration work the floors were covered with parquet. Also during the works from the window openings were laid the stones laid in the XIX century, and they were returned to their original appearance. The original layout of the second floor was not restored, due to the fact that the premises were supposed to be a museum: where there are only two rooms, there were originally eight rooms. The plan of the first floor was completely restored. In 1937-1938 under the guidance of archaeologist V.N. Leviatov, archaeological excavations were carried out in the palace and a large number of artifacts dating from the 12th–15th centuries were found. And the archaeological excavations conducted by Leviatov in 1945 on the territory of the palace ensemble, deep beneath the foundations of the surviving buildings, revealed the remains of a once densely populated residential quarter. Numerous fragments of ceramic products and coins date it to the 8th–9th centuries. For some time, the Azerbaijan People's Museum and the Museum of the History of Religion were located in the palace building. In 1960, the palace was turned into an architectural reserve, which in 1964 was transformed into the State Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve \\"Complex of the Shirvanshahs Palace\\". In 1992, new restoration works began. The author of the restoration project of the palace complex was Niyazi Rzayev. Restoration began from the throne room. In 2000, at the 24th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the historical part of the city of Baku, Icheri Sheher, along with the palace, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site from Azerbaijan. These were the first objects included in the list of UNESCO, located on the territory of Azerbaijan. In 2006, the next restoration of the palace was completed. In 2017, the Maiden Tower and the Palace of the Shirvanshahs were awarded with the Certificate of Excellence.

The main building (the Palace)  The building of the palace did not arise at once. The building of the complex was started in 1411 by Shirvanshah Sheykh Ibrahim I. The two- storey building of the palace numbers about 50 dimensions and outlines of the constructions connected with three narrow winding staircases. The big lancet portal directly leads from the courtyard to the second floor, into a high octahedral lodging covered with a cupola. A small, octagonal vestibule behind it connects it with the rest of the lodgings in the palace. The earliest building (approximately the end of the fourteenth century) is the central part (octagonal hall of the second floor). The part adjoining the western facade was added a little later. The western, northern and a small part of the eastern facades form an incomplete rectangle. The rest of the eastern facade and the entire southern facade are formed by two triangular lanterns and a broken line between them, enclosing four right angles. There were originally 52 rooms connected by three narrow spiral staircases in the palace building: 27 on the first and 25 on the second floor (currently 16 rooms on the second floor), and the layout of the second floor basically reproduced the plan of the first floor. The central part of the palace (octagonal hall of the second floor, the entrance to which is decorated with a portal) has thicker walls. Arranged in the western facade, the main entrance to the palace is decorated with a high portal. The ladder of the portal leads to a tall octagonal front hall, covered with a dome. It is assumed that this room served for receptions. The small octagonal lobby behind it connected the hall to the rest of the rooms. Slit-shaped holes in the faces served as a voice connection with the lower floor, where the office premises were located. The rooms and rooms of the second floor are more ceremonial. Among them, there are the southern and eastern facades with bay windows that reveal the bay view. There are also rooms for the Shah and his family on the second floor. The smooth surface of the large stone planes of the palace is shaded by alternating rows of masonry, differing in color, width and texture, as well as the \\"shebeke\\" aura – stone gratings in small light apertures. There were daily-life objects, coins of the XII-XV centuries, copper utensils, weapons and decorations of the XIX century, musical instruments of the XV century found during the archaeological excavations both on the territory of the palace complex and in the territory of the historical center of Icheri-Sheher and Shirvan. There were also female costumes and embroidery of the XIX century, Shemakha carpets of the XIX century and carpet woven in the XVII century in Baku. There is a mock-up of the historic part of the city in the center of the hall. Turbe (Mausoleum) of Shirvanshahs in Baku. 15th century.  Divan-khana  A small aperture, located on the north side of the palace garden, leads to the closed courtyard Divan-khana, which is framed on three sides by a pointed arcade. In the composition center Divan-khana there is an octagonal rotunda-pavilion. The hall of this rotunda is surrounded by an open arcade of the same warrant. The elliptical cover with a slightly pointed top is protected from the outside by a faceted stone dome. The western facade of the rotunda is decorated with arabesques which are stylized with a portal, the channeled half-cupola of the lancet conch is supported by a system of finely modeled stalactites (mucarnases). Overhead planes are covered with ornament. The portal leads to the canopy connecting the hall with the service rooms located one above the other. There are several versions of the appointment of Divan-khana. It was supposed to serve as a building for legal proceedings, receptions or state council, or perhaps, it was a mausoleum. The most common hypothesis is based on the common name of the monument, according to which it was assumed that it is a court, or a reception room of the palace, or the building of an \\"order\\". The features of the style and the incompleteness of the part of the decoration work allow one to date Divan-khana to the end of the 15th century, the time of the capture of Baku by the Safavid troops. The features of the plan, the dungeon-crypt and the content of the lapidary inscription above the entrance to the hall (Koran, Sura 10, verses 26 and 27) indicate his memorial appointment. The origin of the original architectural structure is also associated with the pre-Islamic funerary tradition. Historian Sara Ashurbeyli believes that even in pre-Islamic times, the occupied Divan-khan territory was a sacred place (it is assumed that the cup-shaped grooves served to collect the sacrificial blood of animals)  The Keygubad Mosque  In the old days, a mosque was added to the mausoleum of Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi, which was called the \\"old\\" mosque. It is known as the \\"Kei-Kubad Mosque\\". This mosque was built at the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century after the destruction of the older building on which it was built. The mosque was covered with a dome, which was supported by four stone columns that stood inside the mosque. The clutches of the mosque were tied up with the laying of the mausoleum. In 1918, the \\"old\\" mosque burned down during a fire. The image of this mosque and its brief description was given in the article of Andrei Pavlinov, who visited Baku and saw the mosque in 1888, published in the third issue of the journal \\"Materials on the Archeology of the Caucasus\\" (Moscow, 1893) Historian Abbasgulu Bakikhanov wrote that Bakuvi taught and prayed in the mosque: \\"The cell where he prayed, the school where he worked and his grave are there, in the mosque\\". Keygubad Shirvanshah ruled from 1317 to 1343 and was Sheikh Ibrahim's grandfather. In the 1920s, when E. A Pakhomov surveyed the mausoleum and ruins of the old mosque, it was discovered that the pedestal on which the base of one of the mosque columns stood, covers a narrow trench made in the ground and plastered into the crypt of the mausoleum. In this trench, there were several stone tombstones. When examining the crypt, it was found that there were scattered bones to twenty human skeletons. The bones were folded without observing any rules. This is due to the fact that at the place where the mausoleum stood and around it, there was once a cemetery. And during the construction of the mosque and digging foundation pits under the foundations, a number of burials were broken. Bones from the broken graves were collected and stacked in the mausoleum, and gravestones – in the trench. These tombstones are not preserved. Currently, on the site where the mosque once stood, there are two columns that once stood inside the mosque, as well as part of the wall with the roof.  Mausoleum of Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi  In the southern courtyard, next to the palace, stands a mausoleum, built in the second half of the 15th century, called the mausoleum of the \\"dervish\\" and known as the burial of the court scholar Khalil Ili Seyid Yahya Bakuvi, who was engaged in medicine, mathematics, and astrology. The mausoleum has an octagonal body, which completes the pyramidal tent. The interior of the mausoleum consists of an underground crypt where the tombstone of Bakuvi is located, and a camera above it. Small octagonal volume of the mausoleum turns into a drum covered with a dome. On the sides of the mausoleum there are three small windows carved into solid slabs of limestone, and, like in the old days, they are through-through stone gratings, consisting of multi-beam stars. The archway in the northern part connects the mausoleum with an older mosque. According to Abbaskuli aga Bakikhanov, \\"the cell where he prayed [Bakuvi], the school and the grave that are under the mosque named after him, still exist today\\".  The palace mosque  In the front of the lower courtyard, there is a mosque building with a minaret. In terms of the mosque is rectangular, has a large hall, a small women's chapel and service rooms. The northern portal is facing the Shirvanshahs burial vault. This portal is more solemn than the east, which was intended for the inhabitants of the palace, descending the semi-underground passage. The double-lighted hall is covered with a dome on spherical sails. Mihrab mosque is located at the southern end of the hall. Above the one-woman women's chapel there is also a domed room. It is inferior in size to the dome of the hall and repeats its outlines. Against the backdrop of the prismatic volume, completed by two domes with slightly pointed tunnels, a deeply shaded aperture of the mosque portal is clearly drawn. Above the northeast corner of the mosque stands a minaret, ending with a stalactite cornice supporting a balcony that had a stone barrier before. The inscription encircles the minaret below the stalactite cornice. It is executed in the font \\"nash\\" and contains an inscription. The inscription tells about the construction of the minaret, but not the mosque that was built at an earlier time. This is confirmed by the lack of a decorated rich portal and artistic inscriptions on it.  The Eastern Portal  On the territory of the southern courtyard of the complex was the so-called Eastern Portal, also known as the \\"Gate of Murad\\". The construction of this portal completed the formation of the ensemble. Judging by the inscription on the portal niche, the portal was built during the years of occupation of Baku by Ottoman troops at the behest of a noble Bakrada of the Rajab Baba in 994 AH (1585/86) by architect Amir Shah of Vaillankoukh (suburb of Tabriz). Compared with the Divan-khana portals and the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the structure and forms of the portal are somewhat simplified. It has a less rich and elegant decor. The upper part of the portal is decorated with a building inscription in Arabic. The inscription has sockets with floral ornaments on both sides. In the lower part of the portal, there is a deep niche formed by a stalactite semi-double. Unlike other portals of the palace, the Eastern portal has a wide lancet entrance opening, similar to the gate. Sarah Ashurbeyli assumes that this structure was the entrance to a building that did not survive, or was not erected.  Shrine  Near the shah's mosque in the lower courtyard, in the wall separating the lower platform from the upper one, is located the building of the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the so-called \\"Turbe\\". This building is located directly opposite the entrance, overlapped by a pointed vault. Smooth wall of the facade is lined with Baku limestone with a careful fit of the seams. Above the building, there is a richly decorated portal to the tomb. This portal repeats the compositional reception of the Divan-khan portal, but in comparison with the latter it is somewhat easier to interpret (the stalactite arch consists of only four rows of stalactites, the side walls are smoothly solved, no niches, and only tympanum of the arches, a number of inscriptions in the font \\"nash\\" – Koranic (Surah XII, verse 92nd) and hadith. On the right and left of the portal's lancet aperture in two onion-shaped medallions are inscriptions with the name of the builder-architect of the tomb. In each medallion, the same inscription is repeated twice (in direct and mirror image) and contains the following words: Allah Muhammad Ali (an architect). Judging by the name, the architect was a Shiite. Above the ornamentation of the tympanum of the stalactite arch there is a strip with an inscription of a religious nature. In the tympanas, medallions are also arranged on each side, also with an inscription. The inscription above the entrance to the portal dates the construction of the burial vault 839 (1435/36) and reports that the tomb was built by Shirvanshah Halilullah for his mother and son. The portal leads to the canopy, on the right and left side of which are located associated with the opening of small rooms, probably intended for ministers of worship. The canopies lead to the main hall, which is cross-shaped in plan, and its central part is covered with a dome resting on the vaults of the branches of the cross and stone walls through a system of spherical sails. It is interesting that outside the stone dome was once covered with turquoise glaze. During the archaeological excavations in the tomb were found fragments of architectural details of tombstones in the hall, as well as a number of burials of members of the family of Halilullah. So, archaeological works in 1946 under the wooden floor of the tomb, a crypt was found with five burials, covered with stone slabs (one of them contained the remains of a child of 6–7 years old, apparently the son of Halilullah, the other – older women, probably the mother of Halilullah, the skeleton of a man is 18–19 years old). The continuation of the work in the tomb found a number of untouched tombs, the total number of which reached 14. The names of the members of the family of Halilullah can be found on the basis of odes, elegies and chronograms from the sofa of Badr Shirvani: the mother of Halilullah Bike khanum (died 839 AH / 1435/6), his sons Farrukh Yamin (born 839 AH / 1435/6, died in 846 AH / 1442/3 at the age of seven), Sheikh Saleh (born in 847 AH / 1443, died in 849 AH / 1445/6 at the age of 2 years), Mir Bahram (killed ( Shaheed) in the Kaytag steppe at a young age of 20 Muharram in 850 AH / 17 April 1446), Prince Muhammad Ibrahim (born 20 Muharram 836 / 16 September 1432), Farrukh Yasar (born 12 Muharram 845 AH / 2 June 1441).  Bathhouses  In the lower courtyard of the complex, there is a bathhouse, the location of which does not allow us to contour the territory that belonged to the palace. It is assumed, however, that the bathhouse, built in the 15th century, was indeed a palace. The bath was cleared of blockages, and the internal layout of the bath was restored thanks to the conservation of the lower rows of wall masonry. The palace bath, like the vast majority of the baths of the East, was buried in the ground, but only the entrance portal and the domes of large halls were visible from the outside, the crowns of which ended with perforated lanterns that served as ventilation. Such a strong depth of the bath was typical for the baths of the entire Absheron peninsula. The visitor of the bath from the vestibule-dressing room got into the soap-house, where there was a swimming pool for general ablution. To the soap adjoining large and small rooms, intended for all procedures that required a different temperature. The necessary temperature of the various rooms, depending on their destination, was tried to preserve the internal layout of the bath. In one of the last chambers of the bathhouse, there was a tank with hot water. Under it, there was a firebox, which served to heat all the premises of the bath. The underground, the stables and the walls of the baths were heated by a branched system of heat-conducting channels.  Ovdan  Not far from the bathhouse is located the ovdan – a reservoir which was one of the largest in the Fortress of the Ovdans. This ovdan supplied drinking water not only to the palace, but also to the entire surrounding area. This assumption is confirmed by the nearby small, built in the 14th century Chin Mosque, which is believed to have served the residents of the nearby area. Ovdan supplied water to the palace bathhouse. Ovdan is a spacious reservoir located deep underground, which was ventilated by means of a special vertical shaft. Such a structure is typical for most of the ovdans surviving till the present day. To descend into the reservoir was possible by a gentle staircase, which was blocked by a lancet arch. Water came into the ovdan from a well-kept underground water pipe or kyhryza. The water intake structures of this water pipe were quite far from the city.  In culture  Images of the Shirvanshahs palace can be found on the works of such artists as Grigory Gagarin, Georgy Hohenfelden, in the photographs of Richard Thiele. In 1990, the postage stamp of the USSR, dedicated to the palace, was issued. Later, the image of the palace appeared on the postage stamps of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Also, Shirvanshah's palace was depicted on an Azerbaijani banknote with a face value of 10,000 manats. Description of the palace is found in the novel of Kurban Said \\"Ali and Nino.\\" = Palace complex in cinematography = The architecture of the palace several times fell into the footage of Leonid Gaidai's film The Diamond Arm (1969), which was also filmed in the \\"old city\\" of Baku.

This led to a long-awaited UEFA Champions League victory, which Real Madrid had not won since 1966, as the club won both the 1998 and 2000 finals. Following the two Champions League trophies, Sanz decided to hold an early election to the club presidency in 2000, but eventually lost to Florentino Pérez. He then tried unsuccessfully twice to regain his former position as the president of Real Madrid, and failed in a bid to take over Parma. Negotiations with Parma Between June 2005 and January 2006, Sanz was negotiating with Italian club Parma in Amministrazione Straordinaria to become the club's new owner. Guido Angiolini and Enrico Bondi, the two officers appointed by the Italian government to restore Parma, and its main sponsor Parmalat, were the two people involved in the operations with Sanz. The first time Parma announced negotiations with Sanz was in August 2005. Both President Angiolini and government-appointed administrator Enrico Bondi asked for €27.5 million, but the negotiations were not as smooth as some predicted. Until January 2006, the Sanz family was still transacting business with Bondi and Angiolini, but to no avail. In an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport in January 2006, President Angiolini stated that, \\"If, by the 16th, the deal with the Sanz family has not been closed, we will set about finding a new buyer.\\" Sanz had seemed the most likely buyer of the club in August 2005 when he made an initial payment of €7.5 million ($9.07 million) on the full price of €27.5 million. However, he did not pay the outstanding €20 million. Parma administrators stated that after 16 January 2006, the club was free to find other interested buyers as the contract with Sanz expired on 15 January 2006. Other interested buyers included the owner of Spain's Alamak Espana Trade, Russian oligarch Abram Reznikov. The uncertainty over the club's future had become a source of increasing frustration for Parma supporters. The deal with Sanz was a big dilemma for the Parma fans. In some papers, this deal was referred to as \\"The never ending story.\\" Parma supporters were longing for a positive ending. Sanz visited Parma a couple of times, and he even turned up at the Stadio Ennio Tardini to follow some of Parma's matches in Serie A. Because of his withdrawal from the deal and failure to pay the rest of the sum of €20.5 million, Lorenzo Sanz Senior and Lorenzo Sanz Junior lost much of their credibility. Later years Sanz announced in 2006 that he was putting himself up for election once again for the vacant President's position at Real Madrid, losing it to Ramón Calderón. In July 2006, Sanz purchased Málaga CF. He sold the club in 2010 to a Qatari investor for a sum of €50 million. In May 2008, it was reported that he was looking to buy Italian club Bari, and that the Bari owners had given him 10 days to close the deal, which was rumored to be around €15 million. Personal life Sanz was the father-in-law of former Real Madrid and Spain national team defender Míchel Salgado, who married his daughter Malula. Sanz's two sons, Paco and Fernando, were also professional footballers. As the owner of Málaga CF, he entrusted Fernando with the presidency of the club. Sanz died in the evening of 21 March 2020 at the age of 76, after testing positive for COVID-19.

Routledge; 2002. In the Wolof language, her pen name means \\"one who is unwanted\\".Ken Bugel, University of Western Australia, Retrieved 30 April 2016 Background Bugul was raised in a polygamous environment, born to a father who was an 85-year- old marabout. After completing her elementary education in her native village, she studied at the Malick Sy Secondary School in Thiès. After a year in Dakar, she obtained a scholarship that allowed her to continue study in Belgium. In 1980 she returned to her home, where she became the 28th wife in the harem of the village marabout. After his death, she returned to the big city. From 1986 to 1993, Bugul worked for the NGO IPPF (International Planned Parenthood Federation) in Nairobi, Kenya; Brazzaville, Congo; and Lomé, Togo, and served as the head of the organization's African region section. She subsequently married a doctor from Benin and gave birth to a daughter. Today she lives and works in Senegal. From July to December 2017 Ken Bugul is the 14th Writer in Residence in Zurich. Bugul's literary reputation has varied from place to place. She was awarded the Grand prix littéraire d'Afrique noire for her novel Riwan ou le Chemin de Sable in 2000, but is better known among American readers for her novel The Abandoned Baobab, which is her only book to date to have been translated into English. Among other themes, the work deals with and critiques African colonialism. On the question of The Abandoned Baobab's autobiographical nature, Bugul has said of the novel, as well as of the subsequent Cendres et Braises and Riwan ou Le chemin de sable, \\"All three books mirror the very deep and radical experiences I went through\\". As of late, her status among American feminists has diminished somewhat, as many have critiqued her for marrying a holy man who already had more than 20 wives. This is perhaps undeserved, and is a good example of ideologies clashing, as the criticism is the result of American feminists attempting to hold Bugul up to the standards of Western feminism, which is worlds away from her Senegalese experience.

Biography Luís Bernardo Honwana was born Luís Augusto Bernardo Manuel in Lourenço Marques (present-day Maputo), Mozambique. His parents, Raúl Bernardo Manuel (Honwana) and Naly Jeremias Nhaca, belonged to the Ronga people from Moamba, a town about 55 km northwest of Maputo. In 1964 he became a militant with FRELIMO, a front that had the objective to liberate Mozambique from Portuguese colonial rule. Due to his political activities he was arrested by the colonial authorities and was incarcerated for three years, from 1964-1967. In 1970, he went to Portugal and did a law degree at the University of Lisbon. For some time, he worked as a journalist. In 1975, upon independence, he became Director of the Office of President Samora Machel. In 1982, he became the Secretary of State for Culture of Mozambique. In 1986, he was appointed Minister of Culture of Mozambique. In 1987, he was elected a member of the Executive Council of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He served on the Executive Board of UNESCO from 1987 to 1991 and was chairman of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Committee for the World Decade for Culture and Development. In 1995, he was appointed director of the newly opened UNESCO office in South Africa.

He was also the executive director of Fundação para a Conservação da Biodiversidade (BIOFUND, Foundation for the Conservation of Biodiversity). Works For decades, Honwana was the author of a single book, Nós Matámos o Cão-Tinhoso (1964), a classic of African literature and the most widely read and influential Lusophone African fiction ever published. It was translated into English by Dorothy Guedes as We Killed Mangy Dog and Other Stories (1969). He self-published Nós Matámos o Cão-Tinhoso when he was 22 while a political prisoner of PIDE. He also published the tale \\"Hands of the Blacks\\". We Killed Mangy Dog is a collection of short stories set in the (Portuguese) colonial era at the turn of the sixties and is reflective of the harsh life black Mozambicans lived under the Salazar regime. It \\"denuncia e contesta a realidade brutal de Moçambique na época do colonialismo\\" (denounces and challenges the brutal reality of Mozambique in the era of colonialism). Honwana's stories were written for a greater purpose than entertainment and amusement. They \\"raise questions about social exploration, racial segregation, and class and education distinctions.\\"Laranjeira, Pires. Literaturas Africanas de Expressão Portuguesa.

Though he was only 47 when he died, Tansi remains one of the most prolific African writers and the most internationally renowned practitioner of the \\"New African Writing.\\" His novel The Antipeople won the Grand Prix Littéraire d'Afrique Noire. In his later years, he ran a theatrical company in Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo. Life and career The oldest of seven children, Tansi was born in the former Belgian Congo, in the village of Kimwaanza, just south of the city now known as Kinshasa in the modern day Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was initially educated in the local language, Kikongo, and only began speaking French at the age of twelve, when his family moved to Congo- Brazzaville, today known as the Republic of the Congo. He attended the École Normale Supérieure d'Afrique Centrale in Brazzaville where he studied literature, and upon completing his education in 1971, he became a French and English teacher in Kindauba. When the young teacher began writing for the theatre later that year, he adopted the pen name \\"Sony La'bou Tansi\\" as a tribute to Tchicaya U Tam'si, a fellow Congolese writer who wrote politically charged poetry about oppressive nature of the state. In the early part of his career, Tansi continued to support himself through teaching and he worked as an English instructor at the Collège Tchicaya-Pierre in Pointe Noire while working on his first two novels and several plays. In 1979 he founded the Rocado Zulu Theatre, which would go on to perform his plays in Africa, Europe, and the United States in addition to appearing regularly at the Festival International des Francophonies in Limoges. After teaching for many years, Tansi moved on to government work, serving as an administrator in several ministries in Brazzaville. In the late 1980s he allied with opposition leader Bernard Kolélas to found the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI), a political party acting against the communist regime of President Denis Sassou Nguesso and his Congolese Labour Party. Left-wing forces succeeded in pushing President Sassou toward democracy, and former Prime Minister Pascal Lissouba returned from an extended exile and was elected President in the August 1992 elections. In that same year, Tansi was elected to parliament as a deputy for the Makélékélé arrondissement of Brazzaville, but his participation in opposition politics angered President Lissouba, and his passport was withdrawn in 1994. Tansi soon discovered that he had contracted the AIDS virus, but Lissouba's travel restrictions prevented him from going abroad to seek treatment for himself and his wife. Tansi's partner, Pierrette, died from the disease on 31 May 1995 and Tansi followed 14 days later. Works in English * Parentheses of Blood, a play. Trans. Lorraine Alexander Veach.

His reign of 26 years was the third longest in the Tang dynasty (surpassed only by Emperor Xuanzong and Emperor Gaozong). Emperor Dezong started out as a diligent and frugal emperor and he tried to reform the governmental finances by introducing new tax laws. His attempts to destroy the powerful regional warlords and the subsequent mismanagement of those campaigns, however, resulted in a number of rebellions that nearly destroyed him and the Tang Dynasty. After those events, he dealt cautiously with the regional governors, causing warlordism to become unchecked, and his trust of eunuchs caused the eunuchs' power to rise greatly. He was also known for his paranoia about officials' wielding power, and late in his reign, he did not grant much authority to his chancellors.  Background  Li Kuo was born in 742, during the reign of his great-grandfather Emperor Xuanzong. His father was Li Chu the Prince of Guangping—the oldest son of Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, and he was Li Chu's oldest son.Old Book of Tang, vol. 11. His mother was a consort of Li Chu's, Consort Shen. He was born at the eastern palace—i.e., the Crown Prince's palace—at the Tang capital Chang'an. Later that year, he was created the Prince of Fengjie and given the honorific title of Tejin (). During the Anshi Rebellion, which erupted in 755, Emperor Xuanzong fled to Chengdu, while Li Heng and his sons, including Li Chu, fled to Lingwu. Li Kuo's exact locations during this time were not stated in historical records, although presumably he accompanied his father, because while his mother Consort Shen was captured by the rebel Yan forces along with many palace women, he was not. (Consort Shen disappeared during the rebellion and, after the end of the rebellion, despite repeated efforts made by both Li Chu and Li Kuo to find her, she was never located.)Old Book of Tang, vol. 52. While Li Heng was at Lingwu, he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong), an act that Emperor Xuanzong later recognized.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 218. After Chang'an was recaptured from Yan forces in 756, Li Chu (whose name was then changed to Li Yu) was made crown prince, and in 762, after Emperor Suzong's death, he became emperor (as Emperor Daizong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 222. Emperor Daizong gave Li Kuo the title of supreme commander of the armed forces and created him the Prince of Lu, a title soon changed to Prince of Yong. He and his staff were sent to rendezvous with Tang and ally Huige forces at Shan Prefecture (陝州, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), to prepare an attack to recapture the eastern capital Luoyang, which was then serving as the Yan capital under Yan's fourth and final emperor Shi Chaoyi. When Li Kuo met Huige's Dengli Khan Yaoluoge Yidijian (), he treated Yaoluoge Yidijian as an equal, drawing Yaoluoge Yidijian's anger (as Tang was highly reliant on Huige aid at that time). Yaoluoge Yidijian had Li Kuo's Yao Ziang (), Wei Ju (), Wei Shaohua (), and Li Jin () arrested and whipped severely, such that Wei Ju and Wei Shaohua died that night. Yaoluoge Yidijian did not harm Li Kuo, but sent him back to the Tang camp. This incident would cause Li Kuo to bear great hatred for Huige later.Bo Yang, Outlines of the History of the Chinese (中國人史綱), vol. 2, p. 554. After Luoyang was recaptured and Shi Chaoyi committed suicide in flight in 763, Li Kuo was given the chancellor title of Shangshu Ling (), and his portrait, along with those of eight generals, were added to the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion. Subsequently, during a Tufan incursion in 763 in which Emperor Daizong was forced to flee Chang'an and Tufan forces briefly captured Chang'an, Li Kuo was named the titular supreme commander of forces in the Guanzhong region (i.e., the Chang'an region), but the general Guo Ziyi, as deputy supreme commander, was actually in command.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 223.  As crown prince  In 764, Li Kuo was created crown prince. Emperor Daizong then tried to transfer his title of Shangshu Ling to Guo Ziyi, but Guo declined on the basis that only Li Kuo had held the title recently, and previously the title had been held by Emperor Taizong. Meanwhile, in 765, a Buddhist nun named Guangcheng () claimed to be Li Kuo's mother Consort Shen, but after further interrogation, it was discovered that she had only been Li Kuo's wet nurse, and Emperor Daizong had her whipped to death. Li Kuo's activities as crown prince were not much recorded in the official histories—although, in 778, after Emperor Daizong executed the corrupt chancellor Yuan Zai, he stated to his close associate Li Mi that it was Li Kuo who revealed Yuan's corruption. In 779, when Emperor Daizong fell ill, Li Kuo briefly served as regent, and when Emperor Daizong subsequently died, he succeeded Emperor Daizong (as Emperor Dezong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 225.  Early attempts to destroy warlord power (early Jianzhong era)  After Emperor Dezong took the throne, within the span of less than a year, he carried out several actions to set out his policy differences with his father: * The chancellor Chang Gun, whom Emperor Dezong suspected of being overly powerful, was exiled, replaced with Cui Youfu; subsequently, at Cui's recommendation, Yang Yan was also made chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226. * Guo Ziyi, who had much military authority, was effectively forced into retirement (albeit with many honorific titles), with his commands divided between Li Huaiguang, Chang Qianguang (), and Hun Jian (). * Emperor Dezong had the animals in the imperial menagerie released, had many ladies in waiting sent out of the palace, and ordered that eunuchs serving as imperial messengers not be allowed to receive gifts. * Cui Ning the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), who had governed the circuit for more than a decade and only nominally obeyed imperial authority, was detained (although titularly promoted) at Chang'an, and the imperial government took back control of Xichuan. * At Yang's suggestion, the tax system was reformed—with the intention to decrease the tax burden on the landowners and farmers and bring merchants, who were previously not taxed, into the taxation system—under a new tax law known as the Law of the Two Taxes (兩稅法, Liangshui Fa). Emperor Dezong further resumed the search for his mother Consort Shen, whom he honored as an empress dowager in absentia. He commissioned officials, as well as Shen clan members, to be in charge of the search, and gave many members of the Shen clan honors. In 781, the searchers mistakenly believed that an adoptive daughter of Gao Lishi, a powerful eunuch during Emperor Xuanzong's reign, was Empress Dowager Shen, and she was taken to Chang'an to be honored as such. However, her brother Gao Chengyue () found out and reported to Emperor Dezong. She subsequently admitted to not being the real Empress Dowager Shen. Emperor Dezong did not punish her or anyone else involved, fearing that doing so would hamper the search for his mother. Later in his reign, there were several more incidents were others claimed to be Empress Dowager Shen, but were discovered to be imposters, and the real Empress Dowager Shen was never found. Meanwhile, Emperor Dezong, under Yang's proposal, also began to consider campaigns to recapture the western prefectures lost to Tufan during and immediately after the Anshi Rebellion. However, his putting Li Huaiguang, known for being a harsh commander, in charge of the project caused a mutiny of the soldiers at Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) in 780. Emperor Dezong had the Jingyuan mutiny suppressed, to show resolve, but was forced to abandon the plans to act against Tufan. When Emperor Dezong came to the throne, there were four major circuits that were ruled by their military governors in effectively independent manner from the imperial government—Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), governed by Li Zhengji; Weibo (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), governed by Tian Yue; Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), governed by Li Baochen; and Shannan East (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), governed by Liang Chongyi. The four circuits were allied with each other, and their governors intended to pass the control of the circuits within the family. In 781, when Li Baochen died, Emperor Dezong, wanting to show imperial authority, refused to let his son Li Weiyue inherit the circuit. The four circuits thus prepared for war against the imperial government. (Li Zhengji also died later in the year, and similarly, Emperor Dezong refused to let his son Li Na inherit the circuit.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. Emperor Dezong reacted by commissioning Li Xilie the military governor of Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) to command the army against Shannan East; Ma Sui, Li Baozhen, and Li Sheng to attack Weibo; and Zhu Tao the acting military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) to attack Chengde. Ma, Li Baozhen, and Li Sheng quickly defeated Tian's forces, which were attacking Li Baozhen's Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) and forced him to flee back to his capital Wei Prefecture (), which Ma, Li Baozhen, Li Sheng, and Li Qiu () put under siege. Li Xilie quickly defeated Liang, causing Liang to commit suicide. Zhu was able to persuade Li Weiyue's officer Zhang Xiaozhong to turn against him and attack Li Weiyue with Zhu, and under pressure, another officer of Li Weiyue's, Wang Wujun, killed Li Weiyue and surrendered to imperial forces. Li Na, meanwhile, was trapped at Pu Prefecture (濮州, in modern Heze, Shandong). By spring 782, it appeared that Emperor Dezong would be soon successful in his aim to wipe out warlord power and reunify the realm under imperial authority. Things quickly turned for the worse, however, after Emperor Dezong angered both Zhu and Wang by not giving them what they believed they deserved—in Zhu's case, control of Chengde's Shen Prefecture (深州, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), and in Wang's case, title as military governor. (Emperor Dezong had divided Chengde's seven prefectures into three circuits, with Zhang receive three circuits as military governor, and with Wang and another Chengde officer, Kang Rizhi (), each receiving two prefectures with the lesser title of military prefect (團練使, Tuanlianshi).) He also refused to accept Li Na's surrender when Li Na offered to surrender. As a result, Zhu and Wang entered into an alliance with Tian and headed south to lift the siege on Wei Prefecture—defeating Ma, Li Baozhen, and Li Huaiguang (whom Emperor Dezong had also sent to combat Tian) to force the situation into a stalemate, while Li Na escaped the trap imperial forces had put him in at Pu Prefecture and returned to his headquarters at Yun Prefecture (), leaving imperial forces unable to do much against him. The four rebel generals (Zhu, Wang, Tian, and Li Na) each claimed princely titles, showing a break from the Tang imperial government, although they continued to use Emperor Dezong's era name of Jianzhong to show some degree of submissiveness. They also persuaded Li Xilie to do the same. By this point, Cui had died, and Lu Qi became chancellor along with Yang. Lu soon was able to persuade Emperor Dezong that Yang was intending treason, and Emperor Dezong put Yang to death. With Lu largely in power by himself, it was said that at his inducement, Emperor Dezong became unduly harsh, causing the officials and the people to be disappointed in Emperor Dezong. With the necessity of paying for campaigns on multiple fronts, Emperor Dezong added two new taxes—property taxes for houses (Shuijianjia, 稅間架) and transaction tax (Chumoqian, 除陌錢); these taxes created heavy burdens, and Emperor Dezong's tax code for these taxes further encouraged people to report on each other when the taxes were not paid properly. It was said that complaints about them filled the realm. The imperial scholar Lu Zhi, whose opinion Emperor Dezong valued, earnestly advised against these taxes and against the campaigns, pointing out that the realm was on the verge of completely falling into rebellion. Emperor Dezong, however, did not accept Lu's advice.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228.  Rebellions of Zhu Ci, Li Huaiguang, and Li Xilie  On November 2, 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit, at Chang'an to be deployed to the battlefield to the east, rebelled when they became angry that they were not only not given rewards that they believed they deserved, but were being fed a vegetarian diet, mutinied. They attacked the palace, and Emperor Dezong fled with his family to Xianyang (咸陽, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), and then to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang). The soldiers supported Zhu Tao's brother Zhu Ci—who had previously been a major general and who had been the military governor of Jingyuan Circuit at one point but who was removed from his command due to Zhu Tao's rebellion—as their leader. Zhu Ci soon declared himself emperor of a new state of Qin. Many Tang officials surrendered to Zhu and served in his administration, although many fled to Fengtian to join Emperor Dezong. Zhu Ci personally led an army and put Fengtian under siege for more than a month, and the small city nearly fell. Meanwhile, Li Huaiguang, hearing of what had happened at Chang'an, marched his army from Weibo as quickly as possible toward Fengtian. Zhu, hearing of Li's impending arrival, first attacked Fengtian even more severely but still could not capture it, and with Li arriving, Zhu withdrew back to Chang'an on December 18.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 229. However, in the aftermaths of Li's saving him, Emperor Dezong offended Li by refusing to meet him, but instead ordering him to rendezvous with several other generals—Li Sheng (who had also marched toward Fengtian), Li Jianhui (), and Yang Huiyuan ()—to recapture Chang'an. (This was at Lu Qi's suggestion, as Lu knew that Li Huaiguang despised him and, if he were allowed to meet the emperor, would surely accuse him and his associates Zhao Zan () and Bai Zhizhen () of crimes.) Li Huaiguang became disaffected, but submitted petitions demanding the dismissals of Lu and his associates. As a result, Lu, Bai, and Zhao were exiled. At Lu Zhi's suggestion, on January 27, 784 (Chinese New Year), Emperor Dezong issued a pardon blaming himself for provoking the rebellions and pardoning all of the warlords and their soldiers, with the only exception of Zhu Ci personally, and further exempting the soldiers involved in the campaign against Zhu Ci from taxes. Upon receiving the pardons, Wang Wujun, Tian Yue, and Li Na renounced their princely titles and reclaimed allegiance to Tang; in turn, Emperor Dezong made them military governors of their own circuits. However, Li Xilie reacted by declaring himself the emperor of a new state of Chu, while Zhu Tao headed south, attempting to join Zhu Ci. When Tian refused to join him, he attacked Weibo, but was unable to immediately capture it. With Tian Yue subsequently assassinated and succeeded by his cousin Tian Xu, Zhu Tao initially attempted to persuade Tian Xu to join him, but Tian eventually reentered an alliance with Wang and Li Baozhen and resisted Zhu Tao. Wang and Li Baozhen soon arrived and defeated Zhu Tao, forcing him to flee back to Lulong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 230.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. Meanwhile, though, Li Huaiguang, disaffected from Emperor Dezong, was in secret negotiations with Zhu Ci (who had changed his state's name to Han by this point) to enter an alliance with Zhu. Zhu promised to honor Li Huaiguang as an elder brother and divide the Guanzhong region with him, with each ruling a state as its emperor. On March 20, Li Huaiguang declared his rebellion and alliance with Zhu. Emperor Dezong fled from Fengtian to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). Several key officers under Li Huaiguang—including Han Yougui (), Dai Xiuyan (), Luo Yuanguang (), and Shang Kegu ()—however, refused to follow Li Huaiguang and instead accepted commands from Li Sheng, whom Emperor Dezong made the commander of Tang forces in the region. With Li Huaiguang weakened, Zhu no longer treated him with respect but instead as a subordinate. In anger and fear, Li Huaiguang withdrew from the region and headed back to his base at Hezhong (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shaanxi). Li Sheng soon prepared for a final attack on Chang'an, and he launched his attack on June 12. On June 20, with Li Sheng having entered the city, Zhu Ci fled toward Tufan. He was soon killed in flight by his own soldiers, ending his state of Han. On August 3, Emperor Dezong returned to Chang'an. When he sent emissaries to persuade Li Huaiguang to again pledge allegiance to him, Li Huaiguang was initially receptive, but when Emperor Dezong's further emissary, the official Kong Chaofu (), arrived at Hezhong, Li Huaiguang's soldiers, believing that Kong was showing disrespect to Li Huaiguang, killed Kong, apparently with Li Huaiguang's implicit approval, and Li Huaiguang continued to resist Tang forces. By fall 785, however, with Tang forces under Ma Sui and Hun Jian converging on Hezhong, Li Huaiguang committed suicide, and his army resubmitted to Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. Meanwhile, Li Xilie's continued attempts to expand were being repeatedly rebuffed by Tang generals. In summer 786, with Li Xilie being ill, his general Chen Xianqi had him poisoned, slaughtered his family, and then resubmitted to Tang authority. (While Chen was soon thereafter himself assassinated by Wu Shaocheng, Wu continued to pledge allegiance to Tang.) Nominally, the realm was again entirely under Emperor Dezong's rule.  Period of strong chancellors Li Mi and Lu Zhi (early Zhenyuan era)  However, by this point, the empire was in deep trouble due to the wars, and Tufan forces, taking advantage of Tang's weakening, were making repeated incursions into Tang territory. Tufan's chancellor Shang Jiezan (), in particular, believed that he would be able to conquer Tang if he could get three Tang generals out of the way—Li Sheng, Ma Sui, and Hun Jian. With Emperor Dezong beginning to become paranoid about generals having too much power by this point, it was soon thereafter that rumors spread by Shang and Li's political enemy Zhang Yanshang, then a chancellor, made Emperor Dezong suspicious of Li Sheng, who was then the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). In 787, he recalled Li back to Chang'an to serve as chancellor as well, stripping him of his military command. Meanwhile, Shang continued the next stage of his plan, by submitting a peace proposal through Ma. Emperor Dezong believed Shang's good faith and agreed to the treaty, despite Li's warnings. At Shang's request, Emperor Dezong sent Hun to meet with Shang and sign the treaty. On July 8, 787, the day set for the treaty signing, Shang ambushed Hun at the meeting site, intending to capture him, but Hun escaped with emergency aid from Luo Yuanguang and Han Yougui. As Ma was responsible for arranging the peace treaty with Shang, Emperor Dezong recalled him to Chang'an as well and stripped him of his command of Hedong Circuit (河東, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). After the disaster, Emperor Dezong recalled Li Mi, who had been serving as the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Shan'guo Circuit (陝虢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), to Chang'an to serve as chancellor, and soon thereafter, Li Mi effectively became sole chancellor. Under Li Mi's suggestion, Emperor Dezong instituted a regime where soldiers were encouraged to settle in the border region with Tufan and were promised land and seeds, to repopulate the border region and strengthen the defense. Li Mi also proposed a marriage alliance with Huige's Heguduolu Khan Yaoluoge Dunmohe ()—a proposal that Emperor Dezong initially resisted due to his hatred for Huige—but finally agreed to, with Li Sheng and Ma also agreeing with Li Mi's opinion.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. With Huige (which was soon renamed Huigu) fighting with Tufan, and with Tufan's major vassal Nanzhao distancing itself from Tufan's campaigns against Tang, Tufan attacks on Tang began to weaken, such that Tang generals were beginning to have successes against Tufan. By this point, however, Emperor Dezong was also extracting frequent tributes from regional governors for his own personal use. Li Mi tried to curb the emperor's hoarding of treasure by instituting an annual stipend for the emperor, which Emperor Dezong initially agreed to. However, even after the stipend was instituted, Emperor Dezong continued to demand tributes from regional governors and ordered that they not let Li Mi become aware of the tributes. When Li Mi still found out, he became depressed over this issue but did not dare to speak again about it. Li Mi died in 789, and for some time, Li Mi's recommended successor, Dou Can, was the most powerful chancellor at court, but he soon lost Emperor Dezong's favor and was exiled (and eventually ordered to commit suicide).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. Lu Zhi became the main chancellor, and for some time, made ambitious proposals to reform the civil service system and logistics system, and reassert authority over regional governors—whom, by this point, Emperor Dezong was so apprehensive about such that he was not daring to impose governors unless he had explicit agreements from the key military officers of the circuits. (For example, after the death of Liu Xuanzuo () the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) in 792, Emperor Dezong was initially intending to commission his granduncle Wu Cou () to replace Liu, but after Xuanwu soldiers mutinied and supported Liu Xuanzuo's son Liu Shining (), Emperor Dezong did not dare to confront the Xuanwu army and instead agreed to commission Liu Shining.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. Lu, however, was soon in conflict with Emperor Dezong's favorite official Pei Yanling—who was able to garner Emperor Dezong's favor by making Emperor Dezong believe that he was locating long-lost revenue resources for the imperial treasury. By 794, Lu had lost the power struggle with Pei and lost his chancellorship, and in 795 was exiled.  Middle Zhenyuan era  It was said that after Lu Zhi's removal, Emperor Dezong became increasingly distrusting of chancellors. He therefore personally selected all of the officials, but as he could not have actually known all of the candidates for official positions himself, he trusted the recommendations of Pei Yanling (who died in 796) and such other officials that he trusted, including Li Qiyun (), Wang Shao (), Li Shi (), Wei Zhiyi, and Wei Qumou (). It was described that these people's recommendations could ruin chancellors, and that those who wanted to be promoted flattered them. Emperor Dezong also increasingly open to tributes from regional governors, and the regional governors often submitted large amounts of tributes in order to protect their positions and gain favor from the emperor. Also around this time, powerful eunuchs (starting with Dou Wenchang () and Huo Xianming ()) became the commanders of the Shence Army, and it was said that, as the military governors frequently were Shence Army soldiers initially, the power and authorities of the eunuchs became increasingly important. In 799, for reasons lost to history, Wu Shaocheng, still governing Zhangyi Circuit (formerly Huaixi Circuit) at that time, began to pillage the circuits around his. Emperor Dezong ordered the military governors around Zhangyi—including Yu Di the military governor of Shannan East Circuit, Han Hong (Liu Xuanzuo's nephew) the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit, Yi Shen () the military governor of Anhuang Circuit (安黃, headquartered in modern Xiaogan, Hubei), and Shangguan Shui () the military governor of Chenxu Circuit (陳許, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan)—to attack Wu. These generals had initial successes, but without an unified command, they could not coordinate their actions, and around the new year 800, they suddenly collapsed and fled, allowing Wu to capture much of their supplies. Emperor Dezong put Han Quanyi () the military governor of Xiasui Circuit (夏綏, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) in command of the operations, but Han Quanyi was repeatedly defeated by Wu. At the suggestion of Wei Gao the military governor of Xichuan Circuit and the chancellor Jia Dan, Emperor Dezong pardoned Wu in late 800, ending the campaign.  Late Zhenyuan era  Chongling (崇陵), tomb of Emperor Dezong, in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Meanwhile, due to victories that Wei Gao and the Nanzhao king Yimouxun (), who had become a Tang vassal after abandoning Tufan, were inflicting on Tufan, Tufan had become a much lesser threat to Tang security by this point.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. By this time, Emperor Dezong's oldest son Li Song the Crown Prince had become close to the junior officials Wang Pi and Wang Shuwen, and Wang Pi and Wang Shuwen and their associates were planning To carry out a number of reforms when Li Song would eventually be emperor. The officials who associated with them included Wei Zhiyi and such junior officials as Lu Chun (), Lü Wen (), Li Jingjian (), Han Ye (), Han Tai (), Chen Jian (), Liu Zongyuan, and Liu Yuxi. They essentially formed a shadow government. In winter 804, however, Li Song suddenly suffered a stroke, causing him to be partially paralyzed and unable to speak. In spring 805, it was said that because of Li Song's illness, Emperor Dezong himself became severely depressed and fell into an illness. He died on February 25, 805, and, while there was some speculation both inside the palace and out as to whether Li Song would actually take the throne due to his severe illness, Li Song did so (as Emperor Shunzong).  Issues during Emperor Dezong's reign  Dezong's reign can be summarized into three categories of mismanagements that began during his reign and would have repercussions for future Tang emperors. =Attempts at eliminating military governors= The early part of Dezong's reign can be seen as an attempt to limit the strength of the fanzhen, a situation where regional military governors or jiedushi had sprung up after the An Lushan rebellion, to take control of huge border areas of the empire. These fiefs were a direct challenge to the central administration of the Tang empire as they were granted the power to collect tax, maintain an army and pass on their power hereditarily rather by appointment of the central government. As such these warlords would only be loyal to central government if it served their interest to do so. In early 781, when one of the military governors, Li Baochen, died, out of respect for protocol, Li's son, Li Weiyue requested to the central government that he be appointed the succeeding governor. Dezong seized upon this request as a chance to rid his state of the military governors and declined to grant Li Weiyue the title. This act angered the rest of the military governors who saw Dezong as a threat. In 782, the four strongest military governors banded together and revolted against the central government. In the meantime, an internal military coup albeit a minor one forced Dezong to flee his palace in capital city of Chang'an - the third Tang emperor to do so. As a result, all plans to remove the military governors had to be abandoned. In early 784, in order to restore peace and stability, Dezong decreed that he would not limit their power and accept responsibility for causing the initial revolt. Dezong's humiliating acceptance of defeat was just as toxic to Dezong himself as to the dynasty. Dezong became disenchanted with ever achieving his goals and when he thought it was unattainable, he would not pursue. Dezong's inability to control the fanzhen weakened the centralized power of the Tang dynasty and would contribute to a series of rebellions in the middle of the 9th century and ultimately lead to its downfall early in the 10th century. =Dependence on eunuchs= Dezong witnessed the rise of eunuchs during the reign of his father Emperor Daizong who himself succeeded to the throne as a result of support from eunuchs. Dezong realized the danger of depending too heavily on eunuchs and as a result he kept them at arm's length when he became emperor. Dezong's opinion of these eunuchs changed drastically when in 782 Dezong was driven out of his capital city by revolting military governors and was not able to command the situation. Even his own generals would not heed to his authority. Dezong felt forsaken and during his escape, only a handful of eunuchs namely Dou Wenchang and Huo Xianming were by his side. During this difficult times, Dezong's view of the eunuchs began to take on a different approach. After his return to Chang'an, Dezong greatly rewarded Dou and Huo for their loyalty not least of which were military and government post. In due course, these eunuchs's power became an inalienable part of the Tang government. Some eunuchs in the latter part of the dynasty were so powerful that they alone held the abilities to support or depose any emperors at whim. Dezong's son Tang Shunzong and grandson Tang Xianzong as well as later emperors such as Tang Jingzong and Tang Wenzong were all murdered or deposed by eunuchs. =From frugality to greed = Dezong began his reign by issuing a variety of edicts restricting wasteful government spending. Monetary contribution from local government officials or abroad were discouraged or limited. He also issued edicts that freed hundreds of palace girls in order to reduce palace expenses. These acts were all met with praise however they only lasted the first few years of his reign. A series of unfortunate events which included revolts by military governors forced Dezong to flee Chang'an in 784. During the months in exile, Dezong began to realize the importance of creating wealth and as a result, after Dezong's returned to Chang'an he began to reverse many of the original edicts he set forth. With the aid of eunuchs, Dezong started to amalgamate a large fortune either by extortion or bribery. These in turn led to a negative atmosphere where wealth rather than merit would ultimately bring one power.

History The new church Like the rest of Transcarpathia, Csap (as it was then known) was part of Hungary until 1920, when, as a result of the post- World War I Treaty of Trianon, it was included in the newly created Czechoslovakia, where it belonged to Slovakia, not to Subcarpathian Rus. During World War II, under the First Vienna Award, it briefly became Hungarian again. But, after the war, as part of the Czechoslovakia–Soviet Union relations, it became part of the expanded Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Ukraine), adopting the Ukrainian version of its name, 'Чоп' (usually transliterated as 'Chop' or 'Tchop' in English). Demography According to the Ukrainian national census, Chop had a population in 2001 of 8,919, of whom 40% were Ukrainians, 39.2% ethnic Hungarians and 20.8% Roma, Russians, Slovaks, Belarusians, and Jews.

The previous incarnation of the club was founded in 1892 and was one of the most successful Italian clubs in the early decades of the twentieth century, winning seven national titles between 1908 and 1922. Its trademark and honours were transferred from Vercelli municipality to A.S. Pro Belvedere Vercelli, the city's other team (founded in 2006), which changed its name and was therefore allowed to continue the history of Pro Vercelli. The trademark \\"Pro Vercelli\\" =From 1892 to 2010 by U.S. Pro Vercelli Calcio= Foundation The Società Ginnastica Pro Vercelli (Pro Vercelli Gymnastics Society) was established in 1892, with its Football Division founded in 1903. The first official match for the football division of S.G. Pro Vercelli took place on 3 August 1903 against the Forza e Costanza. 1907 saw Pro Vercelli's football team win the Subs Division, and subsequently the club were admitted to Italian National League for the first time. Success followed quickly, with the following two years (1908 and 1909) producing the first national championship titles for the \\"White Shirts\\". Phenomenal success The team earned a place in the 1909–10 Championship final. However, a disagreement arose with the Italian Football Federation (F.I.F. – now called the F.I.G.C.) on the arranged date of the match, which clashed with another, previously scheduled match. Pro Vercelli chose to take part only with a youth team, eventually losing the title to Inter. Nevertheless, the Leoni (\\"Lions\\", so called for their notorious hard and not always clean tackles) did not take long to once again prove their supremacy in Italian football. They remained undefeated for the next three seasons, with the unprecedented capture of three titles in a row in 1910–11, 1911–12 and 1912–13. These years began the legends of the famous Midfield Line of Wonders, formed by Ara, Milano I and Leone. In the same years Pro Vercelli also formed, the backbone of the first Italian national teams, with nine players representing the Piedmont club. After such an incredible beginning, Pro Vercelli then had to wait the end of the Great War and 1920–21 to win another National title. In the following years Pro Vercelli remained among the best Italian teams, but fell short of achieving the top prize. Other teams such as arch-rivals Casale, Genoa and Inter overtook the \\"White Shirts\\", breaking a dominance not experienced before or since. In 1921–22, after a row over the structure of the Italian league competition, the Italian Football Federation split, with all the major teams forming the independent Italian Football Confederation (C.C.I.). Pro Vercelli joined the CCI league, which had a structure with fewer matches over the year, subsequently and joyously regaining their 7th National title, their last to date. Pro Vercelli were then invited to Rio de Janeiro to play against Flamengo and Botafogo. In the days before formalised European competition, Liverpool F.C., during a European tour as English Champions, played all of the strongest teams of the continent, defeating all except one: they could only manage a draw with Pro Vercelli in a clash of the finest sides of Europe on the day. Decline 1934-35 was the season that marked the beginning of the slow but steady decline of Pro Vercelli. The Bianche Casacche were eventually relegated to Serie B. The steady modernisation of the game saw the small town team drop to Serie C for the first time in 1940–41. It returned to Serie B in 1946 and stayed for 2 years. It played in Serie C between 1948–1962 and 1971–1978. In the 1977–78 season the team were relegated to Serie C2 and the following season to Serie D. They returned to Serie C2 in 1984, but were relegated back to Serie D the subsequent season. Scudetto Dilettanti 1993–94 It returns in Serie C2 on 1994 when wins group A of Serie D and the Scudetto Dilettanti. The folding and rebirth In recent years, U.S. Pro Vercelli Calcio have been fairly stable at mid-table in the Italian fourth division (Serie C2). In July 2005 a new chairman, Vero Paganoni, took over at the helm of the club. Due to large debts it was not allowed to participate in the 2010–11 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione and so folded. In the summer of 2010 the club changes its name to U.S. Vercelli Calcio, Vero Paganoni remained as president of a club that today is inactive, therefore A.S. Pro Belvedere Vercelli becomes the new Pro Vercelli.

A religious may also be a priest if he has undergone ordination, but in general he is not. More precisely, a religious is a member of a religious order or religious institute, someone who belongs to \\"a society in which members...pronounce public vows...and lead a life of brothers or sisters in common\\".Code of Canon Law, canon 607 §2. The full text is: \\"a society in which members, according to proper law, pronounce public vows, either perpetual or temporary which are to be renewed, however, when the period of time has elapsed, and lead a life of brothers or sisters in common\\". Some classes of religious have also been referred to, though less commonly now than in the past, as regulars, because of living in accordance with a religious rule (regula in Latin) such as the Rule of Saint Benedict. Catholicism =Catholic canon law definition= Religious are members of religious institutes, societies in which the members take public vows and live a fraternal life in common. Thus monks such as Benedictines and Carthusians, nuns such as Carmelites and Poor Clares, and friars such as Dominicans and Franciscans are called religious. Those living other recognized forms of consecrated life are not classified as religious. A member of a secular institute is thus not a religious. Nor is a consecrated hermit, a consecrated virgin, or a person who follows some other form whose approval is reserved to the Holy See. Ordination as deacon, priest or bishop does not make one a member of a religious institute and so does not make one a religious. =Clerical or lay= If a religious has been ordained as a deacon, a priest or a bishop, he also belongs to the clergy and so is a member of what is called the \\"religious clergy\\" or the \\"regular clergy\\". Clergy who are not members of a religious institute are known as secular clergy. They generally serve a geographically defined diocese or a diocese-like jurisdiction such as an apostolic vicariate or personal ordinariate, and so are also referred to as diocesan clergy. A religious who has not been ordained is a member of the laity (a lay person), not of the clergy. However, once any non-ordained religious professes vows, especially final vows, they must be formally dispensed from those vows, which is a lengthy and formal process, with set procedures, that involves their local superior, the local Bishop or other Ordinary, the head of the Order, and the Vatican's Congregation for Religious. If they are ordained, they must also be formally suspended from and then relieved of their duties, and then laicized (formally removed from the clerical state), which is a related but separate matter. Both laicization and dispensation of vows are only done for very serious reasons, except for perhaps when one seeks to get married once it is done. The process is even more complex if they are accused of a secular or ecclesiastical offense or crime (some procedures can be expedited in certain criminal cases involving sex abuse). The state of a non-ordained religious, therefore, is not precisely the same as a lay unmarried person who is not a religious.Cf. Code of Canon Law, canon 207 While the state of consecrated life is neither clerical or lay, institutes themselves are classified as one or the other. A clerical institute is one that \\"by reason of the purpose or design intended by the founder or by virtue of legitimate tradition, is under the direction of clerics, assumes the exercise of sacred orders, and is recognized as such by the authority of the Church\\". In clerical institutes, such as the Dominican Order or the Jesuits, most of the members are clerics. In only a few cases do lay institutes have some clergy among their members. =Canon law= The Code of Canon Law devotes to religious 103 canons arranged in eight chapters: # Religious houses and their erection and suppression # The governance of institutes # The admission of candidates and the formation of members # The obligations and rights of institutes and their members # The apostolate of institutes # Separation of members from the institute # Religious raised to the episcopate # Conferences of major superiors Lutheranism The Priory of St. Wigbert is a Lutheran monastery in the Benedictine tradition In the Lutheran Churches, religious are defined as those who make religious vows before their bishop to live consecrated life, especially in a religious order. An ordained priest who is not a part of a Lutheran religious order is considered 'secular', rather than 'religious'. Anglicanism In the Anglican Communion, the religious are those who have taken \\"vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, usually in community\\".

He left home in 1917; he joined a Zionist community, the HeHalutz Group. His views were not in fact Zionist, but the agricultural work appealed. Late in 1918 he received conscription papers for the Russian Army, and with his father's approval he immediately left Poland.Diamant, p. 140. In 1919 he travelled to the Netherlands and worked in the steel industry.

These were the areas historically governed by the Kazan Palace's Prikaz. As with the rest of the governorates, neither the borders nor internal subdivisions of Kazan Governorate were defined; instead, the territory was defined as a set of cities and the lands adjacent to those cities. In 1717, Astrakhan Governorate was separated from Kazan Governorate; in 1719—Nizhny Novgorod; in 1744—Orenburg; in 1781—Vyatka, Simbirsk, and Ufa Governorates were separated. Under Catherine the Great (1781–1796) Kazan was the center of a namestnichestvo (viceroyalty), with Kazan, Penza, and Saratov Governorates as its integral parts. At first the governorate was divided into lots (, doli), then into provinces (, provintsii) in 1719, and into uyezds () in 1775. Prior to 1796, there were Kazan, Kozmodemyansk, Laishev, Mamadysh, Sviyazhsk, Spassk, Tetyushi, Tsaryovokokshaysk, Tsivilsk, Cheboksary, Chistopol, and Yadrin uyezds. In 1913, the area of the governorate comprised 55,900 square versts, its population was estimated at 2.85 million (38.9% Russians, 31.2% Tatars, 22.8% Chuvash, 5.1% Mari, 1.2% Mordva). There were 7,272 settlements, including 13 towns: Kazan, Arsk, Sviyazhsk, Kozmodemyansk, Laishev, Mamadysh, Spassk, Tetyushi, Tsaryovokokshaysk, Tsivilsk, Cheboksary, Chistopol, Yadrin; and two posads: Mariinsky Posad and Troitsky Posad. The governorate was finally abolished during the Bolshevik administrative reform (see Idel-Ural State). Thereupon its Eastern part was proclaimed the Tatar ASSR, while the Western part was eventually divided between Chuvashia and Mari El.

The Office of Student Publications at UT Martin publishes The Pacer every Tuesday morning throughout the semester except for holidays and exam periods. As of 2006, the newspaper has a circulation of 3,000 copies. Throughout its history, the newspaper has also been named The Checkerboard and The Volette.  History  According to Robert L. Carroll's book, The University of Tennessee at Martin: The First One Hundred Years, the forerunner of UTM was a Baptist school, Hall-Moody Institute, established in 1900. A student newspaper called The Crimson and Gold (the Institute's colors) was printed for several years, and two annuals, or yearbooks, also were published. The Crimson and Gold run ended when the institute closed in 1927 because of financial troubles, and all students were given the opportunity to transfer to nearby Union University in Jackson, Tennessee. The University of Tennessee Junior College opened in the fall 1927, and a student newspaper, The Checkerboard, followed in 1928. = The Checkerboard = A group of students decided in the fall of 1927 that UTJC needed a student newspaper. They called themselves the Checkers, and the first evidence of their dream, the Checkerboard, appeared in the Weakley County Press in January and February 1928. They also published a standalone issue of the Checkerboard later in the spring of 1928 and then published a magazine by the same name at the end of the 1927-28 academic year. The magazine is also considered a forerunner of the present-day UTM yearbook, The Spirit. Its first Editor was Lloyd Lynn. The first edition of The Volette, which evolved from the Checkers' vision and grew into the permanent student newspaper at what is now UTM, was printed Dec. 17, 1928. It paid tribute to the Checkers on page 2, for \\"the spontaneous enthusiasm of this group of students\\", who \\"actually published a paper weekly; without money, without anything but the passive approval of the faculty and their own native ability coupled with a boundless determination. …\\" = The Volette = Front page of the February 11, 1929 issue of The Volette. Courtesy of the Tennessee State Library and Archives (Microfilm 912) The first Volette was a four-page publication that contained a few advertisements but no pictures. Sports news led the way on many of the headlines on Page 1: * Football team closes successful season * Prospects good for girls basketball team * Coach Grantham attends conference at Memphis Other headlines included: * Large number make Honor Role * Faculty members make speeches * U.T. Student admitted to the Bar On Page 2 of The Volette were a freshman's letter home (with all spelling and grammatical errors included, perhaps as a joke), newspaper staff information, subscription information (a year's subscription was only $1.50), a brief on the naming contest held to name The Volette and an editorial from the newspaper staff on the first edition of the paper. The editorial included an apology for why the paper was printed so late in the fall, as well as a plea for stories from the student body that The Pacer continues to make to this day. It reads \\"… It is evident that no group of reporters, however good they may be, can cover all interesting items without the cooperation of the student body at large. Therefore, we ask that any student will report such interesting occurrence as shall come under his observation. Moreover, we wish to state that it is policy of this paper to accept worthwhile contributions from any and all sources.\\" A column down the side of the page was called \\"Newsettes,\\" personal notes of college students. Tidbits from the column include: * Lucille Kirk and Kennedy Laws went to Fulton Saturday night. * Charles Johnson attended the Cow Sale at Gleason Saturday * Marie Wells spent the weekend at her home in Obion. * Tater Jones and Fatty McDonald have accepted position as skating managers in the skating rink here. * Paul White spent several days in Nashville, Christmas shopping. * The Terrible Two were out of the dormitory last weekend. * John McDonald was the guest of Mr. Matthew Enochs at his home in Newbern. * Burnie Orr called on Dr. C.R. Galloway of Greenfield Tuesday afternoon to have the lens of his glasses changed. (Orr was the business manager for The Volette.) While The Pacer no longer contains such personal items on students, local papers like the Weakley County Press and the Dresden Enterprise still feature the same type of \\"community news.\\" The Vollette's Page 3 featured a wide variety of opinionated copy titled \\"El Toro\\" by El Toreador. No other name was given. El Toreador, however, took up much of the page with \\"rants\\" both serious and funny on other students; with a poem called \\"Ballad of Bad Boys\\" with a Top 10 list of rules for drivers and with suggestions on what students could do at night. The last suggestion, of course, was to study. The page also featured a story about the Home Economics Club. Page 4 contained jokes, which shall not be reprinted in this space. Oddly enough, the page also included a brief on all the new students entering UTJC for the second quarter, as well as a short story on the death of a \\"popular student's\\" father. Advertising was confined to Pages 3 and 4, with one plea from the newspaper staff to \\"patronize our advertisers.\\" The paper even included a few classified ads, one for someone willing to work trig problems and a couple for pressing pants and shining shoes. Finally, current students should know that maybe a lot hasn't really changed in the past 75 years of education at UTJC/UTMB/UTM. Page 4 also included a column called \\"Rules and Regulations, of University of Tennessee Junior College (Published by special permission for the benefit of the news students).\\" Such rules included: * Chewing gum must be chewed in every class, and, if possible, chewed loud enough to drown out what the professor has to say. * Whistling, singing and conversations must go on in the library … * Every student is requested to be late to chapel … * When taking examinations, be sure to sit by good neighbors. * Do not buy any books, paper or pencils. There should be extravagance in this University, and purchasing these things is not necessary as they may be borrowed. * Cut as many classes as possible. = The Pacer = Front page of the October 6, 1971 issue of The Pacer. Courtesy of the Tennessee State Library and Archives (Microfilm 912). The first edition of The Pacer was printed on Oct. 6, 1971. At that time, UTM's athletics nickname was the Pacers. Though the university's nickname was changed to the Skyhawks in the 1995, then Pacer adviser Dr. Robert Nanney asked the staff to vote whether to again change the newspaper's name to reflect the changing mascot, as was done when it was The Volette. \\"By an overwhelming margin, the staff voted to retain the Pacer moniker for two reasons. First, The Pacer reflects an ever-evolving, pace-setting entity, and we believed the newspaper should continue to represent such on campus. Second, the staff believed that retaining the name would make it clear that the newspaper does not necessarily follow the recommendations of consultants,\\" Nanney said in a 2003 interview.  Volume Numbers  The Pacer volume number is counted chronologically from the first issue of The Volette published Dec. 17, 1928, with the coming of a new academic year (measured from August to May) representing a new volume. Numerous editions of The Pacer bear the incorrect volume number, including the first edition under the masthead in 1971. Because the newspaper was not entirely reestablished when the name was changed from The Volette, the staff saw fit to correct this mistake in later issues.

He is known to have fought in the trenches of the Western Front. Patch was the longest-surviving soldier of World War I, but he was the fifth- longest-surviving veteran of any sort from World War I, behind British veterans Claude Choules and Florence Green, Frank Buckles of the United States and John Babcock of Canada. At the time of his death, aged 111 years, 1 month, 1 week and 1 day, Patch was the third oldest man in the world, behind Walter Breuning and Jiroemon Kimura, the latter of whom would become the oldest verified man ever. Early life Harry Patch was born in the village of Combe Down, near Bath, Somerset, England. He appears in the 1901 Census as a two- year-old boy along with his stonemason father William John Patch (1863-1945), mother Elizabeth Ann (née Morris) (1857–1951) and older brothers George Frederick (1888–1983) and William Thomas (1894–1981) at a house called \\"Fonthill\\".See General Register Office indices for quarter ending September 1886; and The family are recorded at the same address \\"Fonthill Cottage\\" in the 1911 census.Piece details RG 14/14687, General Register Office: 1911 Census Schedules, Registration Sub-District: Bathwick—Civil Parish, Township or Place: Monkton Combe (part)—RD 316 RS 2 ED 6, The Catalogue, The National Archives. Images of census pages available by subscription on findmypast.com as reference RG14 Piece 14687 Reference RG78PN891 RD316 SD2 ED6 SN65 His elder brothers are recorded as a carpenter and banker mason. Longevity ran in Patch's family; his father lived to 82, his mother to 94, his brother George to 95 and his brother William to 87. Patch left school in 1913 and became an apprentice plumber in Bath.\\"WWI veteran celebrates 109 years\\", BBC News, 17 June 2007. World War I In October 1916, during World War I, he was conscripted into the British Army as a private, reporting for duty at Tolland Barracks, Taunton. During the winter of 1916–17 he was promoted to lance corporal but was demoted after a fist fight with a soldier, who had taken Patch's boots from his billet, and he saw no further promotion. Patch went through a series of short-lived attachments to several regiments, including the Royal Warwickshire Regiment before being posted after completing training to the 7th (Service) Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, serving as an assistant gunner in a Lewis gun section.He recorded: \\"In early 1917 we went to Sutton Veney near Warminster where I joined the 33rd Training Reserve Battalion. At this point we weren't attached to any regiment, although before we joined the 33rd I wore several different regimental cap badges, the Royal Warwickshire Regiment being one, so I must have been shifted around.\\" Patch arrived in France in June 1917. He fought on the Western Front at the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres) and was injured in the groin, when a shell exploded overhead at 22:30 on 22 September 1917, killing three of his comrades. He was removed from the front line and returned to England on 23 December 1917. Patch referred to 22 September as his personal Remembrance Day. He was still convalescing on the Isle of Wight when the Armistice with Germany was declared the following November. =Medals= Patch received eight medals and honours; for his service in the First World War he received the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. In 1998, as a surviving veteran of the First World War, who had fought for the Allies in France and Flanders, the President of the Republic of France made him a Knight of the Légion d'honneur. The award was presented to Patch on his 101st birthday. On 9 March 2009, Patch was appointed an Officer of the Légion d'honneur by the French Ambassador at his nursing home in Somerset. On 7 January 2008, Albert II, King of the Belgians, conferred upon Patch the award of Knight of the Order of Leopold. He received the award from Jean-Michel Veranneman de Watervliet, Belgium's Ambassador to the United Kingdom, at a ceremony in the Ambassador's residence in London, on 22 September 2008, which coincidentally was the 91st anniversary of the day he was wounded in action and three of his closest friends killed. For service during the Second World War, Patch was awarded the 1939–45 Defence Medal. This was subsequently lost and on 20 September 2008, at a ceremony at Bath Fire Station, Patch was presented with a replacement medal. Patch also received two commemorative medals: the National Service Medal and the Hors de combat medal, which signifies outstanding bravery of servicemen and women, who have sustained wounds or injury in the line of duty. The medals are unofficial and not a part of the official order of wear in any Commonwealth realm. In accordance with his wishes, Patch's medals are displayed at the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry Museum in Bodmin. =Ribbons= British War Medal Awarded 1919 Victory Medal Awarded 1919 Defence Medal Awarded 1945 Légion d'honneur (Officer) Awarded 2009 Légion d'honneur (Chevalier) Awarded 1998 Order Of Leopold (Knight) Awarded 2008 Personal life After the war, Patch returned to work as a plumber, during which time he spent four years working on the Wills Memorial Building in Bristol, before becoming manager of the plumbing company's branch in Bristol. A year above the age to be called up for military service at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he became a part-time fireman in Bath, dealing with the Baedeker raids. Later in the war he moved to Street, Somerset, where he ran a plumbing company until his retirement at the age of 65. Patch married Ada Emily Billington (1891–1976) at the Parish Church, Hadley, Shropshire on 13 September 1919. Harry and Ada had two children. Denis Howard Patch (1920–1987) and Gorden Roy Patch (1927–2002). Ada suffered a severe stroke in 1976 and died at Wells and District Hospital on 20 September 1976, aged 85. Patch married Kathleen Alice Joy (née Weedon) (1901–1989) at Mendip Register Office on 5 June 1982. Harry was 83 and Kathleen, known as Jean, was 80. Jean died of breast cancer at St Margaret's Hospice, aged 87 on 18 March 1989. Patch's elder son, Denis, was deeply affected by his mother's death and began drinking heavily. Denis died at Kings College Hospital, London, in 1987 of cirrhosis of the liver, aged 66. At the age of 100, Patch moved to Fletcher House Nursing Home, where he found a companion in widow Doris Whitaker (1914–2007). =Honorary degree= On 16 December 2005, Patch was awarded an honorary degree of Master of Arts, honoris causa, by the University of Bristol, whose buildings he helped construct in the 1920s. The University's restored Wills Memorial Building was reopened by Patch on 20 February 2008. He was chosen for this honour as he was a member of the workforce that originally helped build the tower, which was opened on 9 June 1925 by King George V, an event which Patch also attended. Upon receiving this degree, he became recognized by Guinness World Records as the oldest person to have ever received an honorary degree, at the age of 107 years and 182 days. Death Patch died at 9 a.m. on 25 July 2009, aged 111 years, one month, one week and one day. His death came seven days after that of fellow veteran Henry Allingham, the last veteran of The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and founding member of The Royal Air Force (RAF), aged 113. Charles, Prince of Wales led the tributes to him, saying: \\"Today, nothing could give me greater pride than paying tribute to Harry Patch, of Somerset\\". Patch was the last male First World War veteran living in Europe and the last British male known to have been born in the 1890s. =Funeral= Harry Patch's funeral procession Patch's funeral was held in Wells Cathedral on Thursday 6 August 2009. At 11:00 a.m., the bells of Wells Cathedral were rung 111 times to mark each year of his life. A quarter peal of Grandsire Caters was also rung, half muffled, while quarter-peals were also rung in Bristol and at several churches around the country. His coffin travelled from his home, Fletcher House, to the cathedral where the service commenced at noon. The theme of the service was \\"Peace and Reconciliation\\" and in addition to pallbearers from The Rifles (the successor regiment to the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry), Patch's coffin was accompanied by two private soldiers from each of the armies of Belgium, France and Germany. In accordance with Patch's instructions, no guns were allowed at the funeral and even the officiating soldiers did not have their ceremonial weapons. Due to public interest in the funeral, which was broadcast live on TV and radio, 1,050 tickets were made available for the service. Some, wanting to pay their respects, slept overnight on the Cathedral green in order to get tickets. The funeral was led by John Clarke, Dean of Wells and Peter Maurice, Bishop of Taunton. Among notables to attend the funeral were Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester. Patch was buried at St Michael's Church, Monkton Combe, near his parents and brother. Patch became estranged from his son Gorden, known as Roy, following Denis's death and they did not speak for the last twenty years of Roy's life. Roy died of cancer in 2002 aged 75. Patch's partner Doris died on 19 March 2007 aged 92. Legacy Race horse trainer and owner Michael Jarvis named a horse after Patch in 2008. Having bought the horse in October 2007, during that year's Poppy Appeal, the Newmarket trainer decided to name him after a First World War veteran. Michael's daughter suggested Patch after reading an article about him. The horse won the 1:30 at Doncaster racecourse on 8 November 2008, the day before Remembrance Sunday. A commemorative plaque in Patch's memory is to be placed on the Guildhall in Bath. The BBC commissioned Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet Laureate, to write a poem to mark the deaths of Patch and Henry Allingham (who died one week before Patch, on 18 July 2009). The result, Last Post, was read by Duffy on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 on 30 July 2009, the day of Allingham's funeral. On 5 August 2009, the band Radiohead released the song \\"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)\\". Singer Thom Yorke explained that the song was inspired by a 2005 interview with Patch on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. The song was sold from Radiohead's website for £1, with proceeds donated to the British Legion. The commemorative nameplate on GWR HST Power Car no. 43172 stands under grey skies at Newton Abbot. In mid-2009, Harry recorded some spoken word parts for UK heavy metal band Imperial Vengeance, to be included on the title track to the album At the Going Down of the Sun. The song was about the horrors of the trenches and Patch read part of the poem For the Fallen. The former UK Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion composed a poem, The Death of Harry Patch, which he read for the first time on The World at One Radio 4 programme on Armistice Day 2010. On 6 November 2015 Great Western Railway named one of their Class 43 High Speed locomotives after Harry to commemorate the forthcoming armistice day. The locomotive was wrapped in remembrance vinyls that included images of poppies, soldiers, and text from the 'For the Fallen' poem by Laurence Binyon. The locomotive nameplates read: 'Harry Patch The last survivor of the trenches' and included a coloured line of all eight ribbons from the medals awarded to Patch. Harry Patch's portrait, painted from life by the artist Bill Leyshon, was commissioned by the Western Daily Press in 2007 and is now in the collections of Somerset Museums Service, Taunton.Tom Mayberry and Stephen Minnitt, 'Discover the Museum of Somerset' (2011), p. 60. After his passing, several articles have examined how Patch's life and image served as a reference point for thinking about the meaning of the Great War, commemoration and indeed the figure of the veteran. Patch's hard won pacifism for instance can be seen to sit uneasily with contemporary jingoism and militaristic rhetoric.Paul Long and Nick Webber (2018) ‘”And then there was one” Public History, the Press and Veterans of the Great War’ in Journal of War and Culture Studies, 12 (2): 139-155.; Nick Webber and Paul Long (2014) ‘The Last Post: British Press Representations of Veterans of the Great War’, The Media, War and Conflict Journal, 7 (3): 273-90. =Bibliography (The Last Tommy)= Patch had refused to discuss his war experiences, until approached in 1998 for the BBC One documentary Veterans, on reflection of which and with the realisation that he was part of a fast dwindling group of veterans of \\"the war to end all wars\\", he agreed. Patch was featured in the 2003 television series World War 1 in Colour and said \\"if any man tells you he went over the top and he wasn't scared, he's a damn liar\\". He reflected on his lost friends and the moment when he came face to face with a German soldier. He recalled the story of Moses descending from Mount Sinai with God's Ten Commandments, including \\"Thou shalt not kill\\" and could not bring himself to kill the German. Instead, he shot him in the shoulder, which made the soldier drop his rifle. However, he had to carry on running towards his Lewis Gun, so to proceed, he shot him above the knee and in the ankle. Patch said, In November 2004, at the age of 106, Patch met Charles Kuentz, a 107-year-old Alsatian veteran, who had fought on the German side at Passchendaele (and served on the French side in World War II). Patch was quoted as saying: \\"I was a bit doubtful before meeting a German soldier. Herr Kuentz is a very nice gentleman however. He is all for a united Europe and peace – and so am I\\". Kuentz had brought along a tin of Alsatian biscuits and Patch gave him a bottle of Somerset cider in return. The meeting was featured in a 2005 BBC TV programme The Last Tommy, which told the stories of several of Britain's last World War I veterans. In December 2004, Patch was given a present of 106 bottles of Patch's Pride Cider, which has been named after him and produced by the Gaymer Cider Company. In the spring of 2005 he was interviewed by the Today programme, in which he said of the First World War: \\"Too many died. War isn't worth one life\\" and in July 2005, Patch voiced his outrage over plans to build a motorway in northern France over cemeteries of the First World War. In July 2007, marking the 90th anniversary of the beginning of the Battle of Passchendaele, Patch revisited the site of the battle in Flanders, to pay his respects to the fallen on both sides. He was accompanied by a historian, Richard van Emden. On this occasion, Patch described war as the \\"calculated and condoned slaughter of human beings\\" and said that \\"war isn't worth one life\\". In August 2007, Patch's autobiography The Last Fighting Tommy was published, making him one of the oldest authors ever.Daily Telegraph Review Section, 19 August 2007, p. 28 With the proceeds from this book, Patch decided to fund an Inshore Lifeboat for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and he attended the RNLI's Lifeboat College on 20 July 2007, to officially name the boat The Doris and Harry. In February 2008, the poet laureate of the United Kingdom, Andrew Motion, was commissioned by the BBC West television programme Inside Out West, to write a poem in Patch's honour. Entitled \\"The Five Acts of Harry Patch\\" it was first read at a special event at the Bishop's Palace in Wells, where it was introduced by the Prince of Wales and received by Harry Patch. In July 2008, Wells City Council conferred the freedom of the city of Wells on Patch. On 27 September 2008, in a private ceremony attended by a few people, Patch opened a memorial on the bank of the Steenbeek, at the point where he crossed the river in 1917. The memorial reads, In October 2008, Patch launched the 2008 Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal in Somerset. On 11 November 2008, marking the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I, together with fellow veterans Henry Allingham and Bill Stone, Patch laid a commemorative wreath for the Act of Remembrance at The Cenotaph in London, escorted by Victoria Cross recipient Johnson Beharry. On 9 November 2008, the Master of the Queen's Music, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, attended the world premiere of his choral work paying tribute to Patch. The piece sets words by the Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, and was performed at Portsmouth Cathedral by the London Mozart Players, the Portsmouth Grammar School chamber choir and the cathedral's choristers. The creation of the work was featured in A poem for Harry, a BBC West documentary that was subsequently repeated on BBC Four. The programme won a gold medal at the New York Festivals International Television Programming and Promotion Awards. On 18 July 2009, with the death of Henry Allingham, Patch became the oldest surviving veteran and also the oldest man in the United Kingdom. Patch was the last trench veteran of World War I. The penultimate Western Front veteran, the 108-year-old Fernand Goux of France, who died on 9 November 2008, fought for 8 days. He came out unscathed, unlike Patch and the last Alpine Front veteran, 110-year-old Delfino Borroni of Italy, who died on 26 October 2008. Patch was also the last surviving Tommy, since the death on 4 April 2009 of Netherwood Hughes, who was still in training when the war ended. The last-but-one fighting Tommy, Harold Lawton, died on 24 December 2005. Claude Choules, the last remaining First World War naval veteran, died on 5 May 2011.

Castro is the capital of the Chiloé Province in the Los Lagos Region. The city is located on Estero de Castro on the eastern coast of central Chiloé Island. This position provides Castro with a good access to the eastern islands of Chiloé Archipelago as well as to the open ocean through Cucao and Huillinco to the west.  History  Castro is Chile's third oldest city in continuous existence.Jorge Sánchez R.: Chiloé - tradición y cultura, p. 31. Santiago de Chile. Rodrigo de Quiroga as the temporary governor of Chile in 1567 launched a campaign led by his son in-law Captain Martín Ruiz de Gamboa to conquer Chiloé Island, establishing the city of Castro there, and subjugating its inhabitants, the Cuncos. From its founding on 12 February 1576 until 1767 Castro was the administrative centre of Chiloé Island. In 1594 Castro had 8,000 inhabitants most of whom were farmers.Dominique Verhasselt: Archipielago Chiloé - el encanto de una isla misteriosa, p.110. Santiago de Chile 2008. . Up to the middle of the 17th century the town was looted by Dutch pirates several times. In 1767, during the time of the Bourbon Reforms that sought to modernize the Spanish Empire, Chiloé was separated from the General Captaincy of Chile to which it had previously belonged and made a direct subject of the Viceroyalty of Peru. To ease the communications with Lima the capital of the archipelago was moved from Castro to Ancud in the same year. Even after the incorporation of Chiloé of into the Republic of Chile, Ancud remained the capital of the archipelago. Castro was destroyed by an earthquake in 1837 and had only 1,243 inhabitants in 1907. After the inauguration of the railway line to Ancud in 1912 the town developed better. Many buildings, including the railway station, town hall and many of the wooden palafitos houses, were destroyed or damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of 1960. In 1960, Castro had 7,000 inhabitants.Juan Mancilla Pérez: Pueblos de Chiloé, p. 42. Castro 2008 Only in 1982 did Castro regain its role as the capital of the Chiloé Archipelago. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Castro spans an area of and has 39,366 inhabitants (19,325 men and 20,041 women). Of these, 29,148 (74%) lived in urban areas and 10,218 (26%) in rural areas. The population grew by 31.5% (9,435 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Castro is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2012-2016 alcalde is Nelson Águila Serpa (PDC). Colourful palafitos in Castro Wharf in Gamboa Wooden chapel in Gamboa Plazuela del Tren park Nuestra Senora de Gracia in Nercón Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Castro is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Gabriel Ascencio (PDC) and Alejandro Santana (RN) as part of the 58th electoral district, (together with Ancud, Quemchi, Dalcahue, Curaco de Vélez, Quinchao, Puqueldón, Chonchi, Queilén, Quellón, Chaitén, Hualaihué, Futaleufú and Palena). The commune is represented in the Senate by Camilo Escalona Medina (PS) and Carlos Kuschel Silva (RN) as part of the 17th senatorial constituency (Los Lagos Region).  Sights  *Castro is famous for its palafitos, traditional wooden stilt houses which were common in many places in Chiloé. Some of them are preserved in the town district Gamboa in the west of the town in a bay called Fiordo de Castro. Boats are built in a traditional way in a wharf between the town center and Gamboa. In Gamboa there is an interesting wooden chapel as well. *Plaza de Armas, the central town square with its well-kept park, the Municipality and the church has always been the middle of Castro. The square is surrounded by many shops, banks, bars and restaurants. *The Regional Museum of Castro (Museo Regional de Castro) exhibits many objects made in Chiloé as well as samples of ethnography and archaeology. *The Museum of Modern Art of Chiloé (Museo de Arte Moderno de Chiloé) which was founded in 1988 houses an important collection of contemporary art. *A small park called Plazuela del Tren was laid out on the former railway yard close to the harbour. A locomotive and some other vehicles and machinery referring to the railway line to Ancud which was operated from 1912 to 1960 are exposed here.Jorge Sánchez R.: Chiloé - tradición y cultura, p. 33. Santiago de Chile. *In Nercón, a village which was incorporated into Castro in 2007, there is another sightworthy church which was declared World Heritage by the UNESCO: Nuestra Senora de Gracia was built 1886-90 of Nothofagus dombeyi wood, and a well-kept garden can be seen in front of it.Dominique Verhasselt: Archipielago Chiloé - el encanto de una isla misteriosa, p.34. Santiago de Chile. *A small chapel with ex-votoes can be seen between Nercón and Castro at the bridge over River Nercón near a small wharf where boats are produced of larch woodJuan Mancilla Pérez: Pueblos de Chiloé, p.44. Castro 2008 Colonial fort system During colonial times, Castro was the site of a small fort system made up of Fuerte de Castro, Batería marítima de Castro and Fortín de Tauco. The last fortification is not located in Castro proper but a few kilometers south along Estero de Castro. Only the remnants of Fortín de Tauco can be found at present, there are no known vestiges of the two fortifications that were located in what is now the city of Castro.  Traffic connections  The city is accessed by land by Route 5. From Castro nearly every village of Chiloé is easily accessible on a good paved road. There are good bus connections to most of the villages as well. The bus terminal is close to the central town square. Since November 2012, domestic flights connecting the Island with the rest of the country arrive to Mocopulli Airport four times a week. The railway line from Castro to Ancud was destroyed by the earthquake in 1960 and not rebuilt. Sports The city is home to Deportes Castro, 2012 champion of the Liga Nacional de Básquetbol de Chile. The team plays its home games in the Gimnasio Fiscal de Castro.

Description  Prova is a rule-based scripting system that is used for middleware. The language combines imperative and declarative programming by using a prolog syntax that allows calls to Java functions. In this way a strong Java code base is combined with Prolog features such as backtracking. Prova is derived from Mandarax, a Java-based inference system developed by Jens Dietrich. Prova extends Mandarax by providing a proper language syntax, native syntax integration with Java, agent messaging and reaction rules. The development of this language was supported by the grant provided within the EU projects GeneStream and BioGRID. In the project, the language is used as a rule-based backbone for distributed web applications in biomedical data integration, in particular, the GoPubMed system. The design goals of Prova: * Combine declarative and object-oriented programming. * Expose logic and agent behavior as rules. * Access data sources via wrappers written in Java or command-line shells like Perl. * Make the Java API of various packages accessible as rules. * Run within the Java runtime. * Enable rapid prototyping of applications. * Offer a rule-based platform for distributed agent programming. Prova aims to provide support for data integration tasks when the following is important: * Location transparency (local, remote, mirrors); * Format transparency (database, RDF, XML, HTML, flat files, computation resource); * Resilience to change (databases and web sites change often); * Use of open and open source technologies; * Understandability and modifiability by a non-IT specialist; * Economical knowledge representation; * Extensibility with additional functionality; * Leveraging ontologies. Prova has been used as the key service integration engine in the Xcalia product where it is used for computing efficient global execution plans across multiple data sources such as Web services, TP monitors transactions like CICS or IMS, messages of MOM like MQ-Series, packaged applications with a JCA connector, legacy data sources on mainframes with a JCA connector, remote EJB Java objects considered as data providers or even local Java objects. Prova allows to deliver an innovative software platform for Service-oriented architecture implementations.  References  # A. Kozlenkov and M. Schroeder.

It was listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1995. It is characterized by a unique dark green thorax and two yellow lateral stripes. Hine's emeralds measure 2.5 inches in length with a 3.3 inch wingspan. Populations exist in Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, and in Ontario, Canada. Individuals live for roughly two to four years, inhabiting wetlands, forests, and marshes. Major threats to the species include habitat loss and alteration.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Midwest Region Chicago Ecological Services Field Office. (2013). Hine's Emerald Dragonfly, Somatochlora hineana 5-Year Review: Summary and Evaluation. Retrieved from https://esadocs.defenders- cci.org/ESAdocs/five_year_review/doc4337.pdf Mobility between breeding sites is vital for the reproductive success of the species. Population fragmentation reduces current population sizes and increases the travel distance between sites. Habitat destruction and water contamination in marshes and wetlands also reduce the chance that the Hine's emerald survives.  Description  male The Hine's emerald's appearance varies across its lifetime. During the larval stage, nymphs possess no features that distinguish them from those of other dragonfly species. A mature nymph measures roughly 0.9 inches in length. Several characteristics distinguish adult Hine's emeralds from other dragonfly species. An adult Hine's emerald has a distinctive dark-green thorax with two yellow lateral stripes. Hine's emeralds also have uniquely shaped male and female reproductive structures. A Hine's emerald's eyes are brown during the first 1–3 days of adulthood. After the third day, the Hine's emerald's eyes take on an emerald green color. Their wings remain clear with amber coloring at the base until the ends of their lives, at which point they become smoky in color. The average mature Hine's emerald measures 2.5 inches in length and has a wingspan of 3.5 inches. On average, female dragonflies are slightly longer than males. For a further visual representation of adults, refer to figure 2.  Life history  During their lifespans, Hine's emeralds progress through the egg stage, larval stage, and adult stage.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2001. Hine’s Emerald Dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana) Recovery Plan. Fort Snelling, MN. 120 p. Retrieved from https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/hedplan.pdf Both the egg and larval stages are aquatic. Hine's emeralds spend the majority of this lifespans in the larval stage. This stage lasts 2–4 years. The specific length of this stage varies with food supply, water depth, and temperature. While in this stage, Hine's emerald nymphs live within streamlets and mature by undergoing a series of molts. A mature larvae transitions into the adult stage by climbing up onto a cattail and completing a final molt. During this molt, the nymph’s skin splits longitudinally along its body. The adult then sheds this dead skin and emerges into the wild. Nymphs typically emerge into the wild during June and July.Cuthrell, D.L. 1999. Special animal abstract for Somatochlora hineana (Hine’s emerald dragonfly). Michigan Natural Features Inventory, Lansing, MI. 3 pp. Male and female nymphs appear to progress into the adult stage in equal proportions. The following 4-6 week long adult stage consists of three sub- stages. These stages are the pre-reproductive stage, reproductive stage, and post-reproductive stage. Adults spend these stages hunting for prey, establishing territories, and reproducing. Overall, Hine’s emerald dragonflies live for 2–4 years. = Reproduction = Before reproduction can occur, a male must first establish a territory. These territories range from 2–4 meters in area and sit close to bodies of water. Male dragonflies patrol these areas and defend them from dragonflies of both their own and other species. Females initiate mating by flying into a male’s territory. A male responds to this behavior by chasing after the female. Once the male reaches the female, he latches onto her body. The two then fly to nearby shrubs, and copulation begins. Post-copulation, the female repeatedly dips her abdomen into shallow water. In doing so, she deposits her fertilized eggs. Hine’s emeralds reproduce once and die shortly thereafter. Hine's emeralds reproduce during the months of June, July, and August. = Diet and feeding behaviors = Hine's emeralds are carnivorous during both the larval and adult stages of their lives. Adult Hine's emeralds feed upon small flying insects such as mosquitoes and gnats. Adults usually forage for their prey while in-flight and appear to favor foraging along forest edges. These forest edges typically run alongside roads. During the pre-reproductive stage, these flights last 1–3 minutes. During the reproductive stage, these flights last up to 15 minutes. Reproductive adults may fly up to 1.2 miles during these flights. At times, reproductive adults also forage in large swarms. Hunting in these swarms may protect dragonflies from predators. Nymphs are nocturnal feeders and prey upon other aquatic larvae, such as those belonging to mosquitoes or mayflies Researchers suspect that nymphs prey upon different species throughout their development. While hunting, nymphs remain still and wait for prey to approach them.  Distribution and habitat  Hine's emeralds occupy wetland, pond and pool, wet meadow, forest, and marsh habitats. A few important characteristics are common to typical Hine's emerald habitats. First, Hine's emerald habitats include slow-moving, mineralized streams. Second, they have both open and wooded areas. Open areas provide space for foraging. Wooded areas provide space for resting. Third, they include crayfish burrows, which nymphs use for shelter. Fourth, typical habitats possess exposed or lightly covered bedrock. Finally, they provide pathways for Hine's emerald dispersal. Roadways, forest clearings, streams, and railroads all serve as dispersal pathways. Other characteristics of Hine's emerald habitats, such as vegetation, vary between regions. The Hine's emerald's current range includes parts of the United States and Canada. Within the United States, the Hine's emerald's range includes Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin. Within Canada, the Hine's emerald's range includes parts of Ontario. The Hine's emerald historically also occupied parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Alabama. Due to habitat modification, the Hine's emerald likely no longer live in these states. Whether the Hine's emerald once lived in parts of other states is currently unknown. Hine’s emerald dragonflies were first described in 1931 near Indian Lake in Logan County, Ohio. The IUCN Red List states that there are 47 known locations where Hine's emeralds are present. This includes Ontario, Canada, and Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. (n.d.). Environmental Conservation Online System: Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana). Retrieved April 2, 2020, from https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?sId=7877 Populations at one point also existed in Ohio, Alabama, and Indiana, though there have been no recent sightings.  Ecology  Several species prey upon the Hine's emeralds. Crayfish, turtles, amphibians, and other aquatic species prey upon nymphs. Spiders, frogs, birds, and large dragonflies prey upon adults. Some of these predator/prey relationships may benefit the Hine's emeralds. A 2006 paper suggests that devil crayfish positively affect their Hine's emerald nymph prey. As Hine's emerald habitats dry up in late summer, crayfish burrows remain wet. In inhabiting these burrows, nymphs increase their chances of survival during droughts. It is unknown whether the Hine's emeralds have similar mutually beneficial relationships with other species.  Population size  Not much information exists about historical population size for HED. But, the IUCN Red List states that current populations are stable. They estimate that there are over 30,000 individuals globally. The Door County, Wisconsin population is the biggest and most significant as of 2013. As many as 20,000 individuals are in this population. There are two recovery units in the United States: the Northern Recovery Unit and the Southern Recovery Unit. The Northern Recovery Unit has two populations: Northern Wisconsin and Michigan. The Southern Recovery Unit has four populations. This includes Ozaukee County Wisconsin, Southwest Wisconsin, Illinois, and Missouri. Populations are unique when separated by large distances of at least 30 miles. There must be a low chance of genetic exchange between them. These six populations are made of 27 sub-populations. Thus, there are 69 total sites for Hine's emerald presence. Thirty-five of these sites are fully protected and 21 are partially protected. Eleven sites are not protected, and the remaining two have unknown statuses of legal protection. Information is missing on the number of breeding adults for many of the sub-populations. This makes it difficult to assess progress in conservation efforts. The 2013 Five Year Review suggests future actions that aid conservation efforts. This includes modeling Hine's emerald population dynamics, a high priority. Additionally, more information about key measures of population demographics is required. Areas of research include smallest possible population sizes and current population sizes. Also, the genetic diversity between populations is important to study. Restoring Hine's emeralds to lasting population sizes allows the ESA to downgrade the species from endangered to threatened. To do this, however, up-to-date population data is crucial.  Conservation  = Conservation status = Hine's emerald dragonfly was first proposed as an endangered species in October, 1993.Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service. (1993). Endangered and ThreatenedWildlife and Plants; Proposed Rule To List the Hine’s Emerald Dragonfly as Endangered. Federal Register, 58(190). Retrieved from https://esadocs.defenders- cci.org/ESAdocs/federal_register/fr2428.pdf The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service cited three main reasons why Hine's emerald warrants federal protection. Fragmented habitats and small, highly-distributed populations were significant concerns. By January 1995, Hine's emerald was officially added to the ESA and listed as an endangered species. Last assessed in 2008, the Hine's emerald dragonfly was the only dragonfly species included in the Endangered Species Act.U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. (2008). Recovering Threatened and Endangered Species, Fiscal Years 2005-2006. Retrieved from https://esadocs.defenders- cci.org/ESAdocs/misc/summary_2005-6Recovery.pdf The Recovery Plan by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was published in 2001. Its ultimate recovery goal is “[restoring the dragonfly] to viable populations”. The plan established the Northern Recovery Unit and Southern Recovery Unit. To be downgraded in the Endangered Species Act, certain criteria must be met. Each Recovery Unit must contain at least three subpopulations with 500 reproducing adults for at least 10 years. Additionally, there must be two breeding sites per subpopulation. These areas must have federally protected habitat. In the Recovery Plan, the Fish and Wildlife Service suggests various ideas to increase Hine's emerald survivorship. This includes watershed protection and deed restrictions. Land acquisition and nature preserve creation are also potential ways to protect the species. The Fish and Wildlife Service details the importance of managing existing populations and researching demographic changes. To do this, there must be searches for undiscovered Hine's emerald populations as well as organized education programs. Additionally, the Recovery Plan outlines the importance of protecting and maintaining known populations and habitats. Augmentation programs and evaluations of recovery progress must be conducted. The Recovery Plan's objective is clear: \\"assure the long-term viability by arresting or reversing the decline of Hine's emerald populations and addressing its threats to survival\\". In the Five Year Review conducted in 2013, four major criteria for reclassification are listed. First, each Recovery Unit must meet the population requirements as specified in the initial Recovery Plan. At the time of publishing, some populations in the Northern Recovery Unit exceed this. No populations in the Southern Recovery Unit meet this goal. Only one population in the Southern Recovery Unit was quantified at time of publication. Second, there must be at least 2 breeding habitats per subpopulation. Each breeding habitat must be fed by different water sources. As of 2013, this criterion has not been met, and only 12 of 27 subpopulations have more than one breeding site. Third, the habitat to support subpopulations must be formally protected and managed. This includes control of invasive species and restoration of local water sources. Actions to minimize vehicle presence are also suggested. Lastly, the Review requires the creation of a monitoring plan for each population. This must include annual population estimates. This final criterion has not been met due to lack of knowledge of breeding and habitat structure. Many regions are lacking resources needed to evaluate population sites. Hine's emerald dragonfly was last assessed by the IUCN Red List on June 8, 2018. At this point, it was listed as Least Concern. This contradicts the ESA’s older classification of Endangered. = Critical habitat = The current critical habitat for Hine's emeralds contains 26,531 acres of land.Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. (2010). Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Revised Critical Habitat for Hine’s Emerald Dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana) . Federal Register, 75(78). Retrieved from https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-04-23/pdf/2010-8808.pdf#page=1 This land is concentrated in various counties in Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Expected costs for protection range from $10.5 million to $25.2 million over 20 years when adjusted. This version of the critical habitat ruling was finalized in 2010. However, this ruling differs significantly from the initial proposal and the first critical habitat ruling.

At that time, the major threats to the species were habitat loss/alteration and contamination. Hine’s emerald dragonflies inhabit marsh and wetland habitats, which are already rare. Further loss of habitat would disrupt the surviving populations of the species. The recovery plan explains the habitat loss. Industrial, agricultural, and commercial development caused the most damage. This damage contributed to the decline of the species. A 5-year review was completed in 2013. It includes more recent evaluations of the threats to Hine's emerald populations. It includes a table (pp. 27–29) which details the threats present at each of the Hine’s emerald dragonfly sites. There are a few common threats between sites. These threats are fragmentation, changes to water flow, contaminants, vehicle mortality, and invasive animals and plants.  Fragmentation  Hine's emerald dragonfly populations are susceptible to habitat fragmentation. As of 2012, studies were being conducted to investigate barriers to Hine's emerald movement, such as roads and bridges. They studied how these barriers can influence the flight behavior and dispersal ability of the dragonflies. If Hine's emeralds are unable to disperse properly it may lead to isolated populations of lower population size. Poor dispersal also reduces genetic diversity, and low genetic diversity will make the Hine's emeralds more vulnerable to other threats they face.  Invasive animals  Invasive animal species pose a threat to Hine's emerald habitats. Beavers, feral hogs, and armadillos are the major potential threats. They can contribute to Hine's emerald habitat destruction. Beaver dams have the potential to flood the wetlands of Hine's emerald populations. When feral hogs forage for food, they have the potential to damage Hine's emerald habitats. As of 2013, feral hogs were only considered a threat in Missouri. However, their populations have grown in other states with Hine's emerald populations. Lastly, nine-banded armadillos also impact Hine's emerald habitats when they forage. Armadillos dig up soil looking for insect larvae and forage in burrows as well. The impact of armadillos on Hine's emerald habitats will require monitoring as the armadillo’s range continues to expand.  Invasive plants  Invasive plants have the potential to affect Hine's emerald habitats, behaviors, movements, and breeding. The invasion of woody vegetation and cattails into Hine's emerald habitats could affect adult flight behaviors. Invasive woody species can decrease the amount of subsurface water.Parish, G. and J. Sellar. 2006 Thirsty Plants Dry Soil: Changes in Soil Moisture Content After the Removal of Invasive Species. Chicago Wilderness Journal: Best Practices in Conservation and Restoration. Vol. 4, No. 2, pp. 11-17. https://northbranchrestoration.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/08/CWJournal-Vol-4-2.pdf This is a vital component of Hine's emerald larval habitats. The invasion of species like the common reed may decrease crayfish populations. Thus, decreasing the number of crayfish burrows that are a place of refuge for Hine's emerald larvae.  Human impact  Humans can impact Hine’s emerald dragonflies in a variety of ways. Most human impact involves habitat destruction/alteration. Reduction in habitat area fragments populations. Quarrying, filling wetlands, and creating landfills are examples of harmful human actions. Contamination is another way humans can harm Hine's emerald populations. Landfills have the potential to leach harmful chemicals and contaminate surface and groundwater. Both surface and groundwater are critical to Hine's emeralds in the larval stage. Recreational activities and agriculture may also impact Hine's emerald populations. The insecticides, herbicides, and fertilizers used in these practices could harm Hine's emerald populations. Fertilizers may lead to changes in Hine's emerald habitats that could impact the species. = Conservation efforts = Hine's emerald is listed on the Federal list of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. This means that the species is protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). Hine's emerald is also listed as endangered in Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Michigan. This provides the species with State level protections and Federal protections. = Habitat protection = Many agencies help protect Hine's emerald habitats. State and County agencies protect the habitats of three subpopulations in Illinois. The University of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) help protect Hine's emerald habitats. They protect the habitat of the population in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin. The WDNR also protects the habitat of the population in Southwest Wisconsin. The U.S. Forest Service or Missouri Department of Conservation protects Hine's emerald habitats in Missouri. These agencies protect most of the habitats for two of the Missouri subpopulations. State and Federal agencies protect habitats in the Northern Recovery Unit. They protect the habitats of five out of the 16 subpopulations. = Groundwater recharge = Groundwater recharge areas make an important contribution to Hine's emerald habitats. Researchers have worked to outline the areas that contribute to many Hine's emerald habitats. However, they have not mapped recharge areas for all Hine's emerald habitat sites yet. More research is necessary to identify recharge areas for all Hine's emerald sites. Sections 7 and 9 of the ESA protect all identified groundwater recharge areas. The Illinois Natural Areas Preservation Act protects identified areas in Illinois.  References   External links  * Hine's Emerald Dragonfly.

Such a fuel has been called grassoline. Main processes According to a study done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy, the United States can produce at least 1.3 billion tons of cellulosic biomass each year without decreasing the amount of biomass needed for our food, animal feed, or exports. =Fischer–Tropsch process= The Fischer–Tropsch process is used to produce synfuels from gasified biomass. Carbonaceous material is gasified and the gas is processed to make purified syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen). The Fischer–Tropsch polymerizes syngas into diesel-range hydrocarbons. While biodiesel and bio-ethanol production so far only use parts of a plant, i.e. oil, sugar, starch or cellulose, BtL production can gasify and utilize the entire plant. =Flash pyrolysis= Flash pyrolysis—producing bio-oil (pyrolysis oil), char and gas at temperatures between 350–550 °C and residence times < 1 second (also called anhydrous pyrolysis). = Catalytic fast pyrolysis = Catalytic fast pyrolysis is a fast process in which the cellulose is broken down to a liquid biofuel. In this approach the cellulose is heated to 500 degrees Celsius in less than one second in a chamber to break apart the oxygen molecules. The catalyst forms chemical reactions that remove oxygen bonds and form carbon rings. After the reaction takes place gasoline is formed along with water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. = AFEX treatment = The Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX) pre-treat process, hot concentrated 15 M ammonia is used to break down sugar molecules, cellulose and hemicellulose significantly more efficiently than enzymes. After, the rapid pressure release cools and ends the treatment. The result is minor biomass degradation with high yields. The process was patented by Bruce Dale, Michigan State University professor. AFEX is generally done in one step, making it more efficient than other processes. :AFEX Process Conditions * Pressure: 20–30 atm * Temperature: 70–140 C * Residence time: 5–10 minutes * Ammonia: biomass loading: 0.3 – 2.0 to 1 w/w * Water: biomass content: 0.2 – 2.5 to 1 w/w =Catalytic depolymerization= Catalytic depolymerization is the use of heat and catalysts to separate usable diesel fuel from hydrocarbon wastes. = Regional Biomass Processing Center = Regional Biomass Processing Center is a conceptual place where the AFEX treated biomass can go to biorefineries, farms and forests, and animal feeders. This will improve the value of cellulosic biomass for animals and biofuel production. This will reduce the density of the biomass for easier transport, simplify contract issues, and increase the land use for biofuels The process uses the whole plant to improve the carbon dioxide balance and increase yield. Potential energy grasses Plant material is cheaper than oil on both energy and mass basis and certain plant material have potential to be energy grasses. = Switchgrass = Switchgrass is a bunch grass native to North America that grow naturally under warm weather with wide adaptation capability and easy germination, allowing the switchgrass to grow quicker; however, it has a low relative yield compared to other energy crops = Sorghum = Sorghum are cultivated in warmer climates, mostly in the tropical regions. Sorghum has the potential to be an energy grass because it requires low water usage and can make a large yield. Sorghum, however, has an annual cultivation and is difficult to establish to an area and requires a lot of input from fertilizers and pesticides. = Miscanthus = Miscanthus are native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southern Asia. Miscanthus can grow up to 3.5 meters and has been trialed as a biofuel since the 1980s. The benefits of using miscanthus is it can live more than two years and requires low input eliminating the need for extra irrigation, fertilizer and pesticides. The problems with miscanthus arise from the time it takes to establish to an area. Grassoline Grassoline is a term coined in 1991 by Matthew Scoggins, a graduate student of Bruce Dale, to capture the idea of taking plant material and converting it into oil.  Cost of change  The cost for petroleum to change to grassoline would depend on how fast the use of grassoline grows. Change will also be needed in automobiles to be compatible with grassoline. UC Berkeley's Somerville (professor of alternative energy) estimates that a large investment over $325 billion will be needed to build biofactories that can produce the 65 billion gallons of biofuel needed to meet 2030 national goals.

Methane-rich gases are converted into liquid synthetic fuels. Two general strategies exist: (i) direct partial combustion of methane to methanol and (ii) Fischer–Tropsch- like processes that convert carbon monoxide and hydrogen into hydrocarbons. Strategy ii is followed by diverse methods to convert the hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixtures to liquids. Direct partial combustion has been demonstrated in nature but not replicated commercially. Technologies reliant on partial combustion have been commercialized mainly in regions where natural gas is inexpensive. The motivation for GTL is to produce liquid fuels, which are more readily transported than methane. Methane must be cooled below its critical temperature of -82.3 °C in order to be liquified under pressure. Because of the associated cryogenic apparatus, LNG tankers are used for transport. Methanol is a conveniently handled combustible liquid, but its energy density is half of that of gasoline.https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/fuel_properties.php Fischer–Tropsch process GTL process using the Fischer Tropsch method The Fischer–Tropsch process starts with partial oxidation of methane (natural gas) to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen gas and water. The ratio of carbon monoxide to hydrogen is adjusted using the water gas shift reaction, while the excess carbon dioxide is removed. Removing the water yields synthesis gas (syngas). Syngas is allowed to react over an iron or cobalt catalyst to produce liquid hydrocarbons, including alcohols. Methane to methanol process Methanol is made from methane (natural gas) in a series of three reactions: ;Steam reforming :CH4 \\\\+ H2O → CO + 3 H2 ΔrH = +206 kJ mol−1 ;Water shift reaction :CO + H2O → CO2 \\\\+ H2 ΔrH = -41 kJ mol−1 ;Synthesis :2 H2 \\\\+ CO → CH3OH ΔrH = -92 kJ mol−1 The methanol thus formed may be converted to gasoline by the Mobil process and methanol-to-olefins. Methanol to gasoline (MTG) and methanol to olefins In the early 1970s, Mobil developed an alternative procedure in which natural gas is converted to syngas, and then methanol. The methanol reacts in the presence of a zeolite catalyst to form alkanes. In terms of mechanism, methanol is partially dehydrated to give dimethyl ether: :2 CH3OH → CH3OCH3 \\\\+ H2O The mixture of dimethyl ether and methanol is then further dehydrated over a zeolite catalyst such as ZSM-5, which in practice is polymerized and hydrogenated to give a gasoline with hydrocarbons of five or more carbon atoms making up 80% of the fuel by weight. The Mobile MTG process is no longer practiced. A more modern implementation of MTG is the Topsøe integrated gasoline synthesis (TIGS). Methanol can be converted to olefins using zeolite and SAPO-based heterogeneous catalysts. Depending on the catalyst pore size, this process can afford either C2 or C3 products, which are important monomers. Syngas to gasoline plus process (STG+) The STG+ Process A third gas-to-liquids process builds on the MTG technology by converting natural gas-derived syngas into drop-in gasoline and jet fuel via a thermochemical single-loop process.LaMonica, Martin. Natural Gas Tapped as Bridge to Biofuels MIT Technology Review, 27 June 2012. Retrieved: 7 March 2013. The STG+ process follows four principal steps in one continuous process loop. This process consists of four fixed bed reactors in series in which a syngas is converted to synthetic fuels. The steps for producing high-octane synthetic gasoline are as follows:Introduction to Primus' STG+ Technology Primus Green Energy, undated. Retrieved: 5 March 2013. # Methanol Synthesis: Syngas is fed to Reactor 1, the first of four reactors, which converts most of the syngas (CO and ) to methanol () when passing through the catalyst bed. # Dimethyl Ether (DME) Synthesis: The methanol-rich gas from Reactor 1 is next fed to Reactor 2, the second STG+ reactor. The methanol is exposed to a catalyst and much of it is converted to DME, which involves a dehydration from methanol to form DME (). # Gasoline synthesis: The Reactor 2 product gas is next fed to Reactor 3, the third reactor containing the catalyst for conversion of DME to hydrocarbons including paraffins (alkanes), aromatics, naphthenes (cycloalkanes) and small amounts of olefins (alkenes), mostly from (number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule) to . # Gasoline Treatment: The fourth reactor provides transalkylation and hydrogenation treatment to the products coming from Reactor 3. The treatment reduces durene (tetramethylbenzene)/isodurene and trimethylbenzene components that have high freezing points and must be minimized in gasoline. As a result, the synthetic gasoline product has high octane and desirable viscometric properties. # Separator: Finally, the mixture from Reactor 4 is condensed to obtain gasoline. The non-condensed gas and gasoline are separated in a conventional condenser/separator. Most of the non-condensed gas from the product separator becomes recycled gas and is sent back to the feed stream to Reactor 1, leaving the synthetic gasoline product composed of paraffins, aromatics and naphthenes. Biological gas-to-liquids (Bio-GTL) With methane as the predominant target for GTL, much attention has focused on the three enzymes that process methane. These enzymes support the existence of methanotrophs, microorganisms that metabolize methane as their only source of carbon and energy. Aerobic methanotrophs harbor enzymes that oxygenate methane to methanol. The relevant enzymes are methane monooxygenases, which are found both in soluble and particulate (i.e. membrane-bound) varieties. They catalyze the oxygenation according to the following stoichiometry: :CH4 \\\\+ O2 \\\\+ NADPH + H+ → CH3OH + H2O + NAD+ Anaerobic methanotrophs rely on the bioconversion of methane using the enzymes called methyl-coenzyme M reductases. These organisms effect reverse methanogenesis. Strenuous efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanisms of these methane-converting enzymes, which would enable their catalysis to be replicated in vitro. Biodiesel can be made from using the microbes Moorella thermoacetica and Yarrowia lipolytica. This process is known as biological gas-to-liquids.Microbes paired for biological gas-to-liquids (Bio-GTL) process Commercial uses INFRA M100 GTL PlantUsing gas-to-liquids processes, refineries can convert some of their gaseous waste products (flare gas) into valuable fuel oils, which can be sold as is or blended only with diesel fuel. The World Bank estimates that over of natural gas are flared or vented annually, an amount worth approximately $30.6 billion, equivalent to 25% of the United States' gas consumption or 30% of the European Union's annual gas consumption,World Bank, GGFR Partners Unlock Value of Wasted Gas\\", World Bank 14 December 2009. Retrieved 17 March 2010. a resource that could be useful using GTL. Gas-to-liquids processes may also be used for the economic extraction of gas deposits in locations where it is not economical to build a pipeline. This process will be increasingly significant as crude oil resources are depleted. Royal Dutch Shell produces a diesel from natural gas in a factory in Bintulu, Malaysia. Another Shell GTL facility is the Pearl GTL plant in Qatar, the world's largest GTL facility. SASOL has recently built the Oryx GTL facility in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar and together with Uzbekneftegaz and Petronas builds the Uzbekistan GTL plant. Chevron Corporation, in a joint venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation is commissioning the Escravos GTL in Nigeria, which uses Sasol technology. =Aspirational and emerging ventures= New generation of GTL technology is being pursued for the conversion of unconventional, remote and problem gas into valuable liquid fuels.http://gasprocessingnews.com/features/201706/smaller-scale-and-modular- technologies-drive-gtl-industry-forward.aspx GTL plants based on innovative Fischer–Tropsch catalysts have been built by INFRA Technology.

Economics of GTL GTL using natural gas is more economical when there is wide gap between the prevailing natural gas price and crude oil price on a Barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) basis. A coefficient of 0.1724 results in full oil parity. GTL is a mechanism to bring down the diesel/gasoline/crude oil international prices at par with the natural gas price in an expanding global natural gas production at cheaper than crude oil price. When natural gas is converted in to GTL, the liquid products are easier to export at cheaper price rather than converting in to LNG and further conversion to liquid products in an importing country. However, GTL fuels are much more expensive to produce than conventional fuels.Qatar Airways Flies Plane With New Fuel, The Wall Street Journal, Wednesday, October 14, 2009, p.B2 See also * Biomass to liquid * Carbon- neutral fuel * Coal to liquid  Bibliography  * Boogaard, P.

After Quigley's retirement, the company became Merrill Heatter Productions.  History  On many of Heatter-Quigley's most popular game shows, beginning with Video Village, a key element of the game was enlarged, and in some instances the entire game itself was magnified to larger than life. * Video Village (later Shenanigans) employed a huge \\"living board game\\" motif that used contestants as tokens. (The popular late 1970s Canadian game show Mad Dash is similar to Video Village.) * The Hollywood Squares featured a massive tic-tac-toe board * High Rollers used an extra large pair of dice in a game similar to \\"Shut the Box\\" * Gambit had a large deck of playing cards in a game of blackjack * The Magnificent Marble Machine featured a gigantic pinball machine * Hot Seat used an oversized lie detector In 1965, Heatter and Quigley created and aired a pilot episode of Hollywood Squares hosted by Bert Parks. The show was rejected by CBS, but when NBC acquired broadcasting rights Heatter and Quigley sold the show to Filmways television. (Peter Marshall became the host of The Hollywood Squares.) In 1981, Quigley retired and ended his partnership with Merrill Heatter just before Filmways was bought by Orion Pictures. Quigley died in 1989. Heatter continued solo and produced new game shows, such as Battlestars, All-Star Blitz, Bargain Hunters, and the 1980s version of High Rollers. On September 28, 1998, Heatter leased the worldwide rights to his solo-developed game shows to King World for a limited time.King World International Acquires Exclusive International Format Rights to Game Show Catalogue From Merrill Heatter Productions, Inc., prnewswire.co.uk That option has now expired. CBS Television Distribution owns the rights to Hollywood Squares today, via CBS's acquisition of King World Productions in 2000. MGM Television acquired the rights from Orion Television to Heatter-Quigley shows with the exception of Hollywood Squares (which currently owned by CBS Television Distribution and Fremantle) and Wacky Races (which currently owned by Warner Bros. Television Distribution (via Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. Animation)). Orion had sold those rights to King World Productions after Orion closed its television division on November 25, 1991. Today, the rest of the Heatter-Quigley library are owned by MGM Television's subsidiary, Orion Television. In 2008, Heatter returned to game show production with the GSN game show Catch 21, based on Gambit. Heatter is co-executive producer with another veteran producer, Scott Sternberg. Heatter died of cancer on October 8, 2017.

Many hosts would become famous for the shows they did for HQ. Peter Marshall became most famous for The Hollywood Squares, Wink Martindale would have his first big hit with Gambit, and Alex Trebek would see his first hit in America (after a long run with Reach for the Top in his native Canada) with High Rollers.

A \\"Baxter\\", as defined by the film, is the nice, dull guy in a romantic comedy who is dumped at the end of the story for the protagonist. Much light humor is made of showing Showalter as a \\"Baxter\\" in several typical romantic comedy clichés; for instance, he is shown being left at the altar as a former love is claimed by her high school sweetheart, and being left in college at a pep rally for an underdog sports hero. The plot revolves around the life of Elliot Sherman during the two weeks before his wedding, as he doggedly fights off the curse of his former Baxter role in relationships. IFC Films financed the film and produced it with Plum Pictures. They gave the film a very limited release; it had a U.S. box office gross of $181,872. Plot Elliot, a tax accountant from Brooklyn, is a dependable though thoroughly average young man doomed to be the \\"Baxter\\", the nice guy who's bound to lose the girl to the leading man in romantic comedies. Losing three girlfriends to last-minute rekindled relationships with their ex- boyfriends has made Elliot wary of being abandoned yet again. About a week before his wedding to his girlfriend, Caroline Swann, Elliot discovers that her high school beau, Bradley, is back in town. Elliot tries to keep himself composed, but even Caroline's reassurances do not convince him that her feelings for Bradley are buried. In the meantime, Elliot meets Cecil, his temporary secretary at his accounting firm. As he resigns himself to losing Caroline to Bradley, Cecil offers him a ray of hope: she does not believe in \\"Baxters\\" and thinks that his predicament is avoidable. The two meet up again later that night at a small club where Cecil performs her original songs, and Cecil tells Elliot he needs to take more risks. When Cecil has a fight with her unsupportive boyfriend Dan, Elliot offers to put her up for the night. The next morning, Caroline shows up early with their wedding planner to finalize their plans. Elliot panics due to Cecil's hidden presence and during the meeting makes a string of awkward suggestions, upsetting Caroline, who begins to doubt his commitment to their relationship, to the point of calling off the wedding. While out to a bar with his friends from work, Elliot accidentally runs into Dan, who recognizes him as Cecil's \\"Baxter\\" friend. Dan is there to meet with Sonya, who's Bradley's current girlfriend and Dan's old college friend. They all decide to sit together, much to Elliot's chagrin. Both Dan and Bradley laugh and joke with Elliot's friends, until one of them mentions that Caroline left him. Depressed and upset, Elliot leaves and contemplates suicide but he's interrupted by Caroline's brother-in-law, Louis (David Wain), who tells him Caroline is willing to give their engagement another chance. Elliot plans a romantic dinner with Caroline, but finds her with an anguished Bradley, who just broke up with Sonya and is back flirting with Caroline. Caroline convinces Elliot to take Bradley out with them. They cancel Elliot's reservations to an expensive restaurant and go instead to a burger place that Bradley knows well. Elliot feels out-of-place and eventually calls Cecil from the back of the restaurant, confessing that he feels that his marriage will be over before it begins. The next day, Elliot arrives at work to find that Cecil is his temp again. When she proposes to go have a drink together, Elliot explains that after his phone call, the night actually got better for him. As Caroline accused Elliot of being unromantic, he stood up for himself and accepted to go dance with her and Bradley, actually impressing Caroline with his moves. Bradley shows off his breakdance routines, accidentally hitting Elliot in the face, to Caroline's concerns. Bradley apologizes and reveals that he will leave the next morning to Malta for his work as a geode student. Though happy for him, Cecil is saddened by the news because of her growing feelings for Elliot. She mentions that Dan is moving to Cincinnati and she's going to follow him there, to Elliot's discomfort. At Caroline and Elliot's wedding, Bradley crashes the ceremony and declares his love for Caroline, a split second after Elliot was going to voice his own objection. Caroline finally gives in and kisses Bradley passionately in front of the whole church. Elliot takes off immediately to catch Cecil before she leaves town, and finds her at her apartment right while Dan is leaving. Elliot declares his love for her, and chases off an old friend of hers who suddenly showed up. Later, they perform together at the same club where they had their first date, with Cecil singing one of her songs and Elliot playing the piano to back her up. In a mid-credits scene, Dan reflects in narration on his own status as a Baxter, having just lost the girl to the leading man. Cast Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 32% based on reviews from 75 critics, with an average score of 5.05/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"The Baxter is good-natured, but there are simply not enough laughs to fuel this comedy.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote: \\"The problem with The Baxter is right there at the center of the movie, and maybe it is unavoidable: Showalter makes too good of a baxter. He deserves to be dumped.\\" John Anderson of Variety magazine wrote: \\"Showalter pushes too far: Nerdiness, after all, can be only so attractive.\\" References External links * * Category:2005 films Category:2005 romantic comedy films Category:American independent films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Michael Showalter Category:Films set in Brooklyn Category:Films shot in New York City Category:American satirical films Category:Stock characters Category:Films scored by Theodore Shapiro Category:2005 directorial debut films Category:2005 comedy films Category:2005 independent films ","title":"The Baxter"},{"id":"2555550","text":"Gravir (), is a village on the shore of Loch Odhairn (a sea loch) in the Park district of the Isle of Lewis. Gravir is within the parish of Lochs. There is a Free Church, a school and a voluntary fire station in the village. There is also a pier. Most of the plots of land used to be used for crofting, but this has declined in the last 50 years. The road leading to the village is the B8060, and continues on to Orinsay and Lemreway. Economy Gravir Pier is primarily used by fish farming vessels but is also used by small fishing and leisure craft. The fish farm located in Loch Odhairn is operated by the Scottish Salmon Company. In March 2007, Scottish and Southern Energy proposed to build a converter station above the village and to use Gravir as the Western Isles landfall for a sub-sea interconnector cable, to export electricity generated from two proposed large scale windfarms at Eishken and Pairc across the Minch to mainland markets. The cable would run north of the Shiant bank and land at Little Lochbroom. On the Lewis side, it would enter the mouth of Loch Odhairn at the fish farm and run up the length of the sealoch under the shore at its head, by the old schoolhouse, and then be buried across crofts to the hilltop to the converter station. One network of overhead lines or pylons would run to the planned Pairc windfarm and to Eishken. Another run of overhead lines on wooden poles would leave Gravir by following the village road heading for the sub-station by the River Creed. The proposed interconnector coming into Gravir has been placed on hold due to public objection to the proposals. Mr Openheim of Eisken estate, is happy for the interconnector to go directly into his estate via a more southerly sea loch should it ever be required in the future.

Ligeti wrote: > I present my artistic credo in the Piano Concerto: I demonstrate my > independence from criteria of the traditional avantgarde, as well as the > fashionable postmodernism. Musical illusions which I consider to be also so > important are not a goal in itself for me, but a foundation for my > aesthetical attitude. I prefer musical forms which have a more object-like > than processual character. Music as \\"frozen\\" time, as an object in imaginary > space evoked by music in our imagination, as a creation which really > develops in time, but in imagination it exists simultaneously in all its > moments. The spell of time, the enduring its passing by, closing it in a > moment of the present is my main intention as a composer. It is dedicated to the American conductor Mario di Bonaventura who premiered the work.  History  Initial sketches of the Concerto began in 1980, but it was not until 1985 that he found a way forward and the work proceeded more quickly. In his book on Ligeti, Richard Steinitz documents the composer's many attempts to begin the piece, noting that it was not until the twenty-first attempt, dated 1985–1986, that he gets the first page right. The first three movements were premiered in Graz, Austria on October 23, 1986 by pianist Anthony di Bonaventura and the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Mario di Bonaventura.Steinitz, p. 321. The following year, Ligeti added another two movements, the fourth and fifth, and the final autograph of the last movement was ready in January 1988. Ligeti wrote that “[a]fter hearing the work twice [in 1986], I came to the conclusion that the third movement is not an adequate finale; my feeling of form demanded continuation, a supplement.” The five- movement concerto was premiered on February 29, 1988 with Anthony di Bonaventura and the Austrian Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mario di Bonaventura in the Vienna Konzerthaus.  Instrumentation  The concerto is scored for solo piano and an orchestra consisting of flute (doubling piccolo), oboe, clarinet (doubling alto ocarina), bassoon, horn, trumpet, tenor trombone, percussion, and strings. For balance, Ligeti recommends the strings to be 6–8 violin I's, 6–8 violin II's, 4–6 violas, 4–6 cellos, and 3–4 double basses. The percussion consists of triangle, crotales (in pairs), 2 suspended cymbals (small/normal size), 4 woodblocks, 5 templeblocks, tambourine, snare drum, 3 bongos, 4 tomtoms, bass drum, guero, castanets, whip, siren whistle, signal whistle, slide whistle, flexatone, chromatic harmonica (Chromonica in C, 270 by Hohner), glockenspiel, and xylophone.  Music  The five movements of the final version are: At the time of its composition, Ligeti was working on his first book of piano études, and the superimposed African rhythms, shifting accents, and changing tempos so characteristic of those pieces can be heard in the concerto as well. The first movement is similar to the polymetric concept used in Ligeti's first étude, Désordre. Rhythmically complex throughout, it uses two time signatures, and , simultaneously as well as complicated aksak rhythms. In addition, the left and right hands play two complementary six-note scales.Steinitz, p. 323–24. The second movement, the only slow movement of the piece, begins without pause (attacca subito). It uses the lamento motif from the last movement of Ligeti's Horn Trio and his sixth piano étude, Automne à Varsovie. This motif also forms the basis of the third movement, another fast movement.Steinitz, p. 325–26. According to Ligeti himself, the fourth movement, more fragmentary than the surrounding movements, is inspired by computer-generated images of fractals (like the Julia set and Mandelbrot set) that he saw. The fifth movement, similar to the first, uses three related time signatures simultaneously.Steinitz, p. 328.

The sandwich consists of an egg foo young patty (made with mung bean sprouts and minced white onions) served with dill pickle slices, white onion, mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato between two slices of white bread. The St. Paul sandwich also comes in different combinations and specials, such as chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, and other varieties. Origin One source has the origin of the St. Paul sandwich dating to the early 1940s, when Chinese restaurants created the sandwich as a unique dish that was in a more familiar sandwich form that would appeal to the palates of Midwestern Americans, an early example of fusion cuisine. According to local legend, the St. Paul sandwich was invented by Steven Yuen at Park Chop Suey in Lafayette Square, a neighborhood near downtown St. Louis; Yuen named the sandwich after his hometown of St. Paul, Minnesota. Food writers James Beard and Evan Jones believed that the Denver or Western sandwich was created by \\"the many Chinese chefs who cooked for logging camps and railroad gangs in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\\" and was probably derived from egg foo young. They believed that the early Denver sandwiches were actually St. Paul sandwiches. This sandwich was featured in the PBS documentary Sandwiches That You Will Like in 2003 and will be featured in a book by artist Kelly Pratt to be released in 2016 called Stately Sandwiches as the sandwich chosen to represent the state of Missouri. Availability It is usually only available in Chinese restaurants in the St. Louis metropolitan area as well as a select few Chinese American restaurants in outlying regions of Missouri, the owners of which are typically originally from St. Louis. It is also available in Chinese-American restaurants in California and Oregon with regional names such as \\"Egg Foo Young on Bun\\", notably at Lung Fung in the Kenton neighborhood of Portland, Oregon.

Origin of the term There have been canals which formed a ring for more than 200 years, but the term was unknown before the 1960s, when the Inland Waterways Association coined Cheshire Ring as part of its campaign to save the Ashton Canal and Peak Forest Canal from closure. Working boatmen were concerned with getting from A to B as fast as possible, or for the lowest toll, rather than in visiting more of the system, and what are now known as rings were simply alternative routes to them, but circular routes allow leisure boaters to see twice as much of the system as is possible with an \\"out and back\\" cruise. Hire companies are keen to promote their proximity to popular cruising rings. Since the Cheshire Ring was born, more rings (and variants of them) have been named. The best-known are those that can be completed in one or two weeks, although some three-week rings (such as the Outer Pennine Ring) have been given names, but there are many other unnamed rings.

Two schoolmates, Harden Harrison (drums) and Casey Orr (bass), formed the band when they met Mike Scaccia (guitar). The three young men shared an interest in horror/gore films and very heavy music. With Bruce Corbitt on vocals, they created some of the heaviest thrash metal at the time often flirting with death metal. They were also one of the only major thrash bands from Texas and virtually created the underground metal scene there. The band was signed by Capitol Records in 1987. In 2005, the original lineup reunited and performed at Ozzfest 2008 in Texas. In 2009, Rigor Mortis played in Germany at the Keep It True Festival. Mike Scaccia also played guitar with industrial metal band Ministry, Revolting Cocks, Lard, and others. Casey Orr also plays bass in the shock rock band Gwar, as the character Beefcake the Mighty. He also played bass for Dallas punk rock band The Hellions. He currently plays for Warbeast. Harden Harrison also plays drums with the metal bands Speedealer and Mitra. Bruce Corbitt also sang for the thrash metal band Warbeast (Formerly Texas Metal Alliance). The band was signed by Phil Anselmo's label Housecore Records and their debut album Krush The Enemy was released on April 27, 2010. Warbeast's next release was a split album with Philip Anselmo's solo material titled War Of The Gargantuas and was released on January 8, 2013. Warbeast's second full-length album Destroy was released in 2013. Their final album \\"Enter the Arena\\", was released on August 4th, 2017. Former Rigor Mortis vocalist/guitarist Doyle Bright also played guitar in the metal band Hallows Eve. He currently performs vocals and guitars in the band SOG. Rigor Mortis is featured on the shirt of the creature on the Toxic Holocaust album Evil Never Dies from 2003. On December 23, 2012, the band's guitarist Mike Scaccia died from a heart attack while performing onstage. On October 6, 2014, Rigor Mortis released their final album Slaves to the Grave, which had been recorded in February 2012 at Ministry's 13th Planet Studios in El Paso. With no label interested in the album, Rigor Mortis successfully crowdfunded the new album by raising $22,838 from fan pre-orders to self-release the final album. After years of battling with cancer, Corbitt died on January 25, 2019 at the age of 56, making him the second member of Rigor Mortis (following Scaccia) to die. The remaining members perform Rigor Mortis music under the moniker Wizards of Gore in tribute to Mike Scaccia.

The total area is  Demographics  It had a population of 14,962 in 2011. History In prehistory, several Hill forts surrounded Villaviciosa, most located in the axis of the ria, near Rodiles. During the time of the Kingdom of Asturias in the 8th century, the population migrated to areas such as Amandi, Camoca, and Bedriñana, appearing frequently in the Maliayo territory. By the time of Alfonso IX of León, in the 13th century, the municipality had begun to repopulate, as witnessed in 17 October 1270, when King Alfonso X The Wise created the document evidencing the establishment of a population in Buetes. At the same time, a Cistercian Order emerged in the valley of Boides creating the Monasterio de Santa María de Valdediós. In the 16th century, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V landed and was hosted in the town (the most important event in village history). The King arrived at the port of Tazones due to a storm that altered his course on the way to Santander. In the 19th century, the town was repeatedly attacked. It was occupied several times by French troops during the Peninsular War. In 1835, the community was officially established and municipal business grew significantly due to its location on the river, which at the time was navigable.

The band membership included David Lindley, who later released numerous solo albums and won additional renown as a multi- instrumentalist session musician, and Chris Darrow who later performed and recorded with a number of groups including the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. History =Formation= The group was formed in 1966. The original members were: :David Lindley (born March 21, 1944, Los Angeles, California) :Solomon Feldthouse (born January 20, 1940, Pingree, Idaho) :Chris Darrow (born July 30, 1944, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, died January 15, 2020) :Chester Crill (a.k.a. Max Budda, Max Buda, Fenrus Epp, Templeton Parcely) (born Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) :John Vidican (born Los Angeles, California) Lindley was an experienced performer on a variety of stringed instruments, notably the banjo, winning the Topanga Canyon Banjo Contest several years in a row in the early 60s. While studying at La Salle High School in Pasadena, he formed his first group, the Mad Mountain Ramblers, who performed around the Los Angeles folk clubs. There, he met Darrow, who was a member of a rival group, the Re- Organized Dry City Players. Soon afterwards, around 1964, the pair formed a new group, the Dry City Scat Band, which also included fiddle player Richard Greene (later of Seatrain), but Darrow soon left to set up a new rock group, the Floggs. Lindley also began forming his own electric group. In the course of this he met Feldthouse, who had been raised in Turkey and, on returning to the US, had performed flamenco music and as an accompanist to belly dancing groups. Lindley and Feldthouse then began performing as a duo, David and Solomon, when they met Chester Crill. They invited him to join their band, and by the end of 1966 added Darrow and drummer John Vidican, so forming the Kaleidoscope. =Recording and performance career= The group was founded on democratic principles – there was no \\"leader\\". They soon began performing live in clubs, winning a recording contract with Epic Records. The first single, \\"Please\\", was released in December 1966. It was produced by Barry Friedman (later known as Frazier Mohawk), as was their first album Side Trips, released in June 1967. The album showcased the group’s musical diversity and studio experimentation. It included Feldthouse's \\"Egyptian Gardens\\", Darrow’s \\"Keep Your Mind Open\\", and versions of Cab Calloway's \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" and Dock Boggs' \\"Oh Death\\". Crill, for reasons he never made clear (but ex-bandmates speculated had to do with concerns about overreactions from his \\"straitlaced\\" parents), was credited as \\"Fenrus Epp\\" on the first album and adopted various other pseudonyms on later recordings. Between them, the group played a huge collection of stringed instruments in such psychedelic songs as \\"Egyptian Gardens\\" and \\"Pulsating Dream.\\" They played fusions of Middle-Eastern music with rock in longer pieces such as \\"Taxim,\\" which they performed at numerous venues including the Berkeley Folk Festival on July 4, 1967 and the Newport Folk Festival and the Family Dog at The Avalon Ballroom (San Francisco) in 1968. Live, band numbers were sometimes interspersed by solo instrumental turns from Feldthouse or Lindley, and occasionally Feldthouse brought belly dancers or flamenco dancers on stage. The band performed many different styles, including rock, blues, folk, jazz, Middle-Eastern and also featured music by Calloway and Duke Ellington in their repertoire. Kaleidoscope were one of the progenitors of World Music. Cover of the Kaleidoscope's second album \\"A Beacon from Mars,\\" with album art by Tad Hunter aka San Andreas Fault. The band's second album A Beacon from Mars was released in early 1968, to generally good reviews but poor sales. The album was a mix of Middle- Eastern, country, folk and rock musical styles. The title track, inspired by a Howlin' Wolf musical riff originally in his song Smokestack Lightning, was recorded live in the studio, and featured a long psychedelic electric guitar solo by Lindley, which later caused Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page to refer to the Kaleidoscope as his \\"favourite band of all time.\\" In live performances of the tune, Lindley used a violin bow on his electric guitar, probably influencing Page to use the same effect later. Another live \\"no overdubs\\" track on the album was \\"Taxim,\\" with solos from Lindley on a \\"harp guitar\\" and Felthouse, who played oud and saz on the lengthy cut. Liner notes to the much-later CD reissue claim the album's original title was \\"Bacon From Mars,\\" but that the title was misprinted. This is a complete myth, initiated by a joke printed in the magazine ZigZag during their three-part feature on Kaleidoscope.Biasotti, David (2010). \\"Kaleidoscope\\". In Pulsating Dreams: The Epic Recordings [CD booklet]. London: Floating World Records. Darrow left the group after recording the album and was replaced by bassist Stuart Brotman, previously a member of an early version of Canned Heat. However, Darrow returned briefly for studio work when the group backed first Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson and Larry Williams on their 1967 single \\"Nobody\\", and later Leonard Cohen on \\"So Long, Marianne\\" and \\"Teachers\\" on his first album. Vidican was also replaced by drummer Paul Lagos who had a jazz and R&B; background, having played with Little Richard, Johnny Otis, and Ike and Tina Turner. The band recorded their third album, Incredible! Kaleidoscope, in 1968. It featured \\"Seven-Ate Sweet\\", a long progressive instrumental piece in 7/8 time signature which they had been playing live since the early days of the group. The album reached No. 139 on Billboard in 1969, the only Kaleidoscope album to chart. Around this time they also did soundtrack work on educational and other films, and also made an appearance at the Newport Folk Festival. Kaleidoscope’s fourth and final album from their Epic Records era, Bernice, featured more electric guitar work than the earlier albums, and more country influence. There were further personnel changes, adding singer-guitarist Jeff Kaplan, and bassist Ron Johnston who replaced Brotman during the making of the album. Feldthouse also left the group. At the end of 1969, Kaleidoscope contributed two new songs (\\"Brother Mary\\" and \\"Mickey's Tune\\") to Michelangelo Antonioni's Zabriskie Point. The band split up soon afterwards. Later careers After the end of Kaleidoscope, Lindley became a highly respected session and live musician with Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne and others, before forming his own band, El Rayo-X, in the early 1980s. Feldthouse performed at Renaissance Pleasure Faires, and with various flamenco and Middle Eastern groups. Darrow joined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band after Kaleidoscope and later formed the Corvettes with Bernie Leadon before becoming a leading session musician and solo performer. Crill became an underground comic writer for a time, co-writing the Mickey Rat series, and also produced the first 78rpm record by R. Crumb's group, Armstrong's Pasadenans. Brotman became involved with the LA folk dance scene and has done considerable work as a movie extra. In the 1980s he became active in the Klezmer Revival, playing bass and tsimbl for Brave Old World and most recently is a member of the San Francisco-based trio, Veretski Pass whose most recent CD, \\"The Magid Chronicles,\\" was released in 2019. He is also a regular instructor at KlezCalifornia and KlezKanada, and other ethnic music gatherings. Paul Lagos died on October 19, 2009. Chris Darrow died on January 15, 2020. \\"Noted Claremont artist Chris Darrow dies at 75\\", January 16, 2020. Retrieved January 17, 2020 Kaleidoscope reunions In 1976, ex-members Brotman, Crill, Darrow, Feldthouse and Lagos reconvened for the reunion album, When Scopes Collide, which was released on Michael Nesmith’s Pacific Arts label. Lindley also contributed, but distanced himself from the project by appearing as “De Paris Letante.” Fourteen years later, Crill and Darrow organized a second reunion session, this time for Gifthorse Records. Greetings from Kartoonistan (We Ain’t Dead Yet) again brought together the same lineup, with Brotman contributing the instrumental, Klezmer Suite. (Though invited, Lindley declined to participate.)

It has lyrics composed in rhyme by Santiago González Guiñán; the music was added by Sebastián Díaz Peña. The anthem was first played on July 5, 1908 (being the anniversary of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence) at the Bolìvar Square of Valencia. History =History of the state of Carabobo= The territories that are now part of Carabobo State were part of the former Venezuela Province during Spanish dominion. Since 1819 the Venezuela Province became a Department of the newly and only partially independent Colombian Republic and in 1824 the Department was divided into two provinces, one of them called Carabobo for the first time in honor of the battle that almost definitively defeated Spanish troops in Venezuela. In 1831 Venezuela separated from Colombia and in 1881 the provinces became Federal States. =History of the anthem= On April 4, 1908, a contest for writing and composing the lyrics and music for the Carabobo State Anthem was called by a decree of the President of the State Samuel Niño. For the lyrics jury were designate Francisco de Sales Pérez, Pedro Castillo, Luis Pérez Carreño, Félix Delfín Ortega y Joaquín Reverón. For the music jury were designated Martín Requena, Jacinto Piana, Aquiles Antich, Luis Socorro y Miguel Denti. The winners of the contest were Santiago González Guinán and Sebastián Díaz Peña. González Guinán (1854-1925) was born in Valencia and was a politician, writer and poet. In his political career, he was Minister of Public Instruction in 1888, congressman for his natal state in 1896 and President of the State in 1911. Díaz Peña (1844-1926) was born in Puerto Cabello and was an important Venezuelan composer, pianist and music teacher. His best known piece of music is the joropo Maricela, composed in 1877, and arguably the inspiration for another joropo, Alma Llanera from Pedro Elías Gutiérrez's eponymous zarzuela, one of the most recognizable Venezuelan compositions. Elías Gutiérrez also composed the music for the Barinas State Anthem. Lyrics In the lyrics González Guiñán intends to glorify the State as the place where the decisive battle against Spanish rule was fought. However, Spanish troops were not spelt out for the country until 2 years after the Battle of Carabobo, when a capitulation made possible a peaceful withdrawal of the remaining Spanish troops and Spanish loyalists. Also the campaign that end in the Battle of Carabobo was intended to annex the territory of the Venezuela Province, a lot shorter than the modern day Venezuela, to the Gran Colombia republic rather than created a new independent Venezuelan state. But since the movement that finally separated several provinces from Gran Colombia to form the Venezuelan republic actually took place in Valencia, the State capital, the State remains its fame as the birthplace of the country. In fact, Proyecto Venezuela (Venezuela Project) the most important regional party (today a national party) uses the slogan: \\"Carabobo were Venezuela was born\\" in various propaganda. The lyrics begin with \\"By the Sun that comes to enlighten\\", because the sun became a symbol of the state: the arc of triumph of Carabobo with a rising sun as background can be seen in the state banner, in the top of the state coat of arms (without the arc) and in the logo of Proyecto Venezuela. Finally, the author makes reference in the last two verses to the end of the numerous civil wars that occurs in most of the county's 19th century history and which definitive ends with the upcoming of the governments of Cipriano Castro (1900-1908) and Juan Vicente Gómez (1908-1935). { cellpadding=2 style=\\"background:transparent;\\" - align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Carabobo State Anthem * * * - !

His predecessor, George Percy, through inept leadership, was responsible for the lives lost during the period called the Starving Time. The English-born Gates arrived to find a few surviving starving colonists commanded by Percy, and assumed command. Gates ruled with deputy governor Sir Thomas Dale. Their controlled, strict methods helped the early colonies survive. Sir Thomas was knighted in 1596 by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex for gallantry at the Capture of Cadiz. His knighthood was later royally confirmed by Queen Elizabeth I. Third Supply and Bermuda Gates was appointed by the Virginia Company of London, which had established the Jamestown settlement under a Royal Charter for the colonisation of Virginia. He had sailed for Jamestown in 1609, aboard the Sea Venture, the new flagship of the Virginia Company. The Sea Venture was part of the Third Supply, a fleet of seven ships, towing two pinnacles, which was intended to deliver new settlers and desperately needed supplies. At sea, the ships of the Third Supply were separated by a three-day storm now thought to have been a large hurricane. The Admiral of the Virginia Company, Sir George Somers, had taken the helm to fight the storm, and deliberately drove the ship onto rocks to prevent its foundering. The rocks proved to be the reef line to the east of the uninhabited archipelago now known as Bermuda. The other ships went on to Jamestown, not knowing the fate of the Sea Venture. The 150 survivors spent the next ten months in Bermuda building two new ships on which to complete the journey to Jamestown. Two factions developed, however, due to a dispute between Gates and Somers over who was now the superior. As an appointed officer for Jamestown, Gates felt he was in authority, now that they were ashore. Somers felt that he retained authority until the settlers, including Gates, were landed at Jamestown. The two new ships, the Deliverance and the Patience were completed and sailed for Virginia in 1610. They left two men (a third would be left when the Patience returned from Jamestown) to maintain their claim of Bermuda for England. The Charter of the Virginia Company would officially be extended to include Bermuda in 1612. Ever since, Bermuda has also been known officially as The Somers Isles. Sir Thomas Gates left his own name on a part of the colony, Gate's Bay, where the survivors of the Sea Venture landed. The oldest surviving fort in Bermuda, built between 1612 and 1615, is known as Gate's Fort. Many scholars believe Gates' accounts inspired William Shakespeare's comedy The Tempest.Shakespeare's Caliban: a cultural history By Alden T. Vaughan, Virginia Mason Vaughan, pp38-39 Sir Thomas Gates had a cross erected before leaving Bermuda, on which was a copper tablet inscribed in Latin and English: In Memory of our deliverance both from the Storme and the Great leake wee have erected this cross to the honour of God. It is the Spoyle of an English Shippe of 300 tonnes called SEA VENTURE bound with seven others (from which the storme divided us) to Virginia or NOVA BRITANIA in America. In it were two Knights, Sir Thomas Gates, Knight Governor of the English Forces and Colonie there: and Sir George Somers, Knight Admiral of the Seas. Her Captain was Christopher Newport. Passengers and mariners she had beside (which all come to safety) one hundred and fiftie. Wee were forced to runne her ashore(by reason of her leake) under a point that bore South East from the Northerne Point of the Island which wee discovered first on the eighth and twentieth of July 1609. Virginia colony On reaching Jamestown, only 60 of the 500 settlers previously landed there were found alive through the winter of 1609–1610 which became known as the \\"Starving Time\\". The condition of the settlement was so poor that on June 7, 1610, Gates decided to abandon the floundering settlement and return to England. However, the timely arrival of another relief fleet under Lord De La Warr gave the colony a reprieve. Gates' actions as governor were recorded by his secretary William Strachey, and were later published as the book \\"A True Reportory of the wracke, and redemption of Sir THOMAS GATES, Knight.\\" After Samuel Argall kidnapped Pocahontas in April 1613, Gates was fearful of reprisal from Chief Powhatan, and turned the Algonquian princess over to Dale in Henricus. She met John Rolfe during her captivity three months later. Reverend Alexander Whitaker converted Pocahontas to Christianity. She adopted the name \\"Rebecca\\". Gates would go on to establish at least three new forts along the James River, as well as blockhouses, a wharf, and a governors house. Gates would also lead an armed force against the Powhatans, defeating them, and was governor when Sir Thomas Dale established the first permanent English colony outside of Jamestown, called Henricus. Gates' actions caused him to be considered a national hero upon his return to England, something the Virginia Company badly needed due to their previous dip in investors. Gates was outspoken in support of future expeditions to the New World, and warned his superiors that the colonies would fail without proper supplies. In November 1619, the Virginia Company's new treasurer, Sir Edwin Sandys, praised Gates' \\"Wisdom, industry, and valour, accompanied with exceeding paines and patience, in the midst of many difficulties.\\" Death Gates died in the Netherlands sometime before September 7, 1622. Sir Dudley Carleton was quoted, saying that Gates was \\"an ancient honest gentleman of this nation.\\" Gates had five children at his death, Thomas, Anthony, Margaret, Mary, and Elizabeth. Gates Bay in Bermuda is named in his honor, and is purportedly the bay where the Sea Venture landed. Gates Fort, also named in his honor, is a point of interest in St. George, Bermuda.

The first was published in the spring of 1837, and the second in 1842.Roy Harvey Pearce, \\"Introduction\\" in Nathaniel Hawthorne, Twice-Told Tales, New York: Dutton, 1967, pp. v-vi. The stories had all been previously published in magazines and annuals, hence the name. Publication Hawthorne was encouraged by friend Horatio Bridge to collect these previously anonymous stories; Bridge offered $250 to cover the risk of the publication.McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2005: 22. Many had been published in The Token, edited by Samuel Griswold Goodrich. When the works became popular, Bridge revealed Hawthorne as the author in a review he published in the Boston Post.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 90. The title, Twice-Told Tales, was based on a line from William Shakespeare's The Life and Death of King John (Act 3, scene 4): \\"Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale, / Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man.\\"Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 92–93. The quote referenced may also be Hawthorne's way of acknowledging a belief that many of his stories were ironic retellings of familiar tropes.Howe, Susan. The Birth-mark: Unsettling the Wilderness in American Literary History. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1993: 5. The book was published by the American Stationers' Company on March 6, 1837; its cover price was one dollar.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 92. Hawthorne had help in promoting the book from Elizabeth Peabody. She sent copies of the collection to William Wordsworth as well as to Horace Mann, hoping that Mann could get Hawthorne a job writing stories for schoolchildren.Marshall, Megan. The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism. Boston: Mariner Books, 2006: 356. After publication, Hawthorne asked a friend to check with the local bookstore to see how it was selling. After noting the initial expenses for publishing had not been met, he complained: \\"Surely the book was puffed enough to meet with sale. What the devil's the matter?\\"Schreiner, Samuel A., Jr. The Concord Quartet: Alcott, Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, and the Friendship that Freed the American Mind. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and Sons, 2006: 120. . By June, between 600 and 700 copies were sold but sales were soon halted by the Panic of 1837 and the publisher went out of business within a year.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 93. On October 11, 1841, Hawthorne signed a contract with publisher James Munroe to issue a new, two- volume edition of Twice-Told Tales with 21 more works than the previous edition. 1,000 copies were published in December of that year with a cover price of $2.25; Hawthorne was paid 10 percent per copy.Mellow, James R. Nathaniel Hawthorne in His Times. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980: 192. Hawthorne complained that he still struggled financially. Editor John L. O'Sullivan suggested Hawthorne buy back unsold copies of Twice- Told Tales so that they could be reissued through a different publisher. At the time of this suggestion, 1844, there were 600 unsold copies of the book. Hawthorne lamented, \\"I wish Heaven would make me rich enough to buy the copies for the purpose of burning them.\\"Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 183. After the success of The Scarlet Letter in 1850, Twice-Told Tales was reissued with the help of publisher James Thomas Fields. In a new preface, Hawthorne wrote that the stories \\"may be understood and felt by anybody, who will give himself the trouble to read it, and will take up the book in a proper mood.\\"Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 229–231. Critical response Nathaniel Hawthorne portrait by Charles Osgood, 1840 About a week after the publication of the book, Hawthorne sent a copy to his classmate from Bowdoin College, the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.Miller, Edwin Haviland. Salem Is My Dwelling Place: A Life of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Iowa City, University of Iowa Press, 1991: 120. Longfellow had given a speech at their commencement calling for notable contributions to American literature. By this time, Longfellow was working at Harvard University and was becoming popular as a poet. Hawthorne wrote to him, \\"We were not, it is true, so well acquainted at college, that I can plead an absolute right to inflict my 'twice-told' tediousness upon you; but I have often regretted that we were not better known.\\" In his 14-page critique in the April issue of the North American Review, Longfellow praised the book as a work of genius.McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 58–59. \\"To this little book\\", Longfellow wrote, \\"we would say, 'Live ever, sweet, sweet book.' It comes from the hand of a man of genius.\\"Miller, Edwin Haviland. Salem Is My Dwelling Place: A Life of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Iowa City, University of Iowa Press, 1991: 121. For his review of the second edition, Longfellow noted that Hawthorne's writing \\"is characterized by a large proportion of feminine elements, depth and tenderness of feeling, exceeding purity of mind.\\"Mellow, James R. Nathaniel Hawthorne in His Times. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980: 193. He referred to the collection's \\"The Gentle Boy\\" as \\"on the whole, the finest thing he ever wrote\\".Miller, Edwin Haviland. Salem Is My Dwelling Place: A Life of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991: 43. The two authors would eventually build a strong friendship.McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2005: 19. Generally, reviews were positive. Park Benjamin, Sr. said that the author was \\"a rose baptized in dew\\". For the Boston Quarterly Review, Orestes Brownson noted Hawthorne's writings as \\"a pure and living stream of manly thought and feeling, which characterizes always the true man, the Christian, the republican and the patriot.\\" After reading Twice-Told Tales, Herman Melville wrote to Evert Augustus Duyckinck that the stories weren't meaty enough. \\"Their deeper meanings are worthy of a Brahmin. Still there is something lacking—a good deal lacking to the plump sphericity of the man. What is that?—He does'nt patronise the butcher—he needs roast-beef, done rare.\\"Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 228–229. Edgar Allan Poe wrote a well-known two-part review of the second edition of Twice-Told Tales, published in the April and May 1842 issues of Graham's Magazine. Poe particularly praised Hawthorne's originality as \\"remarkable\\". He nonetheless criticized Hawthorne's reliance on allegory and the didactic, something he called a \\"heresy\\" to American literature. He did, however, express praise at the use of short stories (Poe was a tale- writer himself) and said they \\"rivet the attention\\" of the reader.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 233. Poe admitted, \\"The style of Hawthorne is purity itself. His tone is singularly effective--wild, plaintive, thoughtful, and in full accordance with his themes.\\" He concluded that, \\"we look upon him as one of the few men of indisputable genius to whom our country has as yet given birth.\\"McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2005: 88–89. The Grolier Club later named Twice-Told Tales the most influential book of 1837.Nelson, Randy F. The Almanac of American Letters.

The three stories were: \\"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment\\", which actually was one of the \\"Twice-Told Tales\\"; the Hawthorne novel The House of the Seven Gables; and another short story, \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\". The film is regarded as a classic of sorts in the field of low-budget Hollywood horror, with Vincent Price, Sebastian Cabot, and Beverly Garland performing. The 2016 film Wakefield is a modern adaptation of the story of the same name.

The Senate is accorded legitimacy by Chapter V of the Constitution of Barbados.Constitution, Chapter V, Part 1; Section 35 It is the smaller of the two chambers and also includes Elizabeth II, Queen of Barbados (represented by the Governor General). The Senate was established in 1964 to replace a prior body known as the Legislative Council. Besides creating and reviewing Barbadian legislation, the Senate generally reviews approved legislation originating from the House of Assembly (Lower House). One main constraint on the Senate is that it cannot author monetary or budget-related bills. Most of the non-political appointees to the Senate have been selected by the Governor General from civil society organisations, labour collectives and public associations in Barbados. Senators are nominated by the Governor General of Barbados, on behalf of the Sovereign. According to the Constitution of Barbados, some are chosen at the Governor General's sole discretion, and some on the advice of the Prime Minister and HM's Loyal Opposition. The Senate sits for 20 to 25 days a year. The term of the Senate, and the House of Assembly, is five years; both chambers are dissolved before each election. Composition All 21 Barbadian Senators are theoretically appointed by the Queen, but this duty, and all of the Queen's other Barbadian duties, is carried out by the Governor General. The Governor General appoints 12 Senators on the advice of the Prime Minister and two on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition. The remaining seven Senators are nominated by the Governor General at his/her discretion to represent various religious, social, economic, or other interests in Barbados. Potential Senators must meet certain criteria before they can be nominated to the upper chamber. In order to be eligible for appointment, a person must be a Barbadian citizen of at least 21 years of age who has resided in the country for the past twelve months. A person is ineligible for appointment if they are in bankruptcy, have a mental illness, hold an allegiance to a foreign state, have a capital punishment sentence, have been in prison for a time exceeding six months, or have been convicted of a crime involving electoral fraud, treason, or other dishonourable acts. Furthermore, a Senator cannot also serve as a civil servant, a member of the armed forces or police, a judge, a public prosecutor, a controller, or a current sitting member of the House of Assembly.Constitution: Section 38, 1a. Senators serve for five years. Powers Both the Senate and the House of Assembly constitutionally share most of the same powers, however, much as in other Westminster System Parliaments, the lower house is dominant. All legislation can be introduced and amended in either house with the exception of money bills; money bills always originate in the House of Assembly, and the Senate is limited in the amendments it can make to them. If the budget is approved by the House of Assembly, but it is not approved un-amended by the Senate within one month, it can be directly submitted to the Governor General. If regular legislation is approved by the House of Assembly twice in two consecutive sessions, but is not approved of by the Senate either time, it can also be submitted directly to the Governor General. Officers When a session begins, the Senate elects a President and a Vice President, who may not be ministers or parliamentary secretaries. The President usually votes only to break a tie.

Known for his impassioned lyrical tenor vocals, distinct stage presence and specific brand of poetic lyrics, Varešanović remains the vocal soloist, primary composer and lyricist for the musical group Hari Mata Hari. Biography Born as Hajrudin Varešanović in early 1961, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (then a part of Yugoslavia.) Hari grew up in the Vratnik neighborhood of Sarajevo's old town. His grandfather was one of the more well- known singers of traditional Bosnian music called sevdalinka. At the age of six, Hajrudin began to sing and learned to play the guitar. At the local cultural center, he was asked to sing, then at the age of ten he sang with the group \\"Omi\\", and later for the group \\"Sedam šuma\\". In Vratnik, Hari recorded his first song \\"Zašto da ne uzmem nju\\". After finishing electrical school, Varešanović began to study Philosophy and attended classes of natural politics, but he never completed the courses. Music took up much of his time, as did his love of photography. In 1979, Hari joined the group Zov with whom he recorded the hit song \\"Poletjela golubica sa Baščaršije.\\" The song is still very popular. Next, Varešanović sang with the group \\"Ambasadori\\", with whom, it is said, that he matured into a professional artist. After his serving mandatory military service in the town of Niš, he appeared on the music scene by himself releasing the (1984) album Zlatne Kočije. His professional career has lasted over a quarter of a century and he has performed at over 1,000 concerts. In 1999, Varešanović performed his song \\"Starac i More\\" in hope of representing Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Eurovision Song Contest 1999. However, after \\"Starac i More\\" had won it turned out the song had already been recorded, since Varešanović had sold the song to record label Unirecords in Finland, and Finnish artist Janne Hurme recorded that song in 1997 in name \\"Heart Blood\\" (\\"Sydänveri\\"). Hari Mata Hari was disqualified. The runner-up, Dino Merlin, was sent to the ESC instead. In 1999, he recorded a duet with a famous fellow Bosnian singer, Hanka Paldum. The song, \\"Crni snijeg\\", was featured on her album Nek' je od srca and was covered later the same year by Serbian singer Ceca on her album Ceca 2000. On 9 February 2006, the Bosnian television network PBSBiH announced that Hari Varešanović would represent Bosnia and Herzegovina with the song \\"Lejla\\" at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The announcement confirmed rumors circulating throughout the country for more than two months. Varešanović performed a song with music written by Serbian composer Željko Joksimović and lyrics written by Bosnian writer Fahrudin Pecikoza and Serbian Dejan Ivanović. Hari Varešanović told the Bosnian newspaper Nezavisne Novine: > ... The song is the best in the world. I have to admit that I have not heard > a better one. I am impressed with it and Pecikoza's lyrics. We have made a > song that comes out the spirit of our people and I am glad to be singing > it... On 20 May 2006, Hari Varešanović and his group Hari Mata Hari reached third place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 held in Athens, Greece. In 2011, Varešanović composed the music to and wrote the lyrics to Briši me, a song sung by Bosnian singer Lepa Brena for her sixteenth studio album Začarani krug. He also wrote the lyrics to her 2014 song Zaljubljeni veruju u sve. Personal life On 14 February 2010, Varešanović married girlfriend Jasminka Ištuk from Osijek, Croatia. They live in Sarajevo and Munich. It is the second marriage for both. Each have children from previous marriages.http://www.sarajevo-x.com/showtime/showbiz/clanak/100214046 References External links *Sarajevo school of pop rock Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Sarajevo Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina musicians Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina male singers Category:Yugoslav male singers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 2006 Category:Hayat Production artists Category:Indexi Award winners ro:Hari Mata Hari ","title":"Hari Varešanović"},{"id":"2555696","text":"The anthem for the Cojedes State, Venezuela, has lyrics by Mauricio Pérez Lazo.

Background After spending several months recording material and performing their first few shows in 1998, Thes One and Double K used Thes One's student loan funds to independently press and release their first 12-inch single, \\"The Next Step II\\". Just weeks after the single was released, the shopkeeper of the now-defunct Mr. Bongo record shop purchased a large number of copies of it for his shop. When he played it on an ordinary day in the store, customers rushed the counter and it sold out within minutes. Impressed by the quick sale, Mr. Bongo's shopkeeper called Chris Smith, owner of Om Records in San Francisco, and urged him to get in contact with People Under The Stairs. Initially, Smith contacted the group regarding a one-song deal for Om's compilation albums Deep Concentration and Mushroom Jazz, but upon hearing more material, Smith offered the group a full contract. Recording The album was self-recorded at Thes One's home on 2228 Cambridge Street in Los Angeles, California. Thes One and Double K used their personal recording equipment, including an E-mu SP-1200, an Akai MPC3000, and an 8-track ADAT digital tape recorder. In 1996, when many of the songs were taking shape, Thes One and Double K were not actually planning on making a full-length hip hop album. They had just decided to make music for their own benefit. Eventually, as the amount of material they were creating grew (and at the urging of their friends), they changed their minds, had the album mastered, created their own artwork and self-released the album in the summer of 1998. After being signed with Om, the label re-released The Next Step as the first album of a four-record deal. The self-released version of the CD came with a beedi in the spine, but this was omitted from the Om release. Some of the outtakes from The Next Step were later released on the group's first compilation album, American Men Vol. 1. Reception After the release of the album in 1998, People Under The Stairs had a difficult time getting their record released, and many local DJs refused to play the album on their radio stations or during club events. One producer, DJ Vadim, even wrote a letter to Om Records to tell them they had made a mistake signing the band. New York- based distribution company Phat Beats also refused to endorse the album because it did not sound \\"New York\\" enough. Despite initial difficulties, the group found friends in DJ Rob One and DJ Dusk, who helped them gain exposure in the Los Angeles area and planted the seeds of future success.Portugal, Christopher (August 2013). 10 Years Of Thes One. Booklet accompanying box set release. Reviews of the album were mixed. NME gave the album a positive review, saying that the group's strategy of personally funding and self- releasing the album \\"paid off\\" and that the lyrics are \\"pleasingly unpolished, intelligently raw\\". Allmusic praised the album as a \\"promising debut\\" and enjoyed \\"Death of a Salesman\\", but that the album performed \\"within the boundaries of old\\". The album had a much stronger showing overseas, which prompted People Under The Stairs to go on their first world tour following the release of the album. Despite never being released as a single, \\"San Francisco Knights\\" quickly became a live favorite and a breakout cult classic for the group, and People Under The Stairs still perform it to this day. The song gave the group a little trouble when it was released, however; many casual fans believed that the group was from San Francisco, California. In reality, the song was written and recorded in 1996 to commemorate a fun visit to the city. The track \\"The Next Step II\\" was later included in the 2003 video game Tony Hawk's Underground. The song samples the lyrics of \\"Movin' On Up\\", the opening theme of The Jeffersons.

A rebranding to PostNord for both the mail and logistics divisions was performed in 2015.  History  Posten was established as Kungliga Postverket (The Royal Postal Agency) in 1636 by the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden Axel Oxenstierna, who was de facto regent until the young Queen Christina took the throne in 1644. It was operated as a government agency into the 1990s when it was transformed into a government-owned limited company. One of the most visible changes to the postal service was the decision in 2000 to replace Posten's numerous post offices with a franchise net of postal service points, run by grocery shops and petrol stations.

The company, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications has a monopoly on distribution of letters weighing less than 50g throughout the country. There are 30 post offices in Norway, in addition to 1400 outlets in retail stores. History Posten was founded in 1647 as Postvesenet (\\"the postal system\\") by general post master Henrik Morian. It was established as a private company, and the King Christian IV gave his blessing to the founding of the company. Postvesenet was privately run until 1719, when the state took over. From that point on, national postal service was a state monopoly. Local city postal services remained private, but in 1888 a new postal law was introduced which expanded the monopoly to the entire country. In 1933, Postvesenet was renamed Postverket. In 1996, Posten Norge BA was established as a state-owned company in which the Norwegian state had limited liability.

Causes of rebellion The causes of the rebellion included William Claiborne's disputed claim with the Calverts over Kent Island, Maryland, the bitter relations between the Catholic minority elite and the Protestant majority, and the political partisanship of the English Civil War. The dark period marked a combination of the fall of the British King and religious intolerance, which led directly to the event. Plundering Time In 1638, the first provincial Maryland governor Leonard Calvert seized a trading post on Kent Island established by Captain William Claiborne. In 1644, William Claiborne led an uprising of Protestants and retook Kent Island. Meanwhile, privateer Captain Richard Ingle the co- commander of Claiborne seized control of St. Mary's City the capital of the Maryland colony. Catholic Governor Calvert escaped to the Virginia Colony. The Protestant pirates began plundering the property of anyone who did not swear allegiance to the English Parliament, mainly Catholics. End of rebellion In 1647, the Rebellion was finally put down by Maryland Governor Lord Baltimore, who successfully led Maryland colonial forces against the Parliamentary privateers and regained control of the colony effectively ending the rebellion initiated by Claiborne and Ingle. Succumbing to illness, Lord Baltimore died the following summer in 1648. Following the end of the \\"Plundering Time\\" the Maryland colonial assembly passed the Maryland Toleration Act allowing Catholics freedom of worship in the Protestant majority colony. Almost ten years after the \\"Plundering Time\\" hostilities erupted once again between Maryland Protestants and the Catholic minority within the colony at the Battle of the Severn, a Puritan victory now present- day Annapolis Aftermath The Maryland colonial assembly issued the Maryland Toleration Act of 1649 to mollify the two factions. A Parliamentary victory in England renewed old tensions leading to the Battle of the Severn, now present- day Annapolis in 1655. References *Timothy B.

Feodor Dmitriyevich Motorin  Feodor Dmitriyevich Motorin (Фёдор Дмитриевич Моторин) (1630s–1688) began his career at the Moscow Cannon Yard in 1651 along with another famous bellmaker Alexander Grigoriev. In the 1670s, Motorin became a leading caster at the Cannon yard. In 1678, he cast a bell for the Church of Simeon Stolpnik in the Povarskaya Sloboda, in 1681 – for the Church of Virgin Mary in Grebnevo, in 1682 – for Danilov Monastery, in 1684 – for the Church of Archangel Gabriel at Chistiy Prud. All these bells, however, were destroyed by the Soviets in the 1930s. Feodor Motorin was also a talented businessman. After having accumulated some financial capital, he began purchasing land and buildings for his colleagues-bellmakers in the Pushkarskaya Sloboda in the 1660s. This is how the first bellmaking factory came into being in the area of Sretenskiye Gates in Moscow, of which Motorin had been the owner since 1686. The factory used to cast bells, commissioned by churches and monasteries. Small bells were also made for sale in Moscow. A few works autographed by Feodor Motorin have survived to this day. They include two bells cast in 1678 and 1679 – the Danilov Bell (Даниловский колокол) and the New Bell (Новый колокол) weighing 3.2 tons (both can still be seen in the middle tier of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower); an 8-ton bell, cast for the Novodevichy Convent (1684); a 1.6-ton bell for the Volynsky Monastery in Chernigov (1683), which was relocated to Moscow in 1991 and hung on the Saint Basil's Cathedral. All of the surviving bells made by Motorin are known for their casting purity and rich relief decorations (stylized arabesque ornament and images of cherubs and seraphs, which harmonize with cast inscriptions). Dmitry Feodorovich Motorin Dmitry Feodorovich Motorin (Дмитрий Фёдорович Моторин) (? – ?) was the son of Feodor Motorin. In 1682–1696, he worked at the Moscow Cannon Yard as a bellmaker. Dmitry Motorin is known for his unusual 64 kg bell, cast by him in 1687 at the request of a boyar Vasili Golitsyn for the Church of Pokrova Bogoroditsy in his votchina of the village Medvedkovo (it can be seen in Kolomenskoye today). The top part of the bell is made in the form of a bellringer's head, crowned by lion heads and ornaments. Ivan Feodorovich Motorin Ivan Feodorovich Motorin (Иван Фёдорович Моторин) (1660s – 19 August 1735) was the son of Feodor Motorin. His factory used to produce bells for many Moscow monasteries and churches. In 1692, he cast a 1-tonne bell for the Church of John the Apostle in Bronniki (moved to the Saint Basil's Cathedral). In 1695, Ivan Motorin made a 3-tonne bell for the Church of Saint Nicholas in Moscow (destroyed in the 1930s). In February 1701, after heavy artillery losses in the Battle of Narva, Peter the Great ordered to use Motorin's bellmaking factory for cannon production. A famous cannon maker Martyan Osipov (Мартьян Осипов) assisted Ivan Motorin in mastering the science of cannon-making. Motorin's factory carried out the order in a short period of time and produced 113 copper cannons by February 1702. On 26 November 1702, Ivan Motorin was ordered to cast a 54-ton bell for the Ivan the Great Bell Tower, which would be called Воскресенский (Resurrection Bell). In 1704, he made a 13.3-ton bell nicknamed Великопостный (Lent Bell). In 1712, Motorin's factory burnt down and was rebuilt only two years later. In 1714, Ivan Motorin cast the 2-ton Alarm Bell (Набатный колокол), which was later placed on top of the Tsarskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin. It remained there until 1771 and was then moved to the Armoury in 1821. In the 1710 and 1720s, Motorin made a few bells for the Muscovite churches and monasteries, including Chudov Monastery. Most of these bells did not survive to this day. In 1730, he cast a 7-ton Novgorod Bell (Новгородский колокол), which can still be seen in the lower tier of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower. In 1731, Motorin was ordered to turn the damaged bells (due to a fire of 1723) of the Church of Archangel Gabriel into clock bells for the Troitskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin. Their fate, however, is still unknown. Famous Tsar bell (Царь-колокол) was Motorin's masterpiece, for which he is best remembered. In 1735, he was ordered to recast the bell made by Alexander Grigoriev (1655), shattered during the 1701 fire. Unfortunately, Ivan Motorin died when the work was in full swing. The whole responsibility for the making of the Tsar Bell was placed upon his son Mikhail Motorin. Mikhail Ivanovich Motorin There is little information available on Mikhail Ivanovich Motorin (Михаил Иванович Моторин) (? – 1750) after he finished casting the Tsar Bell. Historians know that in 1736 he made a bell for the Epiphany Monastery. In 1737, he also cast a 1.8-tonne bell for the Church of Archangel Gabriel. Both of these bells, however, were destroyed by the Soviets in the 1930s.

Nothing is known of his origin or parentage, though he may have been a son of Sosibius of Tarentum; nor have we any account of the means by which he rose to power; but we find him immediately after the accession of Ptolemy (221 BC), exercising the greatest influence over the young king, and virtually holding the chief direction of affairs. He soon proved himself, as he is termed by Polybius, a ready and dexterous instrument of autocracy: it was by his ministration, if not at his instigation, that Ptolemy put to death in succession his uncle Lysimachus, his brother Magas, and his mother Berenice. Not long after, Cleomenes, of whose influence with the mercenary troops Sosibius had at this time dexterously availed himself, shared the same fate. While the young king gave himself up to luxury and debauchery, the whole administration of the kingdom appears to have been left to Sosibius, who allowed both the finances and military defences to fall into a state of the greatest decay, so that when Antiochus the Great declared war against Ptolemy, and invaded Coele-Syria, it was some time before the Egyptian monarch or his ministers could muster an army to oppose him. Sosibius, however, displayed some dexterity in delaying the progress of Antiochus by negotiation until he had time to organise a mercenary force: and when, in 218 BC, Ptolemy at length took the field in person, Sosibius accompanied him, and was present at the decisive battle of Raphia. After the close of the campaign he found a more congenial occupation in negotiating the terms of the treaty of peace, which Ptolemy commissioned him to arrange with Antiochus. During the remainder of the reign of Ptolemy, Sosibius seems to have retained his power, without opposition, though sharing it in some degree with the infamous Agathocles, but we have very little information with regard to the latter years of his rule. We are told, however, that he was once more the minister of Ptolemy in putting to death his wife and sister Arsinoë, as he had previously been in the murder of his other relations. But great as was the address of Sosibius in all the arts and intrigues of a courtier, he was no match for his colleague Agathocles; and although, after the death of Ptolemy Philopator (203 BC), the two ministers at first assumed in conjunction the guardianship of the young king, Ptolemy Epiphanes (203–181 BC), Sosibius seems to have been soon supplanted and put to death by his insidious rival. All particulars of these events are, however, lost to us. References *Bevan, Edwyn R.; The House of Ptolemy, London, (1927), chapter 7 *Polybius; Histories, Evelyn S.

Together with Wolverton (on the other side of the West Coast Main Line), it was built primarily to house the workers on the Wolverton railway works. The original village of Bradwell lies south of New Bradwell. History New Bradwell is roughly 150 years old. Exact dates are hard to figure, as buildings such as mill houses and farm houses existed on the site of what is now the village of New Bradwell, long before then. Around 1851 the area was little more than a hamlet, with 381 inhabitants and a local industry of stone quarrying and lime kilns. The first purpose built houses were constructed in 1854 – 1856The New Railway Colony at Wolverton (June 19, 1856). Facsimile of unspecified newspaper article as dwellings for workers in the nearby Wolverton works. By 1861 the village had 1,658 inhabitants and over 4,000 by 1906. Perhaps the most significant date was the expansion of the parish of Stantonbury on 16 July 1857. The old parish of Stanton Barry, or Stantonbury, contained but , and about a dozen scattered houses. By an Order in Council, dated 16 July 1857, a new parish was formed by adding to the old one the hamlet of New Bradwell. The area of the newly formed parish was . There was a ceremony of laying the foundations for the Church of St. James and other buildings such as the church schoolhouse on Monday 24 May 1858, which may mark the very foundations of the village of New Bradwell as an entity in its own right. The church of St. James was completed in 1860. Originally this new village was called Stantonbury after the name of the parish.article concerning expansion of the parish of Stantonbury on Clutch Club local history site Buses within living memory still had the name Stantonbury on them when they terminated in the village. The change of name seems fairly recent. From records of house deeds, the change appears to have happened in 1921. A record of deed for a house in 1920 records a property in King Edwards Street being in Stantonbury, while the following year another property in the same street is listed as being in New Bradwell. Considering how accurate such legal documents have to be, this is pretty conclusive proof that the change of name was made official at this time, but definitive research would need to be conducted to establish this as fact. From 1867 to 1964 the village was served by Bradwell railway station on the now defunct Wolverton to Newport Pagnell line. The Grand Union Canal passes between Bradwell and New Bradwell, providing boating and fishing facilities. The modern Bradwell Aqueduct was the first of its kind to be constructed over the Grand Union in over 100 years =Bradwell Blitz= When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, blackout precautions were immediately put into effect, due to the dangers of night time bombing raids. Ironically, New Bradwell's new electric street lights, which had only been completed two weeks previously, were switched off and not used again for six years. Bradwell's Blitz consisted of two bombs on Sunday 20 October 1940. First, two flares were dropped at the end of Bridge Street, landing on the allotments, now the school playing fields. An unconfirmed theory surmises that the bombs may have been aimed at the Wolverton railway works, then engaged in war work. Then the two bombs were dropped on the western end of the high street, the first landing on the road outside \\"the Laurels\\", creating a crater, the second at the end of the high street, demolishing numbers 71, 73 & 75 and killing five people. The \\"Bradwell Blitz\\" was one of the more dramatic events in this part of North Buckinghamshire. (The activities at Bletchley Park a few miles south were top secret. Nevertheless, Old Bletchley was hit by four bombs one of which hit the Park's main gate without exploding). The Bradwell Blitz was so-called because it happened during the Blitz, the fourth and last phase of the Battle of Britain. Civil parish The civil parish of New Bradwell was created in 1919 from part of the Bradwell parish, and formed part of the Wolverton Urban District urban district (with the rest of the Bradwell parish remaining in Newport Pagnell Rural District). The parish was merged into Wolverton parish in 1934. It was re-established in 2001 as part of a general parishing of all the unparished areas of Milton Keynes. The parish is bounded to the north by the Great Ouse, to the west by V6 Grafton Street, to the south by the route of the former Wolverton/Newport Pagnell railway line (now a redway) and to the east by a short stretch of the Grand Union Canal. At the 2011 census, the population of the parish was 3,109, compared with 2,990 in 2001. Sport and leisure New Bradwell has a Non-League football team New Bradwell St Peter F.C. who play at The Recreation Ground. It also has two cricket teams. New Bradwell is known in Milton Keynes for its silver band. The band has been in existence for over 100 years and is famous locally for waking the residents of New Bradwell on Christmas morning, playing carols in the street. Primary school New Bradwell School is situated on Bounty Street and is just to the side of Grafton Street and Spencer Street, an off-road street with some historic houses named 'Railway Cottages'.

He unsuccessfully approached the Maggia with a plan to kill Spider-Man.Spectacular Spider-Man #25 He attacked Peter Parker, blaming him for the death of Gwen Stacy.Spectacular Spider-Man #28-29 Carrion sought to destroy Parker/Spider-Man several times before capturing Spider-Man and revealing to him that he was a decayed clone of Professor Miles Warren, also known as the Jackal.Spectacular Spider-Man #30 Warren had created the clone and left it in a capsule to mature to full development; however Warren had then (seemingly) died and the clone was left developing in the capsule with artificially accelerated age. Something went wrong and the clone's body became like a living corpse. As Warren's clone, Carrion blamed Spider-Man for the deaths of both Warren and Gwen Stacy and sought to bring him to justice with the help of a malleable student named Randy Vale. Carrion captured Peter Parker and prepared to kill him with a giant \\"Spider-Amoeba\\" created by cloning cells from Parker. However Parker freed himself and became Spider-Man. In the subsequent fight a fire consumed the laboratory whilst the amoeba latched onto Carrion. The Spider-Amoeba suffocated Carrion, smothering him to death, and then unable to escape it perished in the fire.Spectacular Spider- Man #31 =Malcolm McBride= Many years later, Spider-Man learned from the High Evolutionary that Warren had not achieved cloning but had instead created a genetic virus that could transform existing human beings into what seemed to be genetic duplicates of other people.Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #8 This left Spider-Man wondering \\"What about Carrion?\\" As Peter Parker he searched Miles Warren's old lab and found a journal which seemingly answered many questions, though many years later the Evolutionary would cast further doubt on this. Parker was followed by his university research student rival Malcolm McBride who discovered a test tube containing a strange substance. When examining it, McBride discovered it was an advanced genetic creation that when exposed to air grew rapidly and consumed him, turning him into a second incarnation of Carrion, complete with all the knowledge and powers that the original had displayed. The new Carrion attacked Spider-Man, picking up his predecessor's cause.Spectacular Spider-Man #149 Initially this Carrion believed himself to be another clone of Warren but slowly found McBride's memories and personality trying to reassert itself. Carrion would fight against Spider-Man on several occasions. Carrion joined forces with the Hobgoblin against Spider-Man, and apparently sacrificed himself to save the mother of Malcolm McBride.Spectacular Spider-Man #162-163 Carrion turned up alive again, and teamed up with Carnage, Doppelganger, Demogoblin and Shriek on the killing spree Maximum Carnage across New York City. The mentally unstable Shriek started looking upon Carrion and the others as her and Carnage's \\"sons\\". The villains were defeated and confined to the Ravencroft mental institution. Later Shriek escaped and freed Carrion. She tried to dominate Carrion even further and encouraged him to destroy all aspects of McBride's life. However, when they confronted Spider-Man in the McBride household, McBride's mother was able to reach her son's true identity. Mrs. McBride and Shriek fought over who was the true mother. Malcolm/Carrion was driven to despair by this and tried to turn the Carrion virus upon himself. In a moment of compassion Shriek cured him of the virus. Malcolm McBride returned to Ravencroft. Later the mysterious Judas Traveller invaded Ravencroft and briefly transformed McBride back into Carrion during an encounter with Spider- Man. However at the end McBride was transformed back by Traveller and all his memories of Peter Parker as Spider-Man were wiped. Subsequently, it was revealed that many of the powers displayed by Traveller were actually illusions, so it remains unclear what really happened. =William Allen= Following the death of the Jackal his corpse was examined by agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Dr. William Allen ignored safety protocols and in the process was infected by a new, stronger version of the Carrion virus, transforming him into the third incarnation of the villain. The most deadly Carrion of all, he exhibited the further ability to use a \\"zombie plague\\" to control the minds of others, but also found that both Warren and Allen's minds fought for control of the body. As Carrion sought to infect the city with the Red Dust plague, Spider-Man confronted the High Evolutionary, who confirmed that he had deliberately sought to distort Warren's achievements by faking the journals and evidence to make it seem that Warren had never achieved true cloning. Spider-Man discovered Warren's old notes which were used to generate a cure, whilst he confronted Carrion. The latter now revealed that the original Carrion had indeed been a clone of Warren, created to incubate a virus to destroy mankind, but that it had been released too early and failed in its mission. Spider-Man subdued the new Carrion, who was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. The High Evolutionary provided data from Warren's journals that could potentially cure him.Spider-Man: Dead Man's Hand However, no cure was discovered for William, so he has been kept in stasis in a secure S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man 2005 Carrion was at some point incarcerated in Negative Zone Prison Alpha. When Blastaar and his forces invade the facility in search of its portal to Earth, Star-Lord forces Carrion to help him send a telepathic distress signal to Mantis and the other Guardians of the Galaxy.Guardians of the Galaxy #9 Carrion later appears as a member of the Shadow Council's incarnation of the Masters of Evil.Secret Avengers #29 =Sentient virus= A new version of Carrion, engineered by the Jackal, ran rampant through New York, jumping from one host body to the next (taking control of them in the interim). After being pursued across the city by Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body), the Carrion virus took hold of Hyperion's body. After a brief battle with the Avengers, the Carrion virus was thought to have been destroyed by Superior Spider-Man. However, it was able to regenerate itself and returned to its creator.Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #1 The Carrion virus joined the Jackal and a clone of Miles Warren in their battle against Superior Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider.Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #2 During the fight, it attempted to take control of Scarlet Spider's mind, but was stymied by the \\"Other\\" within him.Scarlet Spider #20 During the Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy storyline, Kaine and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 rescue Spider-Man from Jackal. Afterwards, Kaine reveals to Spider-Man that he and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 came to this world to assist Spider-Man because they saw that apparently Spider-Man allying with the Jackal's offer on other worlds results in a global disaster in the form of the Carrion Virus.The Clone Conspiracy #2 Doctor Octopus pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying. Spider-Woman of Earth-65 escapes with Kaine as the Carrion Virus starts spreading which causes Anna to also be affected. Spider-Man tries to appeal to Ben, but Jackal ignores him and takes over J. Jonah's broadcast to tell the world that they will all die and be reborn.The Clone Conspiracy #4 Spider-Man hacks into the Webware Emergency System from Parker Industries and switches it to evoke from every Parker Industries device on the planet, which sends out a large signal that stops some of the other victims from decaying.The Clone Conspiracy #5 Powers and abilities The creature called Carrion is created when a genetic replicator virus derived from the mutated DNA of Professor Miles Warren comes into contact with a human being. The original Carrion had superhuman strength and durability, and could reduce the density of his body to become virtually intangible. He could disintegrate organic matter to ash just by touching it. He also had the powers of telepathy, self-levitation, and telekinesis of organic matter. Carrion also developed a chemical substance called Red Dust which can either render a victim unconscious, or act as a corrosive acid that can burn through flesh, metal, and other substances. Carrion has access to the scientific equipment used by Miles Warren in his \\"cloning\\" experiments. Malcolm McBride, as Carrion, apparently had access to the same set of powers as the original, but had not yet taken the time to explore and hone his powers to the extent of his predecessor. He had not yet demonstrated the ability to become intangible or use telekinesis, and merely has a sense of intuition bordering on telepathy. The sentient Carrion virus is able to infect and control victims without altering their bodies, allowing it to hide within them.Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #1 If allowed to remain in one body long enough, it will be permanently bonded to it. The virus is resilient enough to reform itself after near-destruction. It can assume a bodily form of its own, one which resembles the previous Carrions. In this form, it can create a vapor that, when breathed in, allows him to control minds.Scarlet Spider #20 Other versions =Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy= During the Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy, the Jackal begins \\"reanimating\\" the deceased loved ones and enemies of Spider-Man, though a flaw in the resurrection process causes those brought back by it to degenerate into zombie-like Carrions unless they take a special pill daily. In numerous unidentified realities where Parker Industries allied with the Jackal's company New U Technologies, the degeneration becomes contagious and spreads uncontrollably, turning all of humanity into mindless hordes of Carrions.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4 #21 =Spider-Man: Heroes & Villains= Malcom McBride appears in Spider-Man: Heroes & Villains.Spider-Man: Heroes & Villains Collection #40. Marvel Comics. In other media =Video games= * The Malcolm McBride version of Carrion appears as a recurring villain in the mid-1990s Sega Genesis / Super Nes video game called Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage. He is one of the villains recruited by Carnage to help create chaos in New York. Carrion appears with Doppelganger and Shriek numerous times in the game and hovers above the player's character attempting to grab the character's head and destroy the character. The player has to defeat him numerous times on several levels with other villains. =Novels= * Per the Spider-Man novel Spider-Man: Requiem, Stanley Carter was infected by the Carrion Virus by the Cabal of Scrier, bringing Stanley back to life in an attempt to steal the Darkhold from S.H.I.E.L.D. Spider-Man and the new Stanley Carter/Carrion battled for a while but eventually Carter began to fight with Carrion for control of his own body and when the Cabal of Scrier brought back the ancient god Chthon (which would destroy the world) Carter/Carrion gave up his own life to stop the god. While Stanley was still alive he had hidden from the authorities in his uncle Emory Carter's house and Emory had been infected by the Carrion virus when he was around Stanley. When Stanley died Emory became the next Carrion but was later defeated by Spider-Man.

He ruled for 22 years according to the Babylonian King List C, and was the most prominent monarch of this dynasty. He is best known for his victory over Elam and the recovery of the cultic idol of Marduk. Biography He is unrelated to his later namesake, Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur II, who has come to be known by the Hebrew form of his name “Nebuchadnezzar.” Consequently, it is anachronistic but not inappropriate to apply this designation retroactively to the earlier king, as he does not make an appearance in the Bible. He is misidentified in the Chronicle Concerning the Reign of Šamaš-šuma-ukinŠamaš-šuma-ukin Chronicle (ABC 15), tablet BM 96273. as the brother of Širikti-šuqamuna probably in place of Ninurta-kudurrῑ-uṣur I. He succeeded his father, Ninurta-nādin-šumi, and was succeeded in turn by his son Enlil-nādin-apli, brother Marduk-nādin- aḫḫē and then nephew Marduk-šāpik-zēri, the only members of this family known to have reigned during the dynasty. The Enmeduranki legend, or the Seed of kingship,The seed of kingship tablet K 4874. is a Sumero-Akkadian composition relating his endowment with perfect wisdom (nam-kù-zu) by the god Marduk and his claim to belong to a “distant line of kingship from before the flood” and to be an “offspring of Enmeduranki, king of Sippar.” It begins with a lament over preceding events: =War with Elam= Kudurru of Nebuchadnezzar I with inscription The duration of Nebuchadnezzar's war with Elam and the number of campaigns he conducted are not known, though it is reasonable to believe that this was a protracted effort with diverse strategic considerations. According to a later literary tradition, an invasion of Elam was thwarted when his army was struck by plague and he narrowly escaped death in the stampede to return home. A raid, or šiḫṭu, commemorated in a kudurru created during his reign describes a successful campaign. In this raid he was accompanied by the Kassite chieftain Šitti-Marduk who struck the decisive blow, he was able to overrun Elam in a surprise attack conducted from Dēr during the hottest of the summer months, Dumuzi, when According to the kudduru, Nebuchadnezzar routed the Elamite king Ḫulteludiš-Inšušinak on the banks of the river Ulaya in an engagement that saw the dust of the battle darkening the sky. No contemporary or later source records a sack of Susa by Nebuchadnezzar, but according to another kudurru he was able to retrieve the statue of Marduk (here called Bēl) and that of the goddess Il-āliya (DINGIR.URU-ia) during this or another campaign.Stone tablet BM 92987, BBSt 24 7-12. The campaign destroyed Elam as a power and provided a defining moment for the Babylonians akin to the siege of Troy for the ancient Greeks. This famous victory was celebrated in hymns, & epic poetry; and alluded to in the Marduk prophecy.Marduk Prophecy tablet K. 2158+. Known as “Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur and Marduk” or the Epic of Nabû-kudurrī- uṣurThe Epic of Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur, K.3426 (published as CT 13 48). a poetic document dealing with the legendary story of his recovery of the statue of Marduk; and is one of two hymns glorify his military achievements. It opens with the king in despair, lamenting over the absence of Marduk, \\"beautiful Babylon pass through your heart, Turn your face toward (your temple) Esagila, which you love!” Stele of Nebudhadnezzar I. British Museum The Hymn to Marduk,The Hymn to Marduk, DT 71. celebrating victory over the Elamites, is assigned to him rather than Ashurbanipal who had a similar triumph, on stylistic grounds. There is a poetic pseudo-autobiography,Tablet K.2660, 3R 38. which does not actually mention him by name. An interlinear Sumero- Akkadian textTablet BM 99067 K 3444, duplicated as K 3317 K 3319 K 5190 BM 35000. describes the events preceding the return of the statue from Elam and its joyous installation in Babylon. A seventh-century astrological report alludes to observations made during his reign and their relationship to his devastation of Elam. =Other conflicts= The Synchronistic HistorySynchronistic History, tablets K4401a + Rm 854, ii 1–13. relates his entente cordiale with his contemporary, the Assyrian king Aššur-rēša-iši I,Synchronistic King List 2-3 (KAV 12). and subsequently the outcome of two military campaigns against the border fortresses of Zanqi and Idi that he conducted in violation of this agreement. The first was curtailed by the arrival of Aššur-rēša-iši’s main force, causing Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur to burn his siege engines and flee, while the second resulted in a battle in which the Assyrians apparently triumphed, “slaughtered his troops (and) carried off his camp.” It even reports the capture of the Babylonian field marshal, Karaštu. He is titled as the conqueror of the Amorite lands,KUR.MAR.TU.KI. “despoiler of the Kassites,” in the Šittti-Marduk kudurru, despite the beneficiary being a Kassite chieftain and ally, and having smitten the mighty Lullubû with weapons. =Domestic affairs= His construction activities are memorialized in building inscriptions of the Ekituš-ḫegal-tila, temple of Adad, in Babylon, on bricks from the temple of Enlil in Nippur and appear in the later king Simbar-Šipak’s reference to his having built the throne of Enlil for the Ekur- igigal in Nippur. A late Babylonian inventory lists his donations of gold vessels in Ur and Nabonidus, ca. 555 to 539 BC, consulted his stele for the ēntu-priestess. The earliest of three extant economic texts is dated to his eighth year. Together with three kudurrus and a stone memorial tablet, these are the only contemporary commercial or administrative records extant. Apart from the two deeds related to the Elamite campaign, the other kudurruThe Hinke Kudurru year 16. bears witness to a land grant to the nišakku of Nippur, a certain Nudku-ibni. His name appears on four Lorestān bronze daggers and there is a prayer to Marduk on two more. He may be the Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur who is mentioned in the Chronicle of Market PricesChronicle of Market Prices (ABC 23), BM 48498, line 13. which records his ninth year but the context is lost. =Period literature= The Uruk List of Sages and ScholarsW 20030,7 the Seleucid List of Sages and Scholars, recovered from Anu’s Bīt Rēš temple during the 1959/60 excavation. names Šaggil-kīnam-ubbib as the ummânu, or sage, who served under him and the later king Adad-apla-iddina when he would author the Babylonian Theodicy, and several literary texts are thought to originate from his age, written in both Sumerian and Akkadian. Lambert has suggested that it was during his reign that Marduk was elevated to the head of the pantheon, displacing Enlil and that the Enûma Eliš was possibly composed, but some historians claim an origin during the earlier Kassite dynasty. A text concerning chemical process (imitations for precious stones) bears a colophon identifying it as a copy of an older Babylonian original but places it in his library.

Recorded following their first world tour, the album was their first release on Om Records (the label would later re-release the duo's first album the following year). The release spawned three singles, each selling their entire first pressing run of 15,000 copies, and a second world tour. Background In 1999, People Under The Stairs signed a four-album deal with Om Records, and the title of their second album, Question in the Form of an Answer, came to them while driving up to San Francisco to meet with the Om staff. Om offered them a cash advance on the record deal, and the group immediately went to a local record store, Groove Merchant, and used the money to buy a large number of records, several of which would contain samples that wound up being used on the record.Portugal, Christopher (August 2013). 10 Years Of Thes One. Booklet accompanying box set release. Recording Planned as a logical extension of their first record, Question in the Form of an Answer opened with the same music sample that the previous album closed on. Also similar to the first album, Question... was self-recorded at Thes One's Los Angeles home, and utilized the same instrumentation - namely, Thes One's Akai MPC3000 and Double K's E-mu SP-1200. Despite the similarities, the music departed from the sound of the debut album. Thes One and Double K's knowledge of sampling techniques had grown during the intervening years between the first two albums, and the music on their second release contained more complex filtering techniques, sound manipulation, and analogue recording techniques. \\"Earth Travelers\\", the first music track made for the album, incorporates a large number of layers, including high- and low-pass filters, resonance, horn loops, and drum loops. The creation of a portion of the track can be seen on the bonus DVD which accompanies PUTS' 2006 release Stepfather. The lyrics also toned down the more aggressive themes and battle rap sensibilities of their first album, and instead, the rhymes covered topics including record collecting, recreational drinking and marijuana use (which was at its peak for the group during the recording of this album), and making music. This album also contained fewer guest MCs than The Next Step, and every record since Question... has continued this practice. In the same manner as \\"San Francisco Knights\\" from the group's first album, People Under The Stairs decided to include a true personal story, \\"July 3rd\\", on their second release as well. On July 3, 1999, Thes One was hit by a minivan while crossing the street at the corner of W 3rd St and S Hobart Blvd in Los Angeles, and the driver of the minivan attempted to kidnap him and drive away. Several bystanders, including a video store security guard stopped the man, and a bloodied Thes One was taken to the hospital. This album is the only People Under The Stairs release to contain a hidden track. The hidden track on this album consists of two minutes of \\"shout outs\\" to friends and fellow hip hop artists. Reception The album received positive, but subdued, reviews upon its release. Entertainment Weekly called the album \\"intelligent and funky\\", and AllMusic dubbed Question... \\"a very solid hip-hop album from top to bottom\\". PopMatters was much more enthusiastic in its review, calling PUTS' second album \\"a thoroughly fresh celebration of hip-hop\\" and \\"a funky blast of fresh air\\".

Career Born Josie Jones in Dallas, Texas, Cotton sang with Dallas bands and then moved to Los Angeles, California. She met Larson Paine in Hollywood, and the two began dating. Larson and his brother Bobby gave her \\"Johnny, Are You Queer?\\", previously performed by The Go-Go's, to record as a demo. After the first label to sign her folded, Bomp! Records released the song as a single. The performance of the single attracted the attention of Elektra Records, which re-released the single and a full album, with the future Kingdom Come member Johnny B Frank on keyboards, in 1982. The Convertible Music LP has music reminiscent of the 1960s girl group tradition. Cotton made an appearance in the 1983 film Valley Girl, singing \\"Johnny, Are You Queer?\\", \\"He Could Be the One\\" and \\"School Is In\\" during the film's prom scene. In 1984, Elektra issued Cotton's follow-up album, From the Hip, which returned a minor hit with the cover of Looking Glass' \\"Jimmy Loves Maryann\\" (with guitar by Lindsey Buckingham). In 1986, Cotton appeared in a minor role as the character Silver Ring in the John McTiernan horror film Nomads opposite Adam Ant and Pierce Brosnan. \\"Johnny Are You Queer?\\" was later used in Jackass: Number Two during the \\"Anaconda Ballpit\\" stunt. The punk band Screeching Weasel covered the song on their 1994 album How to Make Enemies and Irritate People. In 1993, Cotton recorded Frightened by Nightingales (as Josey Cotton), a collection of songs by the songwriter/violinist/self promoter Bill Rhea. Continuing to work behind the scenes, Cotton co-founded B-Girl Records, which issued recordings by Goldenboy and Alaska!. An album of her own music, The Influence of Fear on Salesmen, was planned for release in 2002 on B-Girl but failed to materialize under that title. Cotton released Movie Disaster Music in 2006, followed by Invasion of the B-Girls, a collection of B-movie theme song covers, also produced in part by Bill Rhea, in 2007. Building on the critical success for these recordings, Cotton released Pussycat Babylon in late 2010. As of May 2018, \\"Johnny Are You Queer\\" ranks at No. 80 on VH1's list of the Top 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s. Wikipedia once listed her birth name as Kathleen Josey, so she was asked where Cotton came from. But in a 2009 interview with Magnet Magazine, she set the record straight: \\"I was actually born Josie Jones. My mother kept marrying and taking her maiden name back - she was married six times.

Life Portrait sketch by Colesworthey Grant Born in Spitalfields, London, Wilson was educated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford (BA, 1802; MA, 1804; DD, 1832); was ordained and became curate of Richard Cecil at Cobham and Bisley in Surrey, where he developed into a strong Evangelical preacher; was tutor or vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and minister of Worton, Oxfordshire, 1807 to 1812; assistant curate at St John's Chapel, Bedford Row, Bloomsbury, 1808 to 1812 (where Richard Cecil had earlier been incumbent); sole minister there, 1812 to 1824; and vicar of St Mary's Church, Islington, 1824 to 1832, when he was consecrated Bishop of Calcutta and first Metropolitan of India and Ceylon. He founded an English church at Rangoon, Ceylon, in 1855 and St Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta (consecrated 1847). He was an indefatigable worker and as bishop was noted for fidelity and firmness. He also founded Dhaka College on 18 July 1841. It was completed in 1846 with the aid of the Bishop of Calcutta. Wilson founded the Islington Clerical Conference in 1827 in his library. In 1831, Wilson was one of the founders of the Lord's Day Observance Society. He was associated with the Clapham Sect of evangelical Anglicans, the best known of whom is William Wilberforce. In 1835, Wilson was noted for calling India's caste system \\"a cancer\\". He died in Calcutta in 1858 and is buried in St. Paul's Cathedral, Kolkata. Family Daniel Wilson, the younger When Bishop Wilson left for India, his son Daniel Frederick Wilson, who was only twenty- seven at the time, took over as Vicar of Islington and served as such for over forty years. Another son became a missionary to indigenous Canadians in the Diocese of Algoma in the Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario.Church Bells Vol.5 No.210 p.50 (2 January 1875) W.

He spent the largest part of his career at the Telegraph newspaper titles, eventually becoming editor of The Sunday Telegraph for several years. He left the newspaper in 1997. Worsthorne was a conservative-leaning political journalist, who wrote columns and leaders for many years.  Early life, school and military service  Worsthorne was born in Chelsea, the younger son of General Alexander Lexy Koch de Gooreynd, a Belgian banker who had served his country in World War I, and Priscilla Reyntiens, an English Roman Catholic and the granddaughter of the 12th Earl of Abingdon.Bruce Anderson \\"Peregrine Worsthorne at 90: still colourful and indiscreet\\", Telegraph.co.uk, 22 December 2013 The family name was anglicised following the birth of Worsthorne's older brother Simon Towneley, who from 1976 to 1996 was the Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire.Adrian Room Dictionary of Pseudonyms: 13,000 Assumed Names and Their Origins, Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, p. 514, citing an article in Punch, 26 October – 1 November 1996 by Nigel Dempster The two boys were baptised Roman Catholic, but did not attend Catholic denominational schools. Worsthorne's mother divorced his father when he was five years old, and shortly afterwards married Sir Montagu Norman, then the Governor of the Bank of England. As a consequence of the split, the family butler effectively raised the two brothers for several years. \\"Unhappy as some of my formative experiences were, all in all, it was pretty good soil for someone wanting to go into public life\\", he would later recall, commenting on the tradition of public duty and service so prevalent in his family and his family's social circle.Peregrine Worsthorne (2004) In Defence of Aristocracy, Harper Collin. Worsthorne's biological father reverted his name to Koch de Gooreynd in 1937 and lived in Rhodesia for several years; Worsthorne discovered in the early 1960s that a half-brother was born during this period. Worsthorne was educated at Stowe School, where, he wrote, he was once seduced on the art room chaise-longue by George Melly, a fellow pupil who was later a jazz singer and writer,Worsthorne (1977) p.90-91 but Melly always denied it happened. One other pupil, Colin Welch, became a lifelong friend. Welch also had a career in journalism, and persuaded Worsthorne to apply to Peterhouse, Cambridge.Richard West Obituary: Colin Welch, The Independent, 29 January 1997 He began his studies at the college in 1942, having won an exhibition to read History. The master of Peterhouse at that time was the Conservative academic Herbert Butterfield. As was normal practice Worsthorne was called up for war service after three terms; he was rusticated during the last term. In army training with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, however, he injured his shoulder and after being admitted to a hospital in Oxford was able to persuade Magdalen College, Oxford, to admit him for a term. After receiving his commission on 4 June 1943, Worsthorne saw active service in Phantom during the Italian campaign with the philosopher Michael Oakeshott, and was part of the occupying force in Hamburg for three months in 1945. Worsthorne returned to Peterhouse and took his degree a year early, gaining a second.  Early career in journalism  Worsthorne entered the newspaper industry as a sub- editor on The Glasgow Herald in 1946, on a two-year training program for Oxbridge graduates. He then worked for The Times from 1948 on the Foreign Desk, again as a sub-editor in his first year there. During this time he was called into the office of the newspaper's editor William Casey, who then told him: \\"Dear Boy, The Times is a stable of hacks and a thoroughbred like you will never be at home here\\".Worsthorne (1999) p. 117 He became a correspondent in Washington (1950–52), where his advocacy of Senator Joe McCarthy's pursuit of communist subversion in the United States government eventually led to a split with the more circumspect Times, and, in 1953, he joined The Daily Telegraph.Greenslade (2003 [2004]), p. 525 Despite moving to a newspaper more suited to his politics, Worsthorne nevertheless left The Times with some regret, feeling that working for any other title in Fleet Street could only be anti-climactic, and that working conditions at The Telegraph were inferior to those at The Times, then based at Printing House Square. At this time he also contributed articles to the magazine Encounter (then covertly funded by the CIA). In a November 1954 article discussing McCarthyism titled \\"America: Conscience or Shield?\\", he wrote that America's flaws were something the British would have to accept for their own benefit, because: \\"legend created an American god. The god has failed. But unlike the Communist god which, on closer examination, turned out to be a devil, the American god has just become human\\".Quoted in Saunders (1999 [2000] p. 204, also summarised in Worsthorne (1993) pp.161–62 Later he favourably compared a post-war America which \\"put its faith in the [intellectual elites]\\" over a Britain dedicated to the \\"masses\\".  At The Sunday Telegraph  =Deputy editor (1961–76)= In 1961 Worsthorne was appointed as the first deputy editor of The Sunday Telegraph; a job with fewer responsibilities than its title implies, and in his autobiography Worsthorne expressed some regret that he rejected an offer to become editor of The Yorkshire Post. In due course though, he became a leading columnist on his newspaper, taking a Conservative High Tory stance. Worsthorne mourned the loss of the British Empire; he once argued that the public's acceptance of decolonisation was paralleled by their acquiescence to socialism. Of the Six-Day War in 1967 he wrote an article titled \\"Triumph of the Civilised\\": > \\"Last week a tiny Western community, surrounded by immensely superior > numbers of the underdeveloped peoples, has shown itself able to impose its > will on the Arabs today almost as effortlessly as the first whites were able > to do on the Afro-Asian native in the imperial heyday\\". The following year, after Enoch Powell's speech in April 1968 on the perceived threat of non-white immigration, he argued that voluntary repatriation was the \\"only honest course\\".Quoted in Greenslade (2003 [2004]) p. 234 In common with his friend the journalist Paul Johnson, he advocated the recolonisation of former colonies. In September 1991, he advocated \\"a new form of imperialism directed against the countries of the Third World\\" intended to create an \\"anti-barbarian alliance\\" to control the use of weapons by \\"primitive peoples.\\" In his view nothing could be done about famines \\"without the advanced countries re-exerting political control – i.e., a return to colonialism.\\" In 1965 he defended the declaration of independence by the white minority government of Ian Smith in Rhodesia. Worsthorne, in an article on the Sunday following the declaration, wrote: > Just as in the light of history Lord North has been judged wrong for > refusing to give independence to the white slave owners in America, so will > Mr Harold Wilson be for refusing to give it to the white supremacists of > Southern Africa.Quoted in Worsthorne (1993) p. 236 Worsthorne initially accepted Britain's entry into the European Economic Community. After the publication of the Heath Government's 1971 White Paper, he wrote in a Daily Telegraph column that the \\"Europeans\\" deserved to win in the battle over British entry. \\"The sceptics have failed to produce an alternative faith\\", he argued.Greenslade (2003 [2004]) p. 293 By the time of the imminent Single European Act of 1992, however, he wrote in The Sunday Telegraph of 4 August 1992 that: \\"Twenty years ago, when the process began, ... there was no question of losing sovereignty. That was a lie, or at any rate, a dishonest obfuscation\\",William F. Jasper \\"EU Official: Pooling Sovereignty, Once 'Unthinkable,' Now 'the Model'\\", The New American, 12 July 2013 in contradiction of the Treaty of Rome's commitment (1957) to an \\"ever closer union\\". On the BBC's Nationwide programmeChristopher Howse \\"A four- letter word on teatime television\\", Telegraph website, 13 November 2008 in March 1973, he was the second person on the nation's television to say \\"fuck\\", when asked if the general public were concerned that a Conservative Government minister Lord Lambton (his future father-in-law) had shared a bed with two call girls. Worsthorne said in 2013: \\"There's a possibility it wasn't spontaneous. Apparently I took advice about it before in El Vino's. I don't remember. To the best of my knowledge, it was the mot juste.\\"Harry Mount \\"'The pure pleasure of annoying people' – Peregrine Worsthorne at 90\\", The Spectator, 14 December 2013 The use of the swear word on television cost him the opportunity to edit The Daily Telegraph, as its then owner Lord Hartwell strongly objected to Worsthorne's comment and was persuaded to bar him from appearing on television for six months. Worsthorne was, nevertheless, promoted to associate editor in 1976. =Associate editor (1976–86)= Worsthorne argued in 1978 that the possible advance of \\"socialism\\" created an \\"urgent need ... for the state to regain control over 'the people', to re-exert its authority ...\\"Peregrine Worsthorne \\"Too Much Freedom\\", in Maurice Cowling Conservative Essays, London: Cassell, 1978, pp.140–54, 149, 148, 147, 140, 154 in the context of Britain \\"being allowed to spin into chaos\\". He was critical of Margaret Thatcher's connection of domestic socialism with the form in the Eastern bloc as he did not perceive this as being in line with the experiences of most of the population (the \\"untalented majority\\"). He saw \\"the needs and values of the strong\\" as something which \\"should obsess the popular imagination\\" of \\"all healthy societies\\". He defended the conduct of Pinochet's forces in the 1973 Chilean coup, and wrote that he hoped the British army would launch a coup in Britain if a radical minority socialist government should ever enter power. In 1978 Worsthorne did not see the potential for elements of his views (the end of socialism as an alternative in Britain) to be reflected in the forthcoming change of government (in what the political scientist Andrew Gamble came to call \\"the free economy and the strong state\\"). In the year before Thatcher's election he wrote that her government \\"is not going to make all that much difference [...] Her proposals amount in effect to very little: a controlled experiment in using market methods to improve the workings of social democracy\\".Quoted in Greenslade (2003 [2004]) p.362 \\"We put too much emphasis on Mrs. Thatcher forming a government\\", Worsthorne said on the BBC's election night programme late on 3 May 1979 as the results were about to come in. \\"It will really be Conservative ideas and Conservative policies that have formed a government. I don't think that she's articulated it very well.\\" He wrote an article When Treason Can Be Right in the Sunday Telegraph on 4 November 1979, in which he said that he would accept a request to work with the CIA to undermine a Labour Government in the UK. A quote from this article appears in some copies of the novel A Very British Coup, in which the main conspirator is named Sir Peregrine. =Editor and later responsibilities (1986–91)= After Conrad Black's holding company gained 80% of the company stock in 1986, Worsthorne was finally able to become editor of The Sunday Telegraph, though in the end only for three years. In 1989 the Telegraph titles briefly became a seven-day operation under Max Hastings, with the bulk of The Sunday Telegraph edited by Trevor Grove. Worsthorne's responsibilities were reduced to the three comment pages by the editor-in- chief Andrew Knight, who sacked Worsthorne as editor over lunch in Claridge's.Greenslade (2003 [2004]), p.526 The lofty ethos of the comment pages, with contributors including Bruce Anderson, was captured in their nickname, 'Worsthorne College'. This arrangement continued until September 1991 when Worsthorne's commitments were reduced to his weekly column. In January 1990, Worsthorne was the defendant in a libel case brought by Andrew Neil and The Sunday Times, over a March 1989 editorial \\"Playboys as Editors\\" in The Sunday Telegraph which claimed that as a result of Neil's involvement with Pamella Bordes, he and The Observers Donald Trelford (also involved with Bordes) should not serve as editors of their titles. (The Independent on Sunday, the other British quality Sunday, did not begin publication until January 1990.) The Sunday Telegraph had accused Neil of knowing that Bordes was a prostitute, which according to Roy Greenslade, he certainly did not know,Greenslade (2003 [2004]), p.504 a fact which the Telegraph had accepted by the time of the court case, but still defended the two articles (one was not by Worsthorne) as fair comment. Neil won the defamation case, being awarded damages of £1,000,Ben Summerskill \\"Paper tiger\\", The Observer, 28 July 2002 and his paper won its then cover price of 60p.Greenslade (2003 [2004]), p.505 Earlier, in March 1988, Worsthorne had said Neil was a \\"brilliant editor\\", according to an entry in the diary of his friend, Woodrow Wyatt. \\"The job of journalism is not to be scholarly\\", Worsthorne commented in 1989. \\"The most that can be achieved by an individual newspaper or journalist is the articulation of an intelligent, well-thought-out, coherent set of prejudices – ie, a moral position.\\" Worsthorne received a knighthood in the 1991 New Year Honours for services to journalism. Views concerning homosexuality Worsthorne long criticised homosexual activity, castigating Roy Jenkins in particular in a 1982 editorial for his tolerance of \\"queers\\".Obituary: Professor Peter Campbell, Telegraph.co.uk, 15 June 2005 At the time of the debate over Section 28 in January 1988 he appeared on BBC Radio Three's Third Ear programme and persistently referred to gay men as \\"them\\", which caused the other interviewee, Ian McKellen, to come out by saying, \\"I'm one of them myself\\". Worsthorne also said on the programme that not being gay was \\"a close-run thing\\" for some of his contemporaries.\\"Third Ear: Section 28\\", BBC Radio 3, 27 January 1988, BBC Archive website In a 2011 article for the London Evening Standard, in reference to the 1930s, Worsthorne said \\"I think more boys would have gone gay if there hadn't been such a price to pay for it\\". He later accepted the possibility of same sex marriages, believing they allow gay people to form \\"stable relationships\\" and even argued that Conservatives should embrace political correctness as a form of modern courtesy.  Later life and career (1993–2020)  In 1993, Worsthorne criticised the legacy of Margaret Thatcher's government; during the 1980s, his ambivalence to what he saw as her \\"bourgeois triumphalism\\" resulted in Worsthorne and the Telegraph being out of favour at 10 Downing Street for some time.Worsthorne (1993), p.256 In 2005 he argued that Thatcher's \\"utterly un-Tory ideological excesses left such a bad taste in the mouth of the English people as to make Conservatism henceforth unpalatable, except as a last resort in the absence of a less dire alternative\\".Peregrine Worsthorne \\"Trouble in the ranks\\", New Statesman, 28 March 2005 He added: \\"For many of our people, life in the late 20th and in the 21st Century will be repulsive, brutal, and short as well.\\" His weekly article in The Sunday Telegraph was discontinued in 1997 during the editorship of Dominic Lawson, who said that Worsthorne's column had run its \\"natural lifespan\\".Greenslade (2003 [2004]), pp .646–47 From that point, Worsthorne became critical of Conrad Black's wife, Barbara Amiel, and Black himself for his newspapers' uncritical support for Israel and the foreign policies of the United States.Ciar Byrne \\"Worsthorne criticises Israeli bias of Telegraph owner's wife\\", The Guardian, 17 October 2002Peregrine Worsthorne \\"Time to speak for England\\", New Statesman, 21 October 2002 In 1997 he criticised the \\"great and irreversible changes in society\\" and said of a changing Britain that \\"this is not a country I recognise or am particularly fond of any more\\". In 1999, Worsthorne said that only a federal Europe can stop the abolition of Britain, arguing that \\"the European Right (and Left for that matter) has no fear of the strong state, no hang-ups about individual liberty, which is why it is as willing to use the power of the state to curb the excesses of free speech and a free media, as of free enterprise or free trade\\".Peregrine Worsthorne \\"As I Was Saying: Only a federal Europe can stop the abolition of Britain\\", The Spectator, 3 September 1999 In the early 2000s, in reference to nuclear weapons and the possibility of nuclear war during the Cold War, he said \\"would some historian emerging centuries later from the post-thermonuclear war Dark Ages have judged (pressing the button) morally justified, or so evil as to dwarf even the most monstrous inequities of Hitler, Stalin and Mao? ... How could we have believed anything so preposterous?\\".cited by Jakob von Uexkull \\"Our World Needs A Different Human Story\\", International Peace Foundation (Bangkok), 14–25 March 2004 In 2004 he released a book called In Defence of Aristocracy. In a speech at the Athenaeum Club on 19 June 2006, titled \\"Liberalism failed to set us free. Indeed, it enslaved us\\", he criticised liberalism and aspects of meritocracy; as well as the \\"liberal triumphalism\\" of the \\"West's victory in the Cold War left liberalism as the only ism still backed by a world superpower\\". In the 2000s he regularly contributed book reviews to the New Statesman, and was still a subscriber to the magazine in the 2010s. He told Jason Cowley of the New Statesman in a 2016 interview: \\"I've always thought the English aristocracy so marvellous compared to other ruling classes. It seemed to me that we had got a ruling class of such extraordinary historical excellence, which is rooted in England almost since the Norman Conquest.\\" In his Athenaeum Club speech in 2006 he noted the emergence of David Cameron in a positive light, seeing in him \\"the return of the English gentleman.\\" By December 2013, having met Cameron only once, he was more sceptical: \\"Cameron fits into that gentlemanly tradition but he's very embarrassed and awkward about it.\\" Bruce Anderson observed of Worsthorne, \\"my dear friend and master\\", on his 90th birthday in December 2013: \\"Throughout his career, Perry defended conventions, while also defying them.\\" Private life and death Worsthorne married Claudie Bertrande Baynham (née de Colasse)Burke's Landed Gentry, 1965 edition, Koch de Goreynd in 1950, with whom he had a daughter (Dominique) and stepson (David Anthony Lloyd Baynham). Claudie died in 1990. In 1991 he married the architectural writer Lucinda Lambton. A portrait of the couple, by Denis Waugh, is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London. As of 2013, the couple lived in Buckinghamshire. Worsthorne publicly advocated for Lambton and her sisters to inherit properties and fortunes from their father. Worsthome died on 4 October 2020 at the age of 96.

Known for its verdant green hills, crystal clear waters and white sand beaches, the village of Port Olry offers tourists access to two local nature reserve islands, via an underwater sandbar traversed at low tide. Port Olry has a large Catholic population, and is home to a Catholic mission. In 1998, Port Olry was hit hard by Tropical Cyclone Zuman, but it has since recovered, and living standards and amenities have noticeably improved in the village. Economy The local economy is heavily dependent on fishing, a traditional male role, while many females find work gardening. Port Olry produces octopus, beef, copra, and cocoa. The economy is male-centric, women are usually not given a say in typical daily business deals, and rely on their husbands. Port Olry's standard of living has improved since 2009, and citizens now enjoy electricity, tar-sealed roads, improved healthcare (a renovated health centre with new facilities), commercial bank access (NBV - Vanuatu's own bank branch), a new post office branch, a renovation for its secondary school, new restaurants, bungalows along the beach, and more retail shops. Transportation to Luganville, the largest town in the area, is usually done by taxi and bus. However, locals often hitchhike on trucks travelling to the town, typically loaded with bags of copra and other market products. Education Education in the village follows the French system. Parents usually send their children to the village schools, Saint Anne Primary and Saint Anne Secondary. Children who perform well in their Year 6 examinations can pursue their secondary studies in Saint Anne's branch, or choose to attend other schools around Luganville, Sanma Province, and even schools in other parts of the country. A lot of Port Olry children earn higher education qualifications (Year 14 certificates, Year 13, 12, 10), and a few earn bachelor's degrees from the University of the South Pacific, with campuses in Suva, Fiji, and Port Vila, Vanuatu's capital. Cyclone Zuman In 1998, Tropical Cyclone Zuman hit Vanuatu. On Espiritu Santo Island, over 100 buildings were destroyed or damaged, and an estimated 60-70% of crops were destroyed. Port Orly was hit hard, with 95% of buildings and gardens reporting some sort of damage. As part of the relief effort, the town was donated 50 tarpaulins to provide shelter for those affected by the disaster.

In 1988, aged 35, Bölöni left the country to play in Belgium at Racing Jet Bruxelles and then in France at US Créteil. He retired from professional football in 1992. On 25 March 2008 he was decorated by the president of Romania, Traian Băsescu with Ordinul \\"Meritul Sportiv\\" — (The Order \\"The Sportive Merit\\") class II for his part in winning the 1986 European Cup Final. =International= Playing for the Romanian national team in 1983, Bölöni scored one of his most vital goals ever, in the 1–0 win against Italy in a Euro 84 qualification match which eventually proved invaluable to the country's qualification for the tournament. At the finals themselves in France, he played in all three of Romania's games, and scored the equaliser in the 1–1 draw with Spain in Saint-Etienne. In total, Bölöni won 102 caps for Romania and scored 23 goals (108/25 including Olympic games qualification).http://eu-football.info/_player.php?id=2233 Coaching career As a football coach, Bölöni started with French club AS Nancy-Lorraine, where he was head coach for several years. He promoted with the team in Ligue 1. In 2000, he was appointed as national team coach, but in the summer of 2001 decided to leave the job. Then he joined Portugal's club Sporting Clube de Portugal, where he won both the Portuguese championship and cup in his first year. He was fired at the end of the next season due to mediocre results. His legacy at Sporting was the introduction of youth team players such as Ricardo Quaresma, Hugo Viana and Cristiano Ronaldo into the senior's team starting lineup. In 2003, he returned to France as manager of Stade Rennais; in 2005, he managed the team to their best position in history (4th in Ligue 1), and a subsequent UEFA Cup qualification. In May 2006, Bölöni signed a two-year contract with AS Monaco but was fired on 23 October for lack of results (Monaco being 19th out of 20 in the league by that date). On 9 June 2008, Belgian team Standard Liège appointed Bölöni as their new manager, as he succeeded Michel Preud'homme, who led the club to their first Belgian First Division title in 25 years (season 2007–2008). On 24 May 2009, he won the Belgian First Division title in his first season at Standard (season 2008–2009) after playing the championship play-off against Anderlecht. On 10 February 2010, Bölöni resigned from his coaching position at Standard Liege. On 29 May 2010, it was officially announced that Bölöni signed a contract with United Arab Emirates side Al-Wahda.Bölöni appointed as head coach of Al-Wahda On 2 September 2010, Al-Wahda sacked Bölöni, despite the team's 3–1 win over Ittihad Kalba. On 2 January 2011, he was hired by RC Lens, on a one-year contract, but he couldn't save the team from relegation. Bölöni was immediately released in June, and signed a two-year contract with PAOK on 8 June 2011, following a short negotiation period.Συμφώνησε και υπογράφει ο Μπόλονι (in Greek) =PAOK= Bölöni's tenure at PAOK started with two wins against Vålerenga Fotball for the Third Qualifying Round of 2011–12 UEFA Europa League, that brought them against Karpaty Lviv for the Play-off round. PAOK won the first leg at home and drew the second leg, qualifying for the group stage. In a tough group that consisted of Tottenham Hotspur F.C., FC Rubin Kazan and Shamrock Rovers F.C., Bölöni's PAOK managed to qualify undefeated at the first place, winning the game at White Hart Lane on the process, a remarkable feat considering that no Greek team had won at English soil since 1999 when PAOK defeated Arsenal at Highbury. For the round of 32, PAOK faced Udinese Calcio, and although a 0–0 draw at the first game in Italy spread optimism, a weakened PAOK side was eliminated off the competition when the home leg ended with a 0–3 defeat. All and all, the European presence was positive despite the abrupt end, as PAOK managed 6 wins out of 12 games, with impressive performances and a milestone win against Tottenham. At the home front, PAOK had a turbulent season, as the team managed to finish 3rd in regular season, with 5th being its final position after Play-off. During the season, PAOK won the away games against AEK Athens F.C. and Panathinaikos F.C., marking the end of a winless, 10-year-old tradition against those teams when playing away from home. Team's form was inconsistent though, and the departure – due to the club's financial difficulties – of two of the most significant players of the team, Vieirinha and Pablo Contreras didn't help matters. Bölöni had to improvise to cover for the roster's lack of depth, with mixed results. Although the season was not deemed successful, fans didn't put the blame on Bölöni, who had won their hearts with his personality, his results against some major opponents and the team's style of play when on good form. On 25 May 2012 PAOK released Bölöni after a one-year cooperation. =Coaching in the Middle East= Bölöni was hired by Qatari club Al Khor on 21 June 2012. On 26 January 2013, in a league match against Qatar SC, he was involved in a controversial incident. He threw a water bottle at a ball boy behind the goal after the boy took the ball, which went out of play, off the pitch. The bottle did not hit the boy, however, it was spotted by the match observer, Ali Al-Naimi, who relayed the information to a referee's assistant who eventually informed the referee, Fahad Jaber, who decided to send him off. Instead of going directly to the stands, he chose to illegally stay within the checkpoint. Security officers attempted to guide him off, but he retorted by using foul language and pushing the police officers. As a result, a police report was filed against him. He was later fined 75,000 Qatari riyals by the QFA and banned for 5 matches. In August 2013, Croatian media speculated that Bölöni might be named the new head coach of Dinamo Zagreb, following the sacking of team's former head coach, Krunoslav Jurčić. Bölöni has previously been linked with Hajduk Split, Dinamo Zagreb's fierce rival, as well.http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/trener-koji-je-otkrio-cristiana-u-dinamu- boloni-je-kanidat-329918 On 21 July 2015, Saudi club Al-Ittihad announced Bölöni as their new coach. =Royal Antwerp= On 16 June 2017, Bölöni was announced as the new manager of Belgian club Royal Antwerp. In his first season at the club, he finished 8th place in the regular season, and 3rd place in the Europa League play-off group to keep the team safe from relegation. In his second season, Antwerp was the surprise package of the championship, finishing the regular season on 6th place, and qualifying for the championship play-offs for the first time. Antwerp recorded important victories over Genk (1–0), Anderlecht (2–1), Gent (2–1), Standard Liège (2–1), as well as a blank draw with Club Brugge in the first half of the play-off, and climbed on the 3rd place, but later losses to these teams meant Antwerp finished 4th, thus going for the Europa League play-offs final. In the final, Antwerp beat Charleroi 3–2 after coming back from 0–2 down in the first minutes. Thus, Antwerp secured qualification in the second qualifying round of UEFA Europa League after years of absence from Europe. He also led the team to the Belgian cup final in the 2019–20 season, their first since 1992. However, the competition was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. =Gent= On 20 August 2020, Belgian League runners-up K.A.A. Gent announced Bölöni as their new head coach In September, he was sacked after only three games in charge. =Panathinaikos= On 19 October 2020, Panathinaikos is expected to announce Bölöni as their new head coach.

The Battle of Małogoszcz. one of the biggest battles of the 1863 January Uprising, took place there. Małogoszcz belongs to Lesser Poland; the name of the town comes from ancient Polish given name Małogost. Małogoszcz was founded in the early days of the Polish statehood as a settlement located at the intersection of medieval merchant routes. First mention of the village, which at that time was home to a castellan, comes from a papal bull of 1136. In the 12th century Małogoszcz was a local trade and administrative center. Małogost, as it was called, was frequently visited by Polish princes and kings. In 1140, Duchess of Poland Salomea of Berg came here, and in 1273 - Princess Kinga of Poland. In 1259, the gord was destroyed in a Mongol raid. In the 14th century, King Kazimierz Wielki built defensive fortifications here. In 1408 Małogoszcz was incorporated as a town, upon order of King Władysław Jagiełło. In June 1582, King Stefan Batory spent a night here on his way to Warsaw for his crowning. Małogoszcz prospered in the 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1591-1595 a Baroque church was built, and the town emerged as a center of cloth making. Before catastrophic Swedish invasion (the Deluge, 1655 - 1660), the town had 180 houses and the population of 1,200. By 1660, the population was reduced to 700. Until 1795 (see Partition of Poland), Małogoszcz remained part of Lesser Poland's Sandomierz Voivodeship. In June 1794, during the Kosciuszko Uprising, Tadeusz Kosciuszko rested here after the Battle of Szczekociny. On February 24, 1863, one of the biggest battles of the January Uprising, the Battle of Małogoszcz, took place there. The headquarters of General Marian Langiewicz was located in a local parish church complex, and the Łosośna river' name was later changed into Wierna Rzeka (Faithful River). As a punishment, in 1869 the Russians demoted Małogoszcz to the status of a village. In 1904 a great fire destroyed large parts of it, and the village was completely destroyed in 1914 - 1915, when the Russian - Austro/German frontline remained here for several months. Małogoszcz recovered its town rights in 1996. Among points of interest there is the parish church (1591-1595), Renaissance parish complex, a cemetery chapel (1595), and a monument of Tadeusz Kościuszko (1917).

It is the largest organization of its kind with a current membership of approximately 195,000 members, with nearly 57,000 of these being youth members under 19 years of age. Founded in 1936, the AMA is the official national body for model aviation in the United States. They sanction more than one thousand model competitions, and an increasing number of non-competitive Fly-in events for member aeromodelers throughout the country each year, charter more than 2500 model airplane clubs and offer contest sanctioning, liability insurance and the procurement of flying sites. They also certify official model flying records. All AMA-chartered clubs require their flying members to purchase AMA memberships for said liability insurance. In order to be covered by their insurance, an AMA member does not need to fly at a chartered club's flying site, but members have to follow their \\"Safety Code\\" guidelines. AMA's insurance coverage is in excess of one's homeowner's or other insurance. With the burgeoning interest in small park flyer aircraft which are often flown outside of regular club fields, the AMA now provides low-cost membership and coverage for park flyer enthusiasts. AMA organizes the annual National Aeromodeling Championships, the world's largest model airplane competition as well as providing press coverage of major meets across the country via their monthly publication, Model Aviation. Other publications include Park Pilot for those interested in park flyers or who are enrolled in the Academy's park pilot program, as well as starting in March 2010, AMA Today, a bi-monthly e-newsletter sent via e-mail to members. The AMA's Web presence is partly updated through the monthly \\"AMA Air\\" news videoYouTube's AMA Air video news site hosted on YouTube. Given the unique nature of model aviation insofar as it requires both airspace as well as frequency allocation for radio control, the AMA serves as a liaison with the Federal Aviation Administration concerning aeromodeling safety and operation of model aircraft as it relates to full-scale aviation,See Page 6 for FAA Subtitle B—Unmanned Aircraft Systems - SEC. 336. SPECIAL RULE FOR MODEL AIRCRAFT most recently with the nascent development and beginnings of non-military, commercial and public-use UAV deployment in the National Airspace System over the United States, and how the FAA can equitably regulate such commercial and public use of UAVs, simultaneous with accommodating the needs of recreational and sport flying of radio control model aircraft and their close-cousin, strictly hobbyist-flown FPV unmanned aerial vehicles, with the AMA as a \\"community-based organizational\\" advocate for the aeromodeler.AMA official website The AMA also works with both the Federal Communications Commission and the American Radio Relay League concerning available radio bandwidth for radio-controlled aeromodelling activities, with the ARRL primarily functioning as a partner for the purpose of the use of selected amateur radio frequencies (particularly on the well-established 6-meter band, used throughout the USA and Canada) and developing use on the low-UHF 70 cm amateur band for RC flying, especially for FPV activities, (increasingly using spread spectrum transmission as 2.4 GHz RC does)Denmark-based firm's 70 cm-RC spread-spectrum hardware selection by amateur radio license-holding aeromodelers, beyond the other existing low-end VHF (72 MHz) and upper-end UHF 2.4 GHz spread spectrum bands' uses for radio control aeromodeling in the two North American nations. As an associate member of the National Aeronautic Association, the AMA is recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the world governing body of all aviation activity. Insurance An AMA-chartered club, HHAMS, runs this flying site While many members view AMA insurance as the primary purpose of the organization, the insurance program is low on the list of priorities. When the organization was first formed five years before the USA's involvement began in World War II, there was no insurance program. The first offering of optional liability insurance was first suggested in 1939. $0.50 extra was to provide $500.00 liability protection. By the early 1940s, coverage was raised to $1000.00 worth of protection. By the mid-1940s the insurance program was often referred to as a \\"gas license\\" as it was becoming required for operation of gasoline-powered models at most club flying sites and for many contests. The insurance program presently offers US$2.5 million in coverage. Most leases on flying sites not owned by an aeromodeling club require adequate insurance to be carried by all people who will be flying; many clubs — the great majority of which are already \\"chartered clubs\\" within the AMA organizational structure in the United States — require AMA membership even for guests flying models at their field. AMA also offers optional site insurance which is considered to be primary coverage and is very low cost. This insurance is subsidized by part of each member's dues. There is also an additional insurance coverage for each sanctioned event. By providing the insurance, AMA makes it far easier for clubs or individuals to acquire access to flying sites. It is now standard policy of the US Army Corps of Engineers (COE) to require AMA insurance or equivalent coverage in order to acquire a lease of COE-managed land for model aircraft operation. See also: Model Aeronautics Association of Canada, with which the AMA has a reciprocal agreement allowing its own insurance to apply to AMA members flying in Canada, and vice versa.

It has been rumored that Neil Young wrote the song \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" about her, as well as \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\", but both have been denied. One biography states that Courson and Morrison met at a lesser-known nightclub called the London Fog on the Sunset Strip in 1965, while she was an art student at Los Angeles City College. In his 1998 memoir, Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors, keyboardist Ray Manzarek states that Courson and a friend saw the band during their stint at the London Fog. Courson's relationship with Morrison was tumultuous with loud arguments and repeated infidelities by both partners. From 1969 to 1971, Courson operated Themis, a fashion boutique that Morrison bought for her with his royalties from the album Strange Days. Death of Morrison Courson stated that on July 3, 1971, she awoke to find Morrison dead in the bathtub of their apartment in Paris. The coroner's report listed his cause of death as heart failure, although no autopsy was performed. Under Morrison's will, which stated that he was \\"an unmarried person\\", Courson was named his heir, and therefore in line to inherit his entire fortune. Lawsuits against the estate would tie up her quest for inheritance for the next two years. Return to the States, death and estate controversy After Morrison's death, Courson continued to live in Los Angeles. Former Doors employee Danny Sugerman became friendly with her in Los Angeles during this time and later wrote in Wonderland Avenue about an experience of taking quaaludes and snorting heroin with Courson.Sugerman, Danny. Wonderland Avenue: Tales of Glamour and Excess. London, United Kingdom: Abacus, 1991. p. 276. On April 25, 1974, Courson died of a heroin overdose on the living room couch at the Los Angeles apartment she shared with two male friends. Like Morrison she was also 27 years old when she died. Her cremated remains were interred in the mausoleum at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, California. The plaque reads \\"Pamela Susan Morrison 1946–1974\\", even though \\"Morrison\\" was never part of Courson's legal name. Several months after her death, her parents inherited her fortune. Jim Morrison's parents later contested the Coursons' executorship of the estate, leading to additional legal battles. In 1979 both parties agreed to divide the earnings from Morrison's estate equally. Friend Diane Gardner is quoted as saying in the book Break on Through by Riordan and Prochnicky, that In popular culture Courson was portrayed by Meg Ryan in Oliver Stone's 1991 film The Doors.Kagan, Norman.

It was adapted into the 1999 film Whatever, directed by and starring Philippe Harel. Plot The protagonist, known only as \\"Our Hero\\" during the entirety of the story, lives a solitary life, and has not had sex for over two years. Within most of the book and film versions of Whatever, Our Hero draws on recollections of Schopenhauer and Kant to lambast the commodification of human contact, punctuating his inner monologue with bouts of nausea and masturbation. He is wracked by the implications of decisions that would seem minor to the average person, such as disclosing his lack of a sex life through the purchase of a single bed. He is teamed up with a disturbing, unattractive, desperate 28-year-old virgin, Raphael Tisserand, to deliver a series of seminars on the use of IT. Raphael looks up to Our Hero for ever having been able to hold down a relationship, and listens to his musings on love with tragic, but ultimately inspirational consequences.

In Linux systems, FTPFS was initially implemented as a Linux kernel module that allows the user to mount a FTP server onto the local filesystem but it was never seen as the perfect way to do it. By 2003, it has been converted to use LUFS, and later to FUSE. Now it is called CurlFtpFS because it uses the universal libcurl for FTP transactions and is becoming part of the major Linux distributions. There also exists LftpFS for smart mirroring of FTP sites.

The read-only limitation is noted in the man page for mount_ftp (on a macOS system, in Terminal.app, see \\"man mount_ftp\\").

Additionally, macOS Fuse is reported to enable this but the method to do so is undocumented (as of March 4, 2013) either via various obvious man page (e.g. sshfs) or in the macOS Fuse wiki.

Eduard Sievers (; 25 November 1850, Lippoldsberg – 30 March 1932, Leipzig) was a philologist of the classical and Germanic languages. Sievers was one of the Junggrammatiker of the so-called \\"Leipzig School\\". He was one of the most influential historical linguists of the late nineteenth century. He is known for his recovery of the poetic traditions of Germanic languages such as Anglo-Saxon and Old Saxon, as well as for his discovery of Sievers' law. Biography He was educated at Leipzig and Berlin, and became professor extraordinarius of Germanic and Romance philology at Jena in 1871, receiving a full professorship there five years later. In 1883 he went to Tübingen, and in 1887 to Halle, whence he was called in 1892 to Leipzig. Sievers' analysis Sievers' analysis was a system of five patterns which indicated how the poetic line (or, more specifically, the poetic half-line) was to be emphasized or not, e.g. stressed-unstressed-stressed-unstressed, unstressed-stressed-unstressed-stressed, etc. This seemingly elementary analysis was significant because of the difficulty experienced by previous scholars in identifying where the poetic line began and ended. Germanic poetry, in its written form, rarely indicated the line division. Moreover, even though it was clear that some words were of greater importance than others and were thus supposed to be stressed, there were few limitations on the length of the unstressed sequences, which made the identification of the poetic line even more difficult. In Shakespearean verse, for example, a typical poetic line is: ::it IS the EAST and JUliET’s the SUN Here stressed and unstressed syllables follow one after the other. In Old Saxon, however, a line might read: ::LIthi an thesaru LOGnu In this example, five syllables occur between the stressed syllables LI- and LOG. Sievers examined these issues in great detail, as well as the questions of relative stress and clashing stresses in poetry. Sievers himself later abandoned this type of analysis in favor of Schallanalyse, or 'sound analysis,' a system which was understood by very few apart from Sievers and those close to him. Reception His analysis was widely, though not universally, accepted among philologists.Alan Joseph Bliss, The metre of 'Beowulf' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1958); Jun Terasawa, Old English Meter: An Introduction (Totonto: University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 34-48. Sievers's work on the rhythms of Anglo- Saxon poetry influenced the poetry of Ezra Pound, in particular in poems such as his version of The Seafarer.

Although now international, SNOMED was started in the U.S. by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) in 1973 and revised into the 1990s. In 2002 CAP's SNOMED Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT) was merged with, and expanded by, the National Health Service's Clinical Terms Version 3 (previously known as the Read codes) to produce SNOMED CT. Versions of SNOMED released prior to 2001 were based on a multiaxial, hierarchical classification system. As in any such system, a disease may be located in a body organ (anatomy), which results in a code in a topography axis and may lead to morphological alterations represented by a morphology code. In 2002 the first release of SNOMED CT adopted a completely different structure. A sub-type hierarchy, supported by defining relationships based on description logic, replaced the axes described in this article. Versions of SNOMED prior to SNOMED CT are planned to be formally deprecated from 2017.Deprecation of Antecedent Versions of SNOMED by IHTSDO General Assembly Therefore, readers interested in current information about SNOMED are directed to the article on SNOMED CT. Purpose SNOMED was designed as a comprehensive nomenclature of clinical medicine for the purpose of accurately storing and/or retrieving records of clinical care in human and veterinary medicine. The metaphor used by Roger A. Côté, the first editorial chair, was that SNOMED would become the periodic table of elements of medicine because of its definitional organization beyond the hierarchical design. Indeed, diseases and procedures were ordered hierarchically and are further referenced back to more elementary terms (see Reference Ontology and Multi-Axial Design, below). History SNOMED was originally conceived by Côté as an extension of the design of the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) applicable for all medicine. SNOP was originally designed by Arnold Pratt to describe pathological specimens according to their morphology and anatomy (topography). The ambitious development of SNOMED required many more axes (see multi-axial design, below). SNOMED was jointly proposed for development to the College of American Pathologists by Côté and Pratt. The former was appointed as editorial chair of the Committee on Nomenclature and Classification of Diseases of the CAP and developed the SNOMED from 1973 to 1997. In 1998, Kent Spackman was appointed to chair this committee and spearheaded the transformation of the multi-axis systems into a highly computable form (See SNOMED CT): a directed acyclic graph anchored in formal representation logic. In 2007, the newly formed International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO) acquired all the Intellectual Property of SNOMED CT and all antecedent SNOMED versions.

For example, a disease can be defined in terms of its abnormal anatomy, abnormal functions and morphology. In some cases, the etiology of the disease is known and can be attributed to an infectious agent, a physical trauma or a chemical or pharmaceutical agent. Multi-axial design The current concept uses eleven (11) axes that comprise terms organised in hierarchical trees.

Context and authorship The book was part of the war of words between Scotland and England in the sixteenth century. The so-called \\"Rough Wooing\\" of Mary, Queen of Scots, by Henry VIII of England as a wife for his son Edward, which Edward VI continued, had included the publication of books in England asserting the idea of uniting the two countries, with England dominant. The Scottish Complaynt was an answer to these works. Another Scottish work, a dialogue similar in outlook, Ane Resonyng, by William Lamb from the same period was abandoned unpublished. The Complaynt is anonymous, probably due to its controversial political content, and has been variously ascribed to Robert Wedderburn, James Inglis and David Lyndsay,Notes and Queries, vol. 1 no.26, (27 April 1850), p. 422 though the 1979 Scottish Text Society edition of the work supports the Wedderburn attribution, as does the National Library of Scotland It was once thought to have been among the first books printed in Scotland but it is now believed to have been published in Paris. The book owes much of its structure, and some of its content, to the French work Alain Chartier's Quadrilogue-invectif, a similar political work also attacking England.Stewart, A. M. (1979) pp. xxi- xxiv. The close ties between Scotland and France at that time, the Auld Alliance, are attested by the fact that the Complaynt is dedicated to Mary of Guise, the effective queen of Scotland of the time, rather than the Governor, Regent Arran. Dame Scotia The book itself, subtitled \\"wyth ane exortatione to the thre estaits to be vigilante in the deffens of their public weil\\", contains a miscellany of stories, classical legends, biblical tales, ballads and allegories emphasising Scotland's separateness and the rewards of virtue and courage. The unifying structure is the narration of Dame Scotia in the final twelve chapters. She hears the complaints of her three sons, the \\"Thrie Estaits\\" of Scottish society, and then offers her encouragement and rebuke to the clergy, nobility, and populace in turn. Dame Scotia appears to the narrator in a dream. She was a lady of \\"ancient genealogy\\", her hair was the colour of fine gold but untidy, and her gold crown was \\"like to fall down from her head to the cold earth.\\" She held the shield of the red lion rampant but the lion had several wounds. Her dress was made in three fashions according to her three sons, embroidered with the precious stones of the nobility which were engraved with weapons, embroidered with the texts and books of the Spirituality, and the livestock, crops, merchandise, and tools of craftsmen, merchants and farmers. However this ancient fabric was worn with many losses.Complaynt, EETS (1872), pp. 68–70 Merlin The English works it was aimed against included the pagan prophecies of Merlin to back up their claim of a united Great Britain, whilst the Complaynt stuck to Christian ideals. In Chapter 10, the author declares the English, lending more credence to Merlin's prophecies than the Gospel, justify their wars upon Scotland under the basis of nebulous prophecy that the two nations shall be ruled under one king: > \\"the prophesies of Merlyne, to the quhilk the Inglishmen giffis more > confidens nor thai gif to the evangel, by cause that there ald prophane > prophesis sais, that ingland and scotland sal be baitht undir ane prince, on > this misteous prophesis, thai have intendit weyris contrar > Scotland.\\"\\"misteous. 'misty'. obscure.\\" ()A variant text is perhaps somewhat > harsher:\\"diuerse prophane prophesies of merlyne, and vther ald corruptit > vaticinaris, the quhilkis hes affermit in there rusty ryme, that scotland > and ingland sal be vndir ane prince,\\" () Monologue recreative The Complaynt is an important source for information on Border ballads and it contains some of the first references to important ballads such as Tam Lin, Froggy would a-wooing go and The Ballad of Chevy Chase. The names of these songs and poems are recited in Chapter 6, called the Monologue Recreative. This dream-like sequence introduces the main 'Dame Scotia' narration. In the Monologue Recreative the author describes putting his pen down and walking into a beautiful summer day. He hears shepherds speaking of poetry and astronomy, then sees a Scottish warship and its crew and hears their calls. This passage supplies a maritime vocabulary and an insight to seamanship of the period. The Complaynt is also a significant example of Middle Scots language, and the Oxford English Dictionary cites the Complaynt as the earliest source for numerous words, including: axis, barbarian, buffoon, cabinet, crackling, decadence, excrement, heroic, humid, imbecile, moo, parallel, robust, suffocation, superb, timid and water-lily.

The use of the gandasa as a weapon was made famous by the Lollywood film Maula Jatt (1979) and its sequels, in which the implement was portrayed as an Excalibur-like weapon used in the Punjabi Pakistani action films for fighting and killing other people.

Taki’s Imperial Japanese Army page History and development The Type 97 was developed from the earlier Type 91 Grenade which could also be used as a fragmentation hand grenade, but was predominately used as munitions for the Type 10, and Type 89 grenade launchers. For this reason, it had less explosive power and a relatively longer delay time than a dedicated manual hand grenade. To address these issues, the Army Technical Bureau developed a new design in 1937. Design The Type 97 had the same principles as most of fragmentation grenades of the period: a grooved 'pineapple-shaped' segmented body which dispersed sharp pieces of shrapnel when it exploded. Operation was accomplished by first screwing down the firing pin, so that it protruded from the base of the striker. Then the safety pin was removed by pulling the cord to which it was attached; the protective cap which covered the striker was removed. A sharp blow against a hard surface, such as a rock or combat helmet would overcome a creep spring and crush a thin brass cap, allowing the pin to hit the primer and initiate the delay sequence before throwing at the target. Japanese World War II Ordnance However, in comparison with Allied hand grenades of the period, the explosive force of the Type 97 was weaker and, due to lack of an automatic ignition mechanism, the grenade in practice was found to be unreliable and even dangerous to use because of its inaccurate fuse.Rottman, Japanese Infantryman 1937-1945 Physically, the Type 97 was almost indistinguishable from the Type 91, except that it had no attachment on the base for a propellant canister. Paper labels with ink-stamped fill dates warned of the shorter 4-5 second delay. Details of internal construction Combat record The Type 97 hand grenade was issued as standard equipment to Japanese infantrymen in the Second Sino-Japanese War and throughout the various campaigns of World War II.Rottman, Japanese Infantryman 1937-1945 See also *Mills Fragmentation Hand Grenade (Mills Bomb) *Mk. 2 Fragmentation Hand Grenade References =Bibliography= * * * External links *Image of a Type 97 grenade *Details of internal construction *Taki’s Imperial Japanese Army page *US Technical Manual E 30-480 9 37 Category:Fragmentation grenades Category:Hand grenades of Japan ","title":"Type 97 grenade"},{"id":"2556030","text":"Many of the graphic cards sold today are equipped with a TV-out connector to display content on an ordinary television set. there are three major manufacturers: Chrontel, Philips and Conexant.

Biography According to 1 Maccabees, he was a descendant of the Biblical Aaron, brother of Moses, but not in the high-priestly line;1 Macc 7:14; also Ant, XX, 10. and being ambitious for the office of high priest, he traveled to Antioch to secure the assistance of the Seleucid king Demetrius I Soter, who had just overthrown Antiochus Eupator. Alcimus was of the Hellenizing party, and therefore bitterly opposed by the Maccabees. Demetrius sent an army under Bacchides to establish Alcimus in the high priesthood at Jerusalem. The favor with which Alcimus was received by the Jews at Jerusalem on account of his Aaronic descent was soon turned to hate by his cruelties. When Bacchides and his army returned to Antioch, the Hasmonean Judah Maccabee attacked and overcame Alcimus, and drove him also to Syria. There he secured from Demetrius another army, led by Nicanor, who, failing to overcome Judah by treachery, attacked him directly, but was defeated and killed. A third and greater army, under Bacchides again, was dispatched to reinstall Alcimus. Judah was defeated and killed, Alcimus established as high priest and a strong garrison left in Jerusalem to maintain him. But he did not long enjoy his triumph, since he died soon after, while he was pulling down the wall of the temple that divided the court of the Gentiles from that of the Israelites.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews xii. 9. § 7 His successor as High Priest is unknown, though some scholars suggest that this was the Teacher of Righteousness, later founder of the Essenes.

This classification is widely used by cancer registries. It is currently in its third revision (ICD-O-3). ICD-10 includes a list of morphology codes. They stem from ICD-O second edition (ICD-O-2) that was valid at the time of publication.  Axes  The classification has two axes: topography and morphology. = Morphology = The morphology axis is for the and Application of the tumor. This axis has particular importance because the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (\\"SNOMED\\") has adopted the ICD-O classification of morphology. SNOMED has been changing continuously, and several different versions of SNOMED are in use. Accordingly, mapping of ICD-O codes to SNOMED requires careful assessment of whether entities are indeed true matches. = Topography = The topography axis is for of the tumor's site in the body. It is standardized with the C section of ICD-10. There were no changes in the topography axis between ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3. See List of ICD-10 codes#(C00–C97) Malignant Neoplasms for examples.

It extends northeast from the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (HEFT) in southwestern Kendall to the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826) in Glenvar Heights, allowing traffic from the far south of Miami-Dade County and the Florida Keys to move to more central regions of metropolitan Miami and vice versa, bypassing communities along U.S. Route 1, while also permitting local access to the Kendall district. The road, named in honor of the long-serving coach of the Miami Dolphins NFL team, is maintained and tolled by the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority (MDX). Contrary to the numbering plan of Florida State Roads, SR 874 is signed north–south. Route description SR 874 begins at an interchange with the HEFT on the boundary of the communities of Three Lakes, Richmond Heights and Kendall, about southwest of Downtown Miami. The expressway is formed from the median lanes of the HEFT, and immediately turns to the northeast, passing under the HEFT's northbound lanes. Southbound HEFT traffic cannot access northbound SR 874; likewise, southbound SR 874 traffic cannot access the HEFT northbound. After turning to the northeast and entering Kendall, the six-laned Don Shula Expressway subsequently follows a CSX-owned railroad past predominantly residential neighborhoods for its entire route. SR 874 meets its first of three toll gantries about north of its southern terminus, just north of its former lone toll plaza. About from SR 874's southern terminus, the expressway interchanges with Killian Parkway (SR 990) and Southwest 107th Avenue (SR 985) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The Don Shula Expressway continues on for , passing through another toll gantry, before reaching an interchange with Kendall Drive (SR 94). Almost immediately afterwards, SR 874 crosses the Snapper Creek Canal and enters the Sunset district. It then reaches the partial interchange with the Snapper Creek Expressway (SR 878); indeed, southbound motorists along the Don Shula Expressway who wish to exit to Kendall Drive are directed onto the westernmost portion of SR 878. Once past the Snapper Creek Expressway, SR 874 features no interchanges for the remainder of its route. Just north of the bridge over Sunset Drive (SR 986), about north of SR 878, motorists in both directions are provided with a separated lane to take their vehicles to if caught in an accident. past the accident investigation sites, the Don Shula Expressway swings north over the railroad, crossing over Galloway Road (SR 973) in the process, and resumes its northeasterly orientation, now forming the boundary between the communities of Olympia Heights, to the road's north, and Glenvar Heights, to the south. later, SR 874 passes through its third and final toll gantry, before reaching its northern terminus in a partial interchange with the Palmetto Expressway after another . Like at its southern terminus, SR 874 forms the central lanes of SR 826 northbound; however, its interchange is integrated with SR 826's interchange with Bird Road (SR 976). Also like its southern terminus, there is no access for northbound SR 874 or SR 826 traffic to the other route's southbound counterpart. Tolls SR 874's tolls are entirely electronic: cash cannot be accepted along its length. Payment is done either via SunPass transponders or via toll-by-plate billing, the latter of which attracts a higher cost. Three toll gantries are located along the Don Shula Expressway: the first between the HEFT and Killian Parkway, the second between Killian Parkway and Kendall Drive, and the last between the Snapper Creek and Palmetto Expressways. The relationship between the tolling points and interchanges along SR 874 and SR 878 is that all motorists are charged at least one toll for using the road; there are no \\"free sections\\". As of July 1, 2013, the cost for a two-axled vehicle to drive the entire length of SR 874 is $1.00 with a SunPass transponder, or $2.00 via the toll-by-plate program, with the two southern gantries charging $0.25 (SunPass) or $0.50 (toll-by-plate) each, and the northern one charging twice as much. Each additional axle on a vehicle attracts a surcharge equal to the cost of a two-axled vehicle for each gantry passed. History The history of the Don Shula Expressway can be traced back to 1957 when, in planning for the Palmetto Expressway's routing, Dade County Commissioner Ralph Fossey proposed an alternative southern alignment of the expressway to follow the then Seaboard-owned railroad southwest from near Miller Drive (Southwest 56th Street) to Southwest 117th Avenue, before heading south to US 1 at Goulds, instead of heading due south to Kendall. While the Palmetto Expressway was built to its original plan in 1961, the concept of an expressway next to the Seaboard tracks south of Miller Drive, termed the South Dade Expressway, continued to feature in transportation plans over the next decade. By the middle of 1969, bonds for construction of the South Dade Expressway were being secured from the Turnpike Authority; however, plans for the expressway were revised and incorporated into wider plans involving the West Dade Expressway (what would become the HEFT) in 1970, which included a toll of ten cents and a shift of the South Dade Expressway to the northern side of the Seaboard railroad north of Galloway Road (Southwest 87th Avenue). Funding was secured in 1971, and a construction end-date was set for early 1973. This did not eventuate due to difficulties to acquire land for the expressway's right-of-way, resulting in the final section of the South Dade Expressway, between Kendall Drive and the Palmetto Expressway, opening at midday on July 31, 1975. Former NFL Coach Don Shula autographs a \\"Don Shula Expressway\\" sign for a fan during an event in Pinecrest, Florida. In 1983, the South Dade Expressway was renamed by the Florida Legislature to the Don Shula Expressway, in honor of the Hall of Fame head coach of the Miami Dolphins NFL team. Tolls along the Don Shula Expressway were collected at the southern toll plaza until July 17, 2010 when, as part of MDX's rollout of electronic tolling across its owned roads, the road was converted to open road tolling at the same time as the adjoining Snapper Creek Expressway. Initially, tolls were $0.25 for SunPass users at the southern gantries and $0.50 at the northern gantry, with a $0.15 surcharge for motorists using the toll-by-plate system at all gantries. The toll-by-plate rate increased on July 1, 2013, while the SunPass rate was unaffected. Future As part of its long-term plans for the region, MDX is seeking to improve access to the Don Shula Expressway from its surrounding communities, particularly from the areas west of the HEFT. Notably, MDX has launched a project to build exit and entry ramps from SR 874 into the Three Lakes district west of its southern terminus, aiming to relieve congestion at the Southwest 120th Street and Coral Reef Drive (SR 992) interchanges with the HEFT by providing alternative access and egress of the area via SR 874. Studies to build the connection ran from 2010 until early 2012, in which six alternative routes for the ramps were suggested: the preferred route sees Southwest 128th Street widened east of Southwest 137th Avenue to four lanes, with flyovers from east of Southwest 122nd Avenue, heading over the HEFT/SR 874 interchange, to merge with SR 874 east of Southwest 117th Avenue. Construction is set to begin in 2015, with completion sometime two years later. An additional project to improve connectivity with the Don Shula Expressway sees the construction of a partial diamond interchange between SR 874 and Sunset Drive (SR 986), so as to relieve congestion along SR 986 and improve access to the Sunset and neighboring districts. The interchange's ramps would permit movement only to and from SR 874 north of SR 986. MDX began preliminary studies of the project in 2009, but no timeline for construction has yet been published.

It was founded in 1939 as an unofficial AM carrier current campus radio station in the basement of Clark Hall. Upon gaining recognition, the station operated under the unofficial call sign WES. In the 1950s, the call sign became WESU. Then on February 25, 1961, it began operating an FM station at 88.1 MHz, eventually abandoning the AM station.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 Between 1967 and 1990, WESU was owned and operated by an independent student group, the now-defunct Wesleyan Broadcast Association, Inc. Today, it is owned by the Trustees of Wesleyan University, and operated by students and community volunteers. In 1999, the station moved offices and studios from the basement of Clark Hall to its current location next the Wesleyan Argus on 45 Broad Street. Asked in 2020 whether WESU is not the oldest college radio station in the United States, its station manager Benjamin Michael gave an explanation of the complexities of what counts as a \\"college radio station\\" and then stated that WESU is \\"the last of the original student-owned and student-operated stations.\\" WESU operates 24 hours a day. Until 2004, WESU's format had been entirely freeform, with DJs and student staff having complete freedom to program what they wanted. The university then announced its intention to seek an affiliation with National Public Radio (NPR), and to change the station's daytime format.23 November 2004 WESU press release, originally on the WESU-FM site; archived on the Internet Archive, 30 April 2008, retrieved 21 February 2011.

It is a viewpoint regarding the political status of the Republic of China, whose government retreated to the island of Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War in 1949. The main idea of the theory is that the time line for the development of the Republic of China can be classified into four stages, which are: # The Republic of China on the mainland (; ), 1912–1949 # The Republic of China arrival to Taiwan (; ), 1949–1988, before Lee Teng-hui's presidency # The Republic of China on Taiwan (; ), 1988–2000, during Lee Teng-hui's presidency # The Republic of China is Taiwan (; ), 2000–2008, during Chen Shui-bian's presidencyMainland Policy and Work - August 2, 2005, Mainland Affairs Council, 2005Chen says name variance is simply an expedient, Taipei Times, 2005/8/3Chen urges unity to deal with China, Taipei Times, 2005/8/3  Illumination  By this theory, Chen pointed out that the Republic of China was at the 4th stage after the first ruling party rotation of the central government in 2000. That is, Taiwan, with the official name called the \\"Republic of China\\", is already an independent sovereign state separate from People's Republic of China. This theory is welcomed by the mainstream of the Pan-Green coalition (led by the Democratic Progressive Party) in Taiwan, which supports eventual de jure Taiwan independence; but is not welcomed by most members of the Pan-Blue coalition (Kuomintang), which supports the eventual reunification of Taiwan with mainland China as part of a single \\"Chinese nation\\". Some members of the more strongly pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union also oppose this view since they deem the ROC to be an illegitimate foreign and colonial regime that should be replaced by the proposed \\"Republic of Taiwan\\". The Pan-Blue Coalition agrees with the first three stages, but disagrees with the fourth stage, and prefers to maintain the distinction between the \\"Republic of China\\" (the polity) and \\"Taiwan\\" (part of the territory the polity governs). The government of the People's Republic of China has also voiced opposition against the fourth stage on the grounds that such an interpretation is a step closer to de jure Taiwan independence. (Officially, the PRC claims the existence of the ROC only until 1949.)International Business Publications, USA, Position of the Republic of China (ROC), Taiwan Country Study Guide: Strategic Information and Developments, 2012/3/3, p45  Development  Both the Free China Journal and the Free China Weekly often referred to the polity as the \\"Republic of China on Taiwan\\" prior to Lee Teng-hui taking office as the first Taiwan-born president of the Republic of China. During Lee's administration, the term remained in use, and he used the term in his speech at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States in June 1995.Text of Lee's Cornell address , TAIWAN INFO, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1995-6-16國家定位 李前總統︰ROC在台灣, TVBS, 2003/12/21 It was used to identify the Republic of China with its remaining major component - the island of Taiwan, as opposed to its decades-long claim to all China since losing the civil war in 1949. Prior to this speech, the government officials used \\"Republic of China\\" when the name of the state was used. Lee's usage is considered as a departure from the convention, as this usage can be interpreted in the sense that the Republic of China's sovereignty does not extend to mainland China, which the People's Republic of China controls. The Democratic Progressive Party's 1999 Resolution on Taiwan's Future, which is accorded equivalent status as the Party charter, serves as the baseline of debates toward the \\"status quo\\". According to the 1999 Resolution: \\"Taiwan is a sovereign and independent state and that its national title is the ROC.\\" In other words, \\"Taiwan is the ROC\\".DPP’s Cross-Strait Policy Consistent with “Status Quo”, Jamestown Foundation, 2011/12/20 During the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration under Chen Shui-bian, he directed that all government publications and websites to use the form \\"Republic of China (Taiwan).\\" These two variations have been used under their respective administrations for the ROC/Taiwan petition to join the United Nations. Unlike the Cold War era when the KMT-controlled ROC competed with the PRC as the legitimate representative of China (including Taiwan), during Chen Shui-bian's presidency, the ROC did not seek to be the representative of China (i.e. it does not seek the PRC's seat on the Security Council or its ouster) and stresses in its petitions that it was only seeking to represent the people of the land under its effective control (i.e. UN's principle of universality). On October 8, 2011, the eve of the centennial celebration of the founding of the Republic of China on October 10, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen and the presidential candidate for the 2012 Taiwan presidential election explained her stance on the existence of the Republic of China on Taiwan as \\"...the Republic of China has lost the land on which it was originally established. It only exists in Taiwan. It has merged into the land and people of Taiwan. Today, the majority of the people in Taiwan can agree that Taiwan is the Republic of China, and the Republic of China is Taiwan.\\", \\"Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country\\", and \\"...after we began directly electing our president, the current Republic of China government is no longer a foreign government. It is now the government of Taiwan.\\"Tsai presents “ROC is Taiwan” stance on eve of centenary, Formosa News, 2011/10/09Tsai affirms recognition of the ROC, Taipei Times, 2011/10/10 Chen Yi-shen (陳儀深), an associate researcher at the Institute of Modern History at Academia Sinica, said \\"many are aware that the ROC and Taiwan are two faces of the same coin\\" and Tsai's ROC was an extension of the ROC from former presidents Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian. While some understood \\"elections have their own languages\\", many Taiwanese, including former DPP Chairman and former president of the Examination Yuan Yao Chia-wen, are absolutely against the ROC and insist \\"we need to promote the rectification our nation's name to the Republic of Taiwan\\".

The library is located in several parts of the college, and houses a priceless collection of early printed books and more than 300 medieval manuscripts. The historic collection was initially built through benefactions, including manuscripts donated by the medieval clergyman William Reade. The library also contains early printed books from the personal libraries of Griffin Higgs and Henry Kent, who originally donated approximately 600 and 800 volumes respectively. The main collection runs to approximately 70,000 volumes. The oldest part, known as the Upper Library, is on the first floor of two orthogonal ranges of buildings that were built around 1373 by William Humberville as part of the completion of Mob Quad, one of the first collegiate quadrangles. The Upper Library was improved in the 16th century under Warden Sir Henry Savile. Large dormer windows were added to the roof to allow more light in, and Thomas Bodley reorganized it in the new Continental style; the old book chests and lecterns were replaced by book shelves — among the first to be used in England — with benches between them. The Upper Library still retains these 16th-century fittings. It also contains a number of book chests, some chained books, one of Elizabeth I's Welsh Bibles, a matching pair of 16th-century globes (one of the earth, the other of the heavens), and a collection of astrolabes and other early scientific instruments.

Anderson grew up in Montclair, New Jersey and attended Montclair High School where he learned to play the trombone, eventually picking up guitar & bass guitar. He later attended the Berklee College of Music contemporaneously with Pat Metheny and Al Di Meola after working with an early version of Aerosmith in the Boston music scene. He joined The Centurions, which brought him to the attention of Chris Wood of Traffic, who invited him to play on the band's next album. The Traffic album involvement never materialized, but led to Anderson becoming employed by Traffic's record label Island Records, leading to him being asked to play lead guitar on Bob Marley & The Wailers' Natty Dread sessions. Anderson played lead guitar on \\"Crazy Baldhead\\" and on the Live! album, remaining with the band until 1976, when he joined Word, Sound and Power, backing Peter Tosh on the albums Legalize It and Equal Rights. He returned to Marley's band and played on the Survival and Uprising albums. After Marley's death, Anderson continued to tour with The Wailers Band. Anderson went on to record with Ben Harper (Diamonds On the Inside (2003)) and Lauryn Hill on her multi-Grammy winning debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). He also produced and performed on an album for actor Steven Seagal (Songs from the Crystal Cave (2005)). In 2008 he formed the band The Original Wailers with Junior Marvin.

Tingelstad Old Church interior Dendrochronological dating shows that parts of the timber within the church were felled between 1219 and 1220. The original name for this church was \\"St. Petri Church\\", although presently it is called Tingelstad Old Church after it was replaced by the newer Tingelstad Church in 1866. This replacement was due to a law of 1851 which declared that at least 1/5 of a church's congregation should be able to attend its services. The congregation also had a stave church (Grindaker stave church), but this was demolished in 1866, again because it was too small. There were four other churches built of stone in proximity to each other; all located within 20 km of one another. One of these churches is gone, another is heavily rebuilt, but the last two are still standing. Those two are the Sister Churches (Søsterkirkene) at the village of Granavollen in Gran. The spire on the wooden belfry bears a copy of a 12th-century weather vane. The original vane is held in the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo. It is believed that it was once fitted to the bow of a warship. Tingelstad old church has also at some point been rebuilt. At the west end, the gable-end is constructed of wood. In 1673 a report was made that describe the wall as brøstefeldig or dilapidated, necessitating reconstruction. Although the church contains a few other original, medieval features such as a wooden crucifix and a stone altar, it is best known for its intact interior from the 16th and 17th centuries. The pulpit is from 1579 and is one of Norway's oldest. An altar frontal from 1699 can also be found in the church. A unique mural from 1632 depicting the Dano-Norwegian coat of arms, has been partially revealed on the interior north wall.

Most commonly used as a metric in the sabermetric community, it has found more general usage in recent years. It is helpful in assessing how much a specific ballpark contributes to the offensive production of a team or player. The formula\\"RS\\" = runs scored; \\"RA\\" = runs allowed. most commonly used is: PF = 100 * ( {{homeRS + homeRA \\\\over homeG} \\\\over {roadRS + roadRA \\\\over roadG}} ) In this formula, all runs scored by or against a team at home (per game) are divided by all runs scored on the road (per game). Parks with a Park Factor over 100 are those where more overall runs are scored when the team is at home than are scored when the team is away. While some variation can be attributable to fluctuations in offensiveSee: On-base plus slugging (OPS). and defensive performance, PF accounts for the production of both teams in each park and, correspondingly, is very useful in trying to determine which ballparks are \\"hitter friendly\\" and which are \\"pitcher friendly\\". One criticism is that Park Factor does not account for differences in pitchingSee: . between teams. An above-average pitching staff may distort their home stadium's Park Factor by making it seem more pitcher-friendly than it really is. In place of Runs scored and allowed, the formula can easily use home runs, hits or any other statistic to further analyze the park factor of an individual park.

It aired footage of extraordinary events that were usually covered in mainstream news. Synopsis Real TV usually showed home and amateur video. The types of incidents portrayed were often daring rescues, escapes, stunts, and accidents. Clips containing violence or injury were not shown often. The clips had a narration provided by the host of the show, and were commonly set to a soundtrack to heighten the drama. Other clips have included TV show bloopers, human interest stories, and inventions. Hosts The show was hosted by John Daly (no relation to the golfer of the same name) from its beginning in 1996 through 2000, with Beau Weaver announcing until 1999. During Daly's run, the show took on a theme similar to that of a news show, even featuring various correspondents to present the stories along with him. Featured correspondents included Sibila Vargas, Michael Brownlee, John Johnston, Lisa G., and Ellen K. William B. Davis, best known as Cigarette Smoking Man from the sci-fi TV series The X-Files, also made occasional appearances. In season 4 of the show, he was joined by Kristen Eykel, and Mitch Lewis became the announcer. When Daly and Eykel quit the show, Ahmad Rashād took over for them until the show's end. Rashād's version of Real TV had a new set, introduction, and announcer. The correspondents from Daly's run did not appear, nor did the themed segments or news show atmosphere. The show seemingly became targeted towards younger viewers, featuring more extreme sports footage, and less focus on human interest stories and celebrities. The show was canceled in 2001, and was replaced in many markets by the weekly series Maximum Exposure, which ran original episodes until 2002 and continues to air in syndication (Maximum Exposure was produced under the RTV News banner). Segments =Clip segments= Various segments appeared in episodes, usually just as a way to thread featured videos of a similar nature. One feature that appeared often was \\"Quick Clips\\", which featured a number of quick video highlights of some amazing footage. Each episode of Daly's version had the \\"Real TV Quiz\\", which generally featured video footage of a celebrity before they became famous, challenging the viewer to guess who they were during the commercial break. Example: Zachary Ty Bryan actor from Home Improvement, was featured in a quick clip in 1998 from his appearance at the premiere of the movie \\"Blade\\" starring Wesley Snipes. Zachary was videotaped giving a shout out to Real TV on camera at the premiere by known Real TV contributor Michael Nordan a freelance videographer at the time. Viewers had to guess who the quick clip featured talent was. Announcer Beau Weaver announced the quiz at the start of the show's run before the quiz was taken over by Daly. During season 1, the quiz was before the second half of the show. The quiz moved to the end of the show at the start of season 2. =Closing clip montage and credits= Some clips were replayed during the closing credits, set to the show's theme song for most of Daly's run, although episodes with no clips during the credits had the title card on a different monitor in the studio and a short credit roll. In the show's third season, in episodes with a full credit roll, the title card appeared on a much larger monitor in the studio before the clip montage, and the 1995 Paramount Domestic Television logo also appeared on the monitor after the theme song ended. Syndication After its original run, the older episodes of Real TV (Eykel and Rashad run only) re-aired on TNN (The National Network) (later Spike TV, now The Paramount Network) from 2000 to 2003, also all older episodes of Real TV (Daly runs only) re-aired on Spike TV from 2003 to 2006, and the older episodes of Real TV (Daly runs only) re-aired on the Fox Reality Channel from 2005 to 2008.

It is a spinoff of the Super Robot series The King of Braves GaoGaiGar produced under the direction of Yoshitomo Yonetani and writer Hiroshi Yamaguchi. It aired on TV Tokyo from April 1, 1999 to September 30, 1999. Betterman uses heavily Jungian symbolism and themes, such as Animus. Plot The series' plot focuses on the threat of \\"Algernon,\\" a mutation in the brain which causes an accelerated alteration in the sensory, neural and nervous faculties. Those subjected to the phenomenon become violently hostile, suicidal, and share a hive mind collective with those who share the disease. Akamatsu Industries, a group designated to research and counteract Algernon, head a covert squadron of Neuronoids, robots piloted by Dual Kinds to inspect areas exposed to contamination and neutralize any threats brought thereabout. Keita Aono, a high school student, is brought into the fold after a chance encounter with a childhood friend, Hinoki Sai. The titular hero of the series, Betterman, is a life form of superior physical and mental capabilities via adaptation of \\"seeds.\\" Through the resulting consumption of these plants, Betterman can metamorphose into situational combat forms. His most common form is the humanoid \\"Betterman Lamia.\\" Each transformation allows Betterman to attain distinct physical, psionic, and mobility-related abilities. =Algernon= Algernon, the name of which itself derives from the book \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", is never completely understood until the final moments of the series. Even then, it is left to the viewer to deduce what Algernon exactly is. Algernon seems to be, as mentioned, either a virus, or a sort of mutation. However, it is in fact a natural method of preventing human perfection which is understood to be the root of evil. The battle between Algernon and Betterman is actually the process of human evolution. It is not entirely impossible that Algernon is everything that it is theorized to be. Victims of Algernon show symptoms like those in the end chapters of \\"Flowers for Algernon,\\" (loss of intellect and emotional control) but on a larger, more violent scale. Rage isn't the only symptom, as insanity and bodily mutation are evident in many cases. =Shared continuity with The King of Braves GaoGaiGar= Betterman takes place in the same world as The King of Braves GaoGaiGar, as characters from both series make guest appearances in the story, though only a few minor links are visually made within the series itself (and only one minor character from GaoGaiGar appears on a semi-constant basis). Characters =Protagonists= *Keita Aono - The main human protagonist of the series, whose point of view most of the story is seen from. Keita is a seventeen-year-old high school student who, through a chance reunion with his childhood friend Hinoki, finds himself recruited as a Head Diver for Akamatsu Industries. He is quite different from the typical mecha pilot seen in most anime, being rather awkward and prone to panicking easily. However, on multiple occasions, he shows his willingness to place himself in danger to protect those he cares about. He has especially high readings as a Dual Kind, and at one point is even able to pilot a Neuronoid by himself. This is a result of a transplant of dura mater he received as an infant, due to a serious head injury, from a woman named Laurier Noir. Although he shows an attraction to several girls throughout the series, he is especially fond of Hinoki, and makes no secret of his desire to pursue a relationship with her, despite the rather apathetic attitude she often displays towards him. . *Hinoki Sai - The daughter of a famous paleontologist, who was orphaned when her parents and older brother vanished during an expedition to the Ajanta Caves in India four years before the start of the series. She was recruited as a Head Diver by Akamatsu and Mode Warp shortly thereafter. Hinoki acts in a sullen manner a majority of the time, and often derides her own intelligence when asked questions that she can not, or does not wish to, answer. She is a childhood friend of Keita, but had not seen him in some time before their reunion in the first episode. Although she usually acts uninterested in his romantic advances, she shows on several occasions that she cares more for him than she lets on. She also refers to him affectionately as \\"Kei-chan\\". She, like Keita, is seventeen when the series begins. . *Shigeru Akamatsu - The founder and president of Akamatsu Industries. His company worked with Mode Warp in developing the Neuronoids, and he actively assists in their attempt to eliminate Algernon. He has an extremely inventive mind, and many of his company's products, which range from toys to military weapons, were his own ideas. His dedication to his company, however, caused his wife to leave him some time earlier, which still bothers him on occasion. *Sakura Akamatsu - Shigeru's fifteen-year-old daughter. She was born with the ability to tap into the \\"Limpid Channel\\", allowing her to pick up the waves of consciousness in the air around her. By picking up the random thoughts of other beings, she is able to give useful, seemingly precognitive, information, though often in a cryptic manner. However, she was also born with extremely poor health, and she spends much of her time confined in a special chair, known as a \\"Manage Machine\\". Although she is a Dual Kind, she only is used as a Head Diver in emergency situations, due to her weak constitution. . *Miyako Asami - A Bio- medical Engineer who works for Mode Warp. She works closely with Akamatsu Industries in trying to understand and eliminate Algernon. She was recruited by the mysterious \\"Director\\" to take part in the Dive Inspection several years earlier, and thus is familiar with several of the antagonists in the series. She is killed shortly after learning that she, as a survivor of the Dive Inspection, is a carrier of Algernon. . *Shou Yanagi - A 24-year-old Head Diver, who is usually partnered with Kaede. Although he often shows a collected personality in front of others, he suffers from psychological trauma from when his younger brother was killed in an accident while testing early Neuronoid models. Seeing Keita reminds him of his brother, causing him to break down on several occasions. He is a powerful hypnotist, and is able to hypnotize others merely by looking into their eyes. He is devoted to his partner Kaede, and after announcing her pregnancy, marries her before the final battle. He is tragically killed along with his new bride when she seemingly succumbs to Algernon and kills them both. . *Kaede Kurenai - Shou's partner, and a powerful psychic. Her dowsing abilities are a great asset in her role as a Head Diver. She has a past connection with Mammon and the Superhuman Federation, and much of the latter part of the series deals with their attempts to harness her powers. She marries Shou before the final battle, but seemingly contracts Algernon and kills both of them. Their unborn child somehow manages to survive and is rescued by one of the \\"lizard girls\\". . *Ritsuko Fuchu - Ri-chan is . *Yamajii - Yamajii is . *Lamia - The Betterman who the series in named for. Lamia often shows up when the human protagonists are in danger, transforming into one of his fighting forms to save them. He seems especially intent on saving Hinoki, whose brother he bears more than a passing resemblance to. It is later explained that by eating the Vivele Fruit that grew from Hinoki's brother, he inherited his memories, as well as some of his physical attributes. His ultimate goal is to defeat Kankel, the enemy to all life on Earth and protect Hinoki, whom he believes may also produce the revolutionary Vivele Fruit. . *Seeme - Lamia's constant companion, who usually takes the form of a large, yellow, moth-like creature. She occasionally is seen in a larger, four-legged form as well. In extreme situations, she takes the form of Betterman Lume by consuming pieces of the seed that came from Hinoki's mother, appearing as a glowing female figure. . *Bodaiju - Another Betterman who appears later in the series. He has a much darker skin tone and dresses in the raiments reminiscent of a monk. Like Lamia though, he has the tell tale characteristics of his species with red sclera, telepathic communication, and, of course, the ability to take on different fighting forms. He first appears to confront Lamia. Bodiju chastises the latter for twice breaking the taboo regarding Forte (Lamia transforme into Forte twice by then when his people regard the Forte Seed as weapon reserved for the use of a \\"leader\\"). He is also critical of Lamia's quest to protect Hinoki, thinking such efforts would be better spent in the fight against the force named Kankel. The confrontation turns into a battle between Lamia's Nebula form and Bodiju's Turba. The fight ends in a draw, but Bodiju confronts Lamia once more. After working together to survive a psychic's illusion, Bodiju agrees to assist Lamia and Seeme. The alliance is short lived as he is later slain by Kankel. Later on he psychically aides Lamia, bringing him the necessary components of the seed of Oltus (elaborating on his rivalry with Lamia by asking the latter if he can handle Oltus). *Yakusugi - A mysterious priest, rumoured to be over a hundred and twenty years old, who appears to offer aid to the protagonists at unexpected times. Through his extreme physical and psychological training, he has managed to become the pinnacle of human ability. As such, he was selected as the test subject of the Dive Inspection. However, he vanished when the experiment went wrong. Kankel was born from him as a result, and though he is connected to the creature, even Yakusugi can not keep it contained. When Lamia destroys Kankel, Yakusugi dies along with it. *Chandi - A mysterious girl, though not having a large part in the series, she's one of the lizard girl experiments. She gained her own will and appears on a few occasions to save Keita. =Antagonists= *Kazuho Heichin- An employee of Akamatsu Industries, who attempts to kill his co-workers on several occasions after contracting Algernon. He reprograms various types of machines and robots to attack his former friends, which results in the battles of the first several episodes. After being apprehended, he is later killed and used to grow an Animus Flower by BPL. *Prof. Umezaki- The head scientist of BPL, who took part in the Dive Inspection several years ago. Although his laboratory is said to be developing new food sources, he is actually developing various biological monsters, which he uses to attack Mode Warp and Akamatsu Industries' employees. His biological creatures, which range from massive beasts to killer insects, are the primary threat of much of the first half of the series. He is killed during the protagonists' attempt to attack his lab when one of his own creations, which has gained self will, turns on him. *Mugito Mamon- A powerful psychic, and the leader of the Superhuman Federation. His attempts to harness Kaede's powers are the main threat faced by the protagonists in the second half of the series. Mamon is a survivor of the Dive Inspection who still hopes to create a superior human being through psychic powers. He eventually does harness Kaede's powers long enough to transform himself into the powerful Brahman, though he still falls to Lamia during the final battle of the series. *Kankel- A mysterious, incredibly powerful being, which appears as a somewhat effeminate, shadow-like creature. It is the unexpected result of the Dive Inspection, made up entirely of cancerous cells. As such, it seeks to consume all other life and assimilate it into itself, beginning with the Bettermen, which it recognizes as its biggest threat. It is Lamia's ultimate goal to defeat this creature, which he manages to do only by transforming into the ultimate Betterman, OLTUS. Releases Betterman is composed of 26 episodes, first aired on TV Tokyo from April 1, 1999 to September 30, 1999. It was licensed and released in the USA (on DVD) by Bandai Entertainment. The series was dubbed by Ocean Productions at their Blue Water studio in Calgary, Alberta. The dubbed English version from this DVD release has also aired on the US cable network G4TV (Known as TechTV at the time of its airing) during the \\"Anime Unleashed\\" rotation, premiering on December 30, 2002. Despite this exposure, it is still a fairly unknown series to American audiences. This is perhaps due to its plot, as it is generally considered quite difficult to understand. Also, many different terms are used that are never explained, but these terms are scientifically based and often require broader knowledge concerning biology and other sciences. Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013, that Sentai Filmworks has rescued Betterman, along with a handful of other former BEI titles.

He was the first Englishman to write a canzona, an Italian form, and probably the first to write a piece for solo violin. Biography Little is known about his early life. Around 1590 he left England to pursue a musical career in Germany, as did several other prominent English musicians, sensing better job opportunities abroad. He switched employments often between the various courts in north Germany and Denmark. Between his arrival in Germany, sometime around 1590, and 1594 he worked for the Brandenburg court; between 1594 and 1596 he worked for Christian IV of Denmark in Copenhagen; then until 1599 he was back in Brandenburg. He returned that year to Copenhagen, where he stayed until 1606. From 1606 to 1608 he worked at Bückeburg in Brunswick-Lüneburg. From 1608 to 1610 he was employed in Hamburg, but he returned to Bückeburg in 1610. Evidently by 1612 he was again planning on switching jobs, for a letter surviving from that year, written by the count at Bückeburg, tells the Hamburg court pithily that he was a \\"wanton, mischievous fellow\\" and should not be allowed to have his way. However, in spite of the warning by his former employer, by 1613 he was working in Hamburg. Two years later--he liked to swap jobs every two years--he returned to Copenhagen, but in 1618 he moved on to Halle where he obtained the position of kapellmeister to the Prince of Magdeburg, Christian Wilhelm of Brandenburg (1598-1631). By 1619 he was in Berlin, and the next year he returned to Copenhagen yet again. Two years later he moved to Gottorp in Schleswig-Holstein, where he served as director of the Hofkapelle until 1625. His last years were spent in Hamburg, one of the few refuges available within Germany from the ravages of the Thirty Years' War. There is no evidence that he ever returned to England. Compositions All of Brade's surviving music is for string instruments, and most is for dancing. The earlier music, for example, in his collection published in 1609 in Hamburg, is based on English models, and similar to the contemporary work of composers such as Peter Philips and John Dowland. Later he began to work with Italian models, writing the first known canzona by an Englishman; in addition he began to arrange his dances into suites, a practice which would become common during the Baroque era. Some of the dances he wrote were in forms previously unknown in Germany such as the branle, maschera, and volta. His coral, a set of variations on a ground bass, is considered to be the earliest music written for the solo violin by an English composer; however, its attribution is not completely certain, for another source dated 1684 gives the name of another composer. Stylistically, his music is more homophonic than much of the music by his English contemporaries, who still preferred a polyphonic idiom. As a performer, he was famous for his fine technique; he was one of the most famous early violinists, and highly regarded in Germany. Several pieces by other composers were published in Hamburg as tributes to him after his death.

Following enclosures and the arrival of the railway, it developed both agriculturally and industrially during the 19th century. Due to its transport links, it now serves mainly as a dormitory for the neighbouring town of Kidderminster and for the cities of Birmingham and Worcester. Development From the time of the Domesday book, the Blakedown (earlier Bleak Down) area formed part of Hagley Parish; originally it belonged to Clent Hundred and later to the lower division of Halfshire. In 1888 the growing village was separated administratively from Hagley to merge with the small adjacent parish of Churchill; there is now a combined Parish Council for both villages. Much of Blakedown was originally an area of common land, only enclosed in 1832. With the coming of the railway line in 1852, and the consequent agricultural and industrial development, Blakedown eventually became larger than its companion, Churchill. The stream running to the south of it as an affluent to Churchill’s Wannerton Brook had been dammed to make a roadside pool as early as 1367. Formerly known as Blakedown Pool, it was later named Swan Pool. More dams were built higher up to form Springbrook Pool (now Ladies Pool), and Wheatmill Pool, eventually called Forge Pool when the agricultural mill there was redeveloped for industrial use. Even after the mills and forges were demolished, workers came from Lancashire and Cumberland for two months each year to cut the willows surrounding them for withies and clogs until the 1930s.Blakedown Church History There are still two public houses serving the road through Blakedown: the Swan Inn, dating from 1760, and the Old House at Home. The latter started as a cottage taproom in the 1830s, eventually growing to absorb two neighbouring cottages.Adopted Local Heritage The confluence of streams at the foot of the village provided power for ironworks. These included Samuel Bradley’s Spring Brook Forge, which in its heyday had a workforce of 150. The forge began as a glassworks, before diversifying to the manufacture of axles, and was demolished in 1917. The other establishment was the Blakedown Foundry, on the site of which Mill Cottage was built after 1920. Further along was a smaller foundry which later became a saw mill.Watermill Sites in North Worcestershire, pp.33-35, Hagley Historical & Field Society 1993 Many of the village shops that used to serve this clientele have now closed, although a post office and general store remain, along with some other small businesses. One business that disappeared in 2000 was the formerly renowned Blakedown Nursery, where the new Gladstone apple variety was identified in 1868. The recent building development on the nursery site was named Gladstone Place in its honour.”What’s in a name?”, Churchill & Blakedown News, October 2014 However, the greater part of the modern village was built on the other side of the railway line in the years following World War 2. There are horse-riding stables along the Belbroughton Road and the village also has some excellent sports facilities. These include a golf club which was originally a 9 hole course, now extended to 18 holes; a tennis club; and football and cricket pitches. The snooker club that was established in 1904 has former World Billiard Champion and local resident Rex Williams as Honorary President.Mike Pitt, Club history The 1920s Parish Hall with its modest Art Deco frontage houses an indoor performance space known as Theatre 282.Blakedown Parish Rooms Outside is a new bowling green completed in 2016 and below it a recreation area. Road and Rail In ancient times the Roman road between Droitwich and Greensforge ran just east of Blakedown and later developed into a saltway supplying the West Midlands. Another road linking Kidderminster to Birmingham was made a turnpike in 1753, and a toll house was built above Blakedown Pool at the junction with the Belbroughton Road. A milestone from this era with an 1807 metal plate still exists on the first bend coming into the village from Kidderminster.Churchill & Blakedown History The toll house income dwindled with the coming of the railway and the building was eventually replaced with a shop. One source of financial loss was Samuel Bradley, the owner of Spring Brook Forge, who made a short cut from Forge Lane to the station in order to avoid paying dues on his goods. Planted with trees, it is still known as The Avenue.Photo on Geograph The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened a station at the edge of the village in 1853 on land made available by the Squire of Harborough Hall. Originally it was named Churchill, then Churchill and Blakedown following the amalgamation of the two parishes.Blakedown Church History Now it is known simply as Blakedown railway station. In the station yard there still remain the single storey cottages built at the time for railway workers.Photo on Geograph The original viaduct over the wide valley of Wannerton Brook was built on wooden trestles. In 1885 what was by then the Great Western Railway replaced it with a parallel blue brick viaduct, although the red brick abutments of the old structure can still be seen on either side of the valley.Adopted Local Heritage List The station was situated on Mill Lane, where level crossing gates were operated from a signal box. After that became redundant, it was acquired by the Churchill and Blakedown Historical Society for their headquarters and in 2016 was shifted across the road to a site adjoining the station.Kidderminster Shuttle, 24 October 2016 Buildings Settlement of the area along the Kidderminster road came slowly. The timber-framed Harborough Hall was built in 1635 for William and Anne Penn on land that had belonged to the family since the reign of Edward III. On William’s death it was left to his two daughters, of whom the elder married Thomas Shenstone and was the mother of William Shenstone the poet.A History of the County of Worcester Damming produced a chain of pools below the house, curving round to Broome Mill, which was disused by the 1880s. Following shortly on the enclosure of Harborough Common in 1832, Harborough Farm was built on the other side of the main road, with two farm cottages further along the hillside.Adopted Local Heritage The main street in 1917 at the Belbroughton turn; the telegraph office on the left is now the post office At the opposite end of the village, beyond the parish boundary, there was once a half-timbered cottage on the slope, with the village smithy on the other side of the main road, both of which were demolished in the early 20th century. Springbrook House, dating from the turn of the 18th century, still survives, as does the contemporary Churchill corn mill beside Wannerton Brook.Photo on Geograph Along the village street there are two survivals from the end of the 18th century, Castle Ash and Jack’s Cottage (which now adjoins the Post Office). Rose Cottage, near the Belbroughton Road, dates from 1820 but has since been combined with the former blacksmith’s round the corner. Beyond the blacksmith on Belbroughton Road (which continued to be called by its old name of The Common for decades) there were the narrow plots of Victorian cottage developments, each with their peaked porch.Photo on Geograph On the other side of the road were the cottages built for foundry workers in the 1830s at the top of Forge Lane.Adopted Local Heritage By 1860 there were enough inhabitants in the village for the church of St James the Great to be built to a design by Gothic revivalist George Edmund Street. At first it consisted of a simple nave and chancel with an ornamental bell-turret at the gable end. The sandstone for the church was quarried from the grounds of Hagley Hall, the residence of the Lyttelton lords of the manor at the time. In 1865 two Sunday morning services were held to accommodate the growing population and in the following year a rooftop wooden bell-tower was added (later renewed in 1915 at the same time as a new aisle and vestry were built).Buildings of England (2007), p.155-6Photo on Geograph A school associated with the church was first housed in a tin hut in the churchyard, replaced in 1885 with a brick building which now functions as a nursery school. The new primary school occupies modern buildings on a site adjacent to the churchyard.

It was built in 1864 without an Act of Parliament and was operated using horse power. The tramway was absorbed into the Croesor and Port Madoc Railway in 1865 and later became the Portmadoc, Croesor and Beddgelert Tram Railway in 1879. Part of its route, from Croesor Junction to Porthmadog, was taken over by the Welsh Highland Railway in 1922, and upgraded to allow the operation of steam locomotives. The remainder of the line continued as a horse-drawn tramway, and operated as such until the mid-1940s.  History  Slate quarrying in the remote Cwm Croesor (Croesor valley) dates back to at least 1846 when the Croesor Quarry opened. Quarrying expanded in the early 1860s and transportation to the shipping wharfs at Porthmadog became a limiting factor. In 1862 discussion began to construct a tramway to connect the valley with the sea. An initial company, the Croesor Valley Railroad was proposed under the ownership of Hugh Beaver Roberts and two other quarry proprietors. In the meantime, slate from the Croesor Quarry was being hauled by pack mule over to the adjacent Cwm Orthin and down to the Ffestiniog Railway at Tanygrisiau, a long and dangerous journey. In 1863 Beaver Roberts commenced construction of the tramway, by now known as the Croesor Tramway. It opened to goods and mineral traffic on or before 1 August. 1864. The Rhosydd Quarry at the head of the valley was connected that year. The Rhosydd quarry failed in 1873, but a new company was formed to reopen it as the New Rhosydd quarry in 1874. In 1879 the railway company was renamed the Portmadoc, Croesor and Beddgelert Tram Railway Company and authorised to build a branch to Beddgelert, although this was never constructed. The company went into receivership in 1882 and was sold in 1902 to the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway, one of the precursors of the Welsh Highland Railway. The tramway continued to carry slate from the quarries along Cwm Croesor until 1944, when the last wagons were sent down the Rhosydd incline and on towards Porthmadog. The track from Croesor Junction to Croesor Village was lifted between 1948 and 1949. The remaining track, between Croesor and Blaen y Cwm continued in unofficial use by local farmers until the late 1950s.  Route  Map of the Croesor Tramway = Across Traeth Mawr = The Croesor Tramway ran from the wharves at Porthmadog to the quarries at the head of Cwm Croesor. The southern end of the line connected to the Ffestiniog Railway near a timber yard at Cornhill. The line swung to the north and ran through the western edge of the town. North of the Snowdon Mill it crossed the Cambrian Railways Machynlleth-Pwllheli line on the level before heading north across Traeth Mawr - the great polder behind The Cob. A short standard gauge branch from Porthmadog Station ran on the western side of the tramway to meet the narrow gauge at Beddgelert Sidings. This was an interchange point where much of the slate from the quarries was transferred to the Cambrian for shipment onwards. From Beddgelert Siding, the line ran north east across Traeth Mawr. It crossed the Afon Glaslyn a mile north of Porthmadog. This was initially a wooden bridge, though later it was replaced with a substantial stone bridge that carried both the railway and the road over the river. The road and railway ran parallel almost as far as Croesor Junction. Croesor Junction did not exist before 1901, when the tramway was purchased by the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway. After 1901 it became the junction between the tramway heading north east and what would become the Welsh Highland Railway heading north west. The tramway continued to Pont Garreg-Hylldrem where it ran alongside the Afon Maesgwm for a short distance. Here the tramway climbed the first of a series of inclines into Cwm Croesor. = Inclines to Croesor village = The first incline, the Lower Parc incline, rises around past Beudy-Newydd farm house. At the top of the incline the tramway turns through a tight s-bend and immediately arrives at the foot of the Upper Parc incline. This rises another and ends in a winding house that straddles the tramway - this has been preserved and converted into a home. The tramway continues to run north-east entering the village of Croesor where is crosses the main road into the village on the level. = Cwm Croesor = Croesor valley from the top of the Blaen y Cwm incline North from the village, the line crosses Afon Croesor on a low slate-built bridge then continues along the bottom of Cwm Croesor. The valley floor here is nearly level and the line travels almost straight to the north east. Apart from a shallow cutting near Croesor Uchaf farm, this section of the tramway has no significant engineering features. This section terminates at Blaen y Cwm. Here the tramway crosses Afon Croesor once more, again on a low slate bridge. Immediately on the left is Blaen y Cwm power station, a very early hydro-electric turbine, used to provide power to Croesor Quarry above. This is also the foot of the Blaen y Cwm incline which rises up the end wall of the valley. = North of Blaen y Cwm = From the top of the Blaen y Cwm incline the line turns sharply eastward and takes on a different character. It runs across the end of the valley, on well-built embankments and through cuttings, following the contours. About half a mile from the head of the incline it crosses a tributary of the Afon Croesor on a high bridge; the bridge was restored in the 1990s. Shortly afterwards the line curves to the north and reaches its upper terminus under the cliffs of Bwlch y Rhosydd. Here two extremely long inclines rise, one north to reach the Rhosydd Tramway and one east to reach Croesor Quarry. = Branches = A large number of branches from the tramway served the quarries of Cwm Croesor. The first of these branched off at the foot of the Lower Parc incline and served the Parc Slate Quarry, a significant source of traffic for the tramway. The branch ran along the east bank of the Afon Maesgwym and rose by a substantial incline to the quarry. The next branch was just south of Croesor village and served the separate Parc Slate and Slab Quarry. This branch curved away on the eastern side of the tramway and reached the quarry by a short incline. Halfway between Croesor village and the foot of the Blaen y Cwm incline, another incline branched off to the east. This incline climbed directly up the side of the valley. At the head of the incline, two tramways ran north and south along the contour line of the hill. The northern line ran via a further incline to Pant Mawr Quarry, which lies at the head of Cwm Maesgwyn. The connection to Pant Mawr was short lived, being dismantled between 1891 and 1901. It was replaced by the line heading south, which went to Fron-Boeth Quarry which was also within Cwm Maesgwyn, and about a mile south-west of Pant Mawr. The tramway to Fron-Boeth went through a long tunnel beneath the Braich-Parc ridge that separates Cwm Croesor and Cwm Maesgwyn. A further incline and tramway connected Fron-Boeth to a mill and adit that served the former Pant Mawr mine. This line was still in use in the 1920s. The final pair of branches ran from the northern terminus of the tramway proper. Two immense inclines began here, one climbing directly eastwards to Croesor Quarry, the other heading nearly north and rising to connect to a high tramway to Rhosydd Quarry. This latter incline formed a parabolic curve and at its head climbed at 1 in 0.97, one of the steepest inclines in Wales. From the head of the incline, the Rhosydd Tramway ran about a mile to the mill level. This tramway was particularly well engineered, running for much of its distance on high embankments hundreds of feet above Cwm Croesor.  Post closure  After the demise of the original Welsh Highland Railway, the stub of the tramway from Croesor village to the foot of the Blaen y Cwm incline continued in use to carry agricultural products for local farms, until the late 1950s. The rails from this section were recovered some time in the 1960s by members of the Welsh Highland Railway preservation society and were stored at the site of Beddgelert station. The section from Croesor Junction to the slate quarries will probably never re-open as the quarries have long since closed. However the part of the Croesor tramway that ran from Croesor Junction to Porthmadog has been rebuilt as part of the resurrection of the Welsh Highland Railway from Caernarfon to Porthmadog. The section between Croesor Junction and opened in May 2010. The section from Pont Croesor to Porthmadog reopened on 8 January 2011, whereby it linked up with the Ffestiniog Railway to allow through trains to Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station via the Porthmadog cross town link.

Family and early life  Old house in Bourges that was formerly thought to be Jacques Cœur's birthplace He was born at Bourges, the city where his father, Pierre Cœur, was a rich merchant. Jacques is first heard of around 1418, when he married Macée de Léodepart, daughter of Lambert de Léodepart, an influential citizen, provost of Bourges and a former valet of John, Duke of Berry. About 1429 he formed a commercial partnership with two brothers named Godard; and in 1432 he was at Damascus, buying and bartering, and transporting the wares of the Levant--gall-nuts, wools and silks, mohair, brocades and carpets--to the interior of France by way of Narbonne. In the same year he established himself at Montpellier, and there began the gigantic operations which have made him illustrious among financiers. Details are wanting; but it is certain that in a few years he placed his country in a position to contend fairly well with the great trading republics of Italy, and acquired such a reputation as to be able, mere trader as he was, to render material assistance to the knights of Rhodes and to Venice itself.

The country was deluged with base monies from three reigns, charged with superscriptions both French and English, and Charles was determined to make sweeping reforms. In this design he was ably seconded by the merchant, who, in fact, inspired or prepared all the ordinances concerning the coinage of France issued between 1435 and 1451. In 1438, he was made steward of the royal expenditure; in 1441 he and his family were ennobled by letters patent. He chose the motto A vaillans cuers riens impossible, \\"To a valiant heart, nothing is impossible\\". In 1444, he was sent as one of the royal commissioners to preside over the new parliament of Languedoc in Pézenas, where his house can still be seen, a position he held until the day of his disgrace. In 1445, his agents in the East negotiated a treaty between the sultan of Egypt and the knights of Rhodes; and in 1447, at his insistence, Jean de Village, his nephew by marriage, was charged with a mission to Egypt. The results were most important; concessions were obtained which greatly improved the position of the French consuls in the Levant, and that influence in the East was thereby founded which, though often interrupted, was for several centuries a major commercial glory for France. In the same year, Cœur assisted in an embassy to Amadeus VIII, former Duke of Savoy, who had been chosen Pope as Felix V by the council of Basel and in 1448 he represented the French king at the court of Pope Nicholas V where he was able to arrange an agreement between Nicholas and Amadeus, and so end the papal schism. Nicholas treated him with the utmost distinction, lodged him in the papal palace, and gave him special licence to traffic with the infidels. From about this time he made advances to Charles to carry on his wars and in 1449, after fighting at the King's side throughout the campaign, he entered Rouen in Charles' triumphal procession. Château d'Ainay-le-Vieil, owned by Jacques Cœur between 1435 and 1451 At this point, Cœur's glory was at its height. He had represented France in three embassies, and had supplied funding for the king's successful reconquest of Normandy. He was invested with various offices of state, and possessed a fortune that was viewed as colossal and unprecedented by his contemporaries. He had 300 managers in his employ, and business houses in many of the chief cities of France. He had built houses and chapels, and had founded colleges in Paris, Montpellier and Bourges. The in Bourges was exceptionally magnificent and remains today one of the finest monuments of the Middle Ages in France. He also built a sacristy and a family burial chapel in the Bourges Cathedral. His brother Nicolas Cœur was made Bishop of Lyon, his sister married Jean Bochetel, the King's secretary, his daughter married the son of the Viscount of Bourges, and his son Jean Cœur became Archbishop of Bourges. Cœur also actively acquired titles and properties during his heyday: e.g. the lordship of Ainay-le-Vieil in 1435, the Château de Boisy by Pouilly-les-Nonains in 1447, the Château de Menetou-Salon and the lordship of Barlieu in 1448, the lordship of Puisaye in 1450, the in 1451. Palace of Jacques Cœur in Bourges, courtyard  Downfall  Cœur's huge monopoly also caused his ruin. Dealing in everything: money and arms, furs and jewels, brocades and wool, a broker, a banker, a farmer, he had absorbed much of the trade of the country, and merchants complained they could make no profit because of him. He had lent money to needy courtiers, to members of the royal family, and to the King himself, and his debtors, jealous of his wealth, were eager for a chance to cause his downfall. In February 1450 Agnès Sorel, the King's mistress, suddenly died. Eighteen months later it was rumoured that she had been poisoned, and a lady of the court who owed money to Jacques Cœur, Jeanne de Vendôme, wife of François de Montberon, and an Italian, Jacques Colonna, formally accused him of having poisoned her. There was no motivation for such a charge, but for this and other alleged crimes, King Charles VII on 31 July 1451 gave orders for his arrest and for the seizure of his goods, reserving for himself a large sum of money for the war in Guienne. Commissioners extraordinary, several of which were among Cœur's enemies at the royal court, were chosen to conduct the trial and an inquiry began, the judges in which were either the prisoner's debtors or the holders of his forfeited estates. He was accused of having paid French gold and ingots to Muslim infidels, of coining light money, of kidnapping oarsmen for his galleys, of sending back a Christian slave who had taken sanctuary on board one of his ships, and of committing frauds and exactions in Languedoc to the King's prejudice. He defended himself with all the energy of his nature. His innocence was manifest but a conviction was necessary, and in spite of strenuous efforts on the part of his friends, after twenty-two months of confinement in five prisons, he was condemned to do public penance for his fault, to pay the king a sum equal to about 1,000,000 at today's value, and to remain a prisoner till full satisfaction had been obtained. His sentence also included confiscation of all his property, and exile during His Majesty's pleasure. On 5 June 1453 the sentence took effect. At Poitiers, the shame of making honourable amends was accomplished and for nearly three years nothing is known of him. It is probable that he remained in prison. Meanwhile, his vast possessions were distributed among Charles VII's favorite courtiers.  Escape, Papal patronage and death  In 1455 Jacques Cœur contrived to escape into Provence. He was pursued, but a party headed by Jean de Village and two of his old managers, carried him off to Tarascon, whence, by way of Marseille, Nice and Pisa, he managed to reach Rome. He was honorably and joyfully received by Nicholas V, who was fitting out an expedition against the Turks. On the death of Nicholas, Calixtus III continued his work, and made his guest, Cœur, captain of a fleet of sixteen galleys sent to the relief of Rhodes. Cœur set out on this expedition, but was taken ill at Chios, and died there on 25 November 1456. After his death Charles VII showed himself well disposed to the family, and allowed Jacques Cœur's sons to inherit whatever was left of their father's wealth. Aftermath Following Cœur's disgrace and death, his heirs attempted to recover some of his former properties in legal procedures that lasted several decades. They had partial success when Antoine de Chabannes, who had appropriated and bought Cœur's domains in Puisaye, himself lost royal favor upon the accession of King Louis XI in the early 1460s. The reversal, however, was short-lived, and Chabannes recovered all the titles and properties by special provisions of the Treaty of Conflans in 1465. The procedures were finally settled in 1489 between the Cœurs and Jean de Chabannes, Antoine's son and sole male heir. Legacy Statue of Jacques Cœur by Élias Robert in the Louvre, early 1850s Auguste Préault in Bourges, late 1870s The urban palace Jacques Cœur had built for himself in Bourges, or , is a major monument of French 15th-century civil architecture. It was converted into a court house in the 19th century, and carefully restored in the 20th century. Other buildings are allegedly or inaccurately associated with Jacques Coeur. The maison de Jacques Cœur in Paris is generally viewed as having been built or purchased by Jacques Cœur's son Geoffrey, thus a misnomer. Other ancient houses are known as maison de Jacques Cœur, in Pézenas, Sancerre, and L'Arbresle. Jacques Cœur was portrayed by Élias Robert in the early 1850s as one of a series of statues of illustrious Frenchmen that adorn the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre Palace. Another public statue of Jacques Cœur, by sculptor Auguste Préault, was erected in 1879 in Bourges in front of the entrance to his palace. Banknote featuring Jacques Cœur, 1940 He was portrayed on a French banknote, the designed at the end of the Third Republic, in use under Vichy France and until June 1945. Replica of Préault’s statue of Jacques Cœur in Montpellier, in front of a marketplace also named after him (Halles Jacques Cœur) Jacques Cœur neighborhood in Montpellier, around the Bassin Jacques Cœur Streets and squares named after Jacques Cœur exist in numerous French towns and cities, including Bourges, Montpellier, and Paris. Bourges honored its native son in multiple instances, e.g. the ' (Cœur High School) and the Théâtre Jacques Cœur (Cœur Theater). In Montpellier, Jacques Cœur is associated with the development of the local port of Lattes. Several projects were named after him in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, as the city expanded towards the sea along the river Lez. These include a marketplace in the Antigone neighborhood along the Lez; an artificial lake, the Bassin Jacques Cœur in the city's new district; and a theater in Lattes. The is a scenic route that links together a number of sights and castles near Bourges, many of which however have no historical associations with Jacques Cœur. Assessment In a 1997 biography, French historian revises the established view in French historiography, according to which Jacques Coeur exhibited outstanding skills and success as a merchant. He notes that there is no evidence that Cœur's ventures, e.g. in mining near Lyon, were particularly profitable, and that the fleet he established for Levantine commerce was modest in size (never more than four galleys) compared with those of prominent Italian or Catalan merchants. Instead, Heers suggests that Cœur's success was overwhelmingly due to his position at the royal court, and that his riches came from leveraging his privileged access to state resources. Thus, Heers implies that, rather than a brilliant merchant, Cœur is best viewed as a skilled technocrat and a predecessor to the likes of Nicolas Fouquet or Jean- Baptiste Colbert. Cultural references François Villon, in his poem Épitaphe, refers to Cœur's fabled wealth: De pauvreté me guermantant, Souventes fois me dit le cœur : \\"Homme, ne te doulouse tant Et ne démène tel douleur: Si tu n'as tant qu'eut Jacques Cœur, Mieux vaux vivre sous gros bureau Pauvre, qu'avoir été seigneur Et pourrir sous riche tombeau.\\" To ease my poverty, my heart sometimes says to me: \\"Don't fret so and go crazy with pain: If you haven't as much as Jacques Cœur, it's better to live in your coarse burrel, poor, than to have been lord and rot in your rich tomb.\\"'' Jacques Cœur appears in Fulcanelli's Mystère des Cathédrales (1926) where the \\"master alchemist\\" speculates that Cœur was a successful alchemist or associated with alchemists and that he was a silversmith in the literal sense, i.e. that he could transmute base metals into small quantities of silver. He is the titular protagonist of Le Grand Cœur, a 2012 novel by Jean-Christophe Rufin who was also born in Bourges.

In a favorable review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described 'Freak Scene' as the album's \\"masterpiece\\" and opined \\"Although the majority of the album is firmly situated in the sprawling, noisy metallic fusion of hard rock and avant noise, Bug also demonstrates that J Mascis has a talent for winding folk-rock.

The Heavenly Bodies is a professional wrestling tag team famous for having worked in Smoky Mountain Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation, and various independent promotions. It effectively served as a 'spiritual' continuation/expansion of The Midnight Express post WCW. Over the years, there have been multiple variations of the team, which has at different times consisted of \\"Doctor\\" Tom Prichard, \\"Sweet\\" Stan Lane, \\"Beautiful\\" Bobby Eaton, as well as \\"Gigolo\\" Jimmy Del Ray, and was led by Heel Manager James E. Cornette. History =Prichard and Lane= In 1992, veteran wrestlers Tom Prichard and Stan Lane first formed The Heavenly Bodies in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). Managed by Jim Cornette, Prichard and Lane became the first ever SMW Tag Team Champions. Later into the promotion, following his departure from World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Bobby Eaton was added to the team. Manager Jim Cornette explained that any two of the three men could defend the belts at any given time, as he had registered the Heavenly Bodies with SMW as a 'Corporation'. During their tenure in SMW, The Heavenly Bodies had long running feuds with the likes of The New Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Jackie Fulton) and The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson). Their feuds were often highlighted with hardcore matches and numerous title changes. A cross-promotional deal with WCW allowed The Heavenly Bodies to appear at the SuperBrawl III pay-per-view event on February 21, 1993. They lost their match to The Rock 'n' Roll Express. The 'Bodies', as a group, briefly held both the Tag Titles and the TV Title (SMW's secondary Championship). =Prichard and Del Ray= In May 1993, Lane left the team after losing a loser-of-the-fall leaves town match. The core duo continued with Lane replaced by Pritchard's \\"cousin\\" \\"Gigolo\\" Jimmy Del Ray. Over the next few years, the new duo competed not only in SMW but also in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and United States Wrestling Association (USWA). They continued their feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express in these promotions and began new rivalries with The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner), and The Smoking Gunns (Bart and Billy Gunn). In July 1993, SMW's unique cross- promotional deal with the WWF allowed The Heavenly Bodies and The Rock 'n' Roll Express to wrestle on the two organization's pay-per-view shows. SMW formed a working agreement with the WWF that allowed The Heavenly Bodies to appear on WWF programming. Prichard and Del Ray unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam 1993 but captured the SMW Tag Team Championship against The Rock 'n' Roll Express three months later at Survivor Series 1993. During their time in the WWF, they wrestled a tour for All Japan Pro Wrestling in May 1994, and returned to SMW in the summer of 1994 to feud with teams like The Rock 'n' Roll Express, The Thrillseekers (Chris Jericho and Lance Storm) and The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed). In 1995, The Bodies defeated PG-13 (J.C. Ice and Wolfie D) to capture the USWA Tag Team Championship. Later in the year, Prichard and Del Ray also competed in ECW, aligning themselves with Raven (see Raven's Nest) to face off against The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge). Following the November 1995 closure of SMW, The Heavenly Bodies disbanded. Their last match as a team occurred in ECW on December 9, 1995, losing to The Public Enemy. Prichard joined the WWF as Zip of The Bodydonnas while Del Ray competed on the independent circuit and WCW as \\"Jimmy Graffti\\". =DeNucci and Nelson= A new Heavenly Bodies team began to compete on the independent circuit around 2000. The New Heavenly Bodies, comprising \\"Vivacious\\" Vito DeNucci and \\"Casanova\\" Chris Nelson captured the NWA World Tag Team Championship three times, and on occasion, \\"Gigolo\\" Jimmy Del Ray serve as their manager. DeNucci and Nelson once were the longest reigning NWA World Tag Team champions, but have since been surpassed by America's Most Wanted. The duo occasionally appear on various independent wrestling shows. The team also wrestled in IPW as Drunk and Disorderly; as well as holding the NWA World Tag Team Championships three times, they have also held the IPW Tag Team Championships among others. On April 3, 2010 the New Heavenly Bodies defeated the Dark City Fight Club (Jon Davis and Kory Chavis) to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. On April 16 DeNucci and Nelson lost the titles back to the Dark City Fight Club. =Golden and Thunder= Eddie Golden and K.C. Thunder, former rivals in Southern States Wrestling, teamed together as The Heavenly Bodies throughout the Southeastern United States during 2008. They were occasionally accompanied by their valet Dawn Renea. Although short-lived compared to the prior incarnations, they won the tag team titles in the New Frontier Wrestling Association and challenged the tag champions in NWA All-Star Wrestling. In one of their last matches together, they wrestled Iron Cross and Stan Lee in a Texas Tornado death match at middle school fundraiser in Lebanon, Virginia. According to the pre-match stipulation, The Heavenly Bodies' valet Dawn Renae would have her head shaved if the team failed to win the belts.

After 10 years of manufacturing Peugeot 405 in Iran Khodro company, Peugeot Persia was designed as a facelift of the 405. Peugeot Persia was soon renamed to Peugeot Safir and eventually Peugeot Pars because of local copyright problems. Peugeot Pars had been made in three models Pars, Pars 16V, and Pars ELX. The 16V and ELX models use a more powerful PSA 16 valve engine and a few extra facilities. Engine The PSA-borrowed engine is XU7JP (code LFZ, known as L3 in Iran) 1.8 L SOHC with 2 valves per cylinder capable of producing a maximum power of 101 PS (74 kW) at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 153 Nm (15.6 kgf m / 113 ft·lbf) at 3000 rpm which is controlled by SAGEM SL96 ECU. The same engine was already in use in the PSA's Peugeot 405 1.8 SR, Peugeot 306 1.8i 8v, Citroën Xantia 1.8i 8v, and Citroën Xsara 1.8i 8v. Peugeot Pars 16V Not as equipped as ELX, this model was simply an upgraded version of Pars in aspects of engine and rear brakes. The 16V employed a more powerful 16 valve engine, and rear disc brakes, but ABS was not available even as an option. The 16V model's production lasted less than a year; began on the second quarter of 2003 and ended on the first quarter of 2004 (making them 1382 model year based on Persian calendar), the same time it was replaced with the ELX model. Many Iranian car industry critics believe its production was a case study of the Iranian car market capacity performed by Iran Khodro before beginning the production of ELX to see if people are seeking for more powerful and luxurious versions of Pars. As an improvement to Pars, the 16V utilizes solid disc brakes on rear wheels, but unlike the ELX which is equipped with an advanced ABS/EBD, the 16V model uses the same vacuum booster, master cylinder, distributor, and hydraulic lines as the standard Pars. The more powerful LFY engine fitted to the 16V models grabbed the interest of the authorities who are always seeking for high-performance yet inexpensive cars as service vehicles. A large number of 16Vs were produced according to requests registered by Iranian governmental organizations. 16Vs can be seen as parliament service cars and also motorcade escorts. Peugeot Pars ELX Peugeot Pars ELX Comparing to Pars, the ELX features smart instrument cluster, multi-purpose Persian-reading dashboard telematics, alarm with door auto-lock, park assistant, electric Recaro cloth seats equipped with heater/cooling fan, luxury dashboard trim, passenger illuminated vanity mirror, a more powerful 16 valve engine, 4-disc brakes with ABS/EBD, and finally rally alloy wheels. The PSA-borrowed engine is XU7JP4 (code LFY, known as L4 in Iran) 1.8 L DOHC with 4 hydraulically adjusted valves per cylinder capable of producing a maximum power of 109.0 bhp (81.3 kW / 110.5 PS) at 5500 rpm and a maximum torque of 155.0 N·m (15.8 kgf·m / 114 ft·lbf) at 4250 rpm which is controlled by Bosch Motronic MP 7.3 ECU. The same engine was already in use in the PSA's Peugeot 406 LX 1.8i 16v, Citroën Xantia SX 1.8i 16v, and Citroën Xsara VTS 1.8i 16v. The ABS/EBD-featured MK20-E servo-assisted dual-circuit brake system is partially manufactured by Iranian Toklan Toos under license of Continental Teves. It is coupled to ventilated discs on front and solid discs on rear wheels. Front single-piston calipers are also manufactured by Toklan Toos under license of Lucas-TVS and rear single-piston calipers are manufactured by Girling. The Italian-made rally light-weight one-piece flow-formed cast aluminium wheels are provided by Speedline Corse; the manufacturer claims these Turini (type 2120) wheels are FEA-cast in low pressure, heat-treated, low-weight, and designed in accordance with latest FIA regulations for tarmac rally Super 1600 kit cars. The 11-spoke wheel has a diameter of 15 inches, a section width of 7 inches, a bolt pattern of 4 x 108 mm (4 x 4.25\\"), an ET of 38 millimeters, and is attached to the ELX's hub applying four 19 mm lugs. Peugeot Pars LX The PSA-borrowed engine is TU5JP4 (code NFU, known as TU5 in Iran) 1.6 L DOHC with 4 valves per cylinder capable of producing a maximum power of 109 PS (80 kW) at 5800 rpm and a maximum torque of 142 Nm (14.47 kgf m / 104.73 ft·lbf) at 4000 rpm which is controlled by Crouse Or Bosch ECU.

The platforms were lengthened in the 1990s to allow longer trains to call (see image - the hollow space and the white fence mark the extension). This is because Blakedown is within the Birmingham commuter band and over the twenty years between 1998 - 2018 usage of the station has increased by 147%. Currently there is a proposal to develop a car park on an adjacent field site to cater for further anticipated growth.Blakedown station car park options: report for Worcestershire County Council, 27 June 2019 Since August 2012 the signalling system has been altered, with the former signal box having been closed and control of the nearby crossing and signals transferred to the West Midlands SCC at Saltley.

As with public libraries, some people use bookplates - stamps, stickers or embossing - to show ownership of the items. Some people sell their private libraries to established institutions such as the Library of Congress, or, as is often the case, bequeath them after death. Much less often, a private library is maintained intact long after the death of the owner. One such example is the personal library of Dr Rudolf Steiner, which has been maintained intact in Switzerland for close to a century.Paull, John (2018) The Library of Rudolf Steiner: The Books in English, Journal of Social and Development Sciences. 9 (3): 21–46. History Dingestow by Charlotte Bosanquet Private library of Russian archaeologist Ivan Zabelin The earliest libraries belonged to temples or administration bodies, resembled modern archives, and were usually restricted to nobility, aristocracy, scholars, or theologians. Examples of the earliest known private libraries include one found in Ugarit (dated to around 1200 BC) and the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh (near modern Mosul, Iraq), dating back to the 7th century BC. = Mesopotamia = Mesopotamia was home to a great number of private libraries, many with extensive collections of over 400 tablets. The nucleus of these private libraries were primarily texts which had been transcribed by the proprietors themselves from the time they acquired their education in the art of the scribe. As insignificant as these libraries may seem, they established the basis for the Library of Ashurbanipal collection. =Egypt= While private libraries in ancient Egypt were not common, they did exist to some extent. One of the problems in identifying potential individual libraries is that it is often difficult to distinguish between a personal library and one associated with a temple. However, many personal libraries survived over time, and are perhaps more numerous than traditionally assumed. Several private tombs have exposed copious texts whose content is scholarly in nature. In addition, extensive clusters of papyrus scrolls have been unearthed in association with domiciliary arrangements, confirming that some type of library endured there. The Middle Kingdom Period (2055–1650 BC) offers the best clues to the presence of private libraries in ancient Egypt. For example, one sepulcher contained a chest with books on bureaucratic relations, hymns, and incantations. In total, the cache revealed a 20-volume library. A rather large collection from the Thirteenth Dynasty suggests a library belonging to a doctor or necromancer. In addition to general texts on assorted literature, there is a profusion of discourses on medicine and magic. A private library of considerable quantity is attributed to Kenherkhepshef, a scribe. This library embodies nearly 50 manuscripts, accommodating a collection of disparate subjects from correspondence missives to astrological recipes such as incantations and dream interpretations. This particular library spanned many generations, being passed to one family member to the next, which gives the impression of the significance the library had. A manuscript known as the Westcar Papyrus from this same period alludes to an individual whose residence occupies spaces for a private library. The text of the manuscript is a fanciful narrative; however, it proves that ordinary citizens were literate and accumulated books for their own use. One Middle Kingdom tomb, associated with a healer and lector priest, contained over 20 books, one of which was the now-famous Tale of the Eloquent Peasant. Finally, a private library in a New Kingdom tomb at the site of Deir el Medina housed books on medicine as well as on love poetry and wisdom literature. = Ancient Greece = In 600 BC, library and archival collections in ancient Greece flourished. Within the next three centuries the culture of the written word rose to a pinnacle there. Although public libraries available to all citizens were established in some cities, such as Athens, most citizens could not read. However, private book collections owned by the elite and leading citizens were growing, along with the glorious homes and structures used to store them. Private libraries were not only built by the wealthy, but also by professionals who needed information nearby, including doctors and scholars. Notable scholarly figures like Euripides, Herodotus, Thucydides, and even Plato had their own private libraries with large collections. One of the most notable figures in ancient Greece with his own private library was Aristotle. Establishing his personal collection into a library at the Lyceum, Aristotle allowed his students and fellow scholars to use it. After his death, his collection grew to include the work of Theophrastus and student research. The collection was thought to have been scattered after Theophrastus' own death by Neleus. While most of the collection was supposedly brought to Rome and Constantinople, other pieces within the collection were sold to the Library of Alexandria, only to be destroyed later with the library. =Ancient China= There were numerous private libraries in Ancient China. These institutions were called \\"book collection house\\" in Chinese, which was widely accepted from Song Dynasty. Under the influence of petty-farmer consciousness, the patriarchal system, lack of books, and other factors, \\"hiding book\\" thinking was dominant then. Not all private libraries in ancient China were unavailable to the public. Some owners made their collection open to the public. = Ancient Rome = The earliest libraries to appear in Rome were of the private type and were most often procured as spoils of war. For example, when the Roman general Aemilius defeated the Macedonian king Perseus in 168 BC, the only plunder he wished to possess was the king's private library. Likewise, in 86 BC, the Roman general Sulla appropriated the library of the infamous Greek bibliophile and kleptobibliophile Apellicon of Teos. Finally, around 73 BC, Lucullus removed and brought back to Rome the private library of King Mithridates VI of the Pontus region. Nearly every house of nobility had a library, and virtually every one was split into two rooms: one for Latin texts and one for Greek texts. Rome may very well have been the birthplace of specialized libraries, with evidence of early medical and legal libraries. In Rome, one can see the beginnings of book preservation. One author proposed that a library is better suited if it meets the rising sun in the east in order to ensure that it does not succumb to bookworms and decomposition. Some examples of Roman-period private libraries include the Villa of the Papyri, the House of Menander, the House of Augustus, and the Domus Aurea. In the 5th century BC, on the island of Cos outside the city of Pergamum, a medical school complex with a library was built in the sanctuary of Asclepius. This is the first medical school known to have existed, and consequently can be credited as the first specialized library. Small private libraries called bibliothecae were responsible for advancing the larger public libraries of the Roman world. The design of these libraries was rather a novelty, and became the archetype of later institutions, in particular libraries of imperial estates. The form of private libraries during the late Republic Period and early Empire Period imitated Greek architectural characteristics. The library itself was a repository of diminutive proportions whose purpose was to accommodate books. The books were supported on wooden shelving units or were kept in cupboards situated against walls. Rooms annexed to the library were used primarily as reading rooms. The configuration of these libraries was rectangular and is considered more of niche than a separate room because they were always extensions of other structures. Acquiring books for personal use in order to cultivate oneself was all the rage in the Roman world, partially galvanized by the monarchs who were often prolific writers. Satirist Martial notes that it was quite accepted for the houses of the Roman elite to harbor a library. One reason for the abundance of private libraries is the reinforcement of enlightenment and perpetuating the literary traditions. It was also not uncommon for an individual to assemble a library in order to inveigle an emperor. The writer Lucian of Samosata denounces one such individual who exploits his library to cajole the emperor. The emperor Augustus admired the works of authors and was a prolific author himself. He encouraged the advancement of the library as an institution by harboring a private library of his own. The library was the first to incorporate Greek and Hellenic architectural behaviors. The shape of the library was in the recognizable rectangular style. This library marked the establishment of a binary collection with individual rooms supporting the literatures of Greek and Roman writers respectively. Both the philologist Aulus Gellius and the emperor Marcus Aurelius acknowledge the existence of a private library housed in the Domus Tiberiana. While Aurelius makes a passing reference to a bibliothecarius or palace librarian, Gellius commented on how he and author Sulpicius Apollinaris were engaged in erudite disquisition within the library. The Roman sovereign Hadrian had a fondness for all types of literature; his private sanctuary, the Villa Adriana, had its own library. Like the private library of Augustus, Hadrian’s collection promoted a doublet of Greek and Latin writings. It is difficult to ascertain how many manuscripts the libraries held; however, one assessment speculates that at a single wooden cabinet may have held at least 1,500 scrolls. During the tenure of Nero, an affluent residence was not complete without a library. In fact, libraries were as important as baths. The third century biographer Capitolinus remarks on a private library owned by the Emperor Gordion II. Apparently, the original owner of this library was the father of scholar and polymath Quintus Serenus Sammonicus, whom Gordion was a student of. Upon the death of Sammonicus in 212 AD, the library of some 62,000 manuscripts was entrusted to Gordion. It is not clear what happened to this library, but it has been suggested that it was absorbed by the libraries of the Palatine, Pantheon, or Ulpian. It is also conceivable that it had been interspersed during the upheavals of the third century. =Renaissance Europe= Mme Recamier in her library The Renaissance brought with it a renewed interest in conserving the new ideas being put forth by the great thinkers of the day. Kings throughout European countries created libraries, some of which have become the national libraries of today. In addition, wealthy individuals began establishing and developing their own private libraries. The National Library of France () in Paris was started in 1367 as the Royal Library of King Charles V. In Florence, Italy, Cosimo de Medici had a private library which formed the basis of the Laurentian Library. The Vatican library was also established in the 15th century. Pope Nicholas V helped to renew the Vatican Library by donating hundreds of personal manuscripts to the collection. The creation and expansion of universities prompted the gifting of private libraries to university libraries. One notable donation was by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester to Oxford University in the early 15th century. =Colonial North America= Private libraries were a characteristic of the first colonists to North America, rather than a peculiarity. For example, 27 libraries were known to have existed in Plymouth Colony alone between 1634 and 1683. Books and the idea of establishing libraries in the new world had always been a strong conviction for the early settlers. William Brewster was one of the many passengers on board the Mayflower on its maiden voyage to America who transported his library, which consisted of nearly 400 volumes. Even as early as 1607, these libraries were flourishing in English-settled Jamestown. The Virginia colony sovereign John Smith described a private library owned by the Reverend Good Master Hunt which was incinerated during a fire that destroyed much of the town. Another analogous finding from 1720 to 1770 in Maryland records that over half of the demographics population had at least the Bible in their libraries; in Virginia, there were close to a thousand private libraries, each with a typical assemblage of 20 books. Distinguished martial administrator Miles Standish owned 50 books, while the governor of Connecticut John Winthrop the Younger carried 1,000 books with him on his voyage to the recently established territories in 1631. George Washington’s proclivity towards reading and collecting books in general was also acclaimed. Washington’s personal library was originally housed in his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. The library consisted of 1,200 volumes, and a catalog of the titles included in his library was created before his death in 1799. During the mid-nineteenth century, nearly all of the former collection had been purchased by Massachusetts book and manuscript merchant Henry Stevens. Stevens subsequently decided to auction the collection to the British Museum in London; however, interested parties from both Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts procured the collection where they bequeathed it to its current residence, the Boston Athenæum. Washington’s library encompassed books in many disciplines such as economics, geography, history, and religion. Some of his most beloved volumes were those that pertained to agriculture, since he was an avid farmer. One work that he embraced dearly was a play entitled Cato, a Tragedy written in 1712 by the English playwright Joseph Addison because he felt a connection between the main character Cato and his constant battle with totalitarianism. In addition to the subject areas, the library accommodated diaries, travel, and over 100 federal correspondence letters. Like Washington, Thomas Jefferson was a prolific collector of books and a voracious reader. He actually owned three libraries over the course of his lifetime. The first was maintained from ages 14 to 26 (1757–1770) at his birthplace of Shadwell, Virginia, about five miles west of Monticello. It consisted of 40 that he inherited from his father. Since his father had been a surveyor, the library contained a plethora of maps and topographical monographs, though Jefferson added quite a few volumes to the library from his studies. By 1770, Jefferson had acquired over 300 volumes, worth an estimated 200 pounds. During the period of the American Revolution in the 1780s, Jefferson amassed a collection of books that numbered in the thousands. This collection became his library at his home in Monticello. Close to 2,000 books alone were purchased during the time he spent in France in the late 1780s. Because Jefferson was fluent in French and Latin, the library contained numerous books in these languages, as well as in fifteen others. The collection was abundant in books on law, philosophy, and history, but it accommodated volumes on many subject areas such as cooking, gardening, and more exotic avocations like beekeeping. Unlike some of his contemporaries, Jefferson traveled very little. As such, the library became his best travel guide. Even though the library went through multiple stages throughout his lifetime, in 1814 it was known that he had the single greatest private library in the United States. When the Library of Congress was consumed by fire, Jefferson persuaded the library to purchase his collection of between nine and ten thousand books in order to compensate for the lost collection. Congress accepted a portion of Jefferson's library (6,487 volumes) in 1815 for the cost of $23,950 (). The figure was obtained by calculating the number of books in addition to their dimensions, though Jefferson insisted that he would agree to any price. He remarked, \\"I do not know that it contains any branch of science which Congress would wish to exclude from this collection\\". December 1851 brought a second fire to the Library of Congress, which managed to extinguish over 60% of the collection acquired from Jefferson. Jefferson assembled a succeeding library of several thousand volumes. This second library was placed in an auction and purchased in 1829 in order to alleviate his indebtedness. Though Jefferson is recognized most for the breadth of his library, the most astounding characteristic of it is how it was cataloged. While most libraries during this period in American history classified their holdings alphabetically, he chose to catalog his collection by subject. His method of classification was based on a modified version of Lord Bacon's table of science, hierarchy of memory which included history, reason which included philosophy, and imagination which included the fine arts. Jefferson often disregarded his own classification scheme and shelved books according to their size. The most recognizable individuals in colonial North America were proprietors of substantial personal libraries. John Adams, for example, owned more than 3000 volumes, which were entrusted to the Boston Public Library in 1893. He was not only a bibliophile, but an amateur librarian; he maintained his collection fastidiously and even opened his library to the public. Legislator James Logan was a contemporary of Benjamin Franklin, with whom he developed a relationship over a passion for books. According to Logan, there was nothing more important than the acquisition of knowledge. His appetite for enlightenment led to the establishment of a private library of nearly 3000 titles, acknowledged as one of the largest in colonial America. In 1745, Logan converted his private library into a public library, which was the first structure in America to be recognized as a library for the public. Benjamin Franklin, who was instrumental in establishing the first subscription library in North America, was the owner of a private library of considerable proportions. This clandestine miscellanea is not well known, though a contemporary of Franklin, a certain Manasseh Cutler, observed this library firsthand. Cutler noted, \\"It is a very large chamber and high studded. The walls were covered with book shelves filled with books; besides there are four large alcoves, extending two-thirds of the length of the chamber, filled in the same manner. I presume this is the largest and by far the best, private library in America\\". There are no extant catalogs of what treasures were held in Franklin's library; however, his will contained a register which included some 4,726 titles. =Modern era= Theodor Heuss' private library in Stuttgart Private libraries in the hands of individuals have become more numerous with the introduction of paperback books. Some nonprofit organizations maintain special libraries, which are often made available to researchers by appointment. Nearly every law firm and some hospitals maintain either a law library or a medical library for staff use. Most of the English- speaking world categorizes these libraries as special libraries. Many large corporations maintain libraries that specialize in collections pertaining to research specific to the areas of concern to that organization. Scientific establishments are especially apt to have a library to support scientists and researchers. Manufacturing facilities are also likely to have an engineering library to help with troubleshooting and the assembly of complicated parts. These libraries are generally not open to the public. The librarians and other staff of special libraries often join the Special Libraries Association. Library (domestic room) The Bookworm, an 1850 painting, depicting a library by Carl Spitzweg The word library also refers to a room in a private house in which books are kept. Generally, it is a relatively large room that is open to all family members and household guests, in contrast to a study, which also often contains a collection of books but is usually a private space intended to be used by one person.

The reservation is one of the state’s \\"most popular facilities ... welcom[ing] hundreds of thousands of visitors per year.\\" It is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. Description The reservation occupies a peninsula that juts out from Westport's mainland with Rhode Island Sound to the southwest and Buzzards Bay to the southeast. The reservation features of barrier beach, marshland, and a protected estuary habitat. Most of the marshland is concentrated at the northern portion of the peninsula bordering Horseneck Channel and The Let. The barrier island known as Gooseberry Neck (or Gooseberry Island) is connected by a causeway to the main peninsula and is the southernmost extension of Horseneck Beach State Reservation. It partially divides Rhode Island Sound from Buzzards Bay. History The name of the beach is believed to derive from the Algonquin word hassanegk, meaning \\"a house made of stone.\\" Summer homes were built in the area after a bridge connected the beach to Westport Point in 1893. After all were destroyed by hurricanes in 1938 and 1954, the state acquired Horseneck Beach in 1956. Gooseberry Neck was added to the state's holdings in 1957. Activities and amenities The state reservation offers fishing, windsurfing, motorized and non-motorized boating with boat ramp, trails for biking and walking, showers, hunting, and bird watching. The beach is located along the southern portion of the peninsula, bordering Rhode Island Sound and Buzzards Bay. Restroom facilities, management office, food bar, designated on- duty lifeguard towers, and paved walkways are found alongside the beach. A 100-site campground is located behind the dunes at Gooseberry Neck, at the eastern end of the reservation. Accessibility The state reservation is accessible from the Bascule Bridge via Route 88, an offshoot of Interstate 195. Route 88 is the main (and direct) route of the two land routes to Horseneck. Route 88 ends on Horseneck, where John Reed Road, the main road serving the reservation, begins. John Reed Road ends at East Beach Road on the eastern portion of the peninsula. The other land route to Horseneck is East Beach Road via Horseneck Road, on the peninsula's connector, near the Westport/Dartmouth town boundary. The beach is accessible from the several large, designated parking lots via toll gates.

It is referred to as honest comment in some countries. United States In the United States, the traditional privilege of \\"fair comment\\" is seen as a protection for robust, even outrageous published or spoken opinions about public officials and public figures. Fair comment is defined as a \\"common law defense [that] guarantees the freedom of the press to express statements on matters of public interest, as long as the statements are not made with ill will, spite, or with the intent to harm the plaintiff\\". The defense of \\"fair comment\\" in the U.S. since 1964 has largely been replaced by the ruling in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). This case relied on the issue of actual malice, which involves the defendant making a statement known at the time to be false, or which was made with a \\"reckless disregard\\" of whether the statement was true or false. If \\"actual malice\\" cannot be shown, the defense of \\"fair comment\\" is then superseded by the broader protection of the failure by the plaintiff to show \\"actual malice\\". Each state writes its own laws of defamation, and the laws and previously decided precedents in each state vary. In many states, (including Alabama where the case of Times v. Sullivan originated), the \\"fair comment\\" defense requires that the \\"privilege of 'fair comment' for expressions of opinion depends on the truth of the facts upon which the comment is based\\" according to U.S Supreme Court Justice Brennan who wrote the ruling in Times v. Sullivan. It is still technically possible to rely on the common law defense of \\"fair comment\\" without referring to the \\"actual malice\\" standard set by the Supreme Court of the United States but that would only be a likely course of action when the defendant is absolutely sure that the facts upon which the opinion of the defendant was based were true, or that any falsehoods are not defamatory. If those facts are not absolutely true (and the actual malice standard is not taken into account) then the defendant could be sued by the plaintiff for damages, although the plaintiff would need to establish to the satisfaction of a jury that the statements were defamatory, and that the defendant published or made them. \\"Actual malice\\" removes the requirement of being faultless in the reporting of the facts by the defendant. (Under the law prior to this decision any false statement could, if found to be defamatory, be grounds for damages.) Instead it raises the question of whether factual errors were made in good faith. \\"Actual malice\\" means then that the defendant intentionally made false statements of alleged facts, or recklessly failed to verify alleged facts when any reasonable person would have checked. If it is held that the defendant made intentionally false statements of fact, that will form a powerful argument that any statements of opinion based upon those facts were made with malice. If the plaintiff can prove malice on the part of the defendant the common law defense of \\"fair comment\\" is defeated. The \\"actual malice\\" standard only applies when the statement is about a \\"public official\\", or a \\"public figure\\", or in some cases about a \\"matter of public interest\\". When it does apply it offers so much more protection to the defendant that it would be very rare for the defendant to assert \\"fair comment\\" instead. When the allegedly defamatory statement is about a purely private person, who is not a \\"public figure\\" in any way, the defendant may need to resort to the defense of \\"fair comment\\" instead. Also, the \\"actual malice\\" standard is specifically part of United States law, derived from the U.S. Constitution. The defense of \\"fair comment\\" is a part of the older common law, and so might apply in non-U.S. jurisdictions which share the common-law tradition, such as the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth. Canada In Canada, for something to constitute fair comment, the comment must be on a matter of public interest (excluding gossip), based on known and provable facts, must be an opinion that any person is capable of holding based on those facts, and with no actual malice underlying it. The cardinal test of whether a statement is fair comment is whether it is recognizable as an opinion rather than a statement of fact, and whether it could be drawn from the known facts. There was formerly a rule stating that the opinion must be honestly held by the publisher (See Chernesky v. Armadale Publications Ltd. [1978] 6 W.W.R. 618 (S.C.C.)) but this rule was changed to one requiring that the opinion is capable of being held by anyone. (See Rafe Mair v. Kari Simpson [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420) United Kingdom Fletcher-Moulton LJ said in Hunt v Star Newspaper [1908] 2 KB 309, Tab 3, at 319-320, CA: In Branson v Bower [2002] QB 737, at p 748, para 29, Eady J said: Whether the comment is fair, Diplock J (as Lord Diplock then was) said in a summing up to jury in Silkin v.

He wrote a History of the Reformed Churches and on Jewish Antiquities. Biography Jacques Basnage was born at Rouen in Normandy, the eldest son of the eminent lawyer Henri Basnage de Franquesnay. He studied classical languages at Saumur and afterwards theology at Geneva. He was pastor at Rouen from 1676 till 1685, when, on the revocation of the edict of Nantes, he obtained leave of the king to retire to Holland. He settled at Rotterdam as a minister pensionary till 1691, when he was chosen pastor of the Walloon church. In 1709 the grand pensionary Anthonie Heinsius (1641–1720) secured his election as one of the pastors of the Walloon church at The Hague, intending to employ him mainly in civil affairs. Accordingly, he was engaged in a secret negotiation with Marshal d'Uxelles, plenipotentiary of France at the congress of Utrecht. He was then entrusted with several further important commissions. In 1716 Dubois, who was at the Hague at the instance of the regent Orleans, for the purpose of negotiating the Triple Alliance between France, Great Britain and Holland, sought the advice of Basnage, who, in spite of the fact that he had failed to receive permission to return to France on a short visit the year before, did his best to further the negotiations. The French government also turned to him for help in view of the threatened rising in the Cevennes. Basnage had welcomed the revival of the Protestant church by the zeal of Antoine Court. He assured the regent that no danger of active resistance was to be feared from it. True to the principles of Calvin, he denounced the rebellion of the Camisards in his Instructions pastorales aux Réformés de France sur l'obéissance due aux souverains (1720), which was printed by order of the court and scattered broadcast in the south of France. Works His works include several dogmatic and polemical treatises, but the most important are the historical. Of these may be mentioned Histoire de la religion des églises reformées (Rotterdam, 1690), the Histoire de l'église depuis Jésus-Christ jusqu'à présent (ib. 1699)—both of them written from the point of view of Protestant polemics—and, of greater scientific value, the Histoire des Juifs (Rotterdam, 1706, Eng. trans. 1708) and the Antiquités judaiques ou remarques critiques sur la république des Hébreux (1713). He also wrote short explanatory introductions and notes to a collection of copper- plate engravings, much valued by connoisseurs, called Histoires du Vieux et du Nouveau Testament, représentées par des figures gravées en taille-douce par R. de Hooge (Amsterdam, 1704). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1697.

He typically stylises his name in lower-case as herman de vries on his artwork 'to avoid hierarchy'. De Vries works and lives with his wife Susanne in Eschenau near Knetzgau, Germany. De Vries began making art on the theme of \\"nature and plants\\" in 1953. He began painting in the late 1950s. One of his installations, from May 2002, is an explicit critique of Saint Boniface and his felling of the Donar Oak: he planted, on the bank of the Rhine in Düsseldorf, a 7-metre oak tree surrounded by a palisade of cast-iron, gold- tipped spears. Along the palisade is written, in Latin, wynfrith me caesit-- herman me recreavit (\\"Wynfrid cut me down, Herman resurrected me\\"). In 1993, as part of that year's World Horticultural Exposition in Stuttgart, de Vries created Sanctuarium, a small forest also enclosed by a circular palisade consisting of gold-tipped spears, in this case of wrought iron. His intention was for it to remain undisturbed, but the city parks department cleared the land in 2018 as part of a policy of periodic pruning. He and two other artists said they would take legal action against the city. A similar installation by de Vries in Münster is enclosed by a brick wall.

SCN manifests in infancy with life-threatening bacterial infections. Most cases of SCN respond to treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim), which increases the neutrophil count and decreases the severity and frequency of infections. Although this treatment has significantly improved survival, people with SCN are at risk of long-term complications such as hematopoietic clonal disorders (myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia). Kostmann disease (SCN3), the initial subtype recognized, was clinically described in 1956. This type has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, whereas the most common subtype, SCN1, shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Presentation Infants with SCN have frequent infections: 50% have a significant infection within 1 month, most others by 6 months. Their etiology is usually bacterial, especially staphylococcal, and they commonly involve abscesses, both cutaneous and of internal organs, pneumonia, mastoiditis (inflammation of the mastoid process), and sepsis. All of these are life-threatening for infants.  Genetics  { class=\\" floatright\\" center;font-size:90%;margin-left:1em\\" + E5AFAA;\\"Subtypes of SCN - style=text-align:center;font- size:90%;\\" !

Kostmann disease, SCN3, is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, but the commonest subtype of Kostmann syndrome, SCN1, is autosomal dominant. A significant proportion of SCN lacks a known mutation.Xia J, Bolyard AA, Rodger E et al.

PMID19775295 The recognized subtypes of Kostmann syndrome are: * SCN1 is the commonest form of SCN, which accounts for 60-80% of SCN, and the first to be genetically typified. This autosomal dominant form that arises from mutations of the ELANE (formerly ELA2) gene on chromosome 19p13.3, which encodes neutrophil elastase. Over a hundred ELANE mutations have been found in SCN1.Germeshausen, M., Deerberg, S., Peter, Y., et al.

PMID23463630] This same gene is mutated in cyclic neutropenia. * SCN2 is caused by heterozygous (autosomal dominant) mutation of the GFI1 gene on chromosome 1p22.Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, 2, Autosomal Dominant; SCN2. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. Johns Hopkins University. GFI1 is a repressor of several transcriptional processes, including ELANE, as well as miR-21 and miR-196b micro-RNAs which influence myelopoiesis. * SCN3 is the \\"classical\\", autosomal recessive form of Kostmann disease which arises from homozygous mutations in the HAX1 gene on chromosome 1p22.1. About one third of SCN3 individuals also have neurological changes including seizures, learning disabilities, or developmental delay. * SCN4 is caused by autosomal recessive mutation of the G6PC3 gene on 17q21.Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, 4, Autosomal Recessive; SCN4. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. Johns Hopkins University. SCN4 is associated with structural cardiac abnormalities, enlarged liver, intermittent thrombocytopenia and a prominent superficial venous pattern. A subset of SCN4 has severe primary pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure. * SCN5 arises from autosomal recessive Thr224Asn mutation in the VPS45 gene on chromosome 1q21.2.Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, 5, Autosomal Recessive; SCN5. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. Johns Hopkins University. Unlike classical Kostmann disease, SCN5 also has defective platelet aggregation (thrombasthenia) and myelofibrosis. This type is refractory to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. There is an absence of lysosomes in fibroblasts and depletion of alpha granules in platelets. Accelerated apoptosis occurs in the neutrophils and bone marrow. * X-linked SCN (SCNX) is caused by mutation in the WASP gene on Xp11.Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, X-linked; SCNX. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. Johns Hopkins University. SCN occasionally may arise from SBDS mutations. =Usage= Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is used as the overarching term for all diseases that affect myelopoiesis most prominently. Kostmann syndrome can restrictively refer to Kostmann disease specifically, or can be used synonymously with SCN as an umbrella term. These syndrome subtypes are phenotypically similar despite arising from different gene abnormalities. Kostmann disease is a form of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), specifically type 3 (SCN3), which is a rare autosomal recessive condition in which severe chronic neutropenia is detected soon after birth. The disorder was discovered in 1956 in an extended family in northern Sweden by Rolf Kostmann, a Swedish doctor. Although mutations of more than 15 genes cause severe congenital neutropenia (in a general sense)McDermott DH, De Ravin SS, Jun HS et al. Severe congenital neutropenia resulting from G6PC3 deficiency with increased neutrophil CXCR4 expression and myelokathexis. Blood. 2010;116(15):2793. PMID20616219 not all of these are usually considered as SCN. Clinical usage excludes two broad categories of congenital neutropenia. Diseases are excluded that overtly affect multiple systems rather than impacting myelopoiesis most prominently. Thus SCN excludes the severe neutropenia which can occur in congenital diseases such as Shwachman–Diamond syndrome, Barth syndrome, Chédiak–Higashi syndrome, WHIM syndrome, and glycogen storage disease type Ib. A further group of other miscellaneous inherited disorders, such as hyper IgM syndrome, Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome (HPS), Griscelli syndrome (GS), PN, P14 deficiency, Cohen syndrome, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) can show congenital neutropenia, but lack bone marrow findings typical of SCN. This group of diseases may also have additional features such as partial albinism, retinopathy, or neuropathy, and are not inclined to degenerate into acute myelogenous leukemia.  GATA2 deficiency  GATA2 deficiency is a grouping of several disorders caused by common defect, viz., familial or sporadic inactivating mutations in one of the two parental GATA2 genes. These autosomal dominant mutations cause a reduction, i.e. a haploinsufficiency, in the cellular levels of the gene's product, GATA2. The GATA2 protein is a transcription factor critical for the embryonic development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lympathic-forming, and other tissue-forming stem cells. In consequence of these mutations, cellular levels of GATA2 are deficient and individuals develop over time hematological, immunological, lymphatic, or other presentations that may begin as apparently benign abnormalities but commonly progress to a more serious disorder. A small but significant percentage of individuals with GATA2 deficiency's present with congenital neutropenia. This neutropenia is typically mild, often persists for years, and therefore is not a Kostmann syndrome disorder. Over time, however, the deficiency commonly progresses to include thrombocytopenia, increases susceptibility to infections due to, e.g. atypical mycobacteria or human papillomavirus, dysfunction of non-hematological organs, the myelodysplastic syndrome, and/or a leukemia, particularly acute myelogenous leukemia. Pathophysiology The various mutations may be responsible for the untimely initiation of apoptosis in myelocytes, producing their premature destruction. There may be, in addition, other underlying molecular/genetic changes producing DNA mutations and genome instability, which contribute to initiation and progression of this disease. Diagnosis An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) chronically less than 500/mm3, usually less than 200/mm3, is the main sign of Kostmann's. Other elements include the severity of neutropenia, the chronology (from birth; not emerging later), and other normal findings (hemoglobin, platelets, general body health). Isolated neutropenia in infants can occur in viral infections, autoimmune neutropenia of infancy, bone marrow suppression from a drug or toxin, hypersplenism, and passive placental transfer of maternal IgG. A bone marrow test can assist in diagnosis. The bone marrow usually shows early granulocyte precursors, but myelopoietic development stops (\\"arrests\\") at the promyelocyte and/or myelocyte stage, so that few maturing forms are seen. Neutrophil survival is normal. Treatment Regular administration of exogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim) clinically improves neutrophil counts and immune function and is the mainstay of therapy, although this may increase risk for myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia in the long term. Over 90% of SCN responds to treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim), which has significantly improved survival.

He killed his parents, brother and sister with an axe in February 1988 near Rochester, Minnesota after he got into an argument with his father over the music he was listening to. Crimes In the early evening of February 18, 1988, Olmsted County sheriff's deputies discovered the bodies of Bernard (43), Paulette (42), Diane (13), and Richard (11) Brom in the Brom family home. Missing from the home were the two oldest sons, David (16) and Joe (18). The police had been notified by the administration of David's school that students had reported hearing a \\"rumor\\" that David had informed another student that he had killed his family that morning. All four individuals had sustained numerous gashes in the head and upper body. Police subsequently found a blood-stained axe in the basement that forensic tests indicated was used to kill all four victims. Immediately after the discovery, the police were concerned that David might be the victim of an abduction, but a friend of David's informed the police that David himself told her that he killed his family, and testified to the discussion in the subsequent trial. She told jurors at the trial that Brom stopped her on the morning of February 18, 1988, as she was going to school, and convinced her to skip school with him. He then detailed how he killed his parents, brother and sister. \\"He said he hit his dad with an axe, he kept hitting his dad and his dad kept on getting up.\\" The girl said Brom told her he had gotten into an argument with his father at about 11:30 p.m. the previous night, and that he then stayed up until about 3 a.m. She indicated that Brom detailed the crime, saying that he went to his parents' room, first killing his father. Then he hit his mother and went to his brother's room. Then he saw his sister standing over their mother in the upstairs hallway, at which point he attacked them both. Brom was captured on February 19, 1988 while using a pay phone near the local post office. His case was initially referred to the juvenile court system because his age at the time of the crimes was 16, but was eventually sent to the adult judicial system based on the severity of the crime. As Brom's defense claim was insanity, mental illness was a factor in the trial, and much media and legal focus was placed on Minnesota's use of the M'Naghten Rules in determining if Brom was legally insane at the time of the crime. On October 16, 1989, Brom was convicted of first-degree murder and was given three consecutive life sentences. He is currently housed at the Minnesota Correctional Facility in Stillwater. In media *In 1988, Negativland released a fake press release suggesting that their song \\"Christianity Is Stupid\\" was implicated in Brom's murders. *American death metal band Macabre released a song titled \\"David Brom Took an Axe\\" on their 1989 album Gloom based on the David Brom murders.

Release history In November 2005, the next version, 1.2, was released. Version 1.2 was very similar to version 1.1, but included two new features: Tab Explorer and RSS Widgets from Favorites. When the Tab Explorer button is pressed, a thumbnail preview of each tab is displayed in a full-screen window. The user can click on one of the previews to instantly access the page. Microsoft has implemented a similar feature in their Internet Explorer 7 browser, called \\"Quick Tabs\\". Version 1.5 was launched in May 2006, and included many new features such as Desktop Widgets, Visual Themes, a Feeds Screensaver and various performance improvements. Desktop Widgets allow the user to \\"tear off\\" a side panel and use it independently from the browser. The panel will remain open and functional, even after one closes AOL Explorer. When ones computer is idle, one can set the AOL Explorer Feeds Screensaver to display the RSS feeds stored in the feeds panel. Another feature new to 1.5 is the Show Page Preview feature, which allows the user to preview a webpage without leaving the current page by simply holding down Ctrl and right- clicking on a link. This feature is especially useful when there are a large number of links on a page, or when searching. In 2003, AOL signed a seven-year contract with Microsoft to use the Trident layout engine in their products and as such AOL Explorer uses this engine. Because of this, users can use AOL Explorer to download and install updates from Microsoft Update. However, unlike Internet Explorer, AOL does not use Bing as the default search engine.

It was discovered by American astronomers Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo at Las Campanas Observatory on 16 October 2004. It measures approximately 100 kilometers in diameter and was the second such body to be discovered after .  Orbit and classification  Neptune trojans are resonant trans-Neptunian objects in a 1:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Neptune. These Trojans have a semi-major axis and an orbital period very similar to Neptune's (30.10 AU; 164.8 years). Otrera belongs to the group, which leads 60° ahead Neptune's orbit. It orbits the Sun with a semi-major axis of 30.027 AU at a distance of 29.3–30.7 AU once every 164 years and 6 months (60,099 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.02 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic.  Physical characteristics  The discoverers estimate that the body has a mean-diameter of 100 kilometers based on a magnitude of 23.3. Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, it measures approximately 74 kilometers in diameter using an absolute magnitude of 8.8 and an assumed albedo of 0.10.  Naming  This minor planet was the first Neptune trojan to be named in November 2015. It was named after Otrera, the first Amazonian queen in Greek mythology. The naming scheme is to name these objects after figures related to the Amazons, which was an all-female warrior tribe that fought in the Trojan War on the side of the Trojans against the Greeks.

The lack of this enzyme results in an abnormal accumulation of complex carbohydrates known as mucopolysaccharides, and of fatty substances known as mucolipids. Both of these substances accumulate in bodily tissues. Presentation Symptoms of ML I are either present at birth or develop within the first year of life. In many infants with ML I, excessive swelling throughout the body is noted at birth. These infants are often born with coarse facial features, such as a flat nasal bridge, puffy eyelids, enlargement of the gums, and excessive tongue size (macroglossia). Many infants with ML I are also born with skeletal malformations such as hip dislocation. Infants often develop sudden involuntary muscle contractions (called myoclonus) and have red spots in their eyes (cherry red spots). They are often unable to coordinate voluntary movement (called ataxia). Tremors, impaired vision, and seizures also occur in children with ML I. Tests reveal abnormal enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and spleen (splenomegaly) and extreme abdominal swelling. Infants with ML I generally lack muscle tone (hypotonia) and have mental retardation that is either initially or progressively severe. Many patients suffer from failure to thrive and from recurrent respiratory infections. Most infants with ML I die before the age of 1 year. =Related conditions= Other diseases that result from a deficiency in the sialidase enzyme are categorized in a broader group known as sialidoses. Because ML I is classified as a sialidosis, it is sometimes referred to as sialidosis type II. A rarer form of sialidosis – sialidosis type 1– occurs in children and adolescents and is often referred to as the juvenile form of the disorder. Children usually begin to show symptoms during the second decade of life, and myoclonus and cherry-red macules are often the initial symptoms. Patients usually develop seizures and progressive deterioration of coordinated muscular and mental activities. Pathophysiology The role of sialidase is to remove a particular form of sialic acid (a sugar molecule) from sugar-protein complexes (referred to as glycoproteins), which allows the cell to function properly. Because the enzyme is deficient, small chains containing the sugar-like material accumulate in neurons, bone marrow, and various cells that defend the body against infection.

Vriesde holds the South American records for the 800 metres, 1000 metres and 1500 metres (indoors and outdoors) and also for the 3000 metres (indoors). Career Vriesde started running in Suriname, coached by Luiz de Oliveira. She left Suriname after failing to be selected for the 1984 Olympics to train in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, Vriesde competed for Atletiekvereniging Rotterdam. She competed in the 800 metres at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and broke into the highest echelons of the sport in 1991, when she reached the finals of both the 800 and 1500 metres at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Tokyo, finishing in fifth and ninth places respectively. At the 1992 Summer Olympics Vriesde set a record of sorts by recording the fastest ever non-qualifying time (1:58.28) in an 800 metres semi-final. Vriesde won a bronze medal in the 800 metres at the 1995 IAAF World Indoor Championships, before going on to win a silver medal at the 1995 World Championships in Athletics behind Cuba's Ana Quirot. At both competitions, she became the first South American female athlete to win a medal. A year later, she missed the finals at the 1996 Summer Olympics, running a nearly identical time to her 1992 Olympic performance (1:58.29), again placing fifth in her semifinal. Vriesde won a bronze medal in the 800 metres at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics behind Mozambique's Maria Mutola and Austria's Stephanie Graf. Throughout her career, Vriesde also won many medals at the Pan American Games, Central American and Caribbean Games and South American Games. Vriesde was disqualified and stripped of her gold medal at the 2003 Pan American Games after testing positive for excessive caffeine levels. She was said to have the equivalent of five gallons of coffee in her system, and admitted her guilt. She was not banned however and went on to compete at that year's World Championships. Drinking too much coffee or taking a common cold tablet would no longer get athletes disqualified after a new global list of banned substances was drawn up by the World Anti-Doping Agency and applied from 1 January 2004. Vriesde retired soon after competing at her seventh World Championships in 2005. In Paramaribo a street formerly known as Cultuurtuinlaan was changed into Letitia Vriesdelaan. The Surinamese Government also gave her a piece of land in appreciation of her achievements. Personal life Vriesde married Bas van Veen on 9 September 2005 in Middelburg, Holland. Her daughter Joi Vienna was born on 19 March 2007.

Grave. Otto Erich Hartleben (3 June 1864 - in Clausthal; 11 February 1905 in Salò) was a German poet and dramatist from Clausthal, known for his translation of Pierrot Lunaire. Childhood, Education and Marriage Orphaned as a child, Hartleben was brought up by his grandfather in Hanover. Among his youthful acquaintances there were Karl Henckel, Arthur Gutheil and the future industrialist and politician Alfred Hugenberg and together they published a volume of poetry Quartett in 1886. After completing his schooling in Celle in 1886 he went to study law, first in Leipzig, where he got to know Hermann Conradi and Adolf Bartels, and later in Berlin. He studied for the civil service in Stolberg (Harz) and in Magdeburg. Giving up his legal studies, he returned to Berlin where he lived as a freelance writer, eventually moving to Munich in 1901. After the death of his grandfather in 1893, Hartleben inherited 80,000 marks and on 2 December married his lifelong companion, ex-waitress “little mop” Selma Hesse. Career In 1900 he had a resounding success with his “officer’s tragedy” Rosenmontag (Carnival Monday) which deals with an ill-fated affair between a simple girl and a young officer from an old military family. He used the proceeds to purchase the Villa Halkyone in Salò on Lake Garda. Here he founded in 1903 the Halkyone Academy for the Pure Sciences, which included among its members Peter Behrens, Otto Julius Bierbaum, Franz Blei, Gerhart Hauptmann, Alfred Kubin, Emil Orlik and Ferdinand Pfohl, and which boasted just two rules: \\"§ 1. Membership of the Halkyone Academy confers neither duties nor rights. § 2. Everything else is governed by the spirit of the Halkyone community.\\" Letters Hartleben's legendary reputation in turn-of-century letters is due chiefly to the many artistic groups he founded or contributed to, from the Bavarian Bohemian Beer Brotherhood at school in Celle (1885) to the Menschenclub (a club for “humans”) in Magdeburg (1890), the Karlsbad Idealists’ Club (1891), the Verbrechertisch (“Rogues’ Table”) in Berlin (1896), the Berlin Naturalists’ Society known as Durch (“Through”), the Berlin drama movement Freie Bühne (“Free Stage”), the Berlin Free Literary Society, the Leipzig \\"Auguren College\\", not to mention the lively interest he took in the Friedrichshagener Dichterkreis (Friedrichshagen Poets Circle). Journalist He also co- produced the weekly journal Die Jugend (“Youth”), in which he made humorous jibes at contemporary society and its morals. One of his key characters was Serenissimus, the gone-to-seed ruler of an imaginary peppercorn principality. Translator He is especially noted today for his translations of other writers’ poetic works, often improving the poetry of the original, in particular of Albert Giraud’s Pierrot Lunaire which forms the Sprechstimme text of Arnold Schoenberg’s work of that name.

The kingdom he ruled was restricted to the northeast of the old Hispanic kingdom on account of the Arabo-Berber invasions. Achila's reign is known solely from coins and regnal lists and is not mentioned by reliable narrative histories. Gold coins of Achila's have been found bearing the inscriptions of the mints of Girona, Zaragoza, Tarragona, and Narbonne.Collins, Visigothic, 131. According to Thompson, The Goths, 251, two types of coin have been found from the Narbonnese mint. Because the narrative sources, the numismatics, and the regnal lists all confirm the reign of Roderic during the same years as Achila, it is almost doubtless that the two were kings in opposition to each other following Roderic's coup, which may have resulted either in or from the death of the previous king, Wittiza.Collins, Visigothic, 138–39. Thompson, The Goths, 251, believed that Achila succeeded Roderic after his defeat and death, when only the northeast of the kingdom remained under Visigothic control. There are more coins surviving from Achila's kingdom than Roderic's, but the findings do not overlap in territory and it is suspected that the kingdom had been divided between two factions, with the southwest (the provinces of Lusitania and western Carthaginiensis around the capital Toledo) following (or being subjected to) Roderic and the northeast (Tarraconensis and Narbonensis) falling under the rule of Achila.Collins, Visigothic, 131. It is unknown to whom the provinces of Gallaecia and Baetica fell. Roderic and Achila never appear to have come into military conflict; this is probably best explained by the preoccupation of Roderic with Arab raids and not to a formal division of the kingdom.Collins, Visigothic, 139. Two continuations of the Chronicon Regum Visigothorum record Achila's reign of three years following immediately upon Wittiza's.Collins, Visigothic, 132. It has even been suggested by some scholars that Achila was in fact Wittiza's son and successor and that Roderic had tried to usurp the throne from him, even that he had been a co-ruler with Wittiza since 708.Bachrach, 31–32. Any son of Wittiza would have been a child in 711.Collins, Visigothic, 137. Achila's reign probably began shortly after Roderic's and lasted until 713 or 714. During Achila's brief reign, Arab raids began to plague the south of Hispania, where Roderic ruled. Roderic tried to defeat them but was killed in the attempt. Some supporters of Achila may have deserted Roderic on his final campaign.Bachrach, \\"A Reassessment\\", 32. Because of the oppressive policy of his predecessors towards the Jews and the large Jewish population of Narbonensis and because of what he stood to gain should Roderic be removed, military historian Bernard Bachrach has written that \\"[t]here is a temptation to conclude that the Muslims, King Achila, and the Jews all joined together, at least temporarily, to overthrow Roderic.\\"Bachrach, \\"A Reassessment\\", 33. It is possible that an ecclesiastic named Oppa was declared king at Toledo by rivals of both Roderic and Achila, either before Roderic's defeat and death at the Battle of the Guadalete or between his death and the Arab capture of Toledo.Collins, Visigothic, 139. Whatever the case, almost all of Hispania save Gallaecia, the Asturias, the country of the Basques, and the valley of the Ebro had fallen to the Arabs within a couple years of Roderic's death. In 713 the Arabs and their Berber allies began the conquest of the Ebro valley, taking Zaragoza. These events coincide with the end of Achila's three-year reign and may have accounted for his death in battle with the invaders.Collins, Visigothic, 140. The nature of the discovery of a smattering of coins at El Bovalar near Lleida shows that El Bovalar probably fell and was razed by the invaders in 714.Collins, Visigothic, 212. Achila was succeeded by Ardo, who only reigned in Narbonensis north of the Pyrenees and probably died in the Arab invasion of that region in 721.

The documentary mirrors Moore's landmark 1989 documentary, Roger & Me, in tone and interview style. The film is frequently presented at conservative film festivals. Overview In Michael & Me, Elder interviews people who have used guns to prevent becoming a victim of crime to provide evidence that an armed society is a safer society. For example, Elder interviews a woman identified as \\"Jane Doe,\\" a real estate agent who was raped by a client. Elder states that the victim \\"would have been able to protect herself\\" were she armed. Production notes In an August 2005 interview on Hannity & Colmes, Elder stated that he took out a home equity loan to finance the documentary's estimated $350,000 budget.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1892 to 1896 and from 1902 to 1915, and was a senior cabinet minister in the government of Rodmond Roblin. Armstrong was a member of the Conservative Party.  Early life  Armstrong was born in New York City, New York, in 1858, and moved to Ontario with his parents one year later. He moved to Manitoba in 1883, and settled in Portage la Prairie in 1896. He worked as a fish exporter, and was a prominent figure in Manitoba's early fish industry.  Political career  He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1892, winning without opposition in the Woodlands constituency. The Manitoba Liberal Party won a majority government in this election, and Armstrong sat with the small opposition group. He resigned from the legislature in 1896 to run for the House of Commons of Canada as a candidate of the federal Conservative Party. He lost the riding of Selkirk to Liberal Party candidate John Alexander MacDonell by a single vote. The Manitoba Conservative Party formed government in 1900, initially under Hugh John Macdonald and subsequently under Rodmond Roblin. Armstrong returned to the legislature in 1902, and the sitting member for Portage la Prairie died. He was again returned without opposition, and sat as a government backbencher. Armstrong was re-elected in the 1903 election, defeating Liberal candidate Edward Brown by thirty-three votes. Brown became leader of the provincial Liberal Party in 1907, and again challenged Armstrong in that year's general election. Armstrong was again victorious, defeating Brown by 223 votes. Armstrong entered Roblin's cabinet on November 19, 1908, in the senior portfolio of Provincial Treasurer. He served in this capacity for the remainder of his career in politics. In the 1910 election, he defeated Liberal challenger Ewan McPherson by 201 votes. MacPherson challenged Armstrong again in the 1914 provincial election, and this time defeated him by ten votes. The Conservatives again won a majority government, and Armstrong returned to the legislature after winning a deferred election in the northern constituency of Grand Rapids. In 1915, the Roblin ministry was forced to resign from office after a report commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. Armstrong resigned from office on May 12, 1915, and did not seek re-election in the 1915 campaign.

The play is based on a true story (Dorak affair) and focuses on the Anglo-Dutch archaeologist James Mellaart. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was accused of, in turn, stealing an invaluable collection of Neolithic artefacts found near Dorak in Turkey and, ultimately, of fabricating their entire existence. The play deals with attempts by the Turkish press both to recover the treasure and to expose Mellaart and the western archaeology 'industry' as corrupt.

It is the part of Taxila Tehsil of Rawalpindi District. It is the 22nd largest city of Pakistan by population. It has the highest literacy rate in all of Asia, effectively 100%. It is located to the north west of Islamabad-Rawalpindi.  History  Wah Cantt is adjacent to Taxila, a small town enriched with one of the most important archaeological sites of the world. The name 'Wah' has its roots in the Mughal era with the Mughal emperor Jehangir reported to have coined the name when he was camped at Wah village, originally called 'Jalal Sar', en route to Lahore from a visit to Kashmir. Emperor Jehangir was impressed by the scenery and beauty of the place, so he said \\"Wah\\" ('wow'). Later people started calling the area 'Wah'. The Mughal advent had a strong influence on the architecture of the village and surrounding area which is still visible to date. Wah Gardens has Mughal architecture. Wah Cantt has developed a lot recently. Among developments, different kinds of shopping malls and various housing societies have been established. The population of Wah Cantt is increasing day by day due to quality of education and healthy environment. There are different areas for dining. Some of the most popular places in Wah Cantt are Ordinance club and POF hotel.  Military  Wah Cantt is a military cantonment. It is completely locked down for traffic except through the barriers controlled by Military Guards. All the cars entering have to possess a pass or they can not enter. A temporary pass can be picked up at the entrance to city by surrendering their ID card which they can pick up when they are leaving the city.  Education  Wah has the highest literacy rate in all of Asia, effectively 100%. This small city has two chartered universities, one medical college, one engineering college and many schools and colleges. Students from Wah Cantt can be found studying at many of the top institutes of Pakistan and abroad. Wah Cantt also has the largest number of bicycles in any city in Pakistan. This links the city with its past as, historically, the neighboring town of Taxila had been a seat of learning for thousands of years. Apart from numerous private and government schools and colleges, foundations of professional universities have been laid down in the past five years, including the Wah Medical College. COMSATS University Islamabad (Wah Campus), University of Wah & Wah Engineering College are some renowned educational institutes of the city. Some technical colleges (like POFIT, Swedish etc.) are also located in Wah cantt.

Kay has won a number of awards, including the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1998 and the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust Book of the Year Award in 2011. Since 2016, she has held the position of Scots Makar, the national poet laureate of Scotland. She was appointed as chancellor of the University of Salford in 2015. Biography Jackie Kay was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1961, to a Scottish mother and a Nigerian father. She was adopted as a baby by a white Scottish couple, Helen and John Kay, and grew up in Bishopbriggs, a suburb of Glasgow. They adopted Jackie in 1961, having already adopted her brother, Maxwell, about two years earlier. Jackie and Maxwell also have siblings who were brought up by their biological parents. Her adoptive father worked for the Communist Party full-time and stood for Member of Parliament,Jackie Kay, \\"My old man: a voyage around our fathers\\", The Observer, 15 June 2008. and her adoptive mother was the Scottish secretary of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. As a child Kay suffered racism from children and teachers at school. As a teenager she worked as a cleaner, working for David Cornwell—who wrote under the pen-name John le Carré—for four months. She recommended cleaning work to aspiring writers, saying: \\"It’s great ... You’re listening to everything. You can be a spy, but nobody thinks you're taking anything in.\\" Cornwell and Kay met again in 2019; he remembered her, and had been following her. In August 2007, Jackie Kay was the subject of the fourth episode of the BBC Radio 4 series The House I Grew Up In, in which she talked about her childhood. John Kay died in 2019 at the age of 93. Initially harbouring ambitions to be an actor, she decided to concentrate on writing after Alasdair Gray, a Scottish artist and writer, read her poetry and told her that writing was what she should be doing. She studied English at the University of Stirling and her first book of poetry, the partially autobiographical The Adoption Papers, was published in 1991 and won the Saltire Society Scottish First Book Award. It is a multiply voiced collection of poetry that deals with identity, race, nationality, gender, and sexuality from the perspectives of three women: an adopted biracial child, her adoptive mother, and her biological mother. Her other awards include the 1994 Somerset Maugham Award for Other Lovers, and the Guardian Fiction Prize for Trumpet, inspired by the life of American jazz musician Billy Tipton, born Dorothy Tipton, who lived as a man for the last fifty years of his life. Kay writes extensively for stage (in 1988 her play Twice Over was the first by a Black writer to be produced by Gay Sweatshop Theatre Group),\\"Gay Sweatshop Theatre Company\\", Unfinished Histories – Recording the History of Alternative Theatre. screen and for children. Her drama The Lamplighter is an exploration of the Atlantic slave trade. It was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in March 2007 and published in poem form in 2008.Bloodaxe Books, 2008; In 2010 she published Red Dust Road, an account of her search for her biological parents, who had met each other when her father was a student at Aberdeen University and her mother was a nurse. The book was adapted for the stage by Tanika Gupta and premiered in August 2019 at the Edinburgh International Festival in a production by National Theatre of Scotland and HOME, at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh. Kay was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2006 Birthday Honours. She is currently Professor of Creative Writing at Newcastle University, and Cultural Fellow at Glasgow Caledonian University. Kay lives in Manchester.

Hominini includes the extant genera Homo (humans) and Pan (Chimpanzees and Bonobos), but excludes the genus Gorilla (gorillas). The term was originally introduced by John Edward Gray (1824), long before any details on the speciation of Pan and Homo were known. Gray's tribe Hominini by definition includes both Pan and Homo. This definition is still adhered to in the proposal by Mann and Weiss (1996), which divides Hominini into three subtribes, Panina (containing Pan), Hominina (\\"homininans\\", containing Homo \\"humans\\"), and Australopithecina (containing several extinct \\"australopithecine\\" genera). Alternatively, Hominini is taken to exclude Pan. In this case, Panini (\\"panins\\", Delson 1977)Delson, Journal of Human Evolution 6 (1977), p. 450. may refer to the tribe containing Pan as its only genus.Potts (2010). “What Does It Mean to Be Human?”, pp. 34. . National Geographic Society, Washington.\\"Conventionally, taxonomists now refer to the great ape family (including humans) as 'hominids', while all members of the lineage leading to modern humans that arose after the split with the [Homo- Pan] LCA are referred to as 'hominins'. The older literature used the terms hominoids and hominids respectively.\\" Minority dissenting nomenclatures include Gorilla in Hominini and Pan in Homo (Goodman et al. 1998), or both Pan and Gorilla in Homo (Watson et al. 2001). Terminology and definition By convention, the adjectival term \\"hominin\\" (or nominalized \\"hominins\\") refers to the tribe Hominini, while the members of the subtribe Hominina (and thus all archaic human species) are referred to as \\"homininan\\" (\\"homininans\\"). This follows the proposal by Mann and Weiss (1996), which presents tribe Hominini as including both Pan and Homo, placed in separate subtribes. The genus Pan is referred to subtribe Panina, and genus Homo is included in the subtribe Hominina (see above). However, there is an alternative convention which uses \\"hominin\\" to exclude members of Panina, i.e. either just for Homo or for both human and australopithecine species. This alternative convention is referenced in e.g. Coyne (2009)Coyne, Jerry A. (2009) Why Evolution Is True, pp.197-208, 244, 248. (hc), (pbk). Penguin Books Ltd, London. \\"Anthropologists apply the term hominin to all the species on the \\"human\\" side of our family tree after it split from the branch that became modern chimps.\\" (p.197) and in Dunbar (2014). Potts (2010) in addition uses the name Hominini in a different sense, as excluding Pan, and uses \\"hominins\\" for this, while a separate tribe (rather than subtribe) for chimpanzees is introduced, under the name Panini. In this recent convention, contra Gray, the term \\"hominin\\" is applied to Homo, Australopithecus, Ardipithecus, and others that arose after the split from the line that led to chimpanzees (see cladogram below); that is, they distinguish fossil members on the human side of the split, as \\"hominins\\", from those on the chimpanzee side, as \\"not hominins\\" (or \\"non-hominin hominids\\"). Cladogram This cladogram shows the clade of superfamily Hominoidea and its descendent clades, focussed on the division of Hominini (omitting detail on clades not ancestral to Hominini). The family Hominidae (\\"hominids\\") comprises the tribes Ponginae (including orangutans), Gorillini (including gorillas) and Hominini, the latter two forming the subfamily of Homininae. Hominini is divided into Panina (chimpanzees) and Australopithecina (australopithecines). The Hominina (humans) are usually held to have emerged within the Australopithecina (which would roughly correspond to the alternative definition of Hominini according to the alternative definition which excludes Pan). Genetic analysis combined with fossil evidence indicates that hominoids diverged from the Old World monkeys about 25 million years ago (Mya), near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. The most recent common ancestors (MRCA) of the subfamilies Homininae and Ponginae lived about 15 million years ago.The most well-known fossil genus of Ponginae is Sivapithecus, consisting of several species from 12.5 million to 8.5 million years ago. It differs from orangutans in dentition and postcranial morphology. > In the following cladogram, the approximate time the clades radiated newer clades is indicated in millions of years ago (Mya). Evolutionary history Model of the phylogeny of Hominini over the past 10 million years. Both Sahelanthropus and Orrorin existed during the estimated duration of the ancestral chimpanzee-human speciation events, within the range of eight to four million years ago (Mya). Very few fossil specimens have been found that can be considered directly ancestral to genus Pan. News of the first fossil chimpanzee, found in Kenya, was published in 2005. However, it is dated to very recent times—between 545 and 284 thousand years ago. The divergence of a \\"proto-human\\" or \\"pre-human\\" lineage separate from Pan appears to have been a process of complex speciation-hybridization rather than a clean split, taking place over the period of anywhere between 13 Mya (close to the age of the tribe Hominini itself) and some 4 Mya. Different chromosomes appear to have split at different times, with broad-scale hybridization activity occurring between the two emerging lineages as late as the period 6.3 to 5.4 Mya, according to Patterson et al. (2006), This research group noted that one hypothetical late hybridization period was based in particular on the similarity of X chromosomes in the proto-humans and stem chimpanzees, suggesting that the final divergence was even as recent as 4 Mya. Wakeley (2008) rejected these hypotheses; he suggested alternative explanations, including selection pressure on the X chromosome in the ancestral populations prior to the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor (CHLCA). \\"Patterson et al. suggest that the apparently short divergence time between humans and chimpanzees on the X chromosome is explained by a massive interspecific hybridization event in the ancestry of these two species. However, Patterson et al. do not statistically test their own null model of simple speciation before concluding that speciation was complex, and—even if the null model could be rejected—they do not consider other explanations of a short divergence time on the X chromosome. These include natural selection on the X chromosome in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, changes in the ratio of male-to-female mutation rates over time, and less extreme versions of divergence with gene flow. I therefore believe that their claim of hybridization is unwarranted.\\" Most DNA studies find that humans and Pan are 99% identical,Mary-Claire King (1973) Protein polymorphisms in chimpanzee and human evolution, Doctoral dissertation, University of California, Berkeley. but one study found only 94% commonality, with some of the difference occurring in noncoding DNA. It is most likely that the australopithecines, dating from 4.4 to 3 Mya, evolved into the earliest members of genus Homo.Coyne, Jerry A. (2009) Why Evolution Is True, pp.202-204. (hc), (pbk). Penguin Books Ltd, London. \\"After A. afarensis, the fossil record shows a confusing melange of gracile australopithecine species lasting up to about two million years ago. … [T]he late australopithecines, already bipedal, were beginning to show changes in teeth, skull, and brain that presage modern humans. It is very likely that the lineage that gave rise to modern humans included at least one of these species.\\" In the year 2000, the discovery of Orrorin tugenensis, dated as early as 6.2 Mya, briefly challenged critical elements of that hypothesis,Potts, Richard and Sloan, Christopher. “What Does It Mean to Be Human?”, pp. 38-39. . National Geographic Society, Washington. as it suggested that Homo did not in fact derive from australopithecine ancestors.:\\"The discovery of Orrorin has ... radically modified interpretations of human origins and the environmental context in which the African apes/hominoid transition occurred, although ... the less likely hypothesis of derivation of Homo from the australopithecines still holds primacy in the minds of most palaeoanthropologists.\\" All the listed fossil genera are evaluated for: # probability of being ancestral to Homo, and # whether they are more closely related to Homo than to any other living primate—two traits that could identify them as hominins. Some, including Paranthropus, Ardipithecus, and Australopithecus, are broadly thought to be ancestral and closely related to Homo;Potts, Richard and Sloan, Christopher. “What Does It Mean to Be Human?”, pp. 31-42. . National Geographic Society, Washington. others, especially earlier genera, including Sahelanthropus (and perhaps Orrorin), are supported by one community of scientists but doubted by another.

During the 1860s and early 1870s it was the terminus of the Canada Central Railway (subsequently acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway). At one point Sand Point boasted a hotel, a dance hall, a general store, and a post office.  Sand Point Ferry Norvic  For decades Sand Point was the Ontario terminus of the Sand Point, Ontario-Norway Bay, Quebec ferry which provided access to the CPR and Anrprior. From 1923 to 1963 the eight car ferry, Norvic, landed at the Norway Bay Wharf. The Norvic was originally owned by Colonel Courtney, and her father-in-law James Young, both of Ottawa, with Dudley Gamble as manager. The ferry was sold in 1963 to Mr. Charles Bond of the Bond Marina at Manotick, Ontario. Mr. Gamble who owned the ferry paid the wharfage fees charged each year by the federal government. Gamble died in 1966. The ferry has been revived as a tour boat in the 1000 Islands system. The boat was the successor to the old Norway Belle destroyed by ice when it was pushed off the Norway Bay wharf in 1919. The \\"Norvic\\" derived its name from its home harbor, Norway Bay, and its builders, Vicker's Marine of Montreal. Seventy two feet long with a beam of twenty two feet, solid steel hull with diesel engine, built in 1922.Some of the captains who sailed the Norvic were Captains Charier and Fleming, Dudley Gamble,the Bailey brothers, Jack, George and Lincoln and Jim McKnight. For those who are familiar with the Norvic, the vessel had a very distinctive and unique bow and stern shape. In approximately the year 2003, the easily recognizable hull of the boat was sited as the base of a refurbished yacht tied up at a marina on the Ottawa River near Rideau Falls. The boat was refurbished by Ottawa developer Bill Teron and relaunched in 1989.

The company was founded by Dick Portillo on April 9, 1963 in Villa Park, Illinois under the name \\"The Dog House\\". Outside of Chicagoland and Northern Illinois, the chain also encompasses three locations each in central Illinois, the Indianapolis metropolitan area, the Phoenix metropolitan area and the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area; two locations each in the Milwaukee metropolitan area, Southern California, and the Tampa metropolitan area; and one location each in the Madison, Wisconsin metropolitan area, South Bend metropolitan area, Fort Wayne, and the Quad Cities. History Portillo's was founded in 1963 by Dick Portillo. After returning from serving in the Marines, Portillo gathered money from his savings and from an investment from his brother Frank to open a hotdog stand. They bought a 12-foot trailer that had no restroom and no running water. They named it \\"The Dog House\\". The Dog House operated on North Avenue in Villa Park. At the beginning stages, the stand was losing money and Portillo needed to find a solution. Portillo went to do some research one day on how other competitors were operating and snuck into one of the back rooms of a competitor and wrote down where they were purchasing their product. He continued the process of learning by visiting different competitors. By 1967, The Dog House was in good standing, was upgraded to a larger trailer, and was renamed \\"Portillo's\\". In 1970, he partnered with Harold Reskin and opened up his second location in a shopping mall that Reskin owned. Between 1972 and 1989, he opened up a second restaurant under the name \\"Barney's\\" that specialized in BBQ meals. In 1983 Portillo's opened up its first drive thru in Downers Grove. In the 90's Portillo's had profited by more than $50 million with 25 stores around the Chicago area. In 1993, he experimented with a few ideas by combining his concept stores Barney's and Barnelli's with a Portillo's restaurant. In 1994, the first Portillo's within Chicago city limits opened at the intersection of Clark and Ontario St. In 1995, Portillo expanded Key Wester Fish & Pasta House in Naples, Florida. In 1996, Portillo brought the Key Wester Fish & Pasta to Naperville. In 2000, Portillo opened another concept restaurant called Luigi's House. The Portillo's chain grew again in 2010 with Honey-Jam Café. The Batavia, Illinois location closed just three years later. In 2014, Portillo sold Portillo's to Berkshire Partners. The new owners are planning to open five to seven restaurants each year. Portillo has been buying the land for new sites, which he then leases back to the company. A Portillo's Chicago-style hot dog  Outside Illinois Portillo's first California location opened on October 11, 2005, at the Buena Park Downtown shopping center in Buena Park. The second California location opened in 2008 in the Inland Empire city of Moreno Valley. Portillo's also has three locations in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area in Arizona (Tempe, Scottsdale, and the latest being in Avondale), two in the Milwaukee metropolitan area (Brookfield and Greenfield), and one in the Northwest Indiana town of Merrillville, though the latter is still well within the firm's home market of the Chicago Metropolitan Area. Portillo's opened its first Florida location in 2016 in the Tampa suburb of Brandon, Florida and a second location that same year in the University Square neighborhood in Tampa. The chain generated publicity with a tongue-in-cheek open letter on its website on June 16, 2015, the day after its hometown NHL team, the Chicago Blackhawks, beat the Tampa Bay Lightning to win the 2015 Stanley Cup. The stunt received newspaper coverage in both cities. \\"It's official. Portillo's is coming to Tampa in 2016. Tampa residents spent years peppering us with requests to build a restaurant — you really put us in a pickle. So we're thrilled we're finally making our way to Florida,\\" Portillo's letter said, showing the chain's ironic humor. \\"Let's be frank: No matter whose jersey you're wearing, everyone will be welcome. We hope you don't have a beef against us or our hometown team.\\" Both Tampa and Brandon, FL locations are themed 30's Prohibition.https://www.portillos.com/all-locations/ The Minneapolis-St. Paul region's first location opened in Woodbury in mid-summer 2017 as quite a few former Chicagoans have moved to the area and a new restaurant in the Indianapolis Metropolitan Area (Fishers)https://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/hamilton- county/2017/09/28/how-order-menu-fishers-portillos-grand-opening/708757001/ commenced operations in fall 2017.

In 1960, he played on the U.S. Team in the World Student Team Championship in Leningrad, USSR. The U.S. team won the World Championship, the only time the U.S. has ever won that event. Kalme won two gold medals, one for the team and the other for his individual result on board two. Kalme also represented the United States twice more in team play at this level: Helsinki 1961 and Cracow 1964. He played twice in the United States Chess Championship: 1958-1959 and 1960-1961. Kalme also became a master of contract bridge. He sometimes played as a partner of Michael Lawrence, who was a member of the world champion bridge team, the Dallas Aces. Kalme received a Ph.D. degree in mathematics from New York University in 1967, and became a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.

It occurs mainly in women, but it is very rare now. Historically, when it has occurred, it has often been concomitant with cutaneous tuberculosis, and it was formerly thought to be always a reaction to the TB bacteria. It is now considered a panniculitis that is not associated with just a single defined pathogen. The medical eponym Bazin disease was historically synonymous, but it applies only to the tuberculous form and is dated. Pathophysiology Predisposing factors include abnormal amount of subcutaneous fat, thick ankles and abnormally poor arterial supply. Abnormal arterial supply causes low-grade ischemia of ankle region. The ankle skin becomes sensitive to temperature changes. When weather is cold, ankle is cold, blue and often tender. In hot weather, ankle becomes hot, edematous, swollen and painful. Chilblains may be present. On palpation, small superficial and painful nodules are felt. They break down to form small and multiple ulcers. Fresh crops of nodules appear in periphery of ulcer and ultimately break down. In nodular stage, pain is present; while it subsides in ulcerative stage.

Real mode or virtual 8086 mode programs cannot be natively run in long mode. Overview An x86-64 processor acts identically as an IA-32 processor when running in real mode or protected mode, which are supported sub-modes when the processor is not in long mode. A bit in the CPUID extended attributes field informs programs in real or protected modes if the processor can go to long mode, which allows a program to detect an x86-64 processor. This is similar to the CPUID attributes bit that Intel IA-64 processors use to allow programs to detect if they are running under IA-32 emulation. With a computer running legacy BIOS, the BIOS and the boot loader is running in Real mode, then the 64-bit operating system kernel checks and switches the CPU into Long mode and then starts new kernel-mode threads running 64-bit code. With a computer running UEFI, the UEFI firmware (except CSM and legacy Option ROM), the UEFI boot loader and the UEFI operating system kernel is all running in Long mode. Memory limitations While register sizes have increased to 64 bits from the previous x86 architecture, memory addressing has not yet been increased to the full 64 bits. For the time being, it is impractical to equip computers with sufficient memory to require a full 64 bits. As long as that remains the case, load/store unit(s), cache tags, MMUs and TLBs can be simplified without any loss of usable memory. Despite this limitation, software is programmed using full 64-bit pointers, and will therefore be able to use progressively larger address spaces as they become supported by future processors and operating systems. = Current limits = The first CPUs implementing the x86-64 architecture, namely the AMD Athlon 64 / Opteron (K8) CPUs, had 48-bit virtual and 40-bit physical addressing. The virtual address space of these processors is divided into two 47-bit regions, one starting at the lowest possible address, the other extending down from the largest. Attempting to use addresses falling outside this range will cause a general protection fault. The limit of physical addressing constrains how much installed RAM is able to be accessed by the computer. On a ccNUMA multiprocessor system (Opteron) this includes the memory which is installed in the remote nodes, because the CPUs can directly address (and cache) all memory regardless if it is on the home node or remote. The 1 TB limit (40-bit) for physical memory for the K8 is huge by typical personal computer standards, but might have been a limitation for use in supercomputers. Consequently, the K10 (or \\"10h\\") microarchitecture implements 48-bit physical addresses and so can address up to 256 TB of RAM. When there is need, the microarchitecture can be expanded step by step without side-effects from software and simultaneously save cost with its implementation. For future expansion, the architecture supports expanding virtual address space to 64 bits, and physical memory addressing to 52 bits (limited by the page table entry format). This would allow the processor to address 264 bytes (16 exabytes) of virtual address space and 252 bytes (4 petabytes) of physical address space.

It was the result of a public competition sponsored by the then Governor of the State, Jose Ignacio Lares Baralt, who on April 29 of that year, held a lyric and musical contest to select the words and melody of such treasured lyrical piece. The winner of the lyrical category was the famed poet laureate, Udón Perez; in the musical category, the winner was the equally renowned author, Jose Antonio Cháves. The winning entries were officially recognized on the above date, during a ceremony headed by the illustrious governor, but it was not until February 18, 1910 that the anthem was finally distributed throughout the various departments and offices of the State. With its beautiful melody, and a theme built around the ideas of freedom, peace, and hope, the anthem has remained a favorite of the people. It still speaks a revolutionary language - highly critical of dictatorship - and continues to communicate the State’s age-old abhorrence of centralist powers.

I La luz con el relámpago tenaz del Catatumbo, del nauta fija el rumbo, cual límpido farol; el alba de los trópicos, la hoguera que deslumbra cuando al zénit se encumbra la cuadriga del sol no emulan de tus glorias el fúlgido arrebol II En la defensa olímpica de los nativos fueros tus hijos, sus aceros llevaron al confín; ciñendo lauros múltiples los viste, con arrobo, del Lago a Carabobo, del Ávila a Junín; y en Tarqui y Ayacucho vibraron su clarín. III Erguido como Júpiter, la diestra en alto armada, fulgurante la mirada de rabia y de rencor; las veces que los sátrapas quisieron tu mancilla: mirarte de rodilla sin prez y sin honor cayó sobre sus frentes tu rayo vengador. IV Y luego que la cólera de tu justicia calmas, va en pos de nuevas palmas tu espíritu vivaz; en aulas de areópagos, cabildos y liceos; te brindan sus trofeos el numen de la paz; y vese en blanca aureola resplandecer tu faz. V En tu carroza alígera que tiran diez corceles, de cantos y laureles guirnaldas mil se ven. Allí del arte el símbolo del sabio la corona, de Temis y Pomona la espada y el lairén. La enseña del trabajo y el lábaro del bien.

When t=1, the following well-known special case can be derived: :x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3xyz \\\\geq xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z)  Proof  Since the inequality is symmetric in x,y,z we may assume without loss of generality that x \\\\geq y \\\\geq z.

Extensions  A generalization of Schur's inequality is the following: Suppose a,b,c are positive real numbers.

He began his career in 1906 as half owner of the Elmira Gazette. He soon added newspapers in Ithaca, Rochester, Utica, and other cities in upstate New York. At the time of his death, the chain included 22 daily newspapers, four radio stations, and three television stations, largely based in the state of New York. Gannett was known for granting editorial autonomy to the different media, while consolidating and standardizing business procedures and purchases. Gannett disliked sensationalism, so his media played down crime and scandal, and rejected advertising for liquor. A conservative Republican, he was active in state and national politics. He was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor of New York in 1936, and in 1942 was assistant chairman of the Republican National Committee. In 1935 he established the Gannett Foundation to own the business, and provide philanthropy. Early life and college years Frank Gannett was born on September 15, 1876 to Charles and Maria Gannett. Gannett was one of four children and was raised in South Bristol, New York, by parents struggling to make ends meet first as farmers and later as hotel owners. Gannett's interest in the newspaper business began as a child, when he was a newspaper delivery boy for the Democrat & Chronicle. This job would provide Frank with money to buy his own clothes as well as some pocket money. After graduating from Bolivar High School in 1893, Gannett took a year off from schooling to raise enough money to further his education. During this break Gannett also took a competitive exam for a scholarship. Gannett was awarded the scholarship and would begin his college career at Cornell University.Williamson, Imprint of a Publisher: The story of Frank Gannett and his independent newspapers (New York: Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1940), \\"Part I Boyhood and Youth.\\" He was closely associated with Rochester's Unitarian Church.http://sunnycv.com/steve/ar/mm3/gannett.htmlhttp://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Gannett-40 Frank entered Cornell as part of the class of 1898 with $80 to his name. It was at Cornell that Gannett held five jobs and studied a variety of subjects. Since schools of journalism did not exist at the time, Gannett took courses in literature, history, civil and criminal law, government, Greek, and Latin. At the end of his freshman year, Gannett was elected as his class' correspondent for the school's newspaper, The Cornell Daily Sun. Gannett held this post for one year until he acquired a paying job as a campus reporter for The Ithaca Journal. \\"Frank Gannett - A Success Story.\\" Red Berri University, n.d. Web. 01 Dec. 2012. Soon after, he began selling reports to other newspapers as well. A quickly increasing demand led to Gannett hiring a group of students to help. Throughout his college career Frank would work for various magazines and newspapers. Gannett's time at Cornell was a successful one, leaving school with not only a B.A. degree, but $1,000 as well.Williamson, \\"Part I Boyhood and Youth.\\" The rise of a media mogul In the summer of 1898, Gannett joined the Syracuse Herald news staff, but quickly decided to forgo this job in favor of returning to Cornell for his master's degree. Upon his return, Frank was bombarded with requests for his news about Cornell from the newspapers clients he had served as an undergraduate. Ironically, Gannett became so busy meeting these demands that he never found time to register for graduate classes that fall.Good, Howie. \\"Frank E Gannett.\\" Pressinamerica. N.p., 7 Dec. 2009. Web. 29 Nov. 2012. He returned to Cornell the following year determined to complete his graduate degree, but would not stay for long. In the early weeks of 1899, Gannett was offered the secretarial position for William McKinley's Commission to visit the Philippines, and by March he arrived in Manila. Gannett stayed in the Philippines for a year, learning of foreign politics and culture. Upon his return, he accepted a job as city editor for the Ithaca News. He would also become editor of the Pittsburg Index in 1905.Williamson, S. T. \\"Part I Boyhood and Youth. Chapter V & VI.\\" Frank Gannett: A Biography. New York: Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1940. N. pag. Print. In 1906 Gannett became half owner of the daily newspaper the Elmira Gazette. Within the year, Gannett merged the Elmira Gazette and Elmira Star forming the Elmira Star-Gazette, which is still in circulation. Throughout his career, Gannett was known as \\"The Great Hyphenator.\\" The media magnate was known to buy and merge money-losing dailies to create profit.The Chain That Isn't. Time [serial online].

Gannett left Elmira in 1918, when he and his partner, Erwin Davenport turned their sights to Rochester, New York where a \\"politico-journalistic dog fight\\" between three evening newspapers caught their eye. Gannett and his partner sought to buy The Union and Advertiser and the Times, but they required $250,000 in cash. The two partners raised the money through friends and bank loans. Once the newspapers were purchased they were merged into the Rochester Times-Union.Williamson, Chapters VIII and IX Gannett moved his headquarters to Rochester to supervise the news end of his newly acquired newspaper. The company's headquarters would remain in Rochester until 1986, when it was relocated to Arlington County, Virginia. Gannett and Davenport lived in a hotel walking distance from their offices. Gannett spent his time tracking down news while Davenport searched for advertisers. It was also in Rochester that Gannett met his wife, Caroline Werner; they married in March 1920. By 1922, Gannett and Davenport were seeing signs of success. The Times-Union had downed its competition, the Post- Express, and was beginning to turn a profit. This success, though, did not anticipate the arrival of fellow newspaper businessman William Randolph Hearst.Williamson, Chapter IX Rivalry with William Randolph Hearst William Randolph Hearst, another media magnate of the time, is often portrayed as Gannett's rival. The pair's rivalry came to head particularly in the 1920s. Up until that point, Rochester had been monopolized by the Gannett Corporation while the Albany newspapers were mostly under the control of Hearst. This changed in 1922, when William Randolph Hearst attempted to break into the Rochester newspaper business. This would prove to be highly unsuccessful, as it was reported that Hearst began losing $100,000 a year. To combat Hearst's entrance to the Rochester newspaper business, Gannett brought the Knickerbocker Press and Albany Evening News in 1928. The Knickerbocker Press was circulated in the morning while the Albany Evening News was circulated in the evening and was a direct competitor of Albany Times Union, Hearst's newspaper. By 1937, Gannett monopolized not only the Rochester newspaper business but the Albany one as well. It was at this time that Hearst and Gannett struck a deal. William Randolph Hearst would pull out of Rochester, where at one point he was bribing citizens with new cars in order to attract new customers. In exchange Gannett would consolidate the Knickerbocker Press and Albany Evening News into a single evening newspaper called the Knickerbocker Press. Hearst would then transfer the Times Union to the morning field unopposed. The deal would leave Hearst disappointed yet feeling wiser and sounder. Hearst felt \\"sounder because he was putting his financial house in order all along the line and had just concluded a constructive deal in Rochester and Albany, N. Y.\\"Hearst Steps Nos. 2 & 3\\\\. Time [serial online]. July 12, 1937;30(2):32. Available from: Academic Search Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed December 5, 2012. Founding of a corporation Ever the businessman, Hearst continuously offered to buy the Times-Union from Gannett, Davenport, and their friend Woodard J. Copeland. By 1923, this seemed to be an appealing deal to Davenport and Copeland, as both were in poor health. If the two went through with the deal, it would ultimately leave Gannett out in the cold. So he decided to make his friends an offer they could not refuse. If given enough time to raise $250,000, Gannett would buy both of their stakes in the Times- Union, making him the sole owner. In order to obtain these funds, Gannett formed a new corporation, Gannett Co., Inc. So, at age 48, Frank Gannett became the owner of six newspapers in five upstate New York cities. In 1928, Gannett purchased the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, the paper which he first worked as a paperboy. Politics Throughout his life, Gannett was active in politics. A majority of Gannett's newspapers were in solid Republican territory. Gannett would always send his pronouncements to his editors with a note, \\"For your information and use, if desired,\\" and editors were free to ignore them. Gannett backed Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his early years of presidency but by the late 1930s withdrew his support. Gannett, amongst others, took a publicly neutral stand to the New Deal in 1936, though he privately disapproved of it, and would actively campaign against it later in the decade. He was a founding member of the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government and organized opposition to President Roosevelt's court-packing scheme of 1937, as well as the bulk of Roosevelt's proposed responses to the 1937 recession. Frank Gannett briefly ran for the 1940 Republican presidential nomination, but lost to Wendell Willkie.The Chain That Isn't. Time [serial online]. December 16, 1957;70(25):57. Available from: Academic Search Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed December 6, 2012. Later years Gannett would spend the rest of his life tirelessly working to build his corporation. He would expand his company to include both TV and radio stations. Though he never founded a paper, he \\"bought with an auditor's sure eye; in all, Publisher Gannett acquired 30 papers (plus a string of TV and radio stations) in 51 years, merged ten, and unloaded only three.\\" Gannett was able to acquire more papers than any other American publisher has without the help of an inheritance. Though he suffered from diabetes, the publisher refused to slow down. It would not be until 1948, when Gannett suffered from a stroke that he would slow down. Due to a fractured spine in 1955. Gannett was forced to transfer management duties and the presidency of Gannett Co. to Paul Miller. Legacy Frank Gannett died on December 3, 1957 of complications suffered from a fall the previous April. Gannett, who started off with virtually nothing, built an empire that would continue on to this day. His obituary in TIME magazine read that \\"Gannett, 81, [was a] publisher-founder of an empire that includes 22 newspapers, four radio and three TV stations.\\"The New York Times Obituaries [serial online].

The island was called Aichi by the Caribs and Touloukaera by the Arawaks. Marie-Galante was the second island encountered by Christopher Columbus during his second voyage, after Dominica. On 3 November 1493, he anchored at the islet now called ' in Grand-Bourg, and named the island in honor of the flagship ' (‘gallant Mary’) of the second voyage. On November 8, 1648, Governor Charles Houël du Petit Pré organized the first French colonization of the Americas: about fifty men lived near the site called Vieux Fort \\"Old Fort\\". Jacques de Boisseret bought the island back from the French Company of the Islands of America on September 4, 1649. In 1653, the Carib Indians slaughtered the few remaining colonists who had not surrendered to the harsh living conditions. Sugarcane, which probably originated in India, had been imported to the French West Indies by Christopher Columbus. As sugar became a commodity, it was cultivated in Guadeloupe from 1654 by deported Brazilian colonists who created the first sugar plantations equipped with small ox-powered mills to crush the cane. In 1660, at Basse-Terre Chateau, a peace treaty was signed in which the Caribs authorized the French and British to settle on the islands of Dominica and Saint Vincent. With the island now at peace, the availability of mill technology was developing into a plantation-based economy by using imported slaves from Africa. In 1664, Madame de Boisseret gave up her rights to Marie- Galante to the Company of the West Indies, and the island then had its first four ox-powered mills. In 1665, her son Monsieur de Boisseret de Temericourt became the island's governor. The map of the island he established carries his coat of arms. During the second half of the 17th century, the first slaves were brought from Africa to Marie-Galante to cultivate plantations. In 1671, 57% of the inhabitants were black. Jewish Dutch exiles from Brazil also settled, bringing new methods for the cultivation of cane sugar. In 1676, a Dutch fleet abducted the population and plundered its facilities. After the repopulation of the island, its new inhabitants were attacked for the third time by the Dutch and by the British in 1690 and 1691. These raids, which resulted in the destruction of the mills, the refineries and the depopulation of the island, caused the Governor-General of Martinique to forbid the re- population of the island until 1696. The British retook the island from 1759 to 1763. Windmills were first seen in 1780. By 1830, 105 mills were put in place, half of which were still ox-drawn. Today, 72 mill towers are still standing. From November 1792 to 1794, Marie-Galante, which was Republican, separated itself from the royalist government of Guadeloupe. Slavery was first abolished in 1794. The British captured Guadeloupe, and with it Marie-Galante, la Désirade, and all Guadeloupe's dependencies, in April 1794. The Treaty of Amiens in 1802 restored them to France. With the restoration, slavery too was reinstated in 1802. In March 1808 the Royal Navy took possession of Marie- Galante to stop French privateers using its port. In August a small French force attempted to recapture the island but the British garrison, consisting of Royal Marines, augmented by Sir Alexander Cochrane's first Colonial Marines, newly recruited from escaped slaves of the island, and by some troops from the 1st West India Regiment, defeated and captured the French. The British returned the island to France in 1815. Slavery finally came to an end in 1848, thanks to the combined efforts of abolitionists, such as Victor Schœlcher, and repeated slave revolts. The legislative elections of June 24 and June 25, 1849, the first time former slaves were permitted to vote, were inflicted by the bloody violence of protesters which have risen up out of the black majority in response to ballot-rigging orchestrated by wealthy white plantation owners. Many black people were killed during these uprisings which led to the dumping of rum and sugar from the Pirogue plantation into a nearby pond. Today this pond is known as ' (‘the Punch Pond’) in memory of these tragic events. Guadeloupe (Grande-Terre and Basse-Terre), along with its dependencies (Marie-Galante, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy, Îles des Saintes and la Désirade), were an overseas department since 1946 and a single- department overseas region since 1982. Within Marie-Galante the three communes are Capesterre-de-Marie-Galante, Grand-Bourg and Saint-Louis. Together, these were designated as an intercommunal entity on January 8, 1994, the first to be created in an overseas department. In 2007, Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthélemy each became an overseas collectivity, making them politically separate from Guadeloupe. Steven Callahan, who was lost at sea in a small (5-foot, 6-inch inside diameter) Avon life raft for 76 days, was found alive on April 21, 1982 off the coast of Marie-Galante by local fishermen Paulinus Williams, Jules Paquet and Jean-Louis Paquet, from neighbouring Guadeloupe. Geography Marie-Galante comprises three communes of France: Grand-Bourg, Capesterre-de- Marie-Galante, and Saint-Louis, Guadeloupe, with a combined 1999 census population of 12,488 inhabitants. The island is more commonly known as ' (‘the Big Biscuit’) due to its round shape and almost flat surface; its highest peak, the Morne Constant Hill, rises to 204 m. Formerly having over 106 sugar mills, it is also called \\"the Island of a Hundred Windmills\\" (). The island is undulating substrate calcareous, cooled by the trade winds and subject to cyclones and earthquakes. The northern coast is characterized by a high cliff. A fault line called the \\"Bar\\" separates the northern quarter from the remainder of the island. To the west, beaches and mangroves extend along the Caribbean Sea. The rivers of Saint-Louis and the Vieux-Fort run through the plateau that sits at the center of Marie-Galante. In the East and the South, the plateau descends sharply to a coastal plain skirting the Atlantic Ocean from which it is protected by a barrier coral reef. Economy The colonial economy was based on the cultivation of tobacco, indigo, coffee and cotton. But from the 17th century, sugar cane became an important source of income. This continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, adapting to the abolition of slavery and the great sugar crisis. During the dominance of the sugar cane industry, Marie-Galante acquired the nickname \\"the island with a hundred mills\\". In 1818 there were over one hundred mills to process sugar cane. The cane juice was transformed into sugar or rum. The mills were originally powered by oxen, replaced by windmills from 1780, in turn replaced by steam powered mills from 1883. The 19th century brought the disappearance of the former economic model. Gradually the small-scale sugar refining was processed in larger factories, by 1885 the five sites controlled the industry. In 1931, eighteen sugar distilleries and four factories were in production. In the 20th century, the large slave plantations were forcibly abolished and gave place to small farms, organized into co-operatives. But agriculture in the French West Indies is subject to global competition and by the beginning of the 21st century, one sugar refinery () and three distilleries (Bellevue, Bielle, and Poisson) remained on Marie-Galante. The white rum they produced is subject to an '. Organic sugar production could be an innovative development, but the current political situation ended European subsidies putting the current agricultural practices in jeopardy and thus threatens the economic future of Marie-Galante and its inhabitants. Remnants of the old economy still exist and Marie-Galante's rich history is a tourist attraction: a nature trail with 70 points of interest including two restored windmills (the Bézard Mill and the Bellevue Distillery), colonial dwellings and old sugar refineries (the Murat House and Mill) produces a network of paths for hikers to discover the island and its people. Like the other islands in the region, Marie-Galante has undergone the economic transformation accompanying tourism. But the tourism development is based on a policy of conserving nature and heritage, whether it is pre-Columbian, colonial or contemporary. Marie-Galante Airport is located on Pointe des Basses, halfway between Grand-Bourg and Capesterre making access to the airport difficult. Demography Marie-Galante had 30,000 inhabitants in 1946. There was an exodus for people going to Guadeloupe and France and the island had fewer than 12,009 inhabitants in the 2006 census. This population decline is related to the decrease in the sugar cane economy. The population density in 2006 was .

Morrison, computes the inverse of the sum of an invertible matrix A and the outer product, u v^\\\\textsf{T}, of vectors u and v. The Sherman–Morrison formula is a special case of the Woodbury formula. Though named after Sherman and Morrison, it appeared already in earlier publications.  Statement  Suppose A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times n} is an invertible square matrix and u,v\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n are column vectors. Then A + uv^\\\\textsf{T}is invertible iff 1 + v^\\\\textsf{T} A^{-1}u eq 0. In this case, :\\\\left(A + uv^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)^{-1} = A^{-1} - {A^{-1}uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} \\\\over 1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}u}. Here, uv^\\\\textsf{T} is the outer product of two vectors u and v. The general form shown here is the one published by Bartlett.  Proof  (\\\\Leftarrow) To prove that the backward direction (1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}u eq 0 \\\\Rightarrow A + uv^\\\\textsf{T} is invertible with inverse given as above) is true, we verify the properties of the inverse. A matrix Y (in this case the right-hand side of the Sherman–Morrison formula) is the inverse of a matrix X (in this case A + uv^\\\\textsf{T}) if and only if XY = YX = I. We first verify that the right hand side (Y) satisfies XY = I. :\\\\begin{align} XY &= \\\\left(A + uv^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)\\\\left(A^{-1} - {A^{-1}uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} \\\\over 1 + v^\\\\textsf{T} A^{-1}u}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= AA^{-1} + uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} - {AA^{-1}uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} + uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} \\\\over 1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}u} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= I + uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} - {uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} + uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} \\\\over 1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}u} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= I + uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} - {u\\\\left(1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} u\\\\right) v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} \\\\over 1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} u} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= I + uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1} - uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\end{align} To end the proof of this direction, we need to show that YX = I in a similar way as above: :YX = \\\\left(A^{-1} - {A^{-1}uv^T A^{-1} \\\\over 1 + v^T A^{-1}u}\\\\right)(A + uv^T) = I. (\\\\Rightarrow) Reciprocally, if 1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}u = 0 , then letting x = A^{-1}u, \\\\left(A + uv^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right) has a non-regular kernel and is therefore not invertible. Application If the inverse of A is already known, the formula provides a numerically cheap way to compute the inverse of A corrected by the matrix uv^\\\\textsf{T} (depending on the point of view, the correction may be seen as a perturbation or as a rank-1 update). The computation is relatively cheap because the inverse of A + uv^\\\\textsf{T} does not have to be computed from scratch (which in general is expensive), but can be computed by correcting (or perturbing) A^{-1}. Using unit columns (columns from the identity matrix) for u or v, individual columns or rows of A may be manipulated and a correspondingly updated inverse computed relatively cheaply in this way.Langville, Amy N.; and Meyer, Carl D.; \\"Google's PageRank and Beyond: The Science of Search Engine Rankings\\", Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 156 In the general case, where A^{-1} is a n-by-n matrix and u and v are arbitrary vectors of dimension n, the whole matrix is updated and the computation takes 3n^2 scalar multiplications.Update of the inverse matrix by the Sherman–Morrison formula If u is a unit column, the computation takes only 2n^2 scalar multiplications. The same goes if v is a unit column. If both u and v are unit columns, the computation takes only n^2 scalar multiplications. This formula also has application in theoretical physics. Namely, in quantum field theory, one uses this formula to calculate the propagator of a spin-1 field.Propagator#Spin 1 The inverse propagator (as it appears in the Lagrangian) has the form \\\\left(A + uv^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right). One uses the Sherman- Morrison formula to calculate the inverse (satisfying certain time-ordering boundary conditions) of the inverse propagator—or simply the (Feynman) propagator—which is needed to perform any perturbative calculation involving the spin-1 field. Alternative verification Following is an alternate verification of the Sherman–Morrison formula using the easily verifiable identity : \\\\left(I + wv^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)^{-1} = I - \\\\frac{wv^\\\\textsf{T}}{1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}w}. Let :u = Aw, \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad A + uv^\\\\textsf{T} = A\\\\left(I + wv^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right), then : \\\\left(A + uv^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)^{-1} = \\\\left(I + wv^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)^{-1} A^{-1} = \\\\left(I - \\\\frac{wv^\\\\textsf{T}}{1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}w}\\\\right)A^{-1}. Substituting w = A^{-1}u gives : \\\\left(A + uv^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)^{-1} = \\\\left(I - \\\\frac{A^{-1}uv^\\\\textsf{T}}{1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}u} \\\\right)A^{-1} = A^{-1} - \\\\frac{A^{-1}uv^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}}{1 + v^\\\\textsf{T}A^{-1}u}  Generalization (Woodbury matrix identity)  Given a square invertible n \\\\times n matrix A, an n \\\\times k matrix U, and a k \\\\times n matrix V, let B be an n \\\\times n matrix such that B = A + UV. Then, assuming \\\\left(I_k + VA^{-1} U\\\\right) is invertible, we have :B^{-1} = A^{-1} - A^{-1}U \\\\left(I_k + VA^{-1}U\\\\right)^{-1} VA^{-1}.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1907 to 1915, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Rodmond Roblin. Coldwell was a member of the Conservative Party. Coldwell was born in Darlington Township, Durham County, Canada West (now Ontario). He moved with his family to Hullett Township in Huron County in 1860, and lived on his parents’ farm until he was twenty-one years old. He was educated at public schools in Kilburn, at Trinity College School in Port Hope, and at Trinity College in Toronto. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the latter institution, and entered the office of Holmstead & McCaughey in Seaforth as a law student. He also worked for Foy & Tupper in Toronto before moving to Manitoba in 1882, where he completed his legal studies at the firm of Kennedy & Sutherland in Winnipeg. He was called to the bar in November 1882, and briefly practiced in Winnipeg before moving to Brandon in February 1883. He joined T.M. Daly in a law business, and continued this partnership for twelve years before forming the firm of Coldwell, Coleman & Curran. Coldwell was involved in Brandon municipal affairs, and was a member of the Brandon City Council for twenty years. Coldwell was also active in a variety of community pursuits. He was rector warden at the Anglican Church. He was a founder of the Brandon Opera House Company and a director of the Brandon Winter Fair. He was active in the Law Society of Manitoba and the founding of the Union of Manitoba Municipalities. He entered provincial politics in 1907, following the death of local Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Stanley McInnis. McInnis was Provincial Secretary and Municipal Commissioner in Roblin's government. Coldwell was appointed as McInnis's successor in cabinet on November 14, 1907, and entered the legislature after winning a by-election in Brandon City a few days later. Coldwell was elected without opposition. Coldwell was also named Minister of Education on March 14, 1908, and stepped down as Provincial Secretary on November 6 of the same year. He was easily re- elected in the 1910 election. In 1912, Coldwell introduced a series of amendments to the province's education act. He insisted these were only meant to clarify existing provisions, but many Manitobans believed that the Roblin government wanted to reintroduce funding for separate Catholic schools.Manitoba Pageant: My Dear Campbell at www.mhs.mb.ca The issue cost the government support in the 1914 provincial election, which they won with a reduced majority. Coldwell was personally re-elected, defeating Liberal candidate Stephen Emmett Clement by 163 votes. In 1915, the Roblin administration was forced to resign from office after a report commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor found the government guilty of corruption in the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. Coldwell resigned from cabinet on May 12, and was not a candidate in the general election which followed. Coldwell was indicted on charges of fraud for his role in the contracts scandal, but the first trial resulted in a hung jury and charges against Coldwell were later dropped. He died in Brandon at the age of 65. The Rural Municipality of Coldwell was named for him.

Hoff Church is associated with the Church of Norway, Østre Toten Parish Council of the Diocese of Hamar which covers Oppland and Hedmark. Hoff menighet (Den norske kirke) History Hoff Church was built around the 11th century and was constructed of limestone. Hoff church is similar in construction to the old cathedrals at Hamar, Nikolai Church in Gran, Old Aker Church, and Ringsaker Church. The joint model for these churches was the historic St. Hallvard's Cathedral, the main church of medieval Oslo. After 1658, Hallvard's Cathedral was demolished with only ruins left of the former cathedral.Lost treasures: St Hallvard’s Cathedral, Oslo (Trond Norén Isaksen) The church has been restored several times, including 1508, 1703 1894-95 and lastly in 1952. The remodel in 1703 resulted in structural changes. The entire tower and the nave were removed and aisles walls built higher. The baptismal font dates to 1703 and was designed by Lars Jensson Borg (d. 1710). The altarpiece dates to 1664 and was designed by Laurits Lauritsen from Nes. In the center of the altarpiece is a painting believed to be by parish priest Knud Sevaldsen Bang (1633-1694).The pulpit was made by Kristian Kloppen in 1829 and was painted in 1895 and 1952. The church has a distinctive collection of paintings dating from the late 17th century including works believed to be by priest and artist Didrik Muus (1633–1706). The church has a gallery and a total of 332 seats. It is known for its excellent acoustics and is often used for concerts.

They account for less than 1% of all breast neoplasms. Presentation Phyllodes tumor in mammography Anatomopathological results of phyllodes tumor. This is predominantly a tumor of adult women, with very few examples reported in adolescents. Patients typically present with a firm, palpable mass. These tumors are very fast-growing, and can increase in size in just a few weeks. Occurrence is most common between the ages of 40 and 50, prior to menopause. This is about 15 years older than the typical age of patients with fibroadenoma, a condition with which phyllodes tumors may be confused. They have been documented to occur at any age above 12 years. Diagnosis =Classification= Phyllodes tumors are a fibroepithelial tumor composed of an epithelial and a cellular stromal component. They may be considered benign, borderline, or malignant depending on histologic features including stromal cellularity, infiltration at the tumor's edge, and mitotic activity. All forms of phyllodes tumors are regarded as having malignant potential. A large series from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Centre reported the incidence of each as benign (58%), borderline (12%), and malignant (30%). Malignant phyllodes tumours behave like sarcomas and can develop blood-borne metastases. Approximately 10% of patients with phyllodes tumours develop distant metastases and this can go up to 20% in patients with histologically malignant tumours. The commonest sites for distant metastases are the lung, bone, and abdominal viscera. Rare sites of metastasis, such as to the parotid region, have also been described. They are classified as a fibroepithelial tumor by ICD-O, but not by MeSH. Younger women have a higher chance of having a benign phyllodes tumor. {class= +Histopathologic classification ! !! Benign !! Borderline !! Malignant - ! Margin  Pushing   Infiltrating - ! Stromal atypia  Minimal  Moderate  Severe - ! Mitoses per 10 HPF  <5  5 to 9  ≥10 - ! Stromal overgrowth  Absent colspan=2 Present } Treatment The common treatment for phyllodes is wide local excision. Other than surgery, there is no cure for phyllodes, as chemotherapy and radiation therapy are not effective. The risk of developing local recurrence or metastases is related to the histologic grade, according to the above-named features. Despite wide excision, a very high percentage of surgeries yielded incomplete excision margins that required revision surgery. Radiation treatment after breast- conserving surgery with negative margins may significantly reduce the local recurrence rate for borderline and malignant tumors. The authors of a 2012 study have derived a risk calculator for relapse risk of phyllodes tumors after surgery.This is available at www.phyllodes.com. Spectrum Phyllodes tumors are considered to be on a spectrum of disease that consists of fibroadenoma, fibroadenoma variant and benign phyllodes. Some would extend the spectrum to include malignant phyllodes tumors and frank sarcoma.

Until 1960, Rio de Janeiro city was the Brazilian capital and was not part of Rio de Janeiro state. In 1960, with the inauguration of Brasília as the new capital of Brazil, the city of Rio de Janeiro became the new Guanabara state. Only in 1975 the states of Rio de Janeiro and Guanabara fused forming present day's Rio de Janeiro state, but the Campeonato Fluminense continued separately until 1978, after which all its clubs joined the city league, the Campeonato Carioca. As most of the big clubs in the Campeonato Carioca have come from Rio de Janeiro city, the countryside clubs have rarely contended for the state title since the merger; only two countryside clubs, Americano and Volta Redonda, came close to winning the Carioca title, settling for runner-up in 2002 and 2005 respectively. List of Champions =Amateur era= The first Campeonato Fluminense was disputed in 1915, right after the foundation of LSF (the first state football association). In 1928 the clubs were replaced by city XI teams, and the champion league represented the state. From 1941 to 1945 FFD (former AFEA) replaced the city XI teams by clubs. In 1946 the clubs were again replaced by city XI teams.

Since then the state championship was disputed by the professional champions of each region. From 1959 on, the Fluminense champions had berths in the Taça Brasil, but neither the later Roberto Gomes Pedrosa tournament and its successor, the Campeonato Brasileiro, awarded berths to the Fluminense champions. *1952 - Adrianino (Engenheiro Paulo de Frontin) *1952 - Adrianino (Engenheiro Paulo de Frontin) - extra championship *1953 - Barra Mansa FC (Barra Mansa) *1953 - Barra Mansa FC (Barra Mansa) (Superchampionship) *1954 - Coroados (Valença) *1955 - Frigorífico (Mendes) *1955 - Goytacaz FC (Campos) (Superchampionship) *1956 - not finished *1957 - not finished *1958 - Manufatora (Niterói) *1959 - Fonseca AC (Niterói) *1960 - Fonseca AC (Niterói) *1961 - Rio Branco (Campos) *1962 - Fonseca AC (Niterói) *1963 - Goytacaz FC (Campos) *1964 - Americano FC (Campos) *1964 - Eletrovapo (Niterói) (Superchampionship) *1965 - Americano FC (Campos) *1966 - Goytacaz FC (Campos) *1967 - Goytacaz FC (Campos) *1968 - Americano FC (Campos) *1969 - Americano FC (Campos) *1970 - Central (Barra do Piraí) *1971 - Central (Barra do Piraí) *1972 - Barbará (Barra Mansa) *1973 - Barbará (Barra Mansa) *1974 - Sapucaia (Campos) *1975 - Americano FC (Campos) In 1975, although the Rio de Janeiro and Guanabara states had already fused, the federations were still separate.

Schultz and his family were traveling from their home in Brussels, Belgium in 1971 to the United States to visit family when they stopped in Reykjavik, Iceland to see the Fischer/Spassky tournament. Bobby Fischer was a friend and asked him to stay on as one of his allowed council of three. This was the beginning of Schultz's foray into the world of international chess. Over the next several decades, he traveled around the world for chess conferences and tournaments, often accompanied by his wife, Teresa Russ Schultz. Schultz first ran for USCF President in 1966, but was defeated by Marshall Rohland. In 1981, Schultz was appointed U.S. Delegate to FIDE, the World Chess Federation. In 1982, in Thessaloniki, Schultz was elected to the Executive Council of FIDE. In 1992, he was elected to the Policy Board of the USCF. In 1993, he organized a tour for the Israel Youth Chess Team to the US. In 1993 and 1994 he, along with Yasser Seirawan, ran a chess school for children in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. In 1996, Schultz was elected President of the USCF for a three-year term. In 2003, Schultz was elected to the Executive Board of the USCF for a four-year term. He is the author of two books, \\"Chessdon\\" and \\"Fischer, Kasparov and the Others\\". He has held numerous political positions in chess.

Dumont was hired as the head coach of the Tier III Nashville Junior Predators, based in Franklin, Tennessee, in 2016. Playing career =Amateur= As a youth, Dumont played in the 1992 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Montreal Canadiens minor ice hockey team. Dumont played four seasons for Val-d'Or Foreurs in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. Roberto Luongo, Francis Lessard, Steve Bégin and Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre were teammates at Val-d'Or who have also made it to the NHL. =Professional= 2010 Dumont was drafted third overall the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Islanders. In 1998, a contract dispute between Dumont and the team led to the Islanders to trade him to the Chicago Blackhawks along with a fifth round pick in exchange for Dmitri Nabokov. In March 2000, he was traded by the Blackhawks to the Buffalo Sabres. Dumont, Doug Gilmour and a draft pick went to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Michal Grosek. In August 2006, he signed a two-year, $4.5-million contract with the Nashville Predators after the Buffalo Sabres rejected Dumont's $2.9-million arbitration award. During the 2007–08 season, Dumont was signed by the Predators to a four-year, $16-million contract extension. On October 17, 2008, Dumont scored his 400th point in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets. In the 2010-11 season, Dumont posted just 19 points in 70 games with the Predators, his lowest point total since coming to Nashville. Consequently, on June 30, 2011, the day before free agency, the Predators bought out Dumont, making him an unrestricted free agent for July 1. In ending his tenure with the Predators, Dumont left the franchise placing fifth in all-time scoring with 267 points in 388 games. With limited NHL interest, on October 21, 2011, he signed a one-year contract with Swiss team SC Bern of the National League A. Marking a return after playing 13 games for Bern during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. In his final professional season in 2011–12, Dumont contributed to the offence at a point-per-game average, helping Bern reach the Championship finals. Personal J.P. is married to Kristin and has four daughters: Ella, Ava, Laila and Mya. In 2010, Dumont generously donated items to the Brewer, Maine, youth hockey program, by-way of (now former) Maine State Representative Chris Greeley, who served for a number of years in the Maine Legislature with Dumont's father-in-law, a state senator.

She listed Kate Bush, Doctor Who, Prefab Sprout, Lloyd Cole, Belle & Sebastian, Kirsty MacColl and The Smiths among her many influences. She ceased all use of this name for creative work in late 2009 and has changed her name in private life. Career Penny Broadhurst first started performing her own material as a spoken word performer when she was a student in Norwich in 1998. A self-confessed pop music fan and karaoke queen, her performances of acerbic and witty vocal narratives and Steps songs, delivered in a broad Yorkshire accent and often accompanied by pop and rock music, were frequently compared to that of a pop star rather than a poet. Her first album of spoken word with music, Blue Bank got radio play on BBC 6 Music, and the NME declared \\"...You can't mosh to poetry, but if you could, then you'd mosh to this.\\" Forsaking the poetry circuit for gigs supporting bands and comedians, she gradually moved away from using just the spoken word, and began to write and sing her own pop songs and dance routines, working with producers Ed Heaton, and Si McGrath of Hightone Productions. Clint Boon of Radio Xfm Manchester said of her songs : \\"She's unsigned, but she sounds like an established act to me. I can see why she calls herself the Queen of Pop.\\" She has appeared at Ladyfest around the UK and literary festivals including Off The Shelf and Ilkley Literature Festival. She was a member of the Yorkshire young writers' initiative The Writing Squad, funded by the Arts Council. In Summer 2005 she played at Glastonbury and in 2005 and 2006 at the Truck festival. She has also recently appeared at other festivals including Latitude Festival (2006 and 2007), Wireless Festival (2007), Solfest (2007) and Indietracks (2008) and made a television appearance on BBC Look North. As well as having radio play on BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 Music, and Radio Magnetic in the UK (on their playlist), Penny Broadhurst's work has been broadcast on FM4 in Austria, Slovakia and other local and international stations. Her songs have also been featured on Xfm and Dandelion Radio. Penny Broadhurst was based in Leeds, but regularly performed at venues throughout the UK. Recordings In January 2005, she released a demo MP3 single for free download of two tracks. \\"LJaded\\" – described by The Guardian as \\"a tribute to the Myspace and blogging generation\\" and another demo track, \\"London\\". It was accompanied by the following instructions: > \\"Download the MP3s, burn a CD, download the artwork, print it out, stick it > in a jewel case and hey presto! A Penny Broadhurst single.\\" Her first EP, Allons-y!, which featured more demo tracks, was released on Killer Disc Records on 24 September 2007 in a limited edition run of CDs, which were numbered and signed. This included a different mix of \\"London\\" from the mix on the free single, which is now no longer available for download. The title is the French for \\"Let's go!\\", which reflects the tone of the EP and is also a common utterance by the Tenth Doctor as played by David Tennant in Doctor Who. Her most recent EP, 'Sparkle The Dark', included a mixture of both solo and band tracks (as Penny Broadhurst & The Maffickers) and an accompanying booklet of short stories based on the lyrics to \\"The End\\" by several writers: Broadhurst herself, Danny Broderick, Robert Shearman, Danny Broderick, Benjamin Adams and Swithun Cooper.

Occasional special issues appear with all article contents focused on a single topic area. The journal publishes original research and rapid communications generally falling in the following categories: * Theory of Information Science * Communications * Management, Economics, and Marketing * Applied Information Science * Social and Legal Aspects of Information The journal also publishes book reviews and announcements of the association. History The journal was established in 1950 as a quarterly entitled American Documentation. The new journal was a publication of the American Documentation Institute (ADI), which had formed in 1937 around a group of researchers and practitioners who were interested in the emerging technology of microfilm as a medium for the preservation and dissemination of documents and knowledge. Many of the same people and institutions were involved in a prewar American Library Association journal called The Journal of Documentary Reproduction, which ran from 1938–43, before being discontinued due to the imperatives of the war. American Documentation was an explicit continuation of and extension upon The Journal of Documentary Reproduction, with a broader brief to cover documentation as a whole, then defined as \\"...the creation, transmission, collection, classification and use of 'documents'; documents may be broadly defined as recorded knowledge in any format.\\" In the postwar years, rapid technological and social changes ushered in an \\"information explosion\\" which created many new problems and opportunities of special interest to documentation specialists, and in time documentation found itself at the center of the emerging field of information science. The ADI's membership and scope increased rapidly, and in 1968 the members voted to change the organization's name to \\"American Society for Information Science\\", to reflect the changes in their membership and focus. As their official journal, American Documentation followed suit, and beginning with the first issue of 1970 it changed its name to The Journal of the American Society for Information Science (ISSN ; ), and began publishing bimonthly.History of ASIS&T; Retrieved 02/10/2011. In 1991, the publication frequency increased to 10 issues yearly and by 1996, the journal was publishing monthly. In 2000, ASIS again voted to change its name, this time to The \\"American Society for Information Science and Technology\\", in order to recognize the further changes in membership and interests brought on by the rise of the internet and the mainstreaming of networked computing and information technology. The journal's name was subsequently also changed in January 2001 to Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (ISSN ; ). It obtained its current name in January 2014. Multidisciplinarity A study of papers published in Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology in the period 1988-1997 and found, among other things: \\"Top authors have grown in diversity from those being affiliated predominantly with library/information-related departments to include those from information systems management, information technology, business, and the humanities. Amid heterogeneous clusters of collaboration among top authors, strongly connected crossdisciplinary coauthor pairs have become more prevalent. Correspondingly, the distribution of top keywords' occurrences that leans heavily on core information science has shifted towards other subdisciplines such as information technology and sociobehavioral science.\\" Abstracting and indexing The journal is abstracted and indexed in: According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2013 impact factor of 2.230.

Lindqvist. Frans Wilhelm Lindqvist (1862 – 1931) was a Swedish inventor. He designed the first sootless kerosene stove, operated by compressed air. He started a company, Primus, to manufacture and sell the Primus stove. Lindqvist was born in Västergötland, and lived in Gothenburg for a few years before moving to Stockholm, where he started to work in the AB Separator factory. Inspired by a workmate, he and his brother were able to design a new kind of burner for kerosene stoves. By vaporising the kerosene before it reached the burner, their construction had a sootless, smokeless, hot flame. Lindqvist started selling his stove on a small-scale basis, but the business soon grew. The product and the company were dubbed Primus. Together with a companion, Johan Victor Svensson, Lindqvist started industrial production in 1892. With the help of marketing firm B.A. Hjorth & Co sales grew, and soon the Primus stove was exported abroad. In the 1910s, more than half a million stoves were made annually. In 1930, more than 500 people worked at the Primus factory, on the Stockholm island Lilla Essingen. Among them were Per Albin Hansson, future Prime Minister of Sweden. In 1984, the Primus stove was depicted on a Swedish stamp, commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of the Swedish patent system.

Hans Dahl was famous for his paintings of Norwegian fjords and surrounding landscapes. Background Hans Dahl was born in the village of Granvin, on the Hardangerfjord, in the county of Hordaland in Norway. His talent was already evident when Dahl was 16 years old. However, it was only after service in the army that Dahl received artistic education. Hans Dahl was educated first to become an officer and became a lieutenant in 1871. He served in the Bergenske Brigade until 1874. After leaving the army, he apprenticed with Johan Fredrik Eckersberg and Knud Bergslien. He went to Karlsruhe, where he studied under Hans Fredrik Gude and and then to Düsseldorf, where his teachers included Eduard von Gebhardt and Wilhelm Sohn. His art became associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting, which was characterized by finely detailed yet still fanciful landscapes. Career Dahl had his first exhibition in Düsseldorf in 1876. Dahl lived in Düsseldorf until 1888, when he moved to Berlin. Almost every summer, he was back to Norway. In 1893, he commissioned the firm of Jacob Digre in Trondheim to build his summer residence, . It is located on the banks of the Sognefjord at Balestrand in the county of Sogn og Fjordane. Norwegian painter Adelsteen Normann had settled in Balestrand during 1891. Dahl's villa was of a similar design to the villa built for Normann.Villa Strandheim (NRK Sogn og Fjordane) Between 1888 and 1919, Dahl lived mostly in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, and spent only the summer in Balestrand. After 1919, Dahl no longer traveled to Berlin. Balestrand became a much visited tourist destination in western Norway. German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, became one of Dahl's patrons, conferring a professorship upon him in 1910, and visiting Dahl in Balestrand several summers in a row.The artist Hans Dahl (Kulturhistorisk Leksikon) Hans Dahl at Villa Strandheim Dahl resisted the transition in art from Romanticism to Modernism. In the 1890s a new school of art arose, and artists like Dahl were not very popular in the leading circles in the capital. He was particularly criticised by the art historian Jens Thiis. He was severely criticized by fellow artists especially by Christian Krohg, who was one of the leading figures in the transition from romanticism to naturalism which characterized Norwegian art in this period. Throughout his life, he increasingly narrowed his range of topics. Dahl often described the scenery of the western part of Norway in brilliant sunshine with smiling people in national costumes. His vibrant colors and charming portrayals of young Norwegian girls in their national costume have always been very popular. Personal life Hans Dahl was married to Helene Bewer, the daughter of the German painter Clemens Bewer (1820–1884). Their son was the Norwegian painter (1881–1919), who died of tuberculosis at the age of 37. In 1902 Dahl was appointed knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, 1st class. Hans Dahl died in Balestrand in Sogn og Fjordane during 1937.

History =Roches Stores (1901–2007)= Debenhams Ireland has its origins in Roches Stores, a business founded in Cork in 1901 by William Roche, as a small furniture shop, the chain grew to eleven stores throughout Ireland. At their peak, eight of the locations also had co-located grocery stores. Roches Stores began to exit the grocery trade in 1999, leasing its stores to SuperValu, although some of these stores closed after mere months. In October 2007, Roches Stores ceased operating. =Debenhams (1996–2007)= The UK operations of Debenhams entered the Republic of Ireland as an opening anchor of the Jervis Shopping Centre in 1996, with a second store an opening anchor at Mahon Point Shopping Centre in 2005. =Debenhams Ireland (2007–2020)= On 8 August 2006, it was announced that Debenhams would buy the leaseholds of nine of the 11 Roches Stores for €29 million. Under the deal, the stores, including those in St. Patrick's Street in Cork and Henry Street in Dublin would be rebranded as Debenhams stores. The Roche family retained the ownership of the stores, and Debenhams became the new tenants. Marks & Spencer had agreed to acquire the company's Wilton outlet in Cork; however that deal later fell through due to a dispute over rent with the owners of the centre. The eleventh store, in Dublin's Nutgrove Shopping Centre, was closed. Due to poor sales, Debenhams Retail (Ireland) announced in January 2010 that it would cut 170 jobs within its Republic of Ireland stores.320 jobs to go as staff at retailer and airline face axe Independent.ie In November 2010 Debenhams launched Debenhams.ie, the retailer's new Irish online store. On 12 May 2016 Debenhams Ireland filed for examinership (analogous to the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection process), which it exited successfully on 19 August 2016. On 9 April 2019, the parent company based in the UK announced that it had gone into pre-pack administration. On 26 April 2019, Debenhams Ireland confirmed to customers it was under a 'new management structure' and the company Debenhams Ireland Ltd (including Northern Ireland stores) would not be affected by the administration process taking place in the UK. The only Republic of Ireland locations of Patisserie Valerie were concessions located in Debenhams branches, and these closed when the parent chain entered administration. The parent company (Debenhams plc) went into administration once again on 6 April 2020. On 9 April 2020, Debenhams Ireland confirmed to its employees that the company would no longer operate in the Republic of Ireland. It said that stores would not reopen following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions placed by the Government of Ireland due to the impending uncertain economic conditions faced in Ireland. The company would file for liquidation during the week beginning 13 April 2020. Despite efforts to save Debenhams in Ireland in 2016, by separating Debenhams in the UK from Debenhams in Ireland, efforts to retain the Irish business had been unsuccessful. The closure of the stores in Ireland will result in the loss of 1,400 direct jobs and a further 700 concession related jobs. The debenhams.ie website will continue to trade. Closure of stores In April 2020, with the parent company going into administration, it was announced that Debenhams Ireland stores—which were already temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic—would be permanently closed.

When a drop-down list is inactive, it displays a single value. When activated, it displays (drops down) a list of values, from which the user may select one. When the user selects a new value, the control reverts to its inactive state, displaying the selected value. It is often used in the design of graphical user interfaces, including web design.

The distinction is that, when the menu is closed, a pop-up menu's title shows the last-selected item while a pull-down menu shows a static title like a menu in the menu bar.

He ruled jointly with his father Chindaswinth until his father's death in 653.

Beginning in 654, Recceswinth was responsible for the promulgation of a law code Liber Iudiciorum to replace the Breviary of Alaric; he placed a Visigothic common law over both Goths and Hispano-Romans in the kingdom. This Liber Iodicioruim showed little Germanic influence, adhering more closely to the old Roman laws. In his general law code of 654, he outlawed a set of essential Jewish practices, including male circumcision, dietary laws (kashrut), marriage laws and ceremonies, and the celebration of PassoverJohn Edwards, The Spain of the Catholic Monarchs, 1474-1520 (Wiley-Blackwell, 2000), p. 72.. Moreover, the church councils in the Visigothic capital Toledo (Toletum) became the most powerful force in the government and the bishops were the primary support of the monarchy. Will Durant wrote in The Age of Faith: \\"By their superior education and organization they dominated the nobles who sat with them in the ruling councils of Toledo; and though the king's authority was theoretically absolute, and he chose the bishops, these councils elected him, and exacted pledges of policy in advance.\\" Recceswinth died on 1 September 672, just before the first Arab raid of Baetica.Karen Eva Carr, Vandals to Visigoths: rural settlement patterns in early Medieval Spain (University of Michigan Press, 2002), p.33.

It was found in the Treasure of Guarrazar, a goldsmith's treasure made up of crowns and crosses that several kings of Toledo offered in their time as a gesture of the orthodoxy of their faith and their submission to the ecclesiastical hierarchy; the treasure was found between 1858 and 1861 at the archaeological site called Huerta de Guarrazar, located in the city of Guadamur, near Toledo The votive crown of Receswinth is in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain (Madrid). Among the crowns, made of gold and precious stones, it is the one that attracts the most attention because of the exquisite workmanship of its goldsmithery, with gemstones suspended beneath the filigree Latin letters hanging from its base, which read: RECCESVINTHVS REX OFFERET (\\"King Receswinth offered it\\")..

Printing attributes are set directly into the document using control characters. This allows direct changes to formatting such as margins, spacing, justification, etc. AtariWriter has only one menu, the main menu, for creating and editing documents, file directory, file management and printing.

Fu » Sat, 18 Jan 1997 04:00:00, I sat down at my Atari 800 using the original Atari Word Processor to design the specifications for the AtariWriter cartridge word processor. Reception Furr believes that 800,000 cartridges were sold over the product's lifetime. The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the software an overall A rating. The book stated that it \\"heralds a new era in word processing\\" for Atari 8-bit owners, and \\"a good reason in itself to purchase an Atari\\". It praised AtariWriter's ease of use and print preview, and concluded that the software was \\"a must for every serious writer and Atari owner.\\" Legacy *AtariWriter Plus - disk only.

They are made from an enriched dough covered in a thin layer of crisp cookie dough. Their appearance resembles a melon, such as a rock melon (cantaloupe). They are not traditionally melon flavored,Kazuko, Emi: Japanese Food and Cooking but in recent times it has become popular for manufacturers to add melon to melon bread. Variations exist, including some with a few chocolate chips between the cookie layer and the enriched dough layer, and non-melon versions flavored with caramel, maple syrup, chocolate, or other flavors, sometimes with syrup, whipped or flavored cream, or custard as a filling. In the case of such variations, the name may drop the word \\"melon\\" (\\"maple pan\\") or may keep it despite the lack of melon flavor (\\"chocolate melon pan\\"). The name has a bilingual etymology, since melon is a loan word from English, while panSee Infoseek Japanese-English dictionary for pan/パン and Japanese words of Portuguese origin is from the Portuguese word for bread. In parts of the Kinki, Chūgoku, and Shikoku regions a variation with a radiating line pattern is called \\"sunrise\\", and many residents of these regions call even the cross- hatched melon pan \\"sunrise\\". Melonpan and pineapple bun from Hong Kong are very similar. By comparison the Japanese style is lighter in weight and taste, slightly drier and has a firmer outer layer (including top cookie crust) which resists flaking unlike its Hong Kong counterpart, which should be treated with care as the top cookie crust tends to flake easily. The Hong Kong version is also moister and is generally soft on the outside and inside and has a stronger butter flavour.

Isaac La Peyrère (1596–1676), also known as Isaac de La Peyrère or Pererius, was a French-born theologian, writer and lawyer. La Peyrère is best known as a 17th century predecessor of the scientific racialist theory of polygenism in the form of his Pre-Adamite hypothesis, which offered a challenge to traditional Abrahamic understandings of the descent of the human races as derived from the Book of Genesis. In addition to this, La Peyrère anticipated Zionism, advocating a Jewish return to Palestine, within the context of premillennialist Messianic theology. He moved in prominent circles and was known for his connections to the Prince of Condé and abdicated Queen Christina of Sweden. Born to a Hugenot family of Portuguese Jewish converso or Marrano heritage, La Peyrère was pressured to renounce his views and publically converted to the Catholic Church towards the end of his life, though the sincerity of this conversion has been questioned. Biography =Background= La Peyrère was born in Bordeaux to a nominally Calvinist Hugenot family of Portuguese New Christian (converted Sephardic Jewish) ancestry. Retrieved on 20 March 2018. His name is sometimes given in Latin as \\"Pererius\\", which is a version of Pereira. He was born to a socially prominent family to parents Bernard La Peyrère and Marthre Malet, with eight siblings, including his brother Abraham La Peyrère. His father was the private secretary to Jacques II de Goyon de Matignon, Maréchal de France, while on his mother's side, his grandfather was General Treasurer to the Royal House of Navarre. Retrieved on 20 March 2018. La Peyrère was a lawyer by training. =Condé and Christina of Sweden= La Peyrère served as secretary to the Prince of Condé on whose orders he lived for one month in 1654 in a house in the Southern Netherlands adjoining that of the recently abdicated Queen Christina of Sweden. Christina is said to have financed the anonymous publication of Prae-Adamitae. During this time both Christina and La Peyrère met with Menasseh Ben Israel, who was later invited by Oliver Cromwell's government to England to negotiate the readmission of Jews to that country. Menasseh became a convert to La Peyrère's belief that the coming of the Jewish Messiah was imminent. La Peyrère also argued that the Messiah would join with the king of France (that is, the Prince of Condé, not Louis XIV of France) to liberate the Holy Land, rebuild the Temple and set up a world government of the Messiah with the king of France acting as regent. It has since emerged that, in fact: \\"Condé, Cromwell and Christina were negotiating to create a theological-political world state, involving overthrowing the Catholic king of France, among other things\\". La Peyrère was influenced by Thomas Hobbes and was an influence on Baruch Spinoza and on his younger direct acquaintance Richard Simon. =Pre-Adamite hypothesis= Du Rappel des Juifs (On the Calling of the Jews), by Isaac de La Peyrère, published in 1643, without the name of the publisher and place of publication In his Prae-Adamitae, published in Latin in 1655 and in English as Men Before Adam in 1656, La Peyrère argued that Paul's words in Chapter 5, verses 12-14 of his Epistle to the Romans should be interpreted such that \\"if Adam sinned in a morally meaningful sense there must have been an Adamic law according to which he sinned. If law began with Adam, there must have been a lawless world before Adam, containing people\\". Thus, according to La Peyrère there must have been two creations: first the creation of the Gentiles and then that of Adam, who was father of the Jews. The existence of pre-Adamites, La Peyrère argued, explained Cain's life after Abel's murder which, in the Genesis account, involved the taking of a wife and the building of a city. This account of human origins became the basis for 19th century theories of polygenism and were espoused by those trying to justify racism in the New World. This polygenesis of the Gentiles was his method of explaining the existence of the Negroes, Chinese, Eskimos, American Indians, Malays and other people groups being discovered. In 19th- century Europe polygenism and Pre-Adamism were attractive to those intent on demonstrating the inferiority of non-Western peoples, while in the United States those attuned to racial theories who found it unattractive to contemplate a common history with non-Whites, such as Charles Caldwell, Josiah C. Nott and Samuel G. Morton, also rejected the view that non-whites were the descendants of Adam. Morton combined pre-Adamism with cranial measurements to construct a theory of racial difference that justified slavery. As Michael Barkun explains, =Later life= La Peyrère's pre-Adamite contentions were fiercely criticized by Protestant, Jewish and Catholic authorities. In 1656 after a storm of indignation the Prae-Adamitae was publicly burned in Paris. In particular, La Peyrère fell foul of the Catholic Church, while in the Spanish Netherlands which was then under the Habsburgs. Here he was arrested and held in prison for six months and only released after renouncing his views and converting to the Catholic faith. He subsequently went to Rome and begged Pope Alexander VII for forgiveness, retracting his earlier views formally. Following this La Peyrère became a lay member of the Oratory of Jesus in Paris and lived out the rest of his life, from 1659 until 1676. The sincerity of his conversion was later questioned. Pierre Bayle, for example, published a letter in which his religious superior wrote that he \\"was always writing books that … would be burned as soon as the good man died.\\" In his later life La Peyrère was an influence on fellow Oratory of Jesus member, Richard Simon, who has been called \\"father of the higher criticism\\".
