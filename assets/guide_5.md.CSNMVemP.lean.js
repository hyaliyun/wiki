In 1512, he introduced a bill to alleviate the harsh working conditions of tin miners on Dartmoor. However, the local stannary court had jurisdiction to enforce a law against the obstruction of tin mining and Strode was prosecuted and imprisoned before he could travel to Westminster to present his bill. == Strode's Act == In response, Parliament passed Strode's Act, now named the Privilege of Parliament Act 1512 (4 Hen. 8 c. 8): :...AND over that be it enacted by the said authority that all suits, accusations, condemnations, executions, fines, amerciaments, punishments, corrections, grievances, charges and impositions put or had or hereafter to be put or had unto or upon the said Richard [Strode] and to every other of the person or persons afore specified, that now be of this present parliament or that of any parliament hereafter shall be, for any bill speaking, reasoning, or declaring of any matter or matters concerning the parliament to be convened and treated of be utterly void and of none effect. And over that be it enacted by the said authority that if the said Richard Strode or any of all the said other person or persons hereafter be vexed, troubled or otherwise charged for any causes as is afore said, that then he or they and every of them so vexed or troubled of and for the same to have action upon the case against every such person or persons so vexing or troubling any contrary to this ordinance and provision, in the which action the party grieved shall recover treble damages and costs, and that no protection, essoin, nor Wager of Law in the said action in any wise be admitted nor received. == Constitutional implications == In 1629, in the prosecution of Sir John Eliot (R v. Eliot, Hollis and Valentine), the court held that Strode's Act was a private act and applied to Strode only and not to other MPs. However, in 1667, both the Commons and the House of Lords carried resolutions declaring Strode's Act a general law: : ... and that it extends to indemnify all and every the Members of both Houses of Parliament, in all Parliaments, for and touching all Bills, speaking, reasoning, or declaring of any Matter or Matters in and concerning the Parliament, to be communed and treated of, and is only a declaratory law of the antient and necessary Rights and Privileges of Parliament. This establishes the common law that privilege extends beyond mere protection against action for defamation or treason. The law was subsequently codified as Art. 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689. == References == == Bibliography == * Tanner, J.R. (1930) Tudor Constitutional Documents, AD1485-1603 * Taswell-Langmead, T.P.

In 1992 Professor Franklin became the first woman to receive tenure in the Physics department at Harvard University and she served as Chair of the department from 2010 to 2014. While working at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Chicago, her team found some of the first evidences for the existence of the top quark. In 1993, Franklin was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society. She is currently member of the CDF (Fermilab) and ATLAS (CERN) collaborations. ==Early life and education== Franklin was born in Edmonton, Alberta and grew up first in Vancouver, British Columbia and then Toronto, Ontario, where her family moved in 1962. Her father, Stephen Franklin, was a British-born journalist who worked as drama critic for the Ottawa Journal and later as staff writer and editor for Weekend magazine. Her mother, Elsa, was a television producer as well as Canadian author Pierre Berton's manager and literary agent. Melissa Franklin dropped out of high school to form an alternative school with friends. After attending SEED Alternative School and the Lycee Francais Charles de Gaulle in London, she studied physics at the University of Toronto and graduated in 1977. In the summer of 1977, while Melissa Franklin was a student at CERN, she was part of a legendary bar-room bet with John Ellis which in part led to the naming of Penguin diagrams. ==Career== Franklin was a student at CERN in 1978, where she met John Ellis. According to Ellis, he coined the name penguin diagrams following a bet he had made with her in a pub. Franklin earned her physics PhD from Stanford University in 1982 with a thesis titled \\"Selected studies of charmonium decay\\" under the supervision of Gary Feldman, working with the school's linear accelerator, SLAC. She did postdoctoral work at the University of California at Berkeley in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. In 1988 she became an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, and worked at Fermilab in Chicago. In 1987 she joined Harvard University, later becoming the physics department's first tenured woman professor. For over a decade, Franklin traveled between Boston and Chicago every few weeks, to check on and fix equipment at Fermilab. In 1995, her team proved the existence of the top quark. At Harvard, Franklin co-directs the Laboratory for Particle Physics and Cosmology (LPPC), alongside Gary Feldman, John Huth, Masahiro Morii and Christopher Stubbs. The LPPC studies topics on the Energy Frontier, the Intensity Frontier and the Cosmic Frontier. Since the 1990s, Franklin has been a frequent guest on the CBC Radio science program Quirks and Quarks.

The organisation campaigns to reduce litter, improve local places and prevent waste. It has offices in Wigan and London. ==History== Keep Britain Tidy was originally set up by a conference of 26 organisations in 1955. The conference was initiated by the British Women's Institute after a resolution was passed at its 1954 AGM to start a national anti-litter campaign. In 1987, Keep Britain Tidy changed its name to Tidy Britain Group. In 2002, following a merger with environmental awareness charity, Going for Green, the charity changed its name to ENCAMS ‚Äî short for Environmental Campaigns. The \\"tidyman\\" logo In June 2009, the charity changed its name back to Keep Britain Tidy, introducing a new logo highlighting the IT within BRITAIN, reading \\"Keep It Tidy\\" as well as \\"Keep Britain Tidy\\". The \\"tidyman\\" logo is still used in public campaigns, alongside campaign straplines such as \\"Let's keep it tidy!\\" and \\"Help keep it tidy!\\" Following a year-long strategic alliance, in 2011 Keep Britain Tidy merged with the environmental charity Waste Watch. Keep Britain Tidy became the trading name. ==Timeline== === Beginnings === *1954: Led by its chair, Lady Elisabeth Brunner, the National Federation of Women's Institutes passes a resolution to \\"Keep Britain Tidy\\". *1958: For the first time, The Litter Act puts in place an overall law with fines of ¬£10 for people dropping litter. *1960: Group registers as a charity and company limited by guarantee. *1969: The tidyman logo appears on bins and packaging around the UK. *1970s: Public information films and high-profile national campaigning, including many popular faces of the day (such as ABBA, The Walt Disney Company, David Cassidy, Marc Bolan and Morecambe and Wise), have a marked impact on attitudes towards littering and awareness of the Keep Britain Tidy brand. *1971: The Dangerous Litter Act increases the maximum fine for dropping litter from ¬£10 to ¬£100.

The game was released in Europe on November 27, 1997 and released in North America three days later. While the game never saw a release on the Wii's Virtual Console service, it was eventually released on the Wii U Virtual Console in both Europe and North America in March 2017 followed by Japan in June 2017. Bomberman 64 is the first 3D game within the Bomberman series. It implements a different single-player mode by incorporating action-adventure and platforming stages instead of arenas in which enemies or other elements must be destroyed. This new variety of single-player game was well-received by critics for its imagination and depth, though most critics also deemed the multiplayer mode to be lacking compared to previous entries in the series. Three more Bomberman games were released on the Nintendo 64: Bomberman Hero (1998), Bomberman 64: The Second Attack (2000), and Bomberman 64 (2001). == Gameplay == This game is featured in full 3D, thus the directional controls change. Bomberman is able to walk in eight directions with a rotating camera facing in eight directions and with three different zoom levels. His bombs have a different effect than in other games of the series; the bomb's explosion waves have a spherical pattern, rather than the traditional cross- shaped ones. In both single player and multi-player modes, Bomberman always has the ability to kick, pick up, and throw bombs, without the need of power- ups, as in previous games. A unique feature of this game is that Bomberman can \\"pump\\" a bomb while holding it, which will make the bomb's explosion more powerful. A pumped-up bomb cannot be kicked or picked up again. Unlike most platform games of its time, Bomberman cannot jump, nor can he swim in water, although he can wade in shallow water. Since Bomberman lacks the ability to jump, higher areas that do not have a path leading to them must be reached by bouncing across bombs - typically this requires the \\"remote\\" power-up to avoid the normally timed bombs exploding early. \\"Bomb jumping\\" is actually required to fully explore most levels, retrieve certain power-ups, and cross many obstacles. If Bomberman runs into an enemy NPC, or is hit on the head by a small object, such as an unexploded bomb, he will become temporarily dizzy. While in this state, he can get hoisted up by an enemy and thrown around, or even finished off by getting thrown off the map, or into a bomb explosion. Bomberman can do the same to an enemy. When Bomberman takes damage, he dies. If he has a \\"heart\\" power-up when he's hit, he will survive, but he will lose the heart. When he dies, all power-ups he obtained will scatter all over the place. In the Normal single-player mode, taking damage simply causes Bomberman to drop the heart, and if it doesn't bounce off the level, he can pick it up again to survive another hit. In the Hard mode, the heart will disappear. The game has four bosses, all of which perform the same bomb attacks as Bomberman. All bosses can cause Bomberman to be dizzy if they touch him on Hard mode. === Game progression === At the start of the game, Bomberman can enter any of four anchors, which are terrariums of other planets (that were probably drained by Altair). In each anchor there are four stages. The first and third stages are adventure stages which Bomberman must navigate by solving puzzles and blasting his way toward the \\"Goal Arrow.\\" The second and fourth stages are boss stages. Bomberman must fight Sirius or one of Altair's subordinates in the second stage, and he must fight the world's guardian in the fourth. After Bomberman beats the first four anchors, he can enter the Black Fortress. Like the previous worlds, the first and third stages are adventure stages, but this time Bomberman must fight the guardian in the second stage and Altair himself in the fourth stage. In every stage there are five gold cards to collect (100 total). Once all gold cards have been collected, the player can unlock the secret world, Rainbow Palace. After all the gold cards have been collected from there (an additional 20, making a grand total of 120 Gold Cards) the player unlocks more courses in multiplayer mode plus the \\"Full Power\\" cheat option. With the cheat activated, Bomberman starts with 8 bombs, 5 flames, power bombs, and remote bombs. == Synopsis == The Omni Cube In the game's opening sequence, a peaceful-looking planet with gardens, rivers, and residential buildings abound is shown. The space pirate, Artemis, drops from the sky with a band of soldiers to raid the planet. Altair, the leader of the space pirates, watches from the Black Fortress, using his coveted weapon, the Omni Cube, to completely drain the planet's energy, condemning it to a zombie- like state. Artemis returns to the Black Fortress to meet up with her partners, fellow pirates Orion and Regulus and her superior, Altair. Together, they set their sights on their next target: Planet Bomber, home of the protagonist, Bomberman. They maneuver their fortress into the atmosphere of Planet Bomber. Bomberman, from atop a cliff, observes the Black Fortress' descent. Not much later, the Fortress begins to open fire on the people of Planet Bomber, firing destructive energy rays into populated areas. A warrior clad in white then flies out to the surprised Bomberman, and asks if he plans to defeat the assailants. Bomberman gives an affirmative response, and the stranger (later introduced as Sirius) explains that a force field protects the Fortress from any outside attack. Sirius goes on to say that this force field can be deactivated by destroying the four anchors attached to the Fortress; the \\"Green Garden\\": a ruin-filled natural world, \\"Blue Resort\\": a fortress surrounded by water, \\"Red Mountain\\": a large volcano fraught with danger, and \\"White Glacier\\": a large, snowy mountain covered in ice. Once inside the Fortress, they must find and destroy Altair. Bomberman climbs onto and destroys the four anchors with the help of Sirius, who supplies power-ups and teaches him new techniques. In the process, he kills Artemis and Orion, but Regulus survives. Once the force field around the Fortress is deactivated, the duo enter the Fortress. After sneaking through Altair's security measures, Bomberman finds and confronts Altair, and after a difficult struggle, defeats the pirate. The previously defeated Regulus swoops in and attempts to rescue his master from the battlefield, but is then knocked away by Sirius. Altair drops the Omni Cube, which Sirius lands on the battle platform to retrieve. Altair is annihilated by a newly powered-up Sirius. Sirius reveals that he was only using Bomberman's abilities into taking back the Omni Cube which was stolen by Altair, adding that he was sick of working with him and lying to him during the mission. He takes the Omni Cube and escapes to his secret lair to destroy Planet Bomber. Bomberman pursues him, making his way through the palace, confronting Sirius for his betrayal. When Sirius is about to fire on Bomberman, he is saved by Regulus, knocking him away and destroying the Omni cube. With the aid of Regulus, Bomberman defeats Sirius. Without the power of the Omnicube, The Rainbow Palace crashes into the Black Fortress, destroying both, as Regulus escapes with Bomberman, informing him that he was surprised with Bomberman's ability to defeat Sirius, as he and his comrades had considerable difficulty taking the Omnicube from Sirius. Regulus leaves Planet Bomber, stating that one day he will have a rematch with his new rival, Bomberman, who celebrates his victory. ==Development== After working on the game for about six months, the development team scrapped all their initial designs and started anew due to the emergence of more advanced 3D games on the market. It was subsequently exhibited at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo. == Reception == Bomberman 64 received mixed reviews. Critics almost unanimously commented that, in a reversal of the Bomberman series's most fundamental trend, the single-player mode is much better than the mutliplayer mode. However, their opinions of the overall quality of these modes varied. Doug Perry from IGN applauded the single-player mode for its intrigue and inventiveness, particularly the bomb bridging and tower-building abilities, and stated that the multiplayer mode, while not the best of the series, is accessible and benefits from well-designed arenas. Joe Fielder from GameSpot instead judged the single-player mode to be a satisfying improvement over previous Bomberman single-player experiences, but not essential, and said that the multiplayer mode has \\"lost all the addictive charm that so positively defined the series.\\" Shawn Smith and Dan Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly considered the multiplayer mode outright problematic, remarking that the 3D format, which occasionally makes it difficult to see what the player character is doing even in single-player mode, is a constant hassle in multiplayer. Hsu commented that \\"in my book, certain games should stay 2-D, and the B-man series is no exception.\\" Their co-reviewer Crispin Boyer opined that the multiplayer simply gets old quickly, while Kraig Kujawa found it sufficiently intense and fun, though not as good as in previous installments. GamePro found that the analog stick control works fine in single-player mode, but causes heavy aggravation in the heat of the multiplayer battle mode. However, the reviewer concluded that the single-player mode is good enough to make the game worth buying. ==Notes== == References == ==External links== * Category:1997 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Alien zoos in fiction 64 Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U ","title":"Bomberman 64 (1997 video game)"},{"id":"1442772","text":"The Dominate is the name sometimes given to the \\"despotic\\" later phase of imperial government, following the earlier period known as the \\"Principate\\", in the ancient Roman Empire.

Dominus, traditionally used by Roman slaves to address their masters, was sporadically used in addressing emperors throughout the Principate, usually in the form of excessive flattery (or political invective) when referring to the emperor.Cambridge Ancient History, Vol. XI, The High Empire (2008) p. 82 Augustus actively discouraged the practice, and Tiberius in particular is said to have reviled it as sycophancy.Shorter, D., Rome and her Empire (2014) p. 174 Domitian encouraged its use,Cambridge Ancient History, Vol. XI, The High Empire (2008) p. 81 but none of the emperors used the term in any semi-official capacity until the reign of Aurelian in AD 274, where coins were issued bearing the inscription deus et dominus natus.Watson, A., Aurelian and the Third Century (2004) p. 188 However, it was only under Diocletian that the term dominus was adopted as part of the emperor's official titulature, forming part of Diocletian's radical reforms.Menne, I., Power and Status in the Roman Empire, AD 193‚Äì284 (2011) p. 21 == Transition from the Principate == The Dominate system of government emerged as a response to the 50 years of chaos that is referred to as the Crisis of the Third Century. The stresses and strains of those years (chronic usurpations, military insurrections, simultaneous military conflicts across multiple frontiers) exposed the weaknesses in the Roman state under the Principate, and saw a gradual movement from the collegiate model of government that existed prior to AD 235 to a more formally autocratic version that begins after AD 285.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) pp. 12‚Äì13 In broad terms, it saw the gradual exclusion of the senatorial elite from high military commands and the parallel elevation of the equestrian orders, the reorganisation of the armed forces and the creation of mobile field armies, changes in imperial dress and ceremonial displays, a religious policy aiming at religious unity, large scale monetary reforms, and the creation of an empire-wide civil bureaucracy.Bray, J. J., Gallienus: A Study in Reformist and Sexual Politics (1997) p. 2; K√∂rner, C., Aurelian (A.D. 270‚Äì275), De Imperatoribus Romanis (2001) Although Diocletian is commonly thought of as creator of the Dominate, its origins lie in the innovations of earlier emperors, principally those undertaken by Aurelian (AD 270‚Äì275) some stretching back to the reign of Gallienus (AD 253‚Äì268).Bray, J. J., Gallienus: A Study in Reformist and Sexual Politics (1997) pp. 2‚Äì3 Not all the changes that produced the 'Dominate' were completed by the time of Diocletian's abdication in AD 305; many changes were either introduced or modified by Constantine I. Consequently, just as the Principate emerged over the period 31 BC through to 14 AD, it is only by AD 337 that the reforms that resulted in the Dominate were largely complete.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 246 In the opinion of the historian John Bagnall Bury, the system of government, > \\"constructed with the most careful attention to details, was a solution of > the formidable problem of holding together a huge heterogeneous empire, > threatened with dissolution and bankruptcy, an empire which was far from > being geographically compact and had four long, as well as several smaller, > frontiers to defend.

B. > History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the > Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 25 == Characteristics == === Multiple emperors === Under the Principate, the position of emperor saw the concentration of various civil and military offices within a single magistracy.Bury, J. B., A History of the Roman Empire from its Foundation to the Death of Marcus Aurelius (1893) pp. 28‚Äì30 Augustus and his successors usually took great care to disguise the autocratic nature of the office by hiding behind the institutions of the Roman Republic and the fiction that the emperor was simply the princeps or first citizen, whose authority was granted by the Senate. This role was almost always filled by a single individual, and the date that the Potestas tribunicia was conferred onto that person was the point when imperial authority could be exercised.Bury, J. B., A History of the Roman Empire from its Foundation to the Death of Marcus Aurelius (1893) pp. 23‚Äì26 Over the course of the Principate, it became common for the emperor (or Augustus) to nominate an heir (referred to as the Caesar), but the caesar did not have access to the powers of the emperor, nor was he delegated any official authority.Bury, J. B., A History of the Roman Empire from its Foundation to the Death of Marcus Aurelius (1893) pp. 20; 523 It was during the Crisis of the Third Century that the traditional imperial approach of a single imperial magistrate based at Rome became unable to cope with multiple and simultaneous invasions and usurpations that required the emperor to be everywhere at once. Further, it was their absence which caused usurpations to occur in response to a local or provincial crisis that traditionally would have been dealt with by the emperor.Watson, A. Aurelian and the Third Century (2004) p. 5; Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) pp. 251‚Äì2 Under the Dominate, the burden of the imperial position was increasingly shared between colleagues, referred to as the Consortium imperii. It was Diocletian who introduced this form of government, under a system called the Tetrarchy, which originally consisted of two co-emperors (augusti) and two respectively subordinate junior emperors (caesars), each of whom shared in the imperial power. This original power sharing model lasted from AD 289 through to AD 324, being undone during the Civil wars of the Tetrarchy. With Constantine I‚Äôs death in AD 337, the empire was again shared between multiple augusti, lasting until AD 350. The model became a permanent feature of the empire in AD 364 with the accession of Valentinian I, who shared the imperial office with his brother Valens. Barring the 3-year period of solitary rule by Theodosius I from AD 392‚Äì395, this approach would last until the overthrow of the last western emperor in AD 476. While each augustus was autonomous within each portion of the empire they managed, all laws that were introduced by any emperor were valid across the entirety of the empire. === Devaluation of the Consulate === During the Roman Republic, the office of Consul was the highest elected magistracy in the Roman state, with two consuls elected annually. With the arrival of the Principate, although all real power was invested in the emperor, the consuls were still in theory the head of state, and the calendar year was identified by the two ordinary consuls who began in office at the start of the year.Bury, J. B., A History of the Roman Empire from its Foundation to the Death of Marcus Aurelius (1893) p. 38 Throughout the Principate, the imperial consulate was an important position, albeit as the method through which the Roman aristocracy could progress through to the higher levels of imperial administration ‚Äì only former consuls could become consular legates, the proconsuls of Africa and Asia, or the urban prefect of Rome.Bagnall, R. S.; Cameron, A.; Schwartz, S. R.; Worp, K. A., Consuls of the later Roman Empire (1987) pp.1‚Äì2 Consequently, the high regard placed upon the ordinary consulate remained intact, as it was one of the few offices that one could share with the emperor, and during this period it was filled mostly by patricians or by individuals who had consular ancestors. It was a post that would be occupied by a man halfway through his career, in his early thirties for a patrician, or in his early forties for most others.Bagnall, R. S.; Cameron, A.; Schwartz, S. R.; Worp, K. A., Consuls of the later Roman Empire (1987) p.1 If they were especially skilled or valued, they may even have achieved a second (or rarely, a third) consulate. Prior to achieving the consulate, these individuals already had a significant career behind them, and would expect to continue serving the state, filling in the post upon which the state functioned.Bagnall, R. S.; Cameron, A.; Schwartz, S. R.; Worp, K. A., Consuls of the later Roman Empire (1987) p.2 Under the Dominate, the loss of many pre-consular functions and the encroachment of the equites into the traditional senatorial administrative and military functions meant that senatorial careers virtually vanished prior to their appointment as consuls.Bagnall, R. S.; Cameron, A.; Schwartz, S. R.; Worp, K. A., Consuls of the later Roman Empire (1987) p.2 This had the effect of seeing a suffect consulship granted at an earlier age, to the point that by the 4th century, it was being held by men in their early twenties, and possibly younger.Bagnall, R. S.; Cameron, A.; Schwartz, S. R.; Worp, K. A., Consuls of the later Roman Empire (1987) p.2 As time progressed, second consulates, usually ordinary, became far more common than had been the case during the first two centuries, while the first consulship was usually a suffect consulate. Also, the consulate during this period was no longer just the province of senators ‚Äì the automatic awarding of a suffect consulship to the equestrian praetorian prefects (who were given the ornamenta consularia upon achieving their office) allowed them to style themselves cos. II when they were later granted an ordinary consulship by the emperor.Bagnall, R. S.; Cameron, A.; Schwartz, S. R.; Worp, K. A., Consuls of the later Roman Empire (1987) p.2 All this had the effect of further devaluing the office of consul, to the point that by time of the Dominate, holding an ordinary consulate was occasionally left out of the cursus inscriptions, while suffect consulships were hardly ever recorded.Bagnall, R. S.; Cameron, A.; Schwartz, S. R.; Worp, K. A., Consuls of the later Roman Empire (1987) p.2 ===Transformation of the traditional Senatorial order=== Roman Emperor Constantine, who adjusted much of the civil and military reforms initiated by Diocletian One of the key changes in the management of the empire during the Dominate was the large scale removal of old-style senatorial participation in administrative and military functions. The process began with the reforms of Gallienus, who removed senators from military commands, placing them in the hands of the Equites.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) pp. 254‚Äì255 Under Diocletian, the military equestrian transformation was taken a stage further, with the removal of hereditary senators from most administrative, as well as military, posts (such as the Legatus legionis). Hereditary senators were limited to administrative jobs in Italy and a few neighbouring provinces (Sicily, Africa, Achaea and Asia), despite the fact that senior administrative posts had been greatly multiplied by the tripling of the number of provinces and the establishment of dioceses (or super-provinces). The exclusion of the old Italian aristocracy, both senatorial and equestrian, from the political and military power that they had monopolised for many centuries was largely complete. The Senate became politically insignificant, although it retained great prestige.Jones, A. H. M., The Later Roman Empire (1964) pp. 525‚Äì526 Constantine I, however, re-introduced a limited form of senatorial career, basing the magistracies on previous offices but with changed functions.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 255 Beginning with the quaestorship, a role which had acted as a form of apprenticeship for an ambitious senator during the Principate, it was downgraded during the Dominate and assigned to the sons of senators, with the legal qualifying age lowered to sixteen. This was followed by a suffect consulship and/or a praetorship. The office of Praetor had also lost much of its influence, as it had been stripped of its legal functions, so that during the Dominate its purpose was primarily to organise the Ludi Romani.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 18; Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 255 The most prestigious post that a senator could hold under the Dominate was that of Praefectus urbi; during this period the office gained in effective power, as the imperial court was removed from the city of Rome, meaning that the prefects were no longer under the emperor's direct supervision. The most significant change was the return of provincial government to the senatorial order, with the larger or more important provinces handed over to those senators who had held an ordinary consulship. However, unlike the time of the Principate, the role of governor was much reduced, being a purely civil magistrate with no military functions, and with provinces greatly reduced in size, and the number increasing from the roughly fifty pre-existing provinces to approximately one hundred.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 255; Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 25 The decline in the functions carried out by the old aristocratic senatorial families acting collegially with the emperor in the running of the empire was offset by the rise of an expanded imperial bureaucracy who served the emperor in a subordinate role. Interposed between the governors and the emperors was the Vicarius and, above him, the Praetorian Prefect, both of which were civilian (non-military) roles. Gone was the division between provinces under the jurisdiction of the Senate and those under the authority of the emperor. Now all provinces, dioceses and Praetorian prefectures were under the authority of the emperor.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), pp. 26‚Äì28 The Praetorian Prefects had wide-ranging administrative, financial, judicial and legislative powers. The provincial governors were appointed at his recommendation, and with him rested their dismissal, subject to the Emperor's approval. The only civilian officials not under the direct oversight of the Praetorian Prefects were the proconsular governors of Africa and Asia, along with the Urban Prefects.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), pp. 27‚Äì28 The increasing administrative machinery surrounding the emperor resulted in an explosion of bureaucratic offices. These state officials were paid originally both in food and with money, but over the course of the Dominate, the annona (or food ration) was converted into money. Their salaries therefore consumed a considerable chunk of the imperial budget. Although precise numbers are not available, it has been speculated that the state bureaucracy in the Praetorian prefecture of the East and the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum, including the diocesan and provincial governor's staffs, would have consisted of somewhere around 10,000 individuals.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), pp. 32‚Äì33 This figure did not include the staff of the military commanders, or the financial and other central ministries, and contrasts with the estimated 300 state bureaucrats that were employed across all the provinces during the period of the Julio- Claudian emperors.Bowman, A. K. Provincial Administration and Taxation in The Cambridge Ancient History Vol. 10: The Augustan Empire 43 B.C. ‚Äì A.D. 69 (1996) p. 353 Among the most important offices under the Dominate were the: * Quaestor sacri palatii (the officer responsible for drafting the laws, and the Imperial rescripts responding to petitions) * Magister officiorum (officer responsible for managing the secretarial departments in the palace, the conduct of court ceremonies, and controlling the special department which dealt with ceremonial arrangements and Imperial audiences) * Magistri scriniorum (the emperor's secretaries, belonging to the memoriae, epistularum, and libellorum bureaus) * Praepositus sacri cubiculi (the emperor's chamberlain, who exercised a general authority over all officers associated with the imperial court). All important offices automatically carried with them admission into the Senate, thereby further eroding the standing of the traditional aristocratic Senatorial families of the Principate under the Dominate. This resulted in a senatorial body of around 2,000 members during the reign of Constantine,Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 255 and these numbers only increased when there were two senatorial bodies in existence, one at Rome and one at Constantinople. All the higher officials in the imperial bureaucracy belonged to one of the three classes or ranks introduced by Constantine I ‚Äì the illustres, spectabiles and clarissimi, all of whom were automatically members of the senatorial order. The heads of the great central civil ministries, the magistri militum and other high level military commanders as well as the Praepositus sacri cubiculi were all graded as illustres, the highest of the new senatorial ranks. The second class (spectabiles) was assigned to a large group of civil servants, including the Proconsuls, vicarii, the military governors in the provinces and the magistri scriniorum.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), pp. 19; 34 The entry level class, clarissimus, was the minimum qualification for membership of the Senate. It was automatically awarded as part of the governorship of a province, and to a myriad of other lesser officers. It was held by a large number of junior imperial public servants, as well as being awarded to them after their retirement. The generosity of the emperors in bestowing the clarissimus witnessed the gradual erosion in its value. As a consequence, the emperors began to raise many clarissimi graded officials to the rank of spectabiles, which in turn cheapened the highest rank of illustres. This inflationary pressure resulted in the creation of a new senatorial rank before the middle of the 6th century, that of gloriosi. Higher in grading than the illustres, all of the highest state officials were regraded to this rank.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 34 ===Military reforms=== The original command structure of the Late Roman army, with a separate magister equitum and a magister peditum in place of the later overall magister militum in the command structure of the army of the Western Roman Empire. Under the Principate, provinces that contained legions were under the proconsular authority of the emperor, who managed those provinces through designated legates (Legatus Augusti pro praetore), while the units stationed at Rome were under the authority of the Praetorian Prefect. During the Crisis of the Third Century, greater authority over imperial military matters was ceded to the Praetorian Prefects,Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 257 while the imperial legates took advantage of weakened centralised authority to use the troops under their command to rebel against the emperor and claim the imperial title for themselves. It was Diocletian who initially divided the military administrative apparatus and the civil administration in order to mitigate the risk that future imperial governors or Praetorian Prefects might attempt to seize the throne through force, and then he reorganized both of them.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) pp. 153‚Äì157 During the Tetrarchy, the Praetorian Prefects were the Emperor's top administrators, ranking just below the Emperor himself in dignity. While initially serving as the Emperor's second in command in all matters of imperial administration (military, civil, judicial, taxation, etc.), during the course of the Dominate the Prefects gradually had portions of their authority stripped from them and given to other offices: the Masters of the Soldiers for military affairs and the Imperial Chancellor for central civilian administration.Jones, A. H. M., The Later Roman Empire (1964) p. 371 These reforms were the result of both the lack of officials suitable for the prefect's wide-ranging tasks, and of the desire to reduce the potential challenge to the Emperor's authority posed by a powerful Prefect.Kelly, Christopher. Bureaucracy and Government. In Lenski, Noel. The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Constantine (2006), p. 187; Jones, A. H. M., The Later Roman Empire (1964) p. 101 The next reforms were undertaken by Constantine I, who reorganised the supreme military command. Two significant parts of the reform are apparent: the separation of military commanders from civil administration and the division of the army into two classes: the Field Armies (\\"comitatenses\\") and the Frontier Troops (\\"limitanei\\").Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) pp. 271‚Äì273 The Field Armies served as the Empire's strategic reserve to respond to crisis where it may arise whereas the Frontier Troops were permanently stationed along the Empire's borders (\\"limes\\"). Recruited from the ranks of the Field Armies were the Palace Troops units (\\"Palatini\\"), who accompanied the Emperor as he travelled around the Empire, functioning as the successor to the Principate's Praetorian Guard.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 35 Around the same time, Constantine established the new military roles of the Master of the Soldiers (\\"Magister Militum\\"), who were the supreme military commanders of the empire. Beginning with the head of the foot troops, the magister peditum (\\"Master of the Foot\\"), and one for the more prestigious horse troops, the magister equitum (\\"Master of the Horse\\"), these were established in each of the four Praetorian Prefectures. Over time, the numbers and types of Masters would vary across the empire. The establishment of solely military officials provided for a more professional military leadership. The Masters were all ranked as illustres. *Within the East, by the late 4th century, there were Masters of the Soldiers, per Illyricum, per Thracias , and per Orientem. Each of these three Masters exercised independent command over one of the three Field Armies of the Eastern Empire. There were also two Masters of the Soldiers in the Presence (in praesenti) who accompanied the Eastern Emperor and who each commanded half of the Palace Troops. Each of the five Masters were of equal rank.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 36 *Within the West, there were originally four Masters of the Soldiers; foot and horse per Gallias and per Italiam. Over time, it became more common for the offices (foot and horse) to be combined under a single person, then styled magister equitum et peditum or magister utriusquae militiae (\\"master of both forces\\"). By the time of Stilicho, the Master of Both Services was the supreme military commander of the West, ranking only below the Emperor and above all other military commanders, and commander of half the Palace Troops. The Master of the Horse held command over half the Palace Troops and the Field Army of Gaul, but still under the command of the Master of Both Services.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 36 To support the Masters of the Soldiers, the Empire established several Military Counts (\\"Comes rei militaris\\"). There were six such Military Counts throughout the Empire. The Military Counts were all ranked as spectabiles. *Within the East, there was only one Military Count: the Military Count of Egypt (\\"Comes rei militaris Aegypti\\"). Unlike the Military Counts of the West, this Count commanded the Frontier Troops stationed in Egypt and reported directly to the Eastern Emperor. *Within the West, there were six such Military Counts, one for each of the five Field Armies in Illyria, Africa, Tingitania, Hispania, and Britannia. The sixth military count, the Count of the Saxon Shore (\\"comes littoris Saxonici per Britanniam\\"), commanded Frontier Troops along both sides of the English Channel and reported to the Count of Britannia. The five regular Military Counts reported to the Master of Both Services. The various Frontier Troops were under the command of Dukes (\\"duces limitis\\" or \\"border commanders\\"). These commanders were the closest in function to the Imperial Legates of the Principate.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), pp. 36‚Äì37 Most Dukes were given command of forces in a single province, but a few controlled more than one province. In the East, the Dukes reported to the Master of the Soldiers of their district whereas in the West they reported to their respective Military Count. ===Religious reforms=== The Dominate saw enormous changes in the official religion of the empire from its pantheistic Principate origins. Its principal feature was the elevation of a supreme deity that all peoples in the empire were to worship. According to John Bagnall Bury, > \\"while in all ancient monarchies religion and sacerdotalism were a political > as well as a social power, the position of the Christian Church in the Roman > Empire was a new thing in the world, presenting problems of a kind with > which no ruler had hitherto been confronted and to which no past experience > offered a key. The history of the Empire would have been profoundly > different if the Church had remained as independent of the State as it had > been before Constantine. But heresies and schisms and religious intolerance > on one side, and the despotic instinct to control all social forces on the > other, brought about a close union between State and Church which altered > the character and spirit of the State, and constituted perhaps the most > striking difference between the early and the later Empire.\\"Bury, J. B. > History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the > Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 63 The origins of the change began in the reign of Aurelian, who promoted the worship of Sol Invictus as the supreme deity of the empire.K√∂rner, C., Aurelian (A.D. 270‚Äì275), De Imperatoribus Romanis (2001) Although the worship of Sol Invictus did not remove the veneration towards the traditional Roman gods, it was seen as a mark of imperial favouritism, and the emperors linked his cult to the well being of the state and on-going military victories of the empire.Halsberghe, G. H., The Cult of Sol Invictus (1972) pp. 152; 162 Next, it was during Diocletian's reign that emperor worship was fully adopted by the emperors, as a method of expressing loyalty to the state.Lieu, S. N. C., Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China: A Historical Survey (1985) p. 93 Previously, deceased emperors had been worshiped as divus across the empire. Living emperors had been worshiped as gods in the eastern half of the empire since the time of Augustus, but this was not officially encouraged during the Principate, and it was not introduced into Italy. It was Diocletian who altered this to have the worship of the living emperors as an official part of the religious framework of the entire empire.Sextus Aurelius Victor; Bird, H. W. Liber de Caesaribus (1994) pp. 161‚Äì162; Rees, R. Diocletian and the Tetrarchy (2004) p. 46 To facilitate this, Diocletian was linked to the god Jupiter, while his colleague Maximian was associated with Hercules.Rees, R. Diocletian and the Tetrarchy (2004) pp. 54‚Äì55 It was under Constantine I that the religious transformation began to take its late Dominate shape, initially with Constantine officially favouring the worship of a single deity in the shape of Sol Invictus.Williams, S. Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (1996) p. 203 During the course of his reign, the identification of Sol Invictus as the principal god began to merge with the Christian god.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 280 To avoid offending Christians, Constantine abandoned the emperor's formal claim to divinity and ceased to demand sacrifices to the emperor that formed part of the imperial cult.Rees, R. Diocletian and the Tetrarchy (2004) p. 206 In an attempt to appeal to both Christians and pagans, Constantine adopted two new religious symbols into the imperial iconography, in the form of the Chi Rho and the Labarum.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 281 By the time of Constantine's death in AD 337, this process was largely complete, with Constantine officially converting to Christianity on his deathbed. At the Imperial court, Christians began indiscernibly to rise in favour, to the detriment of pagans. This did not begin to immediately hamper the advancement of pagan courtiers after the defeat of Maxentius in 312, as the full effects were not visible until paganism was prohibited at the end of the 4th century.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 281 Ultimately, however, as a result of the imperial patronage of Constantine and especially his sons, Christianity rapidly emerged as the official religion of the empire, although many vestiges of the imperial cult took some time to pass (such as the Emperors still assuming the role of Pontifex Maximus, chief priest of the pagan cults, until AD 381).Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 281 By the time of Theodosius I, the organisation of the Imperial Church had aligned to the civil administration of the empire. Every city had a Bishop, every province had a Metropolitan, and every civil diocese had an Exarch.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 64 At the level of the Praetorian Prefectures sat the five Patriarchates. The Bishop of Rome's authority extended over the whole western or Latin half of the Empire, and included the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum. The Patriarchate of Constantinople had oversight over the civil dioceses of Thrace, Pontus, and Asia. The Patriarchate of Alexandria corresponded to the Diocese of Egypt. The Patriarchate of Antioch had jurisdiction over the majority of the Praetorian prefecture of the East, while the smaller Patriarchate of Jerusalem dominated the three Palestinian provinces.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), pp. 64‚Äì65 The emperors had, over time, conceded many privileges to the clergy and the churches. Firstly, all clergy, like the holders of the pagan religious offices, were exempted from taxation. There were no restrictions placed on churches receiving bequests through wills, and they were given the same rights as the pagan temples had in granting asylum to any who requested it. Bishops were permitted to act as judges in civil cases when both parties had agreed, and no appeal was permitted once the Bishop had made their ruling. The state made increasing use of the ecclesiastical authorities in local administration due to the decline in the civic life of the urban communities, which coincided with the increasing local influence of the bishops. Finally, bishops were given the same role as the defensor civitatis, who was responsible for protecting the poor against exploitation by government officials and defending them from other powerful individuals, during the course of which the bishop could bring cases of illegality directly to the emperor.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 65 ===Downgrading of Rome as capital of the empire=== One of the most visible signs of the changes brought about by the Dominate was the downgrading of Rome from its status as the official residence of the emperor. This precedent had already been established by Gallienus in 260, who moved the imperial court to Mediolanum in response to a suspected future attack by the usurper Postumus as well as defending Italy from the ravages of the Alamanni.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 88 Rome was increasingly seen to be too distant a residence for the emperor when troubles could erupt along any of the borders of the empire. In the west, Mediolanum was seen to be a much better strategic city for the emperor to be based at, as it gave good access through the Alps northwards to both the Danubian provinces in the east as well as the Rhine provinces and Gaul to the west. Further, it was well positioned to guard against incursions through the alpine passes.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) pp. 88‚Äì89 This decision was confirmed when Diocletian established the Tetrarchy, and his colleague Maximian informally established Mediolanum as the senior western emperor's official residence.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) pp. 144; 180 Diocletian, conscious that the Persian threat to the eastern provinces required a continuous imperial presence, placed his eastern capital in the city of Nicomedia. Meanwhile, the Caesars also had imperial residences ‚Äì Constantius Chlorus was based at Augusta Treverorum, while Galerius sited his residence at Sirmium.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) p. 180 After the collapse of the Tetrachy, Constantine I at first placed his imperial capital at Ulpia Serdica before erecting a new imperial capital on the site of the old Greek city of Byzantium. Naming it Constantinople, it finally replaced Nicomedia as the site of the emperor's residence in the east in 330.Southern, P. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine (2001) pp. 180‚Äì181 Constantinople would remain the capital of the eastern provinces throughout the period of the Dominate. In the west, Mediolanum continued to be the imperial residence until the repeated invasions by Alaric I forced the western emperor Honorius to relocate to the strongly fortified city of Ravenna in 402.Bury, J. B. History of the Later Roman Empire From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian Vol I (1958), p. 163 Ravenna remained the western imperial capital until the loss of Italy in 476. Although Rome was reincorporated into the empire by Justinian I in 540, it was Ravenna which was selected as the official residence of the Exarch, the governor who represented the emperor in Italy. Ravenna would retain this position until 751, when the Byzantine Empire finally lost the central Italian provinces to the Lombards. ===Stylistic changes=== Diocletian and his augusti colleagues and successors openly displayed the naked face of Imperial power. They ceased using the more modest title of princeps; they adopted the veneration of the potentates of ancient Egypt and Persia; and, they started wearing jeweled robes and shoes in contrast to the simple toga praetexta used by Emperors of the Principate. Emperors inhabited luxurious palaces (the ruins of Diocletian's enormous palace in Dalmatia survive to this day; see Diocletian's Palace) and were surrounded by a court of individuals who, only due to the favor and proximity of the Emperor, attained the highest honorific titles and bureaucratic functions. In fact, many offices associated with the palatine life and that suggested intimate relationship with royalty eventually developed connotations of power, such as the offices of Chamberlain and Constable. The titles of Senator and Consul, after the loss of every residue of political power they had had in the Principate, became mere honorifics in the later Empire. Historian David Potter describes the transformation of government under Diocletian when describing the shifts in imagery the Emperor used to display his power (in this case the building of a huge new palace at Sirmium): > The style of Government so memorably described by Marcus, whereby the > emperor sought to show himself as a model of correct aristocratic > deportment, had given way to a style in which the emperor was seen to be > distinct from all other mortals. His house could no longer be a grander > version of houses that other people might live in: it, like him, had to be > different. The adoption of Dominus as a formal title reflected the divine status (divus) that has come to be a prerogative of the Imperial position. Originally an exceptional honour awarded by the Senate to an Emperor posthumously, the elevation had devolved to an expected convention for still-living Caesars. To dissuade the rebellions and usurpations of the Crisis of the Third Century, the Emperors sought the kind of divine legitimacy invoked by Eastern monarchies. Emperors imported rituals such as kneeling before the Emperor, and kissing of the hem of the Imperial robe (proskynesis). Even some Christian emperors, such as Constantine, were venerated after death. In the Eastern Roman Empire after 476 AD, the symbiotic relation between the Imperial Crown in Constantinople and the Orthodox Church led to the distinctive character of the medieval Roman state. Anastasius I was the last emperor known to be consecrated as divus on his death (518 AD). The title appears to have been abandoned thereafter on grounds of its spiritual impropriety. See Imperial cult (ancient Rome). The last ruler to use the titles Dominus Noster was Justinian I (died 565), giving place to the title of Basileus (\\"King\\"). In the Eastern half of the Empire, and especially from the time of Justinian I, the system of the Dominate evolved into autocratic absolutism. In contrast to the situation in the Principate, however, emperors in the Dominate could not be deified as it was, excepting the two initial decades and the reign of Julian, the Christian period of the Roman Empire. Another clear symptom of the upgrading of the imperial status was the notion of the emperor as an incarnation of the majesty of Rome; thus l√®se majest√© became high treason. ==See also== * Constitution of the Late Roman Empire ==References== ==Further reading== * Carson, Robert. 1981.

It is situated 32.9 kilometres west of Tralee on the N86 Tralee - Dingle national secondary road near its junction with the R561 regional road to Castlemaine and Farranfore leading to nearby Inch Strand. The village was recorded as having a population of 299 at the time of the 2011 census. ==Placename== Different suggestions as to the original meaning of the name include \\"Sc√°il's River\\" (Sc√°il N√≠ Mh√∫irn√°in is a character in a local legend), \\"River of the Shadows\\", or \\"Ford of the Heroes\\"., transcribed at Statue of Tom Crean, with the South Pole Inn in the background The late Tadhg Kennedy gave this explanation of the origin of the name in his submission to the Bureau of Military History of Ireland: > 'The name of the village, Annascaul, is derived from the ford at that point > where the road to Dingle leads across the river Sc√°l and is a corruption of > the word, √Åtha-na-Sc√°il, meaning, in English, the River of the Hero, and the > hero being Cuchulainn whose grave is reputed to be on the side of the > mountain above Droumavalla, north of Annascaul... There was a controversy in > the \\"Leader\\" years ago about the meaning of the word Annascaul and I > remember Dr. Douglas Hyde,\\"Beirt Fhear\\" (Mr. J.J. Doyle) and Mr. D.P.

Annascaul Lake is situated inland and just above the village. ==History== The village is of relatively modern origins, having grown up around the beginning of the nineteenth century. In 1837 it was described as: > \\"...containing 11 houses and 92 inhabitants. This place is situated in a > pleasant valley on the new mail coach road from Tralee to Dingle, to each of > which it has a penny post recently established.\\" Annascaul was the birthplace of the Antarctic explorer Tom Crean, who was part of Robert Scott's ill-fated attempts to reach the South Pole and Ernest Shackleton's epic open boat journey from Elephant Island to South Georgia. In 2003 a statue of Crean was erected in the village opposite the South Pole Inn, the public house he owned. Irish American sculptor Jerome Connor, famous for his work the Nuns of the Battlefield in Washington D.C., was also born in Annascaul. There was a long history in the locality, particularly around the late 19th and early 20th century, of young men joining the British Royal Navy. ==Sport== Annascaul GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club.

Schalke in The Revenue Journal, Vol. XXII, No. 3, December 2011, pp. 129-139. Three revenue stamps of the AMG from 1950 and 1951. The Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (originally abbreviated AMGOT, later AMG) was the form of military rule administered by Allied forces during and after World War II within European territories they occupied. == Notable AMGOT == This form of controlled government was implemented in the states of Germany, Italy,Friendly Isle, Time, July 26, 1943 Austria and Japan, amongst others. === Opposition of France === A dollar-like 100-franc note produced by the Americans and supplied in June 1944 following Operation \\"Overlord\\". US President Franklin Roosevelt insisted that an AMGOT should be implemented in France, but this was opposed by both Henry Stimson, the US Secretary of War, the US Under-Secretary for War, as well as Allied Europe Supreme Commander, General Dwight Eisenhower, who had been strongly opposed to the imposition of AMGOT in North Africa. Eisenhower, unlike Roosevelt, wanted to cooperate with Charles de Gaulle, and he secured a last-minute promise from Roosevelt on the eve of D-Day that the Allied officers would not act as military governors and would instead cooperate with the local authorities as the Allied forces liberated French territory. De Gaulle would, however, later claim in his memoirs that he blocked AMGOT.Kim Munholland, Rock of Contention, Free French and Americans at War in New Caledonia 1940‚Äì1945, Berghahn Books, New York, Oxford, 2005, p. 190. The AMGOT would have been implemented in France after its liberation if not for the Free French establishing control of the country per the Provisional Government of the French Republic in the name of the Free French Forces and the united French Resistance (FFI) following the liberation of Paris by the French themselves instead of the Allies, in August 1944.Charles L. Robertson, \\"When Roosevelt Planned to Govern France\\" === Germany === Germany's control was notably divided amongst the powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. ===Italy=== Sicily After Operation Husky, with the Allied Invasion of Sicily on July 10, 1943, the Allied Military Government was established with Staff Officer Francis Rodd, 2nd Baron Rennell and Civil Affairs officer colonel Charles Poletti, until February 1944. Interviewed by the News Chronicle, Rodd was asked about the controversial decision to retain the services of the Carabinieri and other police and officials who had worked for the Fascist regime, and answered \\"They are doing an excellent job and deserve to be trusted. Their oath had been to the King, not to Mussolini. (...) We do not seek the support of any political group, neither anti-Fascists nor any others. For the time being, all political gatherings are forbidden in Sicily. We are a military administration, we have no mandate to make any political or social reforms\\".  Free Territory of Trieste  The Allied Military Government of the Free Territory of Trieste was a follow-on from the military government of occupied Italy. The Free Territory of Trieste was created by the 16th UNSC Resolution adopted at the 91st meeting by 10 votes to none, with 1 abstention (Australia), 10 January 1947, and established by the signature of the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 10 February 1947, then entered in force from 15 September 1947. The instrument for the provisional regime of the Free Territory of Trieste provides that the allied and associated military forces govern the territory. The historical situation saw the division into two administration areas called Zone A, including the capital Trieste and the Free Port of Trieste (ports areas within the boundaries delineated in 1939) and Zone B comprising the area of the cities of Koper Izola, Umago, Buje and Cittanova. Zone A was assigned to the Anglo-Americans and Zone B to the Yugoslavs. Military governments ended when in November 1954 under the provisions of the London Memorandum, among the United States, United Kingdom, Italy and Yugoslavia, to become a civil administration. Zone A was assigned to Italy (not yet a member of the UNO) and Zone B was assigned to Yugoslavia. == See also == * Allied Commission * A Bell for Adano is a 1944 novel by John Hersey centered on the AMGOT control of the fictional Italian village of Adano based in the village of Licata. == References == Trieste Revenue stamps listed in Italy Revenues\\" by J.Barefoot Ltd, York, 2013, . == External links == * Infoplease-Military Government * Allied Military Currency Category:Military occupation Category:Aftermath of World War II ","title":"Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories"},{"id":"1442803","text":"Nicholas I of Russia quelling a riot on the Sennaya Square Cholera Riots refers to civil disturbances associated with an outbreak or epidemic of cholera. == In Russia == The Cholera Riots (–•–æ–ª–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –±—É–Ω—Ç—ã in Russian) were the riots of the urban population, peasants and soldiers in 1830‚Äì1831 when the second cholera pandemic reached Russia. The riots were caused by the anti- cholera measures, undertaken by the tsarist government, such as quarantine, armed cordons and migratory restrictions. Influenced by rumors of deliberate contamination of ordinary people by government officials and doctors, agitated mobs started raiding police departments and state hospitals, killing hated functionaries, officers, landowners and gentry. In November 1830, the citizens of Tambov attacked their governor, but they were soon suppressed by the regular army. In June 1831, there was a riot on the Sennaya Square in St.Petersburg, but the agitated workers, artisans and house-serfs were dispersed by the army, reinforced with artillery. The riots went especially out of control in Sevastopol and in military settlements of the Novgorod guberniya. The rebels established their own court, electoral committees out of soldiers and non-commissioned officers and conducted propaganda among the serfs. Further cholera riots in 1892 were aggressively suppressed by the tsarist government. On August 29, 1909 The New York Times reported more cholera riots in Russia. == In Great Britain == Asiatic cholera reached Britain in 1831, with the main epidemic occurring during 1832. There was widespread public fear, and the political and medical response to this new disease was variable and inadequate. In the summer of 1832, a series of cholera riots occurred in various towns and cities throughout Britain, frequently directed against the authorities, doctors, or both. The city of Liverpool, in the northwest of England, experienced more riots than elsewhere. Between 29 May and 10 June 1832, eight major street riots occurred, with several other minor disturbances. The object of the crowd‚Äôs anger was the local medical fraternity. The public perception was that cholera victims were being removed to the hospital to be killed by doctors in order to use them for anatomical dissection. \\"Bring out the Burkers\\" was one cry of the Liverpool mobs, referring to the Burke and Hare scandal four years earlier, when two men had murdered people in Edinburgh in order to sell their bodies for dissection to the local anatomy school. This issue was of special concern to the Liverpool citizenry because in 1826, thirty-three bodies had been discovered on the Liverpool docks, about to be shipped to Scotland for dissection. Two years later a local surgeon, William Gill, was tried and found guilty of running an extensive local grave robbing system to supply corpses for his dissection rooms. The widespread cholera rioting in Liverpool was thus as much related to local anatomical issues as it was to the national epidemic. The riots ended relatively abruptly, largely in response to an appeal by the Roman Catholic clergy read from church pulpits, and also published in the local press. In addition, a respected local doctor, James Collins, published a passionate appeal for calm. The Liverpool Cholera Riots of 1832 demonstrate the complex social responses to epidemic disease, as well as the fragile interface between the public and the medical profession. In the same year, riots were reported in Exeter as people objected to the burial of cholera- infected bodies in local graveyards. Gravediggers were attacked. The local authorities had instituted regulations for the disposal of cholera-infected corpses and their clothes and bedding. Even the collection of clothing could result in riot or disorder as family and friends argued over the amount of compensation to be paid. == In Germany == In 1893 fatal riots broke out in Hamburg, Germany during the fifth cholera pandemic, because the public objected to sanitary officers trying to enforce regulations for the prevention of spread of the disease. The crowd beat to death a sanitary officer and one of the policemen sent to protect them. Troops were called out and dispersed the crowd with fixed bayonets. == In Zimbabwe == In December 2008, baton- wielding riot police broke up protests in Harare and detained dozens, as the death toll of a cholera epidemic neared 600 in Zimbabwe's worsening health and economic crises. Trade unionists protesting against limits on cash withdrawals were beaten by security forces in Harare, while police also dispersed doctors and nurses who tried to hand in a petition against the collapse of the health system. ==References== Riots Category:Politics of the Russian Empire Category:Riots and civil disorder in Russia Category:1830 riots Category:1831 riots Category:1832 riots Category:1893 riots Category:1909 riots Category:2008 riots Category:19th century in the Russian Empire Category:19th century in England Category:1830 in the Russian Empire Category:1831 in England Category:1893 in Germany Category:2008 in Zimbabwe Category:Epidemic riots ","title":"Cholera Riots"},{"id":"1442811","text":"James Solomon \\"Big Jim\\" Nance (December 30, 1942 ‚Äì June 17, 1992) was an American professional football player who was a fullback with the Boston Patriots during their days in the American Football League (AFL). He was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2009. He played college football for the Syracuse Orangemen. ==High school career== Wrestling for the Indiana, PA high school, Nance was a two time Pennsylvania heavyweight champion in 1960 and 1961. It is said that the PIAA (PA's governing body) added the heavyweight class to accommodate Nance, who was too large for their highest weight class in 1959, which was 185 pounds. ==College career== Starting for three years at Syracuse University, Nance tied the school record for career touchdowns (13) and led the Orangemen in rushing in 1964, scoring in ten straight games. In 1963 and 1965 Jim Nance was the NCAA heavyweight wrestling champion and received All-America honors. ==Professional career== Nance was a 19th round selection of the Boston Patriots in the 1965 AFL Draft, as well as a 4th round selection of the Chicago Bears in the 1965 NFL Draft. Nance signed with the Patriots. Though his rookie season was unimpressive, he led the AFL in rushing the next two seasons. He went on to become the only AFL player ever to rush for more than 1,400 yards in a season. At 6-1 and 260 pounds, Nance was a powerful fullback who carried 299 times in 1966, for 11 touchdowns and 1,458 yards. That season, he rushed for 208 yards and two touchdowns in a 24‚Äì21 victory over the Oakland Raiders. Nance was an American Football League All- Star in 1966, when he also received the league's Most Valuable Player award, and an All-Star again in 1967 when he became the only AFL player to have consecutive seasons with over 1,000 yards, this time 1,216. He retired as the Patriots' all-time leading rusher with 46 career touchdowns, a record he still holds. In 1972, he was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles but refused to play for them, temporarily retiring. He joined the New York Jets the following year. In 1974, Nance played with the Houston Texans/Shreveport Steamer of the World Football League, rushing for 1,240 yards. In 1975, he ran for 767 yards before the WFL folded. He is the all-time leading rusher in the WFL with 490 carries for 2,007 yards and a 4.1 average. He rushed for 15 touchdowns in his WFL career. ==Death== Nance suffered a heart attack and stroke in 1983.

King Leonardo is assisted in all things by a calm, competent skunk named Odie Cologne or \\"Odie O. Cologne\\" (voiced by Allen Swift impersonating Ronald Colman). Odie, the one who really keeps the kingdom on an even keel, has been by the king's side since they were children. King Leonardo's permanent foe is the gangster-visaged Biggie Rat (voiced by Jackson Beck impersonating Edward G. Robinson), who routinely attempts to overthrow Leonardo and take over Bongo Congo with Leonardo's incompetent sibling Itchy Brother (voiced by Allen Swift). They are often assisted by an evil German inventor named Professor Messer (voiced by Jackson Beck) or Odie's flirtatious sister Carlotta. Biggie and Itchy's various schemes always end with them either landing in the dungeon or getting away. Episodes of \\"The King and Odie\\" that were exclusive to Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales feature Biggie Rat and Itchy Brother employed by Mr. Mad (voiced by Norman Rose), a mad scientist with a domineering personality that even gives a bad vibe to Biggie. Mr. Mad has his own plans for Bongo Congo. When each of his schemes falls through, Mr. Mad disappears \\"as if by magic\\" before he can be apprehended. ==Other segments== Each half-hour episode of King Leonardo consisted of five animated segments. Each half-hour included a two-part King and Odie episode, with other characters featured in between: * Tooter Turtle: The adventures of a turtle (voiced by Allen Swift) who has Mr. Wizard the Lizard (voiced by Sandy Becker) transport him to various settings, only to realize he was better off at home after all. When Tooter was trapped in a situation he couldn't get out of, he would call to the wizard, who sent him home with this incantation: \\"Drizzle drazzle druzzle drome, time for this one to come home.\\" * The Hunter: A Southern-accented, crime-fighting bloodhound detective (voiced by Kenny Delmar, reprising his Senator Claghorn voice from The Fred Allen Show) chases after a criminal fox named The Fox (voiced by Ben Stone). The Fox would often commit a scheme which always ends with him being apprehended in the end. Another segment of the original King Leonardo show was Twinkles, an orange elephant who served as the mascot of Twinkles Cereal, a product of the show's chief sponsor, General Mills. The 90-second Twinkles segments continued to air in syndication during the 1960s, and were presented in a 15-minute format under the title The King and Odie, but later phased out after a firefighter character replaced the elephant as the cereal's mascot. The segments also appeared during some NBC network rebroadcasts of Underdog. The Twinkles segments were not included when King Leonardo And His Short Subjects was syndicated in a half-hour format during the 1980s. Early in the series' NBC run, selected Columbia Pictures theatrical cartoons were aired on the program, some featuring The Fox and the Crow and Li'l Abner. These shorts were added to fill time when production of the early shows was delayed. The Columbia cartoons were featured during NBC showings of Hanna-Barbera's Ruff and Reddy, but not included in subsequent syndicated versions of the series. The animation for the show's early segments was produced by TV Spots, with later episodes by Gamma Productions, the same Mexico-based studio that did much of the work for Jay Ward Productions. For this reason, and due to shared sponsorship by General Mills, Gamma has often been associated with both Total Television Productions and Jay Ward Productions. TV Spots was primarily a producer of animated commercials, but also was contracted for some segments of Rocky and His Friends for Jay Ward Productions. ==Later appearances== After King Leonardo and his Short Subjects ended, one season of new segments of \\"The King and Odie\\" and \\"The Hunter\\" continued to be produced and aired on Total TV's Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales, which premiered in 1963. The following year, Total TV launched its most popular series, Underdog. When Underdog premiered in 1964, it featured repeats of The Hunter, while The Hunter's former spot on the Tennessee Tuxedo program was filled by repeats of Tooter Turtle. In reruns, Total Television shorts often have been packaged alongside Jay Ward cartoons. Despite similar limited-animation styles, they were two separate studios. King Leonardo, despite its earlier episodes repackaged for syndication as The King and Odie during the mid-1960s, never attained the popularity of Total Television's other series, Underdog and Tennessee Tuxedo, and is rarely seen on television today. Beginning in 2006, the Black Family Channel aired this show on its BFC Kids TV programming block until the channel's demise a year later. The characters of this show were also featured in an eight-issue comic book produced by Dell Comics and Gold Key. ==Episodes== ==Cast== * Jackson Beck - King Leonardo, Biggie Rat, Professor Messer * Allen Swift - Odie Cologne, Itchy Brother, Duke, Earl, Tooter Turtle, Narrator (\\"The King and Odie\\") * Sandy Becker - Mr. Wizard * Kenny Delmar - The Hunter, Narrator (\\"The Hunter\\") * Ben Stone - The Fox, Officer Flim Flanigan * Norman Rose - Mr. Mad, Narrator (several 1962 episodes of \\"The King and Odie\\") * Delo States - various female and children's voices * George S.

Fr√°ech refuses the dowry, saying he would not give it for Medb herself. Ailill and Medb fear that Fr√°ech will elope with Findabair so they plot to murder him in such a way that they cannot be blamed. They tell Fr√°ech that he has a reputation as a good swimmer and take him to a river where they will watch him bathe. When Fr√°ech removes his clothes and enters the water, Ailill opens Fr√°ech's purse and finds Findabair's ring; Ailill throws the ring into the water, and Fr√°ech watches as a salmon leaps from the water to swallow it. Fr√°ech catches the fish and brings it to shore, at which point Medb asks him to stay in the water and retrieve a branch of beautiful rowan berries on the other side of the river.Matson, Gienna: Celtic Mythology A to Z, page 56. Chelsea House, 2004. ). Fr√°ech retrieves a branch of the rowan tree, so Medb asks for another branch, and when Fr√°ech returns to the water he is attacked by a water monster (sometimes referred to as a dragon or serpent). Fr√°ech begs for his sword from the company, but none of Ailill's men dare to help him, so Findabair strips off her clothes and dives into the water with Fr√°ech's sword. Ailill attempts to spear his own daughter, but Fr√°ech catches the spear and throws it back at Ailill. Findabair gives Fr√°ech his sword and he beheads the water serpent but is badly wounded. Ailill and Medb take him back to their palace and prepare a bath for Fr√°ech from bacon and the fresh meat of a heifer; they then place him in a bed to die, but a hundred and fifty maidens of the Sidhe, all dressed in green, hear the lamentations for Fr√°ech and carry him off to the burial caverns of Cruachan. To the astonishment of all, the following morning Fr√°ech returns to the court of Medb and Ailill without a single blemish, and the two companies make peace. In secret, Fr√°ech immediately tells his servant to retrieve the salmon that he left on the shore the previous day, to cook it for Findabair and to remove the ring from its belly. The two parties then proceed to feast and become drunk, and Ailill demands that all of his jewells be displayed before the court. He asks Findabair what became of the ring he gave her and tells her that if it is not found, he will put her to death, but if she can produce it, she may choose her own husband. Findabair then sends her maid to retrieve the cooked fish with the ring prominently displayed on its top, and Ailill demands that Fr√°ech explain how the ring was retrieved. Fr√°ech tells Ailill that he found the ring when he first came to visit and heard at the water's edge that Findabair had lost the ring and was looking for it; Fr√°ech then said he offered to return it to Findabair in exchange for her love for one year. Ailill and Medb then tell Fr√°ech to retrieve his cattle and that when he returns to them, they shall give him Findabair in marriage. Fr√°ech then departs from Ailill and Medb and finds that his cattle have been stolen along with his wife and three sons while he was away. Fr√°ech joins up with Conall Cernach and the two track the cattle and his family to the Alps; they are warned that the thieves' hideout is guarded by two dangerous serpents, but when they arrive, the serpents jump into Conall's girdle and the two heroes raid and destroy the dun, regaining Fr√°ech's cattle and family. Fr√°ech then returns to Medb and Ailill and agrees to fight for them against the Ulstermen in the T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge (Cattle Raid of Cooley). Finally Fr√°ech returns to Ailill and Medb to join them for the T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge. ===The Death of Fr√°ech === \\"The Death of Fr√°ech\\" is a poem from The Book of the Dean of Lismore in which Fr√°ech, who is described as the bravest, friendliest, and best of knights, is sent by Medb to retrieve the berries from a rowan tree on an island in Loch Medb. The berries from the rowan tree could cure disease and prolong life for a year, but the tree itself was guarded by a dragon or monster that dwelt in the loch among its roots. Fr√°ech first went to the island and found the dragon asleep and was able to retrieve its berries unperceived. However Medb was not satisfied with the berries and requested that Fr√°ech retrieve a branch from the tree. Fr√°ech returned to the island and attempted to uproot the tree, but this act disturbed the dragon. The dragon bites Fr√°ech in the side and tears off his arm, but Findabair provides a sword, which Fr√°ech uses to behead the monster. Fr√°ech finally comes ashore but dies of his wounds in Findabair's lap. ===T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge=== In the T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge, Medb sends for Fr√°ech to fight against C√∫ Chulainn. Fr√°ech finds C√∫ Chulainn bathing in a river and C√∫ Chulainn warns Fr√°ech that if he enters the water, he will kill him. Fr√°ech removes his clothes and enters the water to wrestle with C√∫ Chulainn. C√∫ Chulainn partially drowns Fr√°ech and asks him to yield, but Fr√°ech refuses, so C√∫ Chulainn submerges him a second time until he dies. Fr√°ech's body is borne away to Sid Fraich by a troop of maidens of the Sidhe, all dressed in green.T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge.

Nature contemplation Whilst in the life of the intellect 'contemplation' refers to thinking profoundly about something, in the religious life contemplation is a kind of inner vision or seeing, transcendent of the intellect, facilitated by means of practices such as prayer or meditation. ==Definition== The word contemplation basically means 'to think about an action before you perform it'. ==Etymology== The word contemplation is derived from the Latin word contemplatio, ultimately from the Latin word templum, a piece of ground consecrated for the taking of auspices, or a building for worship. The latter either derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *tem- (\\"to cut\\"), on notion of \\"place reserved or cut out\\", or from the root *temp- (\\"to stretch, string\\"), thus referring to a cleared (measured) space in front of an altar. The Latin word contemplatio was used to translate the Greek word Œ∏ŒµœâœÅŒØŒ± (the≈çr√≠a). ==Greek philosophy== Contemplation was an important part of the philosophy of Plato; Plato thought that through contemplation, the soul may ascend to knowledge of the Form of the Good or other divine Forms.Plato: Critical Assessments, Nicholas D. Smith, Routledge, 1998. Plotinus as a (neo)Platonic philosopher also expressed contemplation as the most critical of components for one to reach henosis. To Plotinus the highest contemplation was to experience the vision of God, the Monad or the One. Plotinus describes this experience in his works the Enneads. According to his student Porphyry, Plotinus stated that he had this experience of God four times.See the Life of Plotinus Plotinus wrote about his experience in Enneads 6.9. == Judaism == A number of sources have described the importance of contemplation in Jewish traditions, especially in Jewish meditation. Contemplation was central to the teaching of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, who taught that contemplating God involves recognizing moral perfection, and that one must interrupt contemplation to attend to the poor. Contemplation has also been central to the Musar movement. ==Islam== In Islamic tradition, it is said that Muhammad would go into the desert, climb a mountain known as Mount Hira, and seclude himself from the world. While on the mountain, he would contemplate life and its meaning. ==Bahai Faith== Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha wrote about contemplation and meditation in regards to reflecting on beauty, the Kingdom of God, science, and the arts. Abdu'l-Baha stated that \\"the sign of the intellect is contemplation and the sign of contemplation is silence... he cannot both speak and meditate\\".http://www.bahai.org/r/359367592 ==Christianity== A woman places rosary beads on a devotional image mounted on the wall beside her bed. The Walters Art Museum. In Eastern Christianity, contemplation (theoria) literally means to see God or to have the Vision of God. The state of beholding God, or union with God, is known as theoria. The process of Theosis which leads to that state of union with God known as theoria is practiced in the ascetic tradition of Hesychasm. Hesychasm is to reconcile the heart and the mind into one thing (see nous). Contemplation in Eastern Orthodoxy is expressed in degrees as those covered in St John Climacus' Ladder of Divine Ascent. The process of changing from the old man of sin into the newborn child of God and into our true nature as good and divine is called Theosis. This is to say that once someone is in the presence of God, deified with him, then they can begin to properly understand, and there \\"contemplate\\" God. This form of contemplation is to have and pass through an actual experience rather than a rational or reasoned understanding of theory (see Gnosis). Whereas with rational thought one uses logic to understand, one does the opposite with God (see also Apophatic theology). The anonymously authored 14th century English contemplative work The Cloud of Unknowing makes clear that its form of practice is not an act of the intellect, but a kind of transcendent ‚Äòseeing,‚Äô beyond the usual activities of the mind - ‚ÄúThe first time you practice contemplation, you'll experience a darkness, like a cloud of unknowing. You won't know what this is... this darkness and this cloud will always be between you and your God... they will always keep you from seeing him clearly by the light of understanding in your intellect and will block you from feeling Him fully in the sweetness of love in your emotions. So be sure to make your home in this darkness... We can't think our way to God... that's why I'm willing to abandon everything I know, to love the one thing I cannot think. He can be loved, but not thought.‚ÄùExcerpt from the Shambhala edition, translated by Carmen Acevedo Butcher Within Western Christianity contemplation is often related to mysticism as expressed in the works of mystical theologians such as Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross as well as the writings of Margery Kempe, Augustine Baker and Thomas Merton.\\"Contemplation\\", Catholic Encyclopedia, New Advent. Retrieved March 19, 2008. Dom Cuthbert Butler notes that contemplation was the term used in the Latin Church to refer to mysticism, and \\"'mysticism' is a quite modern word\\". Western Mysticism: Augustine, Gregory and Bernard on Contemplation and the Contemplative Life, by Dom Cuthbert Butler. Dover: Mineola, NY, 2003, p.4. ===Meditation=== In Christianity, contemplation refers to a content-free mind directed towards the awareness of God as a living reality. This corresponds, in some ways, to what in Eastern religion is called samadhi., samannaphala sutta Digha-Nikaya-2, Patanjali, Yoga Sutras Meditation, on the other hand, for many centuries in the Western Church, referred to more cognitively active exercises, such as visualizations of Biblical scenes as in the Ignatian exercises or lectio divina in which the practitioner \\"listens to the text of the Bible with the 'ear of the heart', as if he or she is in conversation with God, and God is suggesting the topics for discussion.\\" A contemporary discussion of differences between meditatio and contemplatio is available in Father Thomas Keating's book on contemplative centering prayer, Open Mind, Open Heart: The Contemplative Dimension of the Gospel (1986) . Brief descriptions of centering prayer and lectio divina are available online at http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/. In Catholic Christianity, contemplation is given importance. The Catholic Church's \\"model theologian\\", St. Thomas Aquinas wrote: \\"It is requisite for the good of the human community that there should be persons who devote themselves to the life of contemplation.\\" One of his disciples, Josef Pieper commented: \\"For it is contemplation which preserves in the midst of human society the truth which is at one and the same time useless and the yardstick of every possible use; so it is also contemplation which keeps the true end in sight, gives meaning to every practical act of life.\\"\\"Says Pope a Universal Voice for the World\\" , Carrie Gross, February 1, 2008, Zenit.org. Pope John Paul II in the Apostolic Letter \\"Rosarium Virginis Mariae\\" referred specifically to the catholic devotion of the Holy Rosary as \\"an exquisitely contemplative prayer\\" and said that \\"By its nature the recitation of the Rosary calls for a quiet rhythm and a lingering pace, helping the individual to meditate on the mysteries of the Lord's life as seen through the eyes of her who was closest to the Lord. In this way the unfathomable riches of these mysteries are disclosed.‚Äùhttp://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/en/apost_letters/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis- mariae.html According to Aquinas, the highest form of life is the contemplative which communicates the fruits of contemplation to others, since it is based on the abundance of contemplation (contemplari et contemplata aliis tradere) (ST, III, Q. 40, A. 1, Ad 2). ==See also== * Attunement * Contemplative education * Contemplative prayer * Interior life * Meditation * Miksang (contemplative photography) * Prayer of Quiet * Quietism (Christian philosophy) * Religious experience ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== *Butler, Cuthbert.

On October 1, 2004 all the former towns and villages of Minamiuwa (J≈çhen, Mish≈ç, Nishiumi, Uchiumi, and Ipponmatsu) merged to form a larger town, Ainan. Ainan is known for its fishing and agriculture industries which produce a variety of products, including bonito, red snapper, yellowtail, oysters, noble scallops, and citrus fruits mikan. The main citrus fruit is Ainan Gold Grapefruit. In addition, Kanjizaiji is located in Ainan. Kanjizaiji is a Shingon Buddhist temple and the 40th of the 88 temples on the Shikoku Pilgrimage. ==Geography and climate== A view of the Sozu River in AinanAinan is located between the mountains of southern Ehime and the Pacific Ocean, on the border with K≈çchi Prefecture. As a result, winters in Ainan are relatively mild. It's rare to see snow in most parts of the town, though flurries may be seen several times a year. The rainy season runs from June to July. The summer is hot and humid, with infrequent rain showers. Ainan offers a variety of activities. The Sozu river runs through Ainan. There is a walking path along the river. Swimming can be enjoyed upstream in the mountains. There are three hot springs with lodging; Yurari Uchiumi, next to the sea in the north, Yamaidashi Onsen, along the Sozu River in the mountains to the east and Ipponmatsu Onsen Akebono So to the south. Sasayama Mountain is the highest mountain in Ainan (1,064.4 m) which has a rare variety of azaleas blooming on its peak, best seen in late April, early May. The peninsula stretching to the west is famous for fishing and has Uwakai Underwater National Park. In the area there is a glass bottom boat and a ferry to transport tourists to Kashima Island. On the island visitors can sunbathe on the beach or swim or snorkel in the water. There is also a special guided underwater experience called Sea Walker. There is a museum which houses Shidenkai, a Japanese military aircraft that was restored after being found in the nearby sea and raised from the seabed. Near the museum there is a revolving tower stretching 107 meters into the sky. Visitors can ride to the top and see the entire area of Ainan for a small fee. Ainan's location, bordering on the inland sea, close to where it meets the Pacific Ocean, allows for local restaurants and people to get some of the freshest fish in Japan. Ainan prides itself on the delicious fresh fish and also has a special word in the dialect for its special freshness, \\"Biya-Biya.\\" ==Festivals== Men carry a mikoshi during the fall festivalA variety of festivals are celebrated in Ainan, including Ainan Tairyo Matsuri in May, Natsu Matsuri (Summer festival), Obon, and Aki Matsuri. During the Obon festival, Japan's equivalent of All Souls' Day, family members from all over Japan return to their family homes in Ainan to remember the souls of the dead. The festival is celebrated all over town, from the larger parts of Misho to the smallest villages in Nishiumi. In the evening, torches and lanterns can be seen along the seashore where the towns are gathering. Aki Matsuri (fall festival) is a major event for the local people. People gather in many places to watch children perform the Five Deer Dance, or the Karashishi dance. Adults also carry Omikoshi (large hand-carried floats) and Ushi Oni (a large cow demon float) around town. ==Travel== A train line does not pass through Ainan, although there are frequent buses through Uwajima Jidosha Bus Company which connect from Uwajima and Matsuyama. The nearest trains lines are to the north, in Uwajima, or to the south, in Sukumo. For travel to further destinations, Johen bus center offers overnight buses to Osaka and Tokyo. In addition, Ainan can be reached by route 56, which runs around the island of Shikoku and through the cities of Matsuyama and K≈çchi. Travel by car has been greatly improved with the high-speed highway which has been extended further south.

He played ten seasons in the NHL (all with the Calgary Flames) and won the Stanley Cup in 1989. He represented Canada at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a member of the national hockey team. ==Playing career== Peplinski played junior hockey for the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League (OMJHL) between 1977 and 1980. He scored 101 points in 67 games in his final season of junior. The Atlanta Flames selected him with their fourth round selection, 75th overall, at the 1979 NHL Entry Draft. Following the franchise's relocation to Canada, he made his NHL debut in 1980 and was an original member of the Calgary Flames, scoring 38 points in his rookie season. Playing his 100th career game on November 17, 1981, Peplinski scored four goals against the Winnipeg Jets as part of a career high 30-goal, 67-point season in the 1981‚Äì82 season. One of Peplinski's strengths was his durability. He missed only 24 games during his career, appearing in all 80 of the Flames' games in 1980‚Äì81, 1982‚Äì83, 1984‚Äì85 and 1986‚Äì87. He was named a tri-captain of the team, shared with Lanny McDonald and Doug Risebrough, in the 1984‚Äì85 season. For the 1988 Winter Olympics, the International Ice Hockey Federation opened the hockey tournament to all professionals. While the NHL refused to allow most of its players to participate, the Flames released Peplinski to the Canadian Olympic team. He appeared in seven games, scoring one assist for the fourth place Canadians. In the Flames' Stanley Cup championship season of 1988‚Äì89, Peplinski scored 38 points in 79 games, and appeared in 20 more games in the 1989 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Prior to the sixth game of the final against the Montreal Canadiens, head coach Terry Crisp wanted to insert McDonald, who was expected to retire following the season, into the lineup for the possible clinching game. As a result, Peplinski was scratched from the line-up and watched as the team won the championship. He came onto the ice to accept the trophy with McDonald and alternate captain Tim Hunter. Six games into the 1989‚Äì90 NHL season, Peplinski chose to retire. He left the game as the Flames' all-time leader in games played at 705. He moved to the broadcast booth, joining Hockey Night in Canada as an analyst before attempting an NHL comeback in 1994‚Äì95. His comeback lasted six games before he left the game for good. Peplinski settled in Calgary after his retirement and remains active with the team's alumni association. He organized the alumni game between the Flames and Canadiens at the 2011 Heritage Classic. Peplinski has the longest goal streak among the NHL players without scoring a power-play goal - 124, from his last power play goal on November 23, 1982 against the Washington Capitals and until his retirement. Peplinski prior to the alumni game at the 2011 Heritage Classic. ==Personal life== Upon retiring from the Flames Peplinski invested in Hartfield Chieftain Leasing, a small vehicle leasing company. Starting with 565 units, split between operations in Calgary and Edmonton, the company initially struggled. In 1998, the company was thriving and merged with his father-in-law's leasing company in the East (Leasemaster), creating a national vehicle leasing firm, Jim Peplinski Leasing Inc. Peplinski remains the Chairman of Jim Peplinski Leasing which serves small to mid-sided fleet vehicles across the country. Peplinski is also the Chairman of Properly Investment Company, a firm established to invest in entrepreneurs looking to take their business to the next level. Peplinski has been recognized on multiple occasions for his charitable contributions, particularly those supporting children. He was named the final recipient of the Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award in 1984 for his work in support of the Special Olympics and Big Brothers of Calgary. The Flames named him their recipient of the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in 1988. Peplinski is married to Catherine (n√©e Esplen), and they have four children together.

He served in the Colorado House of Representatives and was the first African American mayor of Denver, Colorado, serving from 1991 to 2003. ==Early life and career== The Webb family relocated from Chicago to the Northeast section of Denver in August 1954, where the imposing six-foot, five-inch youth became active in sports. He is a graduate of the city's Manual High School. Webb was an all-conference basketball player at Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, Colorado, in 1960. He obtained his B.A. in sociology from Colorado State College in 1964 and his M.A. in sociology from the same school, now known as the University of Northern Colorado, in 1971. He has been married to Wilma Webb since 1969, and they have four children. In 2001, Webb served on the selection committee for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence. ==Politics== Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building In 1972, Webb was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives, representing his boyhood home in northeast Denver. In 1977, Webb was selected by President Jimmy Carter to serve as regional director of the U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare. In 1981, Colorado Governor Richard Lamm appointed Webb to his cabinet as executive director of the Department of Regulatory Agencies. Webb was elected Denver city auditor in 1987, and served until 1991. Wellington Webb's 1991 bid for mayor included his \\"Sneaker Campaign\\", in which he walked door to door through a large portion of Denver, introducing himself as a relatively unknown candidate. Webb served as mayor of Denver for 12 years, from 1991 to 2003. One highlight of his years in office was the South Platte River Corridor Project, involving commercial and residential redevelopment, as well as reclamation of park land, along the South Platte River in central Denver. He was also mayor at the time of the completion of Denver International Airport, started by his predecessor, Federico Pe√±a. Mayor Webb (center), with others at a rally on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on \\"Gun Safety Day\\" organized by the left In his three terms as mayor of Denver, Webb focused on four major areas: parks and open space, public safety, economic development and children. Accomplishments during his administration include a record 40 percent decrease in crime since 1991 as unemployment dipped below 2 percent. Webb's development projects include the new Denver International Airport, a new sports stadium, expansion of the Denver Art Museum and a new African American Research Library. Webb is the former president of the National Conference Democratic Mayors, the past president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and National Conference of Black Mayors. ==Post mayoral career== He lectures frequently on civic issues and was a guest lecturer at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Webb collaborates closely with his wife, former Colorado State Representative Wilma J. Webb. Webb was mentioned in the documentary Bowling for Columbine during a speech by National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. In April 1999, shortly after the high school shootings at Columbine High School near Denver, Heston claimed that Webb had asked him not to come to Denver. Although he briefly sought the office of chairman of the Democratic National Committee in late 2004, Webb dropped out of the race in late January 2005 and endorsed fellow candidate Howard Dean, who went on to win the chairmanship. Webb was well known as the only African-American candidate for the DNC chairmanship. The Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building, completed in Fall 2002, was named in honor of Webb. It houses some forty municipal agencies and divisions from the City and County of Denver, as well as the office of the District Attorney. In February 2007, Webb published his autobiography, The Man, the Mayor and the Making of Modern Denver (Fulcrum Publishing), co-written by former Colorado journalist Cindy Brovsky. In 2008, Webb supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden as one of Colorado's presidential electors.AP: It's official: Barack Obama elected 44th president ==Notes== ==External links== * Biography by DenverGov.org - Focuses mostly on Webb's service as city auditor * The Wellington E.

The Kellogg Interchange complex is a freeway interchange in Southern California, connecting the San Bernardino (Interstate 10), Orange (State Route 57), and Chino Hills (State Route 71) freeways. The interchange is located at the boundary between the cities of San Dimas and Pomona about east of downtown Los Angeles. It is named for the nearby W. K. Kellogg Ranch, now home to Cal Poly Pomona. ==Description== The interchange comprises five freeway segments (i.e. there are five freeway 'paths' of travel into the complex). The three freeways that intersect here are I-10 (San Bernardino Freeway), SR 57 (Orange Freeway), and SR 71 (Chino Valley Freeway). though not all traffic movements are accommodated, particularly for the state freeways.SCv at CA 71 Occasionally Kellogg Hill is used to describe the interchange; however, most traffic reporters properly describe Kellogg Hill as the actual hill that the San Bernardino Freeway climbs between West Covina and the Kellogg Interchange. This hill is often backed up due to slow trucks, especially on the westbound side where there is no additional truck lane. The crest of the hill is near the Via Verde onramp in San Dimas. ==History== Until 2002, Interstate 210 connected with the Kellogg Interchange; that section of the 210 north of the interchange no longer exists as it has been resigned as State Route 57. Generally, transitioning from one freeway to another is efficient and safe because at the time of the interchange's construction over 30 years ago it was not encumbered by existing, surrounding development in the immediate vicinity.

The Bancroft Library in the center of the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, is the university's primary special-collections library. It was acquired from its founder, Hubert Howe Bancroft, in 1905, with the proviso that it retain the name Bancroft Library in perpetuity. The collection at that time consisted of 50,000 volumes of materials on the history of California and the North American West. It is the largest such collection in the world. The building the library is located in, the Doe Annex, was completed in 1950. ==Inception== The Bancroft Library's inception dates back to 1859, when William H. Knight, who was then in Bancroft's service as editor of statistical works relative to the Pacific coast, was requested to clear the shelves around Bancroft's desk to receive every book in the store having reference to this country. Looking through his stock he was agreeably surprised to find some 50 or 75 volumes. There was no fixed purpose at this time to collect a library. Noticing accidentally some old pamphlets in an antiquarian book-store, he thought to add these to his nucleus; then looked more attentively through other stores and stalls in San Francisco, Sacramento, Portland and Victoria, purchasing a copy of every book relating to his great and growing subject. During his next visit to the eastern states, without special pains or search, he secured whatever fell under his observation in second-hand stores of New York, Boston and Philadelphia. Hubert H. Bancroft, the library's founder and namesake He had collected in all not far from a 1,000 volumes and had begun to feel satisfied. \\"When, however, (he declares) I visited London and Paris, and rummaged the enormous stocks of second-hand books in the hundreds of stores of that class, my eyes began to open. ... And so it was, when the collection had reached one thousand volumes, I fancied I had them all; when it had grown to 5,000, I saw it was but begun.\\" (177) Finally, special journeys were made to all parts of Europe, as well as the Americas, in the interest of his collection. \\"And not only was every nook and corner of the world thus ramsacked, but whole libraries were purchased as opportunity offered.\\" While his vague ideas of materials for writing a history gradually assumed more definite form, Bancroft had as yet no idea of writing a history himself. As the collecting proceeded his subject enlarged, until the territory covered was the entire western part of North America from Panama to Alaska, including the Rocky Mountain region, all Central America and Mexico, or about one-twelfth of the earth's entire surface. The bibliophile reached the settled determination to make his collection as complete as it was possible to make it. Neither time, nor money, nor personal attention would be spared. Agents were appointed in all the leading book marts of the world; no book must be lost because of its high price; no opportunity was to be missed to obtain everything in existence on the subject. By buying up at auction in European cities' individual collections, and even libraries, the Bancroft Library was enriched beyond measure. In 1869, it is reported that Bancroft held, including pamphlets, about 16,000 volumes. These were lodged on the fifth floor of the Market Street building, the original home of the library having been a corner of the second story of the building on Merchant Street. Bancroft now decided to begin literary work, but the collecting went rapidly forward without interruption. Trembling for the safety of the library through fear of fire, he lent a willing ear to his nephew's proposal to absorb the fifth floor for the purposes of the manufacturing department, of which he had charge. He would erect on some convenient spot a fireproof library building. Among the places considered were Oakland, San Rafael, Sonoma, San Mateo, and Menlo Park; but after a careful canvass and consideration, he selected the well known site on Valencia Street, near its junction with Mission. The library was moved to the building October 9, 1881. There the library stood for years. ==State purchase== When the question of State purchase was taken up, the Bancroft Library was said to contain from 50,000 to 60,000 volumes of books, pamphlets, maps and manuscripts. Prof. Joseph Cummings Rowell, Librarian of the State University, after careful personal examination, estimated the number at 40,000 as a total. For many years, the collection had been offered for sale, Bancroft holding it at US$250,000, which is but a fractional part of the original cost and yet doubtless above the then market price, which Rowell estimated at about $140,000, if the complete subject index be included. In 1887, a bill was presented in the State Legislature to purchase the library for the State for $250,000, but the proposition was quickly defeated. Some years later, the University of Chicago considered buying it; naturally there was strong sentiment against permitting the Library to be removed from California and the Pacific States. In 1905, Reuben Gold Thwaites, Librarian of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, and one of the foremost book experts in America, was invited to examine the Bancroft Library, \\"with a view to ascertaining its condition and, so far as may be, its marketable value.\\" In his report, Thwaites characterized the collection of documents, manuscripts, books, pamphlets, and other materials, estimating the total value at upwards of $300,000. The report itself was published November 14, 1905, as a 20-page pamphlet. The Report of the Secretary to the Regents of the University of California, year ending June 30, 1906 noted, \\"The Bancroft Library, incomparably superior to any other existing collection as a mine of primary historical material for all western America, a collection which could not even remotely be imitated, at no matter what cost, was acquired by the University on November 24, 1905, at a cost of $250,000. Of this amount Mr. H. H. Bancroft, whose ingenuity, perseverance and skill created this collection, donated $100,000. Of the remaining $150,000. $50,000 was paid by the Regents on November 24, 1905; $50,000 is to be paid November 24, 1906, and the remaining $50,000 in November 1907.\\" On June 11. 1907, the regents of the University approved the Constitution of the Academy of Pacific Coast History, submitted by the Bancroft Library Commission, thus making the Library itself \\"the indispensable nucleus of a great research library, like that of the British Museum,\\" which has for its object \\"the promotion of the study of the political, social, commercial, and the industrial history, and the ethnology, geography, and literature of the Pacific Coast of America, and the publication of monographs, historical documents, and other historical material relating thereto. ==Later history== Herbert Eugene Bolton, founding director The university named history chairperson Herbert E. Bolton its founding director, a position he held for the library's first 22 years. In his dual capacity, he made Bancroft Library a great research center for American history in congruence with the department's rise to prominence. Until the decade of the 1960s, The Bancroft Library continued to focus exclusively on the history of the American West, particularly the borderlands of northern Mexico and the southern United States, from Florida to California, an area associated with the research interests of long-time directors Bolton (1918‚Äì1940) and George P. Hammond (1946‚Äì1966). In the 1950s and 1960s Bancroft added the University of California archives and the Regional Oral History Office, both significant to the history of California. In 1970, under new director James D. Hart (1970‚Äì1990), Bancroft's scope expanded dramatically when the University Library's Department of Rare Books and Special Collections was merged into it. These included the Tebtunis Archive of ancient papyri, excavated by an Egyptian expedition funded by Phoebe Apperson Hearst in 1899-1900 and the largest such collection in the Western Hemisphere; the papers of Mark Twain, the object of the Mark Twain Project, which since 1965 has been editing everything written by him; a large collection of medieval manuscripts, incunabula, and rare printed books from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries; and the literary manuscripts of such California writers as Ina Coolbrith (California's first poet laureate), Jack London, Ambrose Bierce, George Sterling, William Randolph Hearst, Rube Goldberg, C. S. Forester, figures associated with the Beat Generation in San Francisco, such as Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael McClure, Philip Lamantia, Philip Whalen, and William Everson (Brother Antoninus), and contemporary authors such as John Mortimer, Se√°n √ì Faol√°in, Maxine Hong Kingston and Joan Didion. From June 2005 to October 2008, the library underwent a total renovation and seismic retrofitting. Normal operations have resumed since January 20, 2009. The library's director from 1995 through June 2011 was Charles B. Faulhaber, professor of medieval Spanish literature at Berkeley. In September 2011, Elaine Tennant, a medieval and early modern specialist in the German and Scandinavian departments at the University of California, Berkeley, became the James D. Hart Director of The Bancroft Library. ==Holdings and services== Bancroft is one of the largest special collections libraries in the United States. In 2019, it holds more than 600,000 books, 55,000 linear feet of archival and manuscript collections, almost 8 million photographic prints and negatives (including the photographic morgues of the San Francisco Call- Bulletin and the San Francisco Examiner), and over 20,000 historical maps. Although the library itself is open to anyone who wishes to use it, access to some of its more valuable materials are restricted to researchers with a demonstrated need. The library website and the Online Archive of California offer access to online catalogs as well as to numerous collections in digital form. The library's Bancroft Gallery offers changing public exhibits from the library's collections, including art, photographs, documents, letters, architectural drawings, illustrations, newspaper clippings, ephemera, and oral histories. The library's publications include Bancroftiana, a newsletter published by the Friends of The Bancroft Library, and Keepsakes, a series of publications. == See also == * Pony Express bible ==References== * ==Further reading== *Exploring the Bancroft Library, co-edited by Charles Faulhaber and Stephen Vincent, Signature Books, Salt Lake City, 2006. **Complete Table of Contents (Full title: \\"Exploring the Bancroft Library: The Centennial Guide to Its Extraordinary History, Spectacular Special Collections, Research Pleasures, Its Amazing Future & How It All Works\\") ==External links== * * *Bancroft Library location *Online Archive of California *Radio interview of library director Charles Faulhaber on KPFA's Cover to Cover with Denny Smithson, March 3, 2008 *Teachinghistory.org review of Bancroft Library web resource California Heritage Collection Category:Research libraries Category:Special collections libraries Category:University and college academic libraries in the United States Category:University of California, Berkeley buildings Category:Arthur Brown Jr. buildings Category:Libraries in Alameda County, California Category:1905 establishments in California Category:Literary archives Category:Rare book libraries Category:Tourist attractions in Berkeley, California ","title":"Bancroft Library"},{"id":"1442964","text":":See Lugaid for other figures of the same name, and Lug for the god the name derives from.

The ruling's reference to \\"evolving standards of decency\\" is frequently cited in Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. ==Background== Albert Trop was a natural born citizen of the United States who, while serving as a private in the United States Army in 1944, deserted from an Army stockade in Casablanca, Morocco. The next day, he willingly surrendered to an army officer and was taken back to the base, where he was subsequently court- martialed, found guilty, and sentenced to three years at hard labor, forfeiture of pay, and a dishonorable discharge. In 1952, Trop applied for a passport, which was denied because the Nationality Act of 1940 provided that members of the armed forces of the United States who deserted would lose their citizenship. (A 1944 amendment modified the Act such that a deserter would lose his citizenship only if, on these grounds, he had been dishonorably discharged or dismissed from the military.) Trop filed suit in US federal courts seeking declaratory judgment that he was a US citizen. The US district court ruled in favor of the government, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the decision of the district court. ==Representation== * Osmond K.

It allows State Highway 87 and State Highway 73 to connect Port Arthur in Jefferson County on the southwest bank of the river. Bridge City in Orange County is on the northeast bank. Construction on the bridge began in 1936 under the guidance of the Texas State Highway Department. Due to concerns by the upstream city of Beaumont about the bridge posing a threat to ship navigation, the Rainbow Bridge was built with a main span. In addition, it has a vertical clearance of , which was intended to allow what was at the time the tallest ship in the US Navy, , passage under the bridge (however, Patoka never did). However, the height of the bridge did allow the construction of jack up offshore drilling rigs at the Bethlehem Steel Beaumont Shipyard. With seventy-two (72) rigs built, the shipyard was one of the major sources of offshore rigs built in the United States. The bridge was completed on September 8, 1938. The nearby town of Prairie View took on the name \\"Bridge City\\" in response. Initially named the Port Arthur-Orange Bridge, it received its current name in 1957.

It lies on the estuary of the River Sneem. National route N70 runs through the town. ==Origin of the place name== The Irish village name An tSnaidhm means \\"The Knot\\" in English. Several explanations of the name have been offered: *One is that a knot-like swirling is said to take place where the River Sneem meets the currents of Kenmare Bay in the estuary, just below the village. *Another notes that Sneem village comprises two squares, North and South. A bridge in the middle of the village, viewed from overhead, acts as a knot between the two squares. *A less common explanation is that Sneem is the knot in the scenic Ring of Kerry. ==History== A book, Sneem, The Knot in the Ring, recounts the area's history. In 2000, a time capsule was buried in the centre of the town, to be opened in 2100. 250px ==Politics== The village is in the South and West Kerry electoral area of Kerry County Council, and the D√°il √âireann constituency of Kerry. ==People== In March 1978, the state funeral of former President Cearbhall √ì D√°laigh (Carroll O'Daly) took place in Sneem; he had lived nearby before his death.

The title derives from Hawking's bestselling 1988 book A Brief History of Time, but whereas the book is an explanation of cosmology, the film is a biography of Hawking's life, featuring interviews with family members, colleagues, and even his childhood nanny. The music is by frequent Morris collaborator, Philip Glass. The film project originated with executive producer Gordon Freedman who brought the project to Anglia Television as a co-producer. After acquiring the property, Freedman met with director Steven Spielberg for advice on how to make the project into an important documentary film. Spielberg suggested Errol Morris as director. Freedman's production company partnered with Anglia Television and Tokyo Broadcasting. David Hickman, of Anglia, became the film's producer. ==Production== Due to the fact that Errol Morris adapts the documentary A Brief History of Time from Stephen Hawking's book A Brief History of Time: From The Big Bang to Blackholes, much of Morris's directing and editing work was dedicated to formating the fixed theoretical science about the origins of the universe alongside that of his subject, Hawking, who had quite the aversion to featuring his personal life in the film. In addition, Morris only had a few days of access to film and interview Stephen Hawking. Because of Hawking's ALS, a disease that progressively affects nerve cells within the spine and brain, Morris had to navigate around and with the tools, Hawking used to communicate, such as his computer-based communication system, which included a voicebox. Hawking's battery-powered system, sponsored and provided by Intel Corporation is seen and heard in various shots throughout the film A Brief History of Time. Morris, with his production crew that consisted of John Bailey, cinematographer, and Phillip Glass, music composer, address the many challenges and restraints that come from Hawking as a passive observer, therefore, the many stylized interview sequences, humorous graphic illustrations, as well as the hypnotic function of music is critical to the wonder and fascination that stems from this documentary. As time was of the essence during the production of this film, the interviews were shot on set stages as opposed to being shot in actual homes. ==Music== In regards to the sound, music, and score featured in the film A Brief History of Time, Morris employed Phillip Glass to create the soundtrack. ===Soundtrack=== ==Reception== A Brief History of Time received largely positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently holds a 93% rating based on 15 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a 78/100 rating based on 12 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". ==Availability== The film was released on VHS in the early 1990s, but remained unreleased via DVD and Blu-ray until 2014, when The Criterion Collection issued a release on April 15, 2014. ==References* * * A Brief History of Time from ErrolMorris.com *A Brief History of Time: Macrobiography an essay by David Sterritt at the Criterion Collection Category:1991 films Category:Films with atheism-related themes Category:1990s biographical films Category:1991 documentary films Category:Amblin Entertainment films Category:American films Category:American biographical films Category:American documentary films Category:Biographical films about mathematicians Category:British films Category:British biographical films Category:British documentary films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese biographical films Category:Japanese documentary films Category:Biographical documentary films Category:Documentary films about mathematics Category:Documentary films about science Category:Films shot at Elstree Studios Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Philip Glass Category:Films directed by Errol Morris Category:Films produced by Kathleen Kennedy Category:Films produced by Steven Spielberg Category:Films shot in Cambridgeshire Category:Films shot in Hertfordshire Category:Stephen Hawking ","title":"A Brief History of Time (film)"},{"id":"1443002","text":"Sustainable urban design and innovation: Photovoltaic ombri√®re SUDI is an autonomous and mobile station that replenishes energy for electric vehicles using solar energy.

Reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity. ==Alternative and clean power== The Tesla Roadster (2008) was the first all- electric sports car for sale and in serial production. It can completely recharge from the electrical grid in 4 to 48 hours depending on the outlet used. Principles: *Green syndicalism *Sustainability *Sustainable design *Sustainable engineering Concerns over pollution and greenhouse gases have spurred the search for sustainable alternatives to our current fuel use. For example, biogas from anaerobic digestion of plant waste can be stored to produce heat or electricity. The global reduction of greenhouse gases requires the adoption of energy conservation as well as sustainable generation. That environmental harm reduction involves global changes such as: * reducing air pollution and methane from biomass * virtually eliminating fossil fuels for vehicles, heat, and electricity, left in the ground. * widespread use of public transport, battery and fuel cell vehicles * more wind/solar/water generated electricity * reducing peak demands with carbon taxes and time of use pricing. Since fuel used by industry and transportation account for the majority of world demand, by investing in conservation and efficiency (using less fuel), pollution and greenhouse gases from these two sectors can be reduced around the globe. Advanced energy efficient electric motor (and electric generator) technology that are cost effective to encourage their application, such as variable speed generators and efficient energy use, can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere, if electricity were generated using fossil fuels.

The bass pedal keyboard was developed in the 13th century. The keys for the hands are also capable of playing very low pipe tones. ===1960s=== Rhodes Piano Bass (1960) The earliest keyboard bass instrument was the 1960 Fender Rhodes piano bass, pictured to the right. The piano bass was essentially an electric piano containing the same pitch range as the most widely-used notes on an electric bass (or the double bass), which could be used to perform bass lines. It could be placed on top of a piano or organ, or mounted on a stand. Keyboard players such as The Doors' Ray Manzarek placed his Fender Rhodes piano bass on top of his Vox Continental or Gibson G-101 organ to play bass lines. About the same time, Hohner of Germany introduced a purely electronic bass keyboard, the Basset, which had a two- octave keyboard and rudimentary controls allowing a choice of tuba or string bass sounds. The Basset was in due course replaced by the Bass 2 and, in the mid-1970s, the Bass 3. All three were transistorized; the Basset was among the earliest solid-state electronic instruments. Similar instruments were produced in Japan under the \\"Raven\\" and \\"Rheem Kee Bass\\" (sic) names. ===1970s and 1980s=== In the 1970s, a variant form of keyboard bass, bass pedals, became popular. Bass pedals are pedal keyboards operated by musicians using their feet. The guitar players or bass players of bands such as Genesis' Mike Rutherford, Yes' Chris Squire, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin during acoustic sets, The Police (bassist Sting), or Atomic Rooster (organist Vincent Crane) use the bass pedals to play bass lines. Stevie Wonder pioneered the use of synthesizer keyboard bass, notably on \\"Boogie on Reggae Woman\\". Funk, R&B;, G Rap and hiphop musicians such as George Clinton & Parliament, Funkadelic, Roger & Zapp, Dr. Dre, E-40, EPMD, and Kashif used synth bass.SynthMania: Famous Sounds During these decades the keyboard bass in its original form was still in use by some bands such as the B-52's, who used a Korg SB-100 \\"Synth- Bass\\". ===1990s and 2000s=== Novation BassStation (1993) In the 1990s and 2000s, MIDI keyboard controllers, often the smaller 25-note models, or virtual analog synths are used to play the bass lines in some pop groups. Keyboard bass instruments are a common alternative to bass guitars in rap, modern R&B;, and in electronic dance music such as house music. As well, bassists from bands such as No Doubt sometimes perform bass lines on 25-note MIDI keyboards. Jack White of The White Stripes uses a vintage Rhodes Piano Bass live, particularly on performances of \\"My Doorbell\\". During Lady Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour, keyboardist and bassist Lanar \\"Kern\\" Brantley played synth bass on the Roland GAIA and Roland V-Synth. ==References== == External links == * *Information about early keyboard basses Category:Electric and electronic keyboard instruments Category:Keyboard instruments Category:Bass (sound) ","title":"Keyboard bass"},{"id":"1443005","text":"Muppet*Vision 3D is a 3D film attraction located at Disney's Hollywood Studios. Directed by Jim Henson, the attraction consists of a pre-show which then leads into Kermit the Frog guiding park guests on a tour through Muppet Studios, while the Muppets prepare their sketch acts to demonstrate their new breakthrough in 3D film technology. The show, however, completely unravels when Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's experimental 3D sprite, Waldo, causes mayhem during the next portion of the show. The attraction‚Äîwhich opened as Jim Henson's Muppet*Vision 3D on May 16, 1991 at Disney's Hollywood Studios (then Disney- MGM Studios)‚Äîincorporates the 3D film in conjunction with in-theater 4D effects, such as Audio-Animatronics, lighting, projections, smoke, soap bubbles, and a live full-bodied performer. Muppet*Vision 3D had a subsequent incarnation which opened in Disney California Adventure on February 8, 2001 and operated at the park until November 1, 2014. Muppet*Vision 3D is the main attraction of Grand Avenue in Disney's Hollywood Studios. ==Background== The show is a 3D film featuring Jim Henson's Muppets. Due to the use of Audio- Animatronics, a live full-bodied Muppet and other similar effects, the show is sometimes referred to as \\"Muppet*Vision 4D\\" (which was used in The Walt Disney World Explorer application, displayed as \\"Jim Henson's Muppet*Vision ~~3D~~ 4D\\" with a slanted red strikethrough on \\"3D\\"). It was filmed in January of 1990 and directed by Jim Henson and written by Bill Prady. The show was one of the final Muppets projects with the involvement of Henson, as well as veteran Muppet performer Richard Hunt, and was the last time they performed their characters. Henson died in 1990, before production of the film was completed, and Hunt died in 1992. Throughout the attraction's operation at Disney California Adventure, the theater was used to present sneak peeks of Tron: Legacy, Frankenweenie, and Oz the Great and Powerful. On January 7, 2015, the theater at Disney California Adventure began operating as the Crown Jewel Theatre and presented For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration, a musical stage show based on Frozen. The attraction operated until April 17, 2016. The location was renamed to the Sunset Showcase Theater and began showing Walt Disney Studios film previews in May 2016. In April 2019, the Sunset Showcase Theater began showing Mickey's PhilharMagic. ==Attraction== === Queue === Pre-show area as it appeared at Disney California Adventure. Before guests are seated in the theater where the film is shown, they go through the queue, which winds through \\"Muppet Labs\\", home of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant Beaker. The audience passes several office doors, all featuring outlandish job descriptions and spoof movie posters featuring the Muppets, including The Bride of Froggen-Schwein, The Pigseidon Adventure, and SuperBeaker II. Guests then enter a large room filled with Muppet \\"props\\" and boxes with comical and humorous labels. Above guests' heads are sets of three television monitors, where the pre-show featuring several Muppets is shown. The audience is repeatedly reminded to take a pair of 3D glasses from several containers around the room before entering the theater, which is modeled after the theater depicted on The Muppet Show. Muppet*Vision 3D is the only Disney 3D attraction currently playing which refers to the glasses as \\"3D Glasses\\" (It's Tough to Be a Bug! utilizes \\"Bug Eyes\\", Star Tours ‚Äì The Adventures Continue refers to them as \\"Flight Glasses\\", Avatar Flight of Passage calls them \\"Flight Visors\\", Toy Story Midway Mania! calls them \\"3D Game Glasses\\", Honey, I Shrunk the Audience! referred to them as ‚ÄúSafety Goggles‚Äù, and Mickey's PhilharMagic calls them \\"Opera Glasses\\"). However, the glasses are sometimes referred to as \\"3D Safety Goggles\\", foreshadowing the \\"dangerous\\" experiments guests will be visiting. At Disney California Adventure, the queue was different in that it featured a cast member at the turnstile handing out the glasses individually and the \\"hallway\\" scene from the Disney's Hollywood Studios queue was replaced with a \\"courtyard\\" filled with various props. The queue winded around a fake \\"set\\", blending in with the rest of the Hollywood Land district. Guests also saw half of a motorbike protruding from the wall above, with a hole in the shape of Gonzo. The pre-show room there included a scrolling LED monitor known as The Official Time Clock which displayed various messages and jokes (including references to Elvis and The Mickey Mouse Club) while counting down to showtime. In the spring of 2008, the queue was replaced with an eating area for the nearby Award Weiners restaurant in order to provide more seating for it. The spoof movie posters were removed, now in their place are real movie posters promoting current and upcoming films from Walt Disney Studios. The original \\"Disaster Effects\\" storage area remained until January 2015. Constantine, the villain from Muppets Most Wanted, was added to the pre-show at beginning of March 2014 to advertise the new film. In Disney's Hollywood Studios, as of December 2016, Constantine no longer appears and the pre-show is reverted to its original 1991 form. ===Plot synopsis=== Main Theater in Disney California Adventure. The show begins with Statler and Waldorf in their usual box putting on the glasses, and heckling the audience. A penguin orchestra rises up. They tune and play a fanfare, which leads into the opening. Gonzo appears behind a door and pushes a stick labeled \\"3D\\" towards the audience. Kermit the Frog appears and welcomes the audience to Muppet*Vision 3D. He then gives the audience a tour of Muppet Studios, where many of the Muppets are preparing for segments in the show to follow the tour. Many 3D effects are performed at this point by various characters, mainly Fozzie Bear. This includes a noisemaker, a can of springs, and a flower that sprays water. Kermit then takes the audience to the Muppet's top secret laboratory where he explains that they hired scientists from all over the world to come and work there. He then says, \\"Unfortunately, none of them showed up.\\" He then introduces Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant, Beaker. The show re-introduces Waldo C. Graphic, the world's first computer-generated Muppet, (who first appeared in The Jim Henson Hour.) Waldo is \\"created\\" by Dr. Honeydew and Beaker during a demonstration of three-dimensional imagery but he proves to be uncontrollable and wreaks havoc in the lab. Dr. Honeydew tells Beaker to use the lab's inflatomatic to deactivate Waldo. He does so, but instead of being deactivated, Waldo explodes into smaller versions of himself and says that he can start his own football team. Dr. Honeydew then tells Beaker to use the lab's vacuum cleaner to suck up all the Waldos, but also accidentally sucks up the entire lab. All but one Waldo is sucked up and realizing he's free, shape shifts into a taxi cab and drives away. Kermit then reappears and apologizes for the delay since the lab was \\"sucked up\\". Fozzie returns and attempts to demonstrate his flying pie but it malfunctions and hits him in the face. Kermit then says, \\"Fozzie, that's terrible.\\" Fozzie then replies with, \\"You're right. It needs more sugar.\\" He walks away, and Kermit introduces Miss Piggy's musical rendition of \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\". Bean Bunny attempts to assist Miss Piggy by using various props to add 3d effects. These include a butterfly on a fishing rod, a bee on a fishing rod, and bubbles blown from a bubble maker. To add the realism, real soap bubbles are blown from the ceiling. Miss Piggy gets annoyed and tells him to knock it off. Bean then gives her a rope, explaining that it's for the water skiing finale. A toy boat pulls Miss Piggy into the pond and gets her wet. Sam Eagle enters the scene and sends Bean away before he ruins the film more. He leaves and meets Waldo and together, they leave the film. Gonzo sees Bean and Waldo leaving and gathers the rest of the Muppets to help him look for Bean. Sweetums (who is a live full-bodied Muppet) comes out into the audience to search for him having already done so on screen. With help from the audience, he finds Bean on the other side balcony, across from Waldorf and Statler. He explains why he ran away and agrees to stay if he can help in the finale. The Muppets decide to let Bean shoot off the fireworks. The finale begins with a toy soldier marching band playing patriotic music. During their performance, Waldo bounces on their heads and one of the tuba players gets his head stuck inside. To make matters worse, since he cannot see, he runs into people and causes them to fall down. Sam then tells Bean to shoot off the fireworks. To show off, Waldo shape shifts into a rocket and zooms around Miss Piggy, who is dressed like the Statue of Liberty, and accidentally tears her skirt off. Waldo then plummets into the penguin orchestra, causing smoke to rise. Sweetums reappears and puts out the fire with water, which infuriates the penguins and they decide to retaliate with a cannon. After Sweetums tells the audience to duck, the penguins fire their cannon and hit the projector. The Swedish Chef, who is operating the projector, then tries to destroy the now out of control Waldo, who he believes destroyed the film and is now all alone on a blank screen, by firing a gun at him. After missing several times (shooting holes in the screen, as well as the theater wall), the Swedish Chef decides to use a cannon. This causes an explosion as the theater blows up, tearing a hole in the screen, as well as \\"revealing\\" some bricks and sheetrock throughout the main theater, and revealing what's on the \\"other side\\" of the screen: guests at a Disney Park. Kermit then appears on the back of a fire engine through the hole to apologize for the delays. He then bids the audience a final farewell and the curtains close. Waldo appears one last time and shape shifts into Mickey Mouse so that nobody would recognize him. However, he shape shifts back to his true form as a vacuum sucks him up. Bean comments on what a cute ending the show was as the curtains on his balcony close. Waldorf asks Statler what he thought of the show. He asks Waldorf if they have time to go to the bathroom before the next shows starts. He replies with, \\"We can't you old fool. We're bolted to the seats.\\" Then the curtains on their balcony close and the show ends.

The theme of the series is his captors' attempts to find out why Number Six resigned from his job and his attempts to escape from the Village and learn the identity of Number One. Beyond its explicit physical setting, the Village is also viewed as an allegory for humanity and society during the Cold War era. Patrick McGoohan notes that the Village is \\"within all of us...we all live in a little Village...Your village may be different from other people's villages but we are all prisoners.\\" ==Description== The Stone Boat located in front of the Village's \\"Old People's Home\\" (in real life the Hotel Portmeirion) The location of the Village is unknown until the end of the series; clues to its whereabouts are contradictory until the final episode. In \\"Many Happy Returns\\", it is said to be on the coast of Morocco or southern Portugal, possibly an island, and is located by Number Six in this area while making reconnaissance passes in an aircraft. Prior to this, in \\"The Chimes of Big Ben\\", it is claimed to be located in the Soviet Union on the Baltic Sea (the episode states \\"in Lithuania, 30 miles from the Polish border\\"), though it is later revealed that this was a Village plot. In the alternative version of the episode \\"The Chimes of Big Ben\\", Number Six constructs a device that allows him to work out the Village's location; this scene was cut presumably to remove the reference to navigation by stars which would have allowed an estimation of the Village's general position, at the least, thereby undermining the story line of the episode (if not a key element in the entire series). This version of the episode is not considered part of the series' canon. The series final episode, \\"Fall Out\\", reveals that the Village is located in Great Britain. Number Six and other characters are able to drive from the Village to central London. Although a line of dialogue in \\"Many Happy Returns\\" has a character speculating that the Village is on an island, this is never confirmed in the series, and in fact all given locations (save for that in \\"Fall Out\\") should be considered unreliable evidence given the fact they are mentioned as part of a deception aimed at getting Number Six to reveal why he resigned from his secret British government job. Free for All The Italianate architecture of the Village is somewhat deceptive as the interiors of the buildings are frequently Georgian, 1960s 'Mod', or in a number of instances, an oddly sparse kind of 'ultra modern' design. Throughout the Village, music plays in the background, nearly all of it alternating between rousing marching band music and lullabies, periodically interrupted by public announcements (voiced by Fenella Fielding). The media and signage consistently incorporate sailing and resort themes. Exactly who operates the Village is unclear. Ostensibly, the Village is run by a democratically elected council, with a popularly elected executive officer known as \\"Number Two\\" presiding over it and the Village itself, although internal dialogue indicates that the entire process is rigged. \\"Work units\\" or \\"credits\\" serve as currency in its shops, and are kept track of with a hole-punched credit card. Although various members of the community in the Village hold down jobs or even own businesses, most, including Number Six do not seem to work, though they are nevertheless given a comfortable lifestyle. The exact size of the environs of the Village is never established on screen. Besides the main Village setting, which is known to include a hospital building, there are woods, mountains and coastal areas. The Village is large enough that one episode (\\"Living in Harmony\\") established that an entire Old West town and environs was built somewhere in the vicinity. In \\"Arrival\\", \\"Many Happy Returns\\" and other episodes, Number Six actually views the Village from the air, yet is apparently unable to spot any surrounding towns or cities. In other episodes (depending upon the camera angle), buildings can clearly be seen on the far side of the bay. Nevertheless, all maps of the Village seen in the series display little beyond the central village, indicating that it is surrounded on three sides by mountains (said mountains are seen by Number Six in \\"Many Happy Returns\\") and sea on the fourth, though the map does show a road leading off the map which may connect to the other areas, such as the Village hospital which is depicted as being in a field-like area away from the core Village (at least in some episodes like \\"Arrival\\"; in others, such as \\"Chimes of Big Ben\\", it is shown to be overlooking the central plaza of the Village). ==Identification badges== For official identification purposes, all residents and staff of the Village are assigned numbers in lieu of names, and with very few exceptions the use of proper names is forbidden. A few characters as referred to by their former military rank such as general or admiral. Numbers are reassigned as and when the current holder leaves the Village. The actual population of the Village is unknown - other than that there are some residents whose numbers are in the low triple digits (and in \\"The Schizoid Man\\" a private residence is briefly seen with the number 241) and save for Number Two, the numbering appears to have no bearing on one's authority or rank within the Village. Most identification badges are white, but occasionally black. The only character never seen wearing a number badge (other than Number Six, who refuses and is only seen wearing a badge on a couple of occasions) is the unnamed Butler who serves Number Two; his number (if he has one) is never revealed. Similarly, only one character - a woman in \\"The Schizoid Man\\" who befriends Number Six - is consistently identified by a proper name, and never by her number. ==Penny farthing logo== Many items in the Village are branded with its logo, a canopied penny-farthing bicycle (commonly referred to as an \\"Ordinary\\"). It appears on the masthead of the daily newspaper called the Tally Ho. Almost all signs and objects are labelled in the same typeface, a modified version of the font Albertus. ==Filming locations== Scenes of the Village were filmed in the grounds of Clough Williams-Ellis's Italianate Portmeirion, a resort near Penrhyndeudraeth in north Wales. Principal location shooting took place over four weeks in September 1966, with a return visit for additional, second unit- style shots for later episodes in March 1967. Sections of the resort (such as Number Six's residence interior with exterior) were sets at MGM Borehamwood Studios in England. Later episodes were shot almost entirely on the sets on MGM's sound stages and backlot and locations within easy reach of the studio at Borehamwood, (for example, in \\"It's Your Funeral\\", \\"A Change of Mind\\", \\"Living in Harmony\\", and \\"The Girl Who Was Death\\"), and by reusing Portmeirion footage from earlier episodes the production company was able to save the expense that further principal photography at Portmeirion would led to. Portmeirion had previously been used as a background in early episodes of Danger Man to show a foreign location ‚Äì the episodes were \\"View From The Villa\\", \\"Under the Lake\\", \\"The Honeymooners\\", \\"Find and Return\\", \\"The Journey Ends Halfway\\" and \\"Bury the Dead\\".The Danger Man Website ==Infrastructure== There is an extensive network of tunnels and caverns under the Village, connecting many of the public buildings, and a number of secret facilities and support services (plumbing, waste disposal, observation cameras, etc.). These are generally off-limits to all prisoners above, but they appear to be extensively utilised, given the amount of motorcycle traffic observed in them in the final episode. There appears to be a large liquid-filled underground chamber that resembles a lava lamp, probably a short distance off the coast, in which Rover - the Village's security guardian - resides when it is not being used. The normal background display of the large monitor in Number Two's office is a view of this chamber, and lava lamps are visible in virtually every public building in the Village. The Village is a self-contained society, and appears to be mostly self-sufficient as well, although no farming areas are ever seen, so it appears that food and supplies are shipped in from outside. It is sprawling enough to contain several hundred prisoners, in a comfort level similar to that of a hotel or a resort. As seen in \\"The Girl Who Was Death\\", the population includes several children, implying that some prisoners are so resigned to their fates that they have married and started families. The Village has its own daily newspaper (The Tally Ho), a cinema, a peripheral statue garden (though the statues are actually surveillance systems to prevent prisoners' escaping), a retirement home, a gymnasium, a fully equipped hospital, taxi service, a radio station (like George Orwell's telescreens in Nineteen-Eighty-Four, the receivers cannot be turned off), a television studio (used mostly for news reports and announcements), a restaurant, a music shop, several other stores, and its own graveyard. In addition, there are extensive recreation facilities. Although alcohol is officially outlawed in the Village, in one episode Number Six stumbles onto a hidden bar located in a cave on the beach, run by a single bartender and a home-made distillery that serves real alcohol. An old acquaintance he meets there informs him that the Village authorities tolerate its presence partially to mollify harder cases with alcohol, and because the proprietor is an eccentric genius who doodles groundbreaking equations when not serving customers, which the authorities periodically steal. The local economy functions on a credit chit system. The final episode also revealed that the Village conceals a missile launch facility deep underground. A taxi in the Village The exact dimensions of the Village are never explicitly defined. Although a map of the Village is shown on screen on several occasions, it only seems to show the core residential and business area of the village, which is shown as being surrounded on three sides by mountain ranges and the fourth by \\"the sea\\". The episode \\"Living in Harmony\\" reveals that the Village is large enough to house a complete western town mock-up (presumably an area ear-marked for \\"official\\" use, and therefore not shown on the Village maps). Other episodes also indicate that the Village includes an expanse of beach and seaside cliffs (with caves). The jurisdiction of the Village over water is said to extend for several miles, or otherwise the range of Rover, the Village guardian system. There is visual evidence in many episodes that the Village also includes large areas of countryside (with residences) as these are often visible in the distance in aerial shots and views looking out to sea. The small Jeep-like vehicles used as taxis in the Village are Mini Mokes. ==Authorities== The Village's penny-farthing logo Ostensibly, the Village is run by a democratically elected council, with a popularly elected executive officer known as \\"Number Two\\" presiding over it and the Village itself. Though most Village inhabitants seem to go along with this, internal dialogue indicates that the entire process is rigged: Whenever the council is seen, none of its members speak or move in any way. In actuality, the Village is a brutal dictatorship, best described by Number Six himself as \\"This farce, this 20th century Bastille that pretends to be a pocket democracy.\\" It is ruled by a revolving series of Chief Administrators designated \\"Number Two\\", some of whom return to the office after lengthy absences. They vary greatly in personality and in methodology: some of them are quite amiable, some are sadistic, and some are mere bureaucratic functionaries bordering on functional impotence. Number Two appears to be directly answerable to unseen superiors, the shadowy \\"They\\" or \\"Number One\\" pulling all the strings from behind the scenes, with direct contact via a red phone. It appears that Number Two is continually being observed by hidden cameras, and indeed one of the Number Twos confides to Number Six in \\"The Chimes of Big Ben\\", \\"I'm as much of a prisoner here as you are. We're both lifers, my boy!\\" Whether Number Two literally means that he is a captive is not known for certain; several Number Twos are shown coming and going from the Village at will, and the very first Number Two, when he receives orders regarding his replacement in \\"Arrival\\", takes it calmly with understanding (as opposed to other Number Twos such as the one in \\"A. B. and C.\\" who live in fear of such an order). However, when the Number Two of \\"Chimes of Big Ben\\" returns in \\"Once Upon a Time\\", it is made clear that it is against his will. In the final episode, \\"Fall Out\\", Number Two makes it clear that he had been kidnapped in much the same way as Number Six, but chose to quickly give in instead of fighting his captors. The episode \\"It's Your Funeral\\" suggests that most of the Number Twos encountered in the series are in fact only temporary appointments, standing in for an older Number Two who has been away from the Village for reasons not explained. This Old Number Two eventually returns, ostensibly in order to retire, but becomes the target of an assassination plot by the current \\"temporary\\" Number Two. Exactly who operates the Village is deliberately obscured. It sometimes appears to be run by Communist types, suggesting it is a holding cell for captured western agents, but at others it appears to be operating with some assistance from British Intelligence, implying that it is a holding area for western agents who have been compromised, or are feared to be untrustworthy by their own agencies. Several of the Number Twos in the course of the show appear to be unclear as to whom they are actually working for, and one explicitly says, \\"It doesn't matter 'who' Number One is. It doesn't matter which 'side' runs the Village [...] both sides are becoming identical. What in fact has been created here? An international community.\\" Another Number Two implies that both East and West are covertly operating the Village together for unknown reasons. The overall impression given by the series is that some kind of nebulous organisation is manipulating all the Cold War powers for its own ends. ==Security== Weapons, alcohol, and tools are forbidden in the Village, but there are no walls or visible barriers to prevent escape, and no apparent prison guards. Indeed, aside from Number Two functioning as warden, the Village at first appears to have no real security infrastructure. This is merely a ruse, however, as subsequent episodes reveal that many of the other people in the Village are, in fact, warders planted unobtrusively in the community and reporting back to the current Number Two. It is strongly implied that \\"They\\" (the never-revealed masters of the Village) have several plants in the Village as well, whose identities are unknown to Number Two, and who report back to \\"Them\\" directly; one of the more sadistic Number Twos (seen in \\"Hammer into Anvil\\") is particularly paranoid about this possibility. An underground control room monitors closed-circuit television cameras located throughout the Village. Observers continually spy on Villagers and foil escape attempts with the aid of Rover, a large white balloon-like device that chases would-be escapees. The perimeter of the Village is surrounded by a pleasant wooded area, including one or two caves (which may or may not connect to the network of tunnels). Beyond this, Rover patrols: if anyone ventures too far from town, they will be intercepted and nudged back towards the Village. If anyone attempts to escape, Rover will capture them and they wake up in the Village hospital. Rover has also been shown to kill on two occasions; the exact cause of death is not revealed (the target is \\"enveloped\\"/suffocated; this happens to the victims in \\"Arrival\\" and \\"The Schizoid Man\\"), however, in \\"Free for All\\", Number Six is attacked in a similar manner, but survives. ==Customs== Citizens use the phrase \\"Be seeing you\\" as a farewell, accompanied by a waving gesture consisting of thumb and forefinger forming a circle over the eye, then tipped forward in a salute. This may be a reminder that in the Village you are under constant surveillance; anyone may be a warder, a stooge working for Number Two ‚Äì although a simpler theory of the salute could be that the fingers are formed into the shape of a number six. In their book, The Official Prisoner Companion, Matthew White and Jaffer Ali state that actress Norma West said that McGoohan told her the gesture was used by early Christians; it was the sign of the fish (the documentary The Prisoner Video Companion, originally released on VHS in the 1980s and later on DVD by A&E;, also makes this statement). In Danger Man and Secret Agent, John Drake uses that expression often. Most (but not all) guards wear the same style of resort clothing and numbered badges as the prisoners, and mingle seamlessly among the general population. Thus, it is nearly impossible for prisoners to determine which Villagers can be trusted and which ones cannot. ==Fate== When last seen in the final episode, \\"Fall Out\\", the residents of the Village are evacuated by helicopter after Number Six primes a missile (located within a silo beneath the Village) to launch. The episode and the series never reveal what happens to the Village or its people after Number Six finally escapes. The Village did appear again in a DC Comics mini-series based on the series published in the 1980s, which picked up the story 20 years later. In this version (published later as the graphic novel, Shattered Visage), the Village is abandoned and falls into disrepair. Number Six seemingly never left the Village, instead choosing a hermit-like existence as its Number One. This existence comes to an end when Number Two writes a book about the Village, inspiring a joint effort by American and British agents to investigate the site. However, a young woman washes ashore before their arrival, awakening to find herself dubbed Number Six. One and Six are able to establish an odd camaraderie before Two arrives, seeking to complete unfinished business. Ultimately, in this version of the story line, the Village is destroyed in a massive explosion. In reality, Portmeirion continues to be a popular tourist attraction in north-west Wales, and frequently hosts events related to celebrating the series. The building in Portmeirion shown in the series as Number Six's house was later converted into a shop selling Prisoner-related souvenirs, with a penny-farthing bicycle parked outside. ==In other media== In The Simpsons episode \\"The Computer Wore Menace Shoes\\", Homer Simpson is imprisoned in a location called \\"The Island\\" after accidentally uncovering a secret flu shot scheme. He escapes by stealing Number Six's raft (which he had spent thirty years building) and uses a spork to pop the Rover sent to capture him. Patrick McGoohan guest-starred in the episode, reprising the role of Number Six. It is revealed in this episode that the reason for Six's imprisonment was his invention of the bottomless peanut bag. In Alan Moore's crossover comic, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, The Village is stated as having been built by the Thought Police to house enemies of Big Brother. After the death of Big Brother and the collapse of the Ingsoc regime, MI5 continues to operate The Village. In the comic, The Village is specifically stated as being located in Portmeirion. In the TV series 2Point4 Children, the episode \\"Seven Dials\\" sees one of the main characters Ben played by Gary Olson wake up in the Village at a Prisoner convention, as part of an ongoing and increasingly surreal vendetta plot with rival plumber Jake Klinger, played by Roger Lloyd-Pack. In the TV series The Invisible Man (2000), the episode \\"A Sense of Community\\" featured a village called \\"The Community\\" where troublesome spies were forced to 'retire' to. The Village is recreated in the late-1970s Edu-Ware computer game, The Prisoner and its sequel, Prisoner 2. In both games, however, the location is renamed \\"The Island\\". In the 2009 remake, the Village is located in the middle of a desert, instead of by the sea, though it was later revealed that this version of The Village does not exist in reality, only in a virtual reality computer environment. The area that was used for filming was Swakopmund, Namibia.The Prisoner ‚Äì Download Posters and Comic, Watch Preview Footage! ‚Äì AMC Iron Maiden wrote a song that appeared on their 1982 release of The Number of the Beast called \\"The Prisoner\\". The group later wrote a second composition that appeared on the Powerslave album called \\"Back in The Village\\". In the second volume of the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series, Xavier Maum√©jean's short story \\"Be Seeing You!\\" describes the origin of The Village. It was established in 1912 by Winston Churchill, the original Number 1, to interrogate his enemies, including Sherlock Holmes. In the science fiction TV series Babylon 5, the culture of the Psi Corps organization pays homage to aspects of The Prisoner, including a modified salute and use of the phrase \\"Be seeing you\\". ==References== ==Further reading== *Britton, Piers D.

Throughout its turbulent history, it defended western approaches to Moscow. Population: 44,000 (1970). ==Medieval history and monuments== Vyazma was first mentioned in a chronicle under the year of 1230, although it is believed to be much older than that. The town was named after the river, whose name was from Russian word \\"\\" (vyaz'), meaning \\"bog\\" or \\"swamp\\".–ï. –ú. –ü–æ—Å–ø–µ–ª–æ–≤. \\"–ì–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –º–∏—Ä–∞\\". –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, 1998, —Å—Ç—Ä. 108. At the time, the town belonged to a lateral branch of the Rurikid House of Smolensk, and carried on a lively trade with Narva on the Gulf of Finland. In 1403, the local princes were expelled by Lithuanians to Moscow, where they took the name of Princes Vyazemsky. The most notable among them were Pyotr Vyazemsky, an intimate friend of the poet Alexander Pushkin and a poet himself, and Sophie Viazemski, a French writer, for a time married to Jean-Luc Godard. In 1494, Vyazma was captured by the Grand Duchy of Moscow and turned into a fortress, of which but a single tower remains. Two important abbeys were embellished with stone churches, including a rare three-tented church dedicated to Our Lady of Smolensk (Hodegetria) and consecrated in 1638 after Polish occupation between 1611 and 1634. A barbican church of the same abbey dates back to 1656, and the town's cathedral was completed by 1676. Other churches are designed mostly in baroque style. Spasskaya tower is the only tower left of the medieval Vyazma Kremlin. Hodegetria church is one of three major three-tented churches in the world, the other two being in Uglich and Moscow. ==Battles of Vyazma== Vyazma monument commemorating the Russian victory over Napoleon. An illustration by Leonid Pasternak for War and Peace, showing Napoleon near Vyazma During the French invasion of Russia in 1812, there was a battle between the retreating French army (up to 37,000 troops) and the Russian army (25,000 men) near Vyazma on October 22, 1812. The vanguard of the Russian army under the command of Lieutenant General Mikhail Miloradovich and a Cossack unit of General Matvey Platov attacked the rearguard corps of Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout east of Vyazma and cut off his retreat. Owing to the intervention of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais and J√≥zef Poniatowski, Davout managed to break through the Russian army's encirclement. However, the French army's attempts to hold the heights near Vyazma and the town itself were unsuccessful. By the evening of October 22, Russians seized Vyazma, which had been set on fire by the French. The French lost 6,000 men during the battle; 2,500 soldiers were taken prisoners. The Russians lost around 2,000 men. In 1941, during World War II, Vyazma was the scene of a battle of encirclement. The Soviet 16th, 19th, 20th and 24th armies were surrounded West of the town by the Third and Fourth Panzer Armies. Vyazma was occupied by German forces between 7 October 1941 and 12 March 1943. In October 1941, 11 Jews were shot in the town and two were hanged. In December 1941, 117 Jews were killed in a mass execution perpetrated by the Einsatzgruppe B.http://www.yahadmap.org/#village/vyazma-smolensk-russia.546 The town was heavily damaged in the fighting, then rebuilt after the war. U.S. journalist Quentin Reynolds, of Collier's Weekly, visited Vyazma shortly after the German withdrawal in 1943 and gave an account of the destruction in his book The Curtain Rises (1944), in which he stated that the town's population was reduced from 60,000 to 716, with only three buildings remaining. The Nazis also established two concentration camps in the town, Dulag 184 and Dulag 230. About 80,000 people died there and were buried in mass graves. The victims included Jews, political officers, and POWs. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Vyazma serves as the administrative center of Vyazemsky District.Resolution #261 As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Vyazemsky District as Vyazemskoye Urban Settlement. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Vyazemsky Municipal District.Law #130-z ==Economy== The town's main industries are engineering, leather working, graphite products, and flax textiles. ===Transportation=== Esh 4290 0-10-0 steam locomotive outside the Vyazma railway station. Vyazma is a major railway junction, with connecting trains from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kaluga, and Bryansk. It is also located near the main M1 Highway between Moscow and Minsk. The town is served by the Vyazma Airport. ==Education== In terms of education Vyazma has branches of the Moscow State Industrial University, the Smolensk Humanitarian University, the International Academy of Tourism (WF RMAT), and the Moscow State University of Technology and Management, as well as the Vyazemsky Polytechnic College. ==Sports== The town association football club, FK Vyazma, plays in the Amateur football league.

In the first, Edwardian Supersize Me ( BBC Four, 2007), the two spent a week on the diet of a wealthy Edwardian (i.e. pre-WWI) couple. The second series (The Supersizers Go...) broadcast in May 2008 on BBC Two. The 2009 series, The Supersizers Eat..., covered the cuisine of the 1980s, the 1950s, 1920s, the French Revolution, Medieval culture, and ancient Rome.

A second series aired in 2018. ==Radio== Since July 2020, Coren has presented a weekly programme on Times Radio, on Friday afternoons. ==Controversies== ===Leaked e-mail to subeditors=== On 23 July 2008, The Guardian media blog published an email from Coren to sub-editors at The Times. Coren's internal Times email used profanity, the use of which he defends, to take issue with a colleague's removal of an indefinite article (an \\"a\\") from his piece, which he believed ruined a joke in his last line. Coren said a joke was lost in the change from \\"a nosh\\" (meaning fellatio) to \\"nosh\\"‚Äîa word derived from Yiddish meaning \\"food\\", which he doubted his editors knew better than he. The Daily Telegraph said the incident was \\"not the first time the critic has been caught out writing abusive emails to colleagues\\". The exchange was reprinted in the American magazine Harper's in October 2008. ===Polish controversy=== In his next article, on 26 July 2008, Coren said his Jewish ancestors had been persecuted by Poles. He stated that Poles used to burn Jews in synagogues for entertainment at Easter; and that Poland is in denial about its role in the Holocaust. He referred to immigrant Poles as \\"Polacks\\", arguing that \\"if England is not the land of milk and honey it appeared to them three or four years ago, then, frankly, they can clear off out of it\\". Coren's comments led to a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission, an early day motion in the UK parliament,Early day motion 2529 ‚Äì PRESS COMPLAINTS COMMISSION AND GILES COREN UK Parliament, 19 November 2008 and a critical editorial in The Economist. Coren responded: \\"I wrote in passing that the Poles remain in denial about their responsibility for the Holocaust. How gratifying, then, to see so many letters in The Times in the subsequent days from Poles denying their responsibility for the Holocaust.\\" He also told The Jewish Chronicle: \\"Fuck the Poles\\". After the Press Complaints Commission rejected their complaint because the criticism had been of a group rather than an individual, the Federation of Poles in Great Britain lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights. Professor G√°bor Halmai of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency said \\"I completely share the criticisms\\" of the piece made by The Economist. He said that amid an internal debate about an FRA response, a Cypriot colleague had said \\"it is not even certain that what Coren stated with regard to his past had taken place at all\\". Halmai responded that while the generalization used by Coren was unacceptable, it was protected under freedom of expression. The Neighbours‚Äô Fear. Anti-Semitism in Poland Before and After World War II. Fundamentum, English Edition, 5/2008. 82-87, G√°bor Halmai ===Mediawatch complaint over Twitter posting=== On 14 January 2010, Coren attracted criticism after he posted on his Twitter feed: \\"Next door have bought their 12-year-old son a drum kit. For fuck's sake! Do I kill him then burn it? Or do I fuck him, then kill him then burn it?\\" Vivienne Pattison, director of watchdog Mediawatch UK, condemned the remark as \\"very bad taste\\". Coren later posted: \\"Oh hell's bells. Look, can I just say I didn't kill the kid, or have sex with him. And anyway he's not real. And I live in Vienna.\\" ===Privacy injunction and alleged contempt of court=== On 13 May 2011, Coren attracted more controversy after joking about a privacy injunction by posting on his Twitter feed: \\"god, ANOTHER injunction tonight. another footballer. and SUCH a boring one. fucking shit midfielder... he's yet another very ugly married man who's been carrying on with a gold-digging flopsie he should have seen coming a MILE away\\". Then on 14 May he tweeted \\"Gareth Barry looks remarkably relaxed when you consider that... first touch for Gareth Barry... not according to what I've heard... time for a bet. what chance Barry to score? tiny fiver on barry to score at 22‚Äì1. wdv been nice to get a double with Giggs in the match before... Barry's been pulled off...\\". This was later deleted but was archived. On 22 May 2011, it was reported that lawyers at Schillings acting for an England footballer had persuaded the High Court judge Mr Justice Tugendhat to ask the Attorney General for England and Wales, Dominic Grieve, to consider the criminal prosecution of \\"a top journalist\\" over a matter that breached a privacy injunction. Coren acknowledged on Twitter that he could face jail for contempt of court, saying: \\"A funny fucking day. The support of twitter has been almost tear-jerking. But I am afraid there won't be room for all of us in the cell. xxx.\\" On 23 May 2011, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament John Hemming spoke in the House of Commons and used parliamentary privilege to identify Coren as the person involved, leading to an immediate rebuke from Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow.Sky News Giggs Named In Commons As Footballer Identified On Twitter In Context Of Injunctions YouTube, 23 May 2011 In an interview with The Sunday Times on 29 May 2011, Hemming stated that he considered naming both footballers in the Coren controversy, before the Speaker stopped him. Hemming commented that the Speaker was \\"probably right to do so\\", and added: \\"I couldn't be guaranteed his family didn't know, whereas Giggs' name had been chanted on the terraces.\\" According to The Daily Telegraph, the Premier League footballer identified by Coren in the tweets was not Ryan Giggs, and was known in the privacy injunction by the pseudonym TSE. The case at the High Court of Justice was TSE & ELP v News Group Newspapers Ltd, with TSE being described as \\"a married footballer\\" who had been involved in an extra-marital relationship with a woman known as ELP. Neither person had wished The Sun to publish the details of the relationship. The injunction was granted on 13 May 2011 by Mr Justice Tugendhat, who accepted claims from the footballer that publication of the details of the relationship \\"would provoke the cruel chants of supporters.\\" Tugendhat said that aspects of the case had been published on \\"various electronic media, including Twitter\\", but added: \\"the fact that these publications have occurred does not mean that there should be no injunction in this case\\". ===Fake Polish Twitter account=== In December 2018, it was discovered that Giles Coren had an alternative Twitter account that \\"he uses to accuse people critical of him of antisemitism\\". The account stated to be of a Polish plumber with a bio composed in broken English and Coren's book cover as avatar. ==Bibliography== *Coren, Giles Winkler; London: Jonathan Cape Ltd, 2005 *Coren, Giles Anger Management for Beginners: A Self-Help Course in 70 Lessons; London: Hodder & Stoughton, 2010 *Coren, Giles How to Eat Out: Lessons from a Life Lived Mostly in Restaurants; London: Hodder & Stoughton, 2012 ==References== == External links == *Giles Coren articles Times Online *Giles Coren reviews Times Online *Five Minutes With: Giles Coren Interview with BBC News, 20 December 2012.

She was sent to Canada by the Dr. Barnardo's Homes as a British Home Child, along with other orphans, to work on a farm. She remained there until she was 19 before moving back to East Ham to live with her aunt, who introduced her to Spiritualism and astrology. During that time, she found work as a nurse at Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone. At the age of 25, she married her cousin, Thomas Edwin Gill, a stockbroker. Together they had three sons; their second son Reginald, died of the Spanish flu. The following year she gave birth to a stillborn baby girl and almost died herself, contracting a serious illness that left her bedridden for several months and blind in her left eye. ==Artistic works== During her illness, in 1920, Gill ‚Äì now thirty-eight ‚Äì took a sudden and passionate interest in drawing, creating thousands of allegedly mediumistic works over the following 40 years, most done with ink in black and white. The works came in all sizes, from postcard-sized to huge sheets of fabric, some over long. She claimed to be guided by a spirit she called \\"Myrninerest\\" (my inner rest) and often signed her works in this name. As American scholar Daniel Wojcik noted, \\"like other Spiritualists, Gill did not attribute her art to her own abilities, but considered herself to be a physical vessel through which the spirit world could be expressed.\\" However, she experimented with a wide variety of media including knitting, writing, weaving, and crochet work. Extremely prolific, she was capable of completing dozens of drawings in a single night. The figure of a young woman in intricate dress appeared thousands of times in her work, and is often thought to be a representation of herself or her lost daughter, and in general female subjects dominate her work. Her drawings are characterised by geometric chequered patterns and organic ornamentation, with the blank staring eyes of female faces and their flowing clothing interweaving into the surrounding complex patterns.Outsider Art Sourcebook, ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.79 In 1922, Gill became a patient of Dr Helen Boyle after Thomas Gill contacted the Essex Voluntary Association for the Blind, concerned for his wife's mental health. Dr Boyle admitted Gill for treatment at the Lady Chichester Hospital in Hove, known for progressive and kind treatment of women, and is thought to have been encouraging about Gill's creation of art. In 1939, she exhibited one of her works at the Whitechapel Gallery. It was probably one of her largest works, measuring at 40 meters wide, covering an entire wall in the gallery. She continued to exhibit her work each year at the Whitechapel Gallery up until 1947. ==Later years== She rarely exhibited her work and never sold any pieces out of fear of angering \\"Myrninerest\\". After her first born son, Bob, died in 1958 she started drinking heavily and stopped drawing. Following her death in 1961, thousands of drawings were discovered in her home; the collection is owned by the London Borough of Newham and is in the care of the borough's Heritage and Archives Service.Newham Archives and Local Studies Library Her work has been exhibited internationally at venues including The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, USA (1992), Manor Park Museum, London (1999), The Whitechapel Gallery, London (2006), Slovak National Gallery, Bratislava (2007), Halle Saint Pierre (Mus√©e d'Art Brut & Art Singulier), Paris (2008, 2014), Kunsthalle Schirn, Frankfurt a.M. (2010), Collection de l'Art Brut, Lausanne (2005, 2007). ==Exhibitions== From 5 October 2013 to 26 January 2014, Gill's work was displayed at the Orleans house Gallery. A major trilogy of exhibitions, showing over 600 of Gill's work, many previously unseen, took place at The Nunnery Gallery in London. It opened in May 2012 and lasted until January 2013. In summer 2019 Sophie Dutton curated Myrninerest at the William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow, which included 'newly uncovered large-scale embroideries, textiles and archival objects, many of which [had] never been exhibited before. Some of her drawings are on permanent view in The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art & Natural History, whilst others are held by the London Borough of Newham Heritage Service. ==Recognition== Waltham Forest Heritage commemorative plaque at 71 High Street, Walthamstow, London E17 Madge Gill, like many outsider artists, has continually been gaining fame since her death in 1961. Her work is part of the permanent collection at the Collection de l'Art Brut in Lausanne, Switzerland, one of the central venues for the exhibition and support of outsider art. In 2013, admirer David Tibet, himself an outsider artist, published an antiquarian-style book solely devoted to her work, the first of its kind. On 8 March 2018 a blue plaque commemorating Gill was erected at 71 High Street, Walthamstow, where she was born in 1882 and lived until 1890. ==References== ==External links== *The Newham Story *Collection of Madge Gill drawings at Henry Boxer Gallery Category:Outsider artists Category:1882 births Category:1961 deaths Category:British women artists Category:Women outsider artists Category:Spiritual mediums Category:Drawing mediums Category:Draughtsmen ","title":"Madge Gill"},{"id":"1443069","text":"was a Rinzai Zen Master born in modern-day Kanagawa Prefecture who had trained with S≈çt≈ç, Rinzai and Ch'an masters of his time. Bassui was unhappy with the state of Zen practice in Japan during his time, so he set out in life with the mission of revitalizing it. The problems he saw were really two sides of the same coin. That is, he saw both too much attachment by some monks and masters to ritual and dogma as well as too much attachment by some monks and masters to freedom and informality. ==Biography== Bassui was born in 1327 in Sagami (today's Kanagawa Prefecture) during a time when Japan sat on the heels of civil war. These were the ruling years of Emperor Go-Daigo, who had begun reclaiming control of the country back from the H≈çj≈ç clan of the Kamakura shogunate. When Bassui was an infant, he was abandoned by his mother and left alone in a field. His mother had a dream during her pregnancy in which she had a premonition that her baby would be born a demon. A servant of the family retrieved the infant and raised him. Note that it is plausible his mother left him there knowing the servant would come to get him, making the ritual of abandoning the newborn a formality in which evil spirits were dispelled. At the age of seven his father died, and Bassui became tormented by questions like \\"What is a soul?\\" and \\"Who is this that hears, sees and understands?\\" These are questions he would struggle with for a good portion of his life. He would pursue this style of inquiry in meditation, one day realizing that the soul is ungraspable due to its inherent emptiness. When Bassui was twenty he undertook training at Jifukuji Temple under a Zen Master Oko. Bassui resisted ordaining as a monk just yet, and waited for another nine years before becoming one. Once a monk he would not wear a monk's robes or recite the sutras as everyone was doing. Instead, he was most interested in meditation and practiced it in such a devout way that it could almost appear to border on compulsive asceticism. Bassui related the bodhisattvas of Mahayana Buddhism to names for the nature of the mind: ==Bassui and Tokukei== At the end of his stay at Jifukuji, Bassui sought to find the hermit monk Tokukei Jisha whom he heard lived amongst the mountains. Upon first meeting each other Tokukei appeared taken aback by Bassui's appearance (a shaved head yet regular clothing). Tokukei asked Bassui why he was not wearing his robes, to which Bassui explained he had no need for them. Bassui then expressed the true purpose of his quest, about his desire to attain enlightenment for the benefit of others. This endeared Bassui to Tokukei, and the two developed a strong friendship following this initial encounter. ==Bassui's last years== Bassui left for a hermitage in Kii province but was sidetracked at Eigenji temple, where he met the Zen master/haiku poet Jakushitsu Genk≈ç. For many years after this Bassui lived in many hermitages all over Japan, where his reputation as a clear teacher spread by word of mouth. In 1378 Bassui settled for a bit in Kai province, but by now the audience coming to see him was growing so fast that it became hard to continue living his life as a hermit. So Bassui moved to Enzan, where he founded a temple called Kogakuan at which he lived and taught for the remainder of his life. Bassui never did like referring to Kogakuan as a temple or monastery, however, and would often just refer to it as a hermitage. In 1387 (at the age of 61), as Bassui was sitting in zazen meditation among his followers, he turned to them and shouted twice: He then died. ==See also== *Buddhism in Japan *List of Rinzai Buddhists *Hakuin Ekaku *Matsuo Bash≈ç *Ry≈çkan ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:Zen Buddhist monks and priests Category:Rinzai Buddhists Category:Japanese Zen Buddhists Category:1327 births Category:1387 deaths ","title":"Bassui Tokush≈ç"},{"id":"1443089","text":"Edward Walker Archer (12 December 1871 ‚Äì 1 July 1940) was an Australian politician of Queensland.Archer, Edward Walker (1871‚Äì1940) -- Australian Dictionary of Biography.

It stars Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh and Hal Holbrook. It tells the story of a strange, glowing fog that sweeps over a small coastal town in California, bringing with it the vengeful ghosts of mariners who were killed in a shipwreck there 100 years before. The Fog received mixed reviews upon release but was a hit at the box office, making over $21 million domestically on a $1.1 million budget. Since release, it has received more positive retrospective reviews and has become a cult classic. A remake of the film was made in 2005 to very negative reviews. ==Plot== As the coastal town of Antonio Bay, in Northern California is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary, paranormal activity begins occurring at midnight. Town priest Father Malone discovers his grandfather's diary at the church after a piece of masonry falls from the wall, and the journal reveals that in 1880, the six founders of Antonio Bay (including Malone's grandfather) deliberately sank a clipper ship named the Elizabeth Dane, so that its wealthy, leprosy- afflicted owner Blake would not establish a leper colony nearby. The conspirators used gold plundered from the ship to fund the town. Meanwhile, three fishermen are out at sea when a strange, glowing fog envelops their trawler. The fog brings with it the Elizabeth Dane, carrying the vengeful revenants of Blake and his crew who kill the fishermen. Meanwhile, town resident Nick Castle is driving home and picks up a young hitchhiker named Elizabeth Solley. As they drive towards town, all the truck's windows inexplicably shatter. The following morning, local radio DJ Stevie Wayne is given a piece of driftwood by her son Andy; it is inscribed with the word \\"DANE\\", and Andy says he found it on the beach. Intrigued, Stevie takes it with her to the lighthouse where she broadcasts her radio show. She sets the wood down next to a tape player that is playing, but the wood inexplicably begins to seep water, causing the tape player to short circuit. A mysterious man's voice emerges from the tape player swearing revenge, and the words \\"6 must die\\" appear on the wood before it bursts into flame. Stevie quickly extinguishes the fire, but she then sees that the wood once again reads \\"DANE\\" and the tape player begins working normally again. After locating the missing trawler, Nick and Elizabeth find the corpse of one of the fishermen, Dick Baxter, with his eyes gouged out. The other two are missing, one of whom is the husband of Kathy Williams, who is overseeing the town's centennial celebrations. While Elizabeth is alone in the autopsy room, Baxter's corpse rises from the autopsy table and approaches her, before collapsing. As Elizabeth screams, Nick and coroner Dr. Phibes rush into the room where they see the once-again lifeless corpse has carved the number 3 on the floor. That evening, as the town's celebrations begin, local weatherman Dan calls Stevie at the radio station to tell her that another fog bank has appeared and is moving towards town. As they are talking, the fog gathers outside the weather station and Dan hears a knock at the door. He answers it and is killed by the revenants as Stevie listens in horror. As Stevie proceeds with her radio show, the fog starts moving inland, disrupting the town's telephone and power lines. Using a backup generator, Stevie begs her listeners to go to her house and save her son when she sees the fog closing in from her lighthouse vantage point. As the fog envelops Stevie's house, the revenants kill her son's babysitter, Mrs. Kobritz. They then pursue Andy, but Nick arrives and rescues him. Stevie advises everyone to head to the town's church. Once inside, Nick, Elizabeth, Andy, Kathy, her assistant Sandy, and Father Malone take refuge in a back room as the fog arrives outside. Inside the room, they locate a gold cross in the wall cavity which is made from the stolen gold. As the revenants begin their attack, Malone takes the gold cross out into the chapel. Knowing that they have returned to take six lives in lieu of the six original conspirators who led them to their deaths, Malone offers the gold and himself to Blake to spare the others. At the lighthouse, more revenants attack Stevie, trapping her on the roof. Inside the church, Blake seizes the gold cross, which begins to glow. Nick pulls Malone away from the cross seconds before it disappears in a blinding flash of light along with Blake and his crew. The revenants at the lighthouse also disappear, and the fog vanishes. Stevie gets down from the roof and makes it back to safety. After Elizabeth, Nick, Andy, Kathy and Sandy leave the church, the fog reappears inside the church along with the revenants, and Blake decapitates Malone as the screen cuts to black. ==Cast== * Adrienne Barbeau as Stevie Wayne * Tom Atkins as Nick Castle * Jamie Lee Curtis as Elizabeth Solley * Hal Holbrook as Father Malone * Janet Leigh as Kathy Williams * Nancy Loomis as Sandy Fadel * Ty Mitchell as Andy Wayne * Charles Cyphers as Dan O'Bannon * James Canning as Dick Baxter * John Houseman as Mr. Machen * John F. Goff as Al Williams * George Buck Flower as Tommy Wallace * Regina Waldon as Mrs. Kobritz * Darwin Joston as Dr. Phibes * Rob Bottin as Blake * John Carpenter as Bennett (uncredited) ==Production== ===Development=== Point Reyes Lighthouse, where many of Adrienne Barbeau's scenes were shot John Carpenter stated that the inspiration for the story was partly drawn from the British film The Trollenberg Terror (1958), which dealt with monsters hiding in the clouds. He has also said that he was inspired by a visit to Stonehenge with his co-writer/producer (and then-girlfriend), Debra Hill. While in England promoting Assault on Precinct 13, Carpenter and Hill visited the site in the late afternoon one day and saw an eerie fog in the distance. In the DVD audio commentary for the film, Carpenter noted that the story of the deliberate wreckage of a ship and its subsequent plundering was based on an actual event that took place in the 19th century near Goleta, California (this event was portrayed more directly in the 1975 Tom Laughlin film, The Master Gunfighter). The premise also bears strong resemblances to Massimo Pupillo's 1965 Terror-Creatures from the Grave as well as the John Greenleaf Whittier poem The Wreck of the Palatine which appeared in The Atlantic Monthly in 1867, about the wreck of the ship Princess Augusta in 1738, at Block Island, within Rhode Island. The Fog was part of a two-picture deal with AVCO-Embassy, along with Escape from New York (1981), and was shot on a reported budget of $1 million. Although this was essentially a low-budget independent film, Carpenter chose to shoot in the anamorphic 2.35:1 format, preventing it from looking like a low-budget horror film. Filming took place from April to May 1979 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California (interior scenes) and on location at Point Reyes, California; Bolinas, California; Inverness, California; and the Episcopal Church of the Ascension in Sierra Madre, California. After viewing a rough cut of the film, Carpenter was dissatisfied with the results. Recalling the experience, Carpenter commented \\"It was terrible. I had a movie that didn't work, and I knew it in my heart\\". Carpenter subsequently added the prologue with Mr. Machen (John Houseman) telling ghost stories to fascinated children by a campfire (Houseman played a similar role in the opening of the 1981 film Ghost Story). Carpenter added several other new scenes and re-shot others in order to make the film more comprehensible, more frightening, and gorier. Carpenter and Debra Hill have said the necessity of a re-shoot became especially clear to them after they realized that The Fog would have to compete with horror films that had high gore content. Approximately one-third of the finished film is the newer footage, increasing the film's budget slightly to $1.1 million. ===Casting=== Cast as the female lead was Adrienne Barbeau, Carpenter's wife, who had appeared in Carpenter's TV movie Someone's Watching Me! in 1978. This was her first feature film. Barbeau also appeared in Carpenter's next film, Escape from New York (1981). Tom Atkins, a friend of Barbeau's, was cast as Nick Castle. The Fog was Atkins' first appearance in a Carpenter film, and he also appeared in Carpenter's next film, Escape from New York (1981) as well as Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), which was produced and scored by Carpenter. Jamie Lee Curtis, who was the main star of Carpenter's 1978 hit Halloween, appeared as Elizabeth. Commenting on the role and on appearing in another of Carpenter's films, she said \\"That's what I love about John. He's letting me explore different aspects of myself. I'm spoiled rotten now. My next director is going to be almost a letdown\\".Scanlon, Paul. The Fog': A Spook Ride on Film\\", Rolling Stone, June 28, 1979. Reprinted at TheOfficialJohnCarpenter.com. Retrieved November 17, 2007. This was the first collaboration between Carpenter and character actor George Buck Flower, who would go on to appear in four more films directed by Carpenter. Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau and Tom Atkins went on to appear in the horror film Creepshow in 1982. ===Character names and other references=== Besides the fact that many of the actors in The Fog also appeared in Halloween (and other later Carpenter films), several characters in The Fog are named after people that Carpenter had collaborated with on previous films. * Dan O'Bannon is a screenwriter who worked with Carpenter on Dark Star (1974). * Nick Castle is the actor who played Michael Myers in Halloween and co-wrote Escape from New York (1981). * Tommy Wallace has worked with Carpenter as an editor, art designer, and sound designer on several of his films in the 1970s and 1980s. * Richard Kobritz, the producer of Carpenter's 1978 TV film Someone's Watching Me! inspired the name of the character Mrs. Kobritz. Other references that are interwoven into the film include the name of the John Houseman character \\"Mr. Machen\\" (a reference to Welsh horror fantasist Arthur Machen); a radio report that mentions Arkham Reef; and the town's coroner Dr. Phibes was named after the titular character of the horror films starring Vincent Price from the early 1970s. ==Music== ==Release and reception== In addition to the final $1.1 million production budget, Avco Embassy spent over $3 million solely on advertising which included TV spots, radio spots, print ads, and even the placement of fog machines (costing ¬£350 each) in the lobbies of selected theaters where the film was showing. A further undisclosed amount was spent on 600 prints of the film, 540 of which were distributed to American cinemas. Originally, the film was set for release during the 1979 Christmas season, but Avco Embassy president Bob Rehme opted to wait until February 1980 when there would be less major box office competition from other films and more theater screens available. The film had a staggered release in various cities beginning February 1st before expanding to further locations later that month. ===Box office=== The film made $21.3 million in the United States and Canada. ===Critical response=== The film initially received mixed reviews when it was released. In the years since its release, later reviews were more positive regarding the film. It later came to be considered, as Carpenter opined regarding his creation, \\"a minor horror classic\\" though he also stated it was not his favorite film due to re-shoots and low production values.Audio commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill in The Fog, 2002 special edition DVD. This is one of the reasons he agreed to the 2005 remake. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 74% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.55/10 based on 65 reviews. The consensus reads, \\"A well- crafted return to horror for genre giant John Carpenter, The Fog rolls in and wraps viewers in suitably slow-building chills.\\" In his 1980 review, Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, commenting, \\"This isn't a great movie but it does show great promise from Carpenter\\". In a 2002 review (for the DVD release of the film), Slant Magazine reviewer Ed Gonzalez gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and stated that \\"Carpenter's use of 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen is beyond legendary and his compositions evoke a town that may as well be the last remaining one on the face of the earth.\\" Chris Justice at Classic-Horror.com commented \\"The music is also classic Carpenter, and although the composer actually scrapped his original score and rewrote it to better match the film's vibe, viewers benefit greatly from his acute sense of rhythm, composition, and tone. His stark notes add another layer of complexity to a film that too often is forgotten. The editing is also brilliant; at 89 minutes, the film packs quite a punch and is worth every second.\\" Zombiemania: 80 Movies to Die For author Arnold T. Blumberg wrote that the film was \\"a very effective small scale chiller\\" and \\"an attempt to capture the essence of a typical spooky American folktale while simultaneously paying homage to the EC Comics of the 1950s and the then very recent Italian zombie influx.\\" Slam Adams at House of Geekery commented \\"The Fog is an incredibly atmospheric horror flick that takes the technical expertise of Halloween and adds more obvious supernatural elements. Carpenter picks and chooses what to show and what not to show, opting that more is less. It is impressive the way they seem to have complete control over the actual fog giving it an other-worldly, sentient feel.\\" In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll of over 100 authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. The Fog placed at number 77 on their top 100 list. ==Novelization== A novelization of the movie, written by Dennis Etchison, was published by Bantam Books in January 1980. The novel clarifies the implication in the film that the six who must die were not random but in fact descendants of the six original conspirators. ==Home media== The film has been released on various home video formats since the early 1980s, including VHS and Laserdisc. It was released on DVD in 2002, complete with extra features including two documentaries and an audio commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, as well as trailers and galleries. Another Special Edition Dual disc DVD was released in Europe in 2004 with the same features of the 2002 release. Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray in 2013, which included the previous extra features as well as a new audio commentary by actors Adrienne Barbeau and Tom Atkins and production designer Tommy Lee Wallace, a new interview with Jamie Lee Curtis, and an episode of Horror's Hallowed Grounds which revisits the film's locations. ==Remake== In 2005, the film was remade under the direction of Rupert Wainwright with a screenplay by Cooper Layne and starring Tom Welling and Maggie Grace. Though based on Carpenter and Hill's original screenplay, the remake was made more in the vein of a \\"teen horror film\\" and given a PG-13 rating (the original film was rated R). Green-lit by Revolution Studios with just eighteen pages of script written, the film was almost universally panned for its poor script and acting and has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 4%. ==See also== *List of ghost films ==References* * \\"The Wreck of the Palatine\\", poem by John Greenleaf Whittier of 1867 * Review of The Fog at Love Horror, a horror film review website Category:1980 films Category:1980 horror films Category:1980s ghost films Category:1980s horror thriller films Category:1980 independent films Category:1980s mystery films Category:American independent films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American ghost films Category:American mystery films Category:Embassy Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by John Carpenter Category:American films about revenge Category:Films set in California Category:Films shot in California Category:Films scored by John Carpenter Category:American zombie films Category:American films Category:Films with screenplays by John Carpenter Category:Films with screenplays by Debra Hill Category:Films produced by Debra Hill Category:StudioCanal films ","title":"The Fog"},{"id":"1443102","text":"Vashti Bunyan (born Jennifer Vashti Bunyan in 1945) is an English singer- songwriter. Bunyan released her debut album, Just Another Diamond Day, in 1970. The album sold very few copies and Bunyan, discouraged, abandoned her musical career. By 2000, her album had acquired a cult following; it was re- released and Bunyan recorded more songs, initiating the second phase of her musical career after a gap of thirty years. She subsequently released two albums: Lookaftering in 2005, and Heartleap in 2014. ==Early life and education== Vashti Bunyan was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1945 to John Bunyan and Helen Webber, and moved to London at six months old. Although she has been said to be descended from The Pilgrim's Progress author John Bunyan,Richard Harrington, \\"Vashti Bunyan's 'Day' Has Come Again\\" The Washington Post 9 February 2007 this is a claim she has herself denied. In the early 1960s, she studied at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at Oxford University, but was expelled for focusing on music instead of art. ==Musical career== ===1960s=== At age 18, she travelled to New York and discovered the music of Bob Dylan through his The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan album and decided to become a full-time musician. Returning to London, she was discovered by The Rolling Stones' manager Andrew Loog Oldham. In June 1965, under his direction, she released her first single, \\"Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind\\", penned by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Released using simply the name Vashti, it was backed with her own song \\"I Want to Be Alone\\". This single and her follow-up \\"Train Song\\", released on Columbia in May 1966, produced by Canadian Peter Snell, received little attention. The only other release of this time was her distinctive vocal on \\"The Coldest Night of the Year\\" by Twice as Much which eventually turned up on their second and final LP, That's All, by Oldham's Immediate Records in 1968. After recording additional songs for Immediate Records, which remain unreleased, and making a brief appearance in the 1967 documentary Tonite Let's All Make Love in London, with her song \\"Winter Is Blue\\", she decided to travel with her then boyfriend Robert Lewis by horse and cart to the Hebrides to join a commune planned by a friend, fellow singer/songwriter Donovan (\\"...from South London up to the Hebrides. Initially to Skye but we carried on to the Outer Hebrides.\\"). During the trip she began writing the songs which eventually became her first album, Just Another Diamond Day. At Christmas 1968, during a break from her trip, she met Joe Boyd through a friend and he offered to record an album of her travelling songs for his Witchseason Productions. A year later Vashti returned to London and recorded her first LP with assistance from Simon Nicol and Dave Swarbrick of Fairport Convention, Robin Williamson of The Incredible String Band and string arranger Robert Kirby. The album appeared on Philips Records to warm reviews in December 1970, but struggled to find an audience. Disappointed, she left the music industry and moved to The Incredible String Band's Glen Row cottages, then Ireland, and back to Scotland. Much of the ensuing 30 years were spent raising her three children. In this time, entirely unknown to her, the original album slowly became one of the most sought-after records of its time. It has sold online on Discogs for as much as US$3,946. ===2000-present time=== In 2000, Just Another Diamond Day was re-released on CD (with bonus tracks), assuring her influence over a new generation of folk artists such as Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom. In 2001, Banhart wrote to her asking for her advice, beginning her connection with many of the contemporary performers who cite her work. In 2002, she was invited by Piano Magic musician Glen Johnson to sing guest vocals on his song \\"Crown of the Lost\\", her first recording in over 30 years. Since then, she has appeared on releases by Devendra Banhart and Animal Collective. In 2005, she recorded and released her second album, Lookaftering on Fat Cat Records, some 35 years after her first. The album was produced by composer Max Richter and featured many of her contemporary followers including Banhart, Joanna Newsom, Adem, Kevin Barker of Currituck Co, Otto Hauser of Espers and Adam Pierce of Mice Parade. It was well received by critics and fans alike. Bunyan performing at the Summer Sundae festival in Leicester in 2006 During the autumn of 2006, Bunyan assembled an ad hoc band and embarked on a brief North American tour, with performances in both Canada and the US. She performed songs from both of her solo albums, as well as some of the rare material from the unreleased Oldham sessions. Her music reached a much wider audience when \\"Just Another Diamond Day\\" was covered and used in a TV advert for T-Mobile. \\"Train Song\\" gained her further attention when it was used in 2008 by Reebok for an ad for the NFL, in 2014 as part of the soundtrack for the TV series True Detective, as well as in 2015 as the opening credits song for the Amazon Original Series Patriot. In 2007, she collaborated with novelist Rodge Glass on the song \\"The Fire\\" for the compilation album Ballads of the Book which was devised to combine Scottish writers with Scottish singers (Bunyan lives in Edinburgh). Bunyan also provided vocals on three songs for former Jack frontman Anthony Reynolds' debut solo album British Ballads. Bunyan sang with Reynolds on the songs \\"Country Girl\\", \\"Just So You Know\\" and \\"Song of Leaving\\". In October 2007 a compilation album of her mid-1960s singles and unreleased demos was released entitled Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind - Singles and Demos 1964 to 1967. In January 2008, Vashti said she was in the process of recording a new album: \\"I'm supposed to be writing just now. I have one complete song and a whole lot of fragments. I'm supposed to have them finished by May and there's no way.\\"Tobias Khan, \\"Vashti Bunyan: The Past and Future Collide\\" Tiny Mix Tapes 8 February 2008 In June 2008, Vashti appeared at London's Royal Festival Hall with The Heritage Orchestra as part of Massive Attack's Meltdown, in a live performance of Vangelis' Blade Runner soundtrack, singing \\"Rachel's Song\\" as sung by Mary Hopkin on the original recorded soundtrack.Ally Carnwath, \\"Massive chill melts into warm Vangelis\\" The Observer 22 June 2008 In October 2008, a feature documentary about her Vashti Bunyan: From Here To Before, directed by Kieran Evans, had its world premieres at the Times BFI London Film Festival. It retraces Bunyan's journey across the British Isles and sets it against the backdrop of her first high-profile London concert. It uses her trip through Britain as its main narrative structure. The album provides the soundtrack to that journey, just as it did the first time. In 2011 Bunyan's cover of the late John Martyn's \\"Head and Heart\\" appeared on the tribute album, Johnny Boy Would Love This...A Tribute to John Martyn. In June 2014, Bunyan announced her third and final album, Heartleap. She wrote, \\"The whole point of the album was finally to learn a way that would enable me to record the music that is in my head, by myself. I neither read nor write music, nor can I play piano with more than one hand at a time, but I have loved being able to work it all out for myself and make it sound the way I wanted. I've built these songs over years. The album wouldn't have happened any other way.\\" Heartleap was released on 7 October in the U.S. via DiCristina and 6 October in the UK via FatCat Records. The cover artwork was by Bunyan's daughter, Whyn Lewis, who also did the artwork for Lookaftering. ==Reception== In 2008, Bunyan has been labelled \\"the Godmother of Freak Folk\\" for her role in inspiring the \\"new generation of folk experimentalists including Devendra Banhart and Adem\\". Her music has also been categorized as folk, psychedelic folk, or new folk. Despite these classifications, she has stated multiple times she is not a folk singer: \\"[...] I find it quite hard to read myself described as a folk singer, because I‚Äôm not.\\" https://www.mookychick.co.uk/reviews/music/interview-vashti- bunyan.php; Her former producer Joe Boyd also underlines this in the 2008 Kieran Evans' film \\"From Here to Before\\", explaining how he never considered Vashti to be \\"[...]much of a folkie\\" ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Just Another Diamond Day (Philips 1970) *Lookaftering (Fat Cat Records 2005) *Heartleap (Fat Cat Records 2014) ===Compilations=== *Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind ‚Äì Singles and Demos 1964 to 1967 (Fat Cat Records/Spinney Records 2007) ===Singles=== *\\"Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind\\" / \\"I Want To Be Alone\\" (Decca, 1965) (as Vashti) *\\"Train Song\\" / \\"Love Song\\" (Columbia, 1966) (as Vashti) ===Compilation appearances=== *Tonite Let's All Make Love in London (1967) **\\"Winter Is Blue\\" (as Vashti) **\\"Winter Is Blue (Reprise)\\" (as Vashti) *Circus Days ‚Äì UK Psychedelic Obscurities 1966‚Äì70 Vol.1 (1990) **\\"I'd Like To Walk Around in Your Mind\\" (as Vashti) *A Pot By Any Other Name (2001) (compilation issued by Ptolemaic Terrascope magazine) **\\"17 Pink Sugar Elephants\\" (rec. 1966) (early variation of \\"Train Song\\") *Instant Karma (2002) **\\"Winter Is Blue\\" (as Vashti) (combined version of song from Tonite Let's All Make Love in London) *Folk Rock and Faithfull: Dream Babes Vol. 5 (2004) **\\"Train Song\\" (rec. 1966) (as Vashti) **\\"Love Song\\" (rec. 1966) (as Vashti) *The Golden Apples of the Sun (2004) **\\"Rejoicing in the Hands\\" (with Devendra Banhart) *The Enlightened Family: A Collection Of Lost Songs (2005) **\\"Song of a Wishwanderer\\" (rec. 1968) *Not Alone (2006) **\\"Same But Different\\" *Ballads of the Book (2007) **\\"The Fire\\" (lyrics by Rodge Glass) *Gather in the Mushrooms ‚Äì The British Acid-Folk Underground 1968 ‚Äì 1974 (2004) **\\"Winter Is Blue\\" *Johnny Boy Would Love This...A Tribute to John Martyn (2011) **\\"Head and Heart\\" *Way to Blue: The Songs of Nick Drake (2013) **\\"Which Will\\" ===Guest appearances=== *Twice as Much ‚Äì That's All (1970) **\\"Coldest Night of the Year\\" (rec. 1967) *Piano Magic ‚Äì Writers Without Homes (2002) **\\"Crown of the Lost\\" *Piano Magic ‚Äì Saint Marie EP (2004) **\\"Dark Ages\\" *Devendra Banhart ‚Äì Rejoicing in the Hands (2004) **\\"Rejoicing in the Hands\\" *Animal Collective ‚Äì Prospect Hummer (2005) **\\"It's You\\" **\\"Prospect Hummer\\" **\\"I Remember Learning How to Dive\\" *Vetiver ‚Äì Thing of the Past (2008) **\\"Sleep a Million Years\\" *Dudley Benson ‚Äì Forest: Songs by Hirini Melbourne (2010) **\\"Tui\\" *We/Or/Me ‚Äì The Walking Hour (2013) **\\"Time\\" *Devendra Banhart - Ma **\\"Will I See You Tonight?\\" ==In popular culture== *Her voice was heard on Saint Etienne Presents Finisterre (2005), a documentary about London featuring the music of the band Saint Etienne. *Friend, fellow folk singer and longtime fan Devendra Banhart reportedly writes her name on his arm before some concerts. *Lush covered her song \\"I'd Like To Walk Around in Your Mind\\".

The script was adapted from the 1964 novel A Mule for the Marquesa by Frank O'Rourke. The film received three Oscar nominations and an enthusiastic critical reception. ==Plot== In the later years of the Mexican Revolution, wealthy rancher J.W. Grant (Ralph Bellamy) hires four men, all experts in their respective fields, to rescue his kidnapped wife, Maria (Claudia Cardinale), from Jesus Raza (Jack Palance), a former revolutionary leader-turned-bandit. Henry \\"Rico\\" Fardan (Lee Marvin) is a weapons specialist, Bill Dolworth (Burt Lancaster) is an explosives expert, the horse wrangler is Hans Ehrengard (Robert Ryan), and Jake Sharp (Woody Strode) is a traditional Apache scout, skilled with a bow and arrow. Fardan and Dolworth both fought in the early days of the revolution, under the command of Pancho Villa, side by side with Raza and some of his band. They have a high regard for Raza as a soldier, but as cynical professionals, they have no qualms about going up against him now. After crossing the Mexican border, the team tracks the bandits to their hideout. Along the way, Dolworth rigs explosives to block an escape route. They watch while Raza's small army captures a government train carrying soldiers and executes all aboard in cold blood. Dolworth explains to Ehrengard that the men on the train were a troop of vicious torturers and killers. He describes how they destroyed a town and killed Fardan's wife. The professionals follow the captured train to the end of the line and retake it from the bandits. Some move on to the bandit camp to observe Raza and his followers ‚Äî including a female soldier, Chiquita (Marie Gomez) ‚Äî and to implement a plan to rescue Maria from the camp. Come nightfall, the professionals put their plan into action. Ehrengard stays with the train, which will be their means of escape. Dolworth uses dynamite to blow up the water tower in the camp. Sharp launches dynamite sticks strapped to his arrows to make it appear the camp is being shelled by a much larger force. Fardan knocks out the machine gun sentry on the roof of the quarters where Maria is being held. Dolworth joins Fardan at Maria's quarters, and they sneak in together to rescue Maria. Seconds later Raza also enters through another door to the warm embrace of Maria - the two are clearly lovers - leading Dolworth to conclude, \\"we've been had\\". The two knock Raza out and force Maria to come with them, but Fardan orders Dolworth not to kill Raza. Back at the train, Ehrengard has been overwhelmed by a bandit force, who lie in wait to ambush Fardan, Dolworth and Sharp upon their return. The professionals use Maria as a human shield to convince the bandits to hand the train back to them, as Raza has given strict instructions that Maria must not be harmed. First by train, then upon horseback, the professionals and Maria retreat into the mountains, pursued by Raza and his men. The professionals evade capture by lighting the fuse placed earlier, bring down the walls of a pass, blocking the bandits' path and delaying their pursuit. Maria confirms the professionals' suspicion: they have not rescued Grant's kidnapped wife but Raza's willing mistress. The two have been lovers since their youth. Maria's father wanted her to have the prestige that marriage to Grant would bring, and his wish was a command. She made the mistake of telling Grant that she loved another man‚Äîhence his hatred for Raza. Her kidnapping was, in actuality, an escape to Mexico with her true love. As Raza and his bandits pursue the retreating professionals, Dolworth fights a rearguard action to allow the other men to escape with Maria. In the battle, Raza is wounded. He and Chiquita attempt to escape, but Dolworth shoots her and captures the weakened Raza. The professionals, with Maria and Raza, reach the U.S. border and are met by Grant and his men. Grant tells Fardan that their contract has been satisfactorily concluded, even before Maria is safely handed over to him. As Maria tends the wounded Raza, Grant says to one of his men, \\"Kill him.\\" Before the man can fire, Dolworth shoots the gun out of his hand. The professionals step in to protect Maria and Raza. Fardan says, \\"We made a contract to save a lady from a nasty old kidnapper‚Äîwho turns out to be you.\\" They collect the wounded Raza, put him on a wagon and, with Maria at the reins, send both back to Mexico. The professionals follow the wagon. ==Cast== * Burt Lancaster as Bill Dolworth * Lee Marvin as Henry \\"Rico\\" Fardan * Claudia Cardinale as Mrs. Maria Grant * Robert Ryan as Hans Ehrengard * Woody Strode as Jake Sharp * Jack Palance as Jesus Raza * Ralph Bellamy as Joe Grant * Joe De Santis as Ortega * Rafael Bertrand as Fierro * Marie Gomez as Chiquita ==Production == The remains of the set for the film (Mexican hacienda), Valley of Fire State Park ===Writing=== The film was adapted for the screen by its director Richard Brooks, who based the screenplay on the novel A Mule for the Marquesa by Frank O'Rourke. ===Filming=== The movie, which was shot in Technicolor, was filmed in Death Valley, Valley of Fire and around Coachella Valley in California. ‚ô¶ Download (Downloadable PDF file) The rail scenes were filmed on Kaiser Steel's Eagle Mountain Railroad.

They were formed by ex-Sex Pistols members Steve Jones and Paul Cook after that band's demise. ==Career== The Professionals were formed in 1979 by guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook, both formerly of the Sex Pistols. In the previous year, Johnny Rotten had left the Sex Pistols, and both Cook and Jones had sung lead for the late Sex Pistols recordings \\"Silly Thing\\" and \\"Lonely Boy\\". For these recordings, Lightning Raiders bassist Andy Allan was employed as a session musician. After the Sex Pistols officially split and broke ties with manager Malcolm McLaren, this line-up was resurrected as the Professionals, and signed to Virgin Records, the same label as the Sex Pistols. In July 1980, the Professionals released their first single, \\"Just Another Dream\\", which also included a video promo. This was followed by a second single \\"1-2-3\\" in October, which reached No. 43 in the UK Singles Charts. Shortly after the second single's release, Cook and Jones had plans to debut a self-titled LP during that same year. But there were some legal problems, as Allan had no recording contract with Virgin. He sued the record company, claiming he had never been credited nor paid by them. Consequently, Virgin's compilation album Cash Cows, which featured the Professionals' track \\"Kick Down the Doors\\", was withdrawn and the album was shelved. After Allan left the band, he was replaced by ex-Subway Sect bassist Paul Myers, with Ray McVeigh also joining the band as a second guitarist. The new line-up of the Professionals later re-recorded previous material so that Allan would not be owed any further royalties. The Professionals were first managed by Dave Hill, who had managed Johnny Thunders and was managing the Pretenders. They recorded radio sessions for John Peel's Radio 1, which aired on 10 November 1980, to promote the release of \\"Join the Professionals\\" that same month. Due to difficulties in finding a producer (Mick Glossop was eventually picked), the release of the single was repeatedly delayed up to June 1981. Hill left afterwards to focus on the Pretenders, and John Curd was chosen as a replacement. They then recorded further sessions with BBC, this time for The Evening Show with Mike Read on 15 December. The group brought in producer Nigel Gray to help record their full-length album; the result was I Didn't See It Coming, released in November 1981. The album was supported by UK and U.S. tour dates, and the release of a single for the song \\"The Magnificent\\". But the band's American tour was cut short when Cook, Myers, and McVeigh were injured in a car accident. The Professionals returned to America in the spring of 1982 after a hiatus for recovery, but Jones' and Myers' drug problems further hampered the band's prospects. Later that year, \\"Join the Professionals\\" was featured in the movie Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains along with three other Cook/Jones compositions, \\"Conned Again\\", \\"La La La\\", and \\"Don't Blow It All the Way\\". ==2015 reunion== In celebration of the release of a three-disc set (The Complete Professionals) by Universal Music Group on 16 October 2015, the Professionals, with Tom Spencer filling in for Steve Jones, reunited for a concert at the 100 Club. This reunion also included a warm-up gig at the Fleece in Bristol three days prior to the main show. The band returned to the capital in June 2016 for a co-headline performance with the Rich Kids at the Islington Academy. ==New lineup, album and touring== In March 2017 the band announced via their official Facebook page that the lineup of founding member Paul Cook along with Paul Myers and Tom Spencer would be releasing the first new music under the Professionals name in 35 years. Although Steve Jones isn't officially listed as a member of this new incarnation of the group, the band confirmed it is with his full blessing and that he is featured on the album alongside other guests including Marco Pirroni and Billy Duffy. 2018 saw some UK live appearances of the band like The Rebellion and Isle of Wight festivals Chris McCormack (3 Colours Red) taking on guitar duties. Also during this year, original bass player Paul Meyers had to step aside for health reasons. Toshi JC Ogawa jumped up from the band's tech guy to bass player to amply fill his shoes. They went down a storm supporting Billy Idol on his English dates. ==Legacy== A best-of album was eventually released in 2005, containing material from their one album, four singles, and the album's-worth of demos recorded with Andy Allan. Ten years later, the compilation was expanded further with the release of The Complete Professionals, which features all of their studio tracks, alternate recordings, and radio sessions. Their song \\"Join the Professionals\\" was covered by the Epoxies. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *1980 ‚Äì The Professionals (Virgin Records) (unreleased because of a legal dispute with bassist Andy Allan over unpaid royalties, released in 1990 by Limited Edition Records, in 1997 and 2001 by Virgin Records) *1981 ‚Äì I Didn't See It Coming (Virgin Records, November 1981) (re-released on CD with bonus tracks by EMI, June 2001) *2017 - What in the World (Automaton Records, October 2017) ===Live album=== *2020 - Live In London (JTP Records, March 2020) (recorded live at Highbury Garage in London, October 2017) ===Singles=== *1980 ‚Äì \\"Just Another Dream\\" b/w \\"Action Man\\" (Virgin Records, July 1980) *1980 ‚Äì \\"1-2-3\\" b/w \\"Baby, I Don't Care\\" and \\"White Light/White Heat\\" (Virgin Records, October 1980) - UK No. 43 *1981 ‚Äì \\"Join the Professionals\\" b/w \\"Has Anybody Got an Alibi\\" (Virgin Records, June 1981) *1981 ‚Äì \\"The Magnificent\\" b/w \\"Just Another Dream\\" (Virgin Records, October 1981). ===EPs=== *2020 - \\"Kingdom Come\\"/\\"Reality\\"/\\"1, 2, 3 (TV Session)\\"/\\"Rewind (TV Session)\\" (JTP Records, January 2020) *2020 - \\"Curl Up And Cry\\"/\\"Fade Away\\"/\\"Going, Going, Gone (TV Session)\\"/\\"Kick Down The Doors (TV Session)\\" (JTP Records, February 2020) *2020 - \\"Twenty 20 Vision\\"/\\"One That Got Away\\"/\\"Join The Professionals (Live)\\"/\\"Good Man Down (TV Session)\\" (JTP Records, March 2020) ===Compilations=== *1980 ‚Äì \\"Kick Down the Doors\\" featured on the compilation Cash Cows (Virgin Records, October 1980) (Later releases omitted the song after Andy Allan's lawsuit against Virgin.) *1981 ‚Äì \\"Little Boys in Blue\\" featured on the Sounds Freebie No. 2 split single promo (Sounds magazine, October 1981) (b/w \\"I‚Äôll Rip Your Spine Out\\" by Gillan) *1981 - \\"1-2-3\\" featured on the compilation Suburban Music (Virgin Records, 1981) *1993 - \\"1-2-3\\" and \\"Join The Professionals\\" featured on the compilation After The Anarchy (Conoisseur Collection, 1993) *2001 - \\"1-2-3\\" featured on the compilation Cash From Chaos (EMI, 2001) *2002 - \\"Baby I Don't Care\\" featured on the compilation All Covered In Punk (EMI, March 2002) *2002 - \\"Join The Professionals\\" featured on the compilation 24 Carat Punk (EMI, 2002) *2005 ‚Äì The Best of The Professionals (Captain Oi!, October 2005) *2013 - \\"Baby I Don't Care\\" featured on the compilation Massive Hits!

In 1939, a week before Capone was released from Alcatraz, O'Hare was shot to death while driving. He was the father of Medal of Honor recipient Butch O'Hare, for whom O'Hare International Airport is named. ==Early life in St. Louis== Edward Joseph O'Hare, known to friends and family as E.J., was born on September 5, 1893 in St. Louis to first-generation Irish-American parents Patrick Joseph O'Hare and Cecelia Ellen Malloy O'Hare. On June 4, 1912, E.J. O'Hare married Selma Anna Lauth, a native of St. Louis, born on November 13, 1890. She traced her heritage to Germany. E.J. and Selma started their family in an apartment above Selma's father's grocery store in the Soulard neighborhood. They had three children: Edward (\\"Butch\\"), born in 1914, Patricia, born in 1919, and Marilyn, born in 1924. E.J. passed the Missouri bar exam in 1923 and joined a law firm. From 1925 O'Hare operated dog tracks in Chicago, Boston and Miami. O'Hare, as a lawyer, represented the inventor Owen P. Smith, high commissioner of the International Greyhound Racing Association, who patented a mechanical running rabbit for use in dog racing. As a result of this lucrative work for Smith, O'Hare moved his family in 1930 into a new house ‚Äî with a swimming pool and a skating rink ‚Äî in Holly Hills. During summers, the O'Hare family had escaped the St. Louis heat to river camps on the Meramec and Gasconade rivers. E.J. had given Butch a .22-caliber rifle. Plinking at cans and bottles tossed in the river, Butch became an able marksman. It was also during this time that E.J. became fascinated with flying, even hitching a ride in Charles Lindbergh's mail plane. O'Hare took his first job as lead pilot of an air mail route operated by Robertson Aircraft Co. of Lambert Field in St Louis. E.J. then flew commercially whenever possible, and he found chances for his teenage son to briefly take the controls. As a result, his son Butch, the later Medal of Honor recipient, best known for his extreme bravery as a U.S. naval aviator in World War II, became a competent marksman and familiar with planes. When Owen Patrick Smith died, O'Hare represented the administratrix of Smith's estate, Hannah M. Smith. E.J. began to expand his business interests from the St. Louis levee to Chicago. One day in the 1920s E.J. came home to find his son, Butch, sprawled on a couch reading books and eating banana layer cake and doughnuts. The father decided that his boy was showing signs of laziness and enrolled him at Western Military Academy in Alton, Illinois. ==Chicago== Divorced from his wife Selma in 1927, O'Hare moved to Chicago. Selma stayed in St. Louis with her two daughters Patricia and Marilyn, while Butch went to Western Military Academy. In Chicago, O'Hare met Al Capone, whose dominant Chicago Outfit ran Chicago rackets and bootlegging during Prohibition. O'Hare and Capone began collaborating in business and in law. O'Hare made a second fortune through his ties to Capone. O'Hare became engaged to Ursula Sue Granata, a secretary, the sister of a Mob-affiliated Illinois state representative. The engagement went on for seven years because they were Catholics, and the Church would not recognize O'Hare's divorce. Thus they could not have a church wedding. However, O'Hare was hopeful that a request for a dispensation from the Vatican would be granted by 1940. But in 1930, O'Hare turned against Capone. He asked John Rogers, a reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, to arrange a meeting with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which was trying to convict Capone of tax evasion. Rogers organized a meeting with IRS agent Frank J. Wilson. O'Hare subsequently played a key role in Capone's prosecution and conviction. Agent Wilson (also Chief of the U.S. Secret Service between 1937 and 1946) said later: > On the inside of the gang I had one of the best undercover men I have ever > known: Eddie O'Hare.\\"Collier's magazine, 26 April 1947 It is believed O'Hare directed investigator Wilson to the Capone bookkeeper who became a key witness at the 1931 trial, and also helped break the code used in the ledgers by Capone's bookkeepers. At the start of Capone's trial in the court of Judge James Wilkerson, O'Hare tipped the government that Capone had fixed the jury. Thus alerted, Judge Wilkerson switched juries with another federal trial before the Capone trial began. (This incident was depicted in the 1987 film The Untouchables.) Capone was found guilty and sent to prison in 1931. ==Assassination== Assassination of Edward O'Hare O'Hare was shot and killed on Wednesday, November 8, 1939, while driving in his car at age 46. That afternoon, when he left his office at Sportsman's Park racetrack in Cicero, Illinois, he was reportedly carrying a cleaned and oiled Spanish-made .32-caliber semi-automatic pistol, something unusual for him. O'Hare drove away from the track in his black 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr coupe. At the intersection of Ogden and Rockwell, two shotgun-wielding gunmen in a dark sedan drove alongside and fired a volley of big-game slugs. O'Hare was killed instantly. His Lincoln crashed into a roadside post, while the killers continued east on Ogden and were lost in traffic. No arrest was ever made. In 2010, Chicago alderman Ed Burke asked the Chicago Police Department Cold Case Squad to re-examine O'Hare's murder in light of a new book, Get Capone, which made allegations about the crime. ==In popular culture== *In the 2010-2014 HBO series Boardwalk Empire, the character of Mike D'Angelo played by Louis Cancelmi is based on Edward J. O'Hare. In the last season he is shown to be an undercover agent who helped gather evidence to convict Al Capone on Tax evasion. *The story of 'Easy Eddie', and his son, are mentioned in the \\"Payback\\" chapter of the novel Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror, by American author Steve Alten, published 1996. ==References== ==External links== *Interview with daughter Patricia O'Hare Palmer *Illinois Police & Sheriff's News *Urban Legends * Category:1893 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Al Capone associates Category:American mobsters of Irish descent Category:Mobsters from St. Louis Category:Mobsters from Chicago Category:Lawyers from St. Louis Category:Lawyers from Chicago Category:Prohibition-era gangsters Category:Murdered American mobsters of Irish descent Category:People murdered by the Chicago Outfit Category:People murdered in Illinois Category:Deaths by firearm in Illinois ","title":"Edward J.

Typically, the President flies in military aircraft that are under the command of the Presidential Airlift Group, which include Air Force One, Marine One, Navy One, and others. The Presidential Airlift group is part of Air Mobility Command's 89th Airlift Wing, based at Joint Base Andrews (formerly Andrews Air Force Base) near Camp Springs, Maryland in Prince George's County. On December 26, 1973, to \\"set an example for the rest of the nation during the current energy crisis\\" and to \\"demonstrate his confidence in the airlines\\", then-President Richard Nixon became the only sitting president to travel on a regularly scheduled commercial airline flight when he flew on a United Airlines DC-10 from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. A Nixon aide carried a suitcase-sized secure communication device on board the plane, so that the President could remain in contact with Washington in the event of an emergency. If the president's family members are aboard, but not the president himself, the flight can, at the discretion of the White House staff or Secret Service, use the callsign Executive One Foxtrot (EXEC1F). \\"Foxtrot\\" is the phonetic alphabet designation for the letter \\"F\\", with that being the first letter of \\"family\\". The military helicopter that normally has the call sign \\"Marine One\\" is assigned the \\"Executive One\\" call sign when it transports the outgoing president on their final flight from the Capitol, after the inauguration of their successor, as was done on January 20, 2009 for George W. Bush and on January 20, 2017 for Barack Obama.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/20/barack-obama-departs- white-house ==Executive Two== Executive Two is the call sign designated any United States civil aircraft when the Vice President of the United States is on board. Typically, however, the Vice President flies in military aircraft that are under the command of the Air Mobility Command's 89th Airlift Wing, based at Joint Base Andrews in Prince George's County, Maryland. One notable exception was when Nelson Rockefeller was named Gerald Ford's Vice President in 1974. He owned a Gulfstream airplane that he preferred to the DC-9 that was then being used as Air Force Two. Being a private plane, the Gulfstream's call sign was Executive Two when Rockefeller was on board. On February 2, 2000, a bill that would stop abortion protesters from being able to avoid paying fines by filing for bankruptcy was on the Senate agenda. Shortly before the actual vote, it became clear that there might be a tie, requiring the Vice President to cast the tie breaker. A US Airways Shuttle flight was the fastest way to get from New York City, where Vice President Al Gore was, back to the Capitol. As it turned out, his vote was not needed. If the Vice President's family members are aboard, but not the Vice President himself, the flight can optionally use the callsign Executive Two Foxtrot just like Executive One Foxtrot. ==See also== *Transportation of the President of the United States ==References== Category:Presidential aircraft Category:Transportation of the President of the United States Category:Call signs Category:Aviation in the United States ","title":"Executive One"},{"id":"1443137","text":"Richard Ira Vos (born June 30, 1957) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, and radio and podcast host with his wife, comedian Bonnie McFarlane. ==Early life== Vos grew up in Plainfield, New Jersey \\"in an all black neighborhood\\", and was raised Jewish. His parents divorced when he was young, and he did not graduate from high school. A fan of stand-up comedy since he was a child, Vos was influenced by watching it on television, particularly acts featured on The Ed Sullivan Show. ==Career== Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour in 2006 Vos began his stand-up career in 1984, choosing to pursue it full-time as he \\"failed at everything else\\", and developed his act in local clubs. In 1995, Vos became the first white comic to perform a set on Def Comedy Jam on HBO, a show usually featuring African American comedians. In July 1999, Vos hosted the Woodstock '99 festival, later calling it a highlight of his career. In 2001, Vos played the bouncer and wrote and performed skits on the British television show The People vs. Jerry Sadowitz. In 2001, Vos released a stand- up comedy album, I'm Killing Here. This was followed by the DVD Vos, consisting of an unedited, 55-minute performance recorded at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey, released in 2004. He went on to produce two half-hour specials on Comedy Central Presents. In 2003, Vos came third on the first season of Last Comic Standing on NBC. During this time he was given the nickname \\"The Don\\" by Cory Kahaney \\"because of my rough and tough demeanor ... maybe it was more because I was the most experienced comic\\". At the end of the season, Vos toured with Kahaney and Dave Mordal for eight months. In 2004, Vos was a finalist in its third season. Vos was a frequent guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show, with jokes centered at his expense, most often highlighting his speech impediment or supposed lack of intellect. In 2002, he brought comedian Patrice O'Neal onto the show who also became a popular regular guest. During the show's time on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, Vos hosted a Saturday night program with Bonnie McFarlane. He hosted the 2006 and 2007 editions of the Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour. From 2002 to 2004, Vos was a frequent guest on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn on Comedy Central. He picked the show as one of his favourites to do as he lived close to its filming location and by the fact that he could do it with his best friends. Between 2006 and 2008, Vos prepared three pilot episodes for a comedy series alongside McFarlane, but neither were picked up by a network. Vos has appeared on Premium Blend. He was featured in a segment of the television show, What Would You Do?

It charted at number one on the iTunes and Billboard release charts. == Personal life == After struggling with crack cocaine and alcohol addiction throughout his 20s, Vos completed a one-month rehabilitation course in 1987, three years into his comedy career. He has been clean since. Vos was previously in a marriage that ended in a divorce. He has two daughters with his previous wife, and remained in their lives. He moved into a home two miles away from them so he could see them more. In September 2005, Vos married comedian Bonnie McFarlane, who competed on the second season of Last Comic Standing.

The truck stop is located off a freeway and it features a diner, a gas station, and a convenience store. ==Plot summary== The story's narrator and a handful of strangers find themselves trapped together in a freeway truck stop diner after semi-trailers and other large vehicles are suddenly brought to independent life by an unknown force and proceed to gruesomely kill every human in sight. Cars, which remain unaltered, are swiftly battered into wreckage and pedestrians are massacred by rampaging trucks and buses. The six survivors hiding in the diner include the narrator, as well as an elderly counterman, a trucker, a young man named Jerry, his girlfriend, and a salesman named Snodgrass. As the story begins, the counterman and the trucker attempt to radio any other survivors, but the two-way radio fails for unknown reasons. Snodgrass, cracking under the strain, attempts to flee across the stop's parking lot and is hit by a truck. Snodgrass gets propelled into a drainage ditch, taking hours to die from internal bleeding. The situation worsens when the diner's power goes out. The counterman instructs the survivors that they will need to consume the perishable meats and collect good potable water from the restrooms. While the employee's restroom is inside the diner, the men's and ladies' room are by the outdoor gas station, and the narrator's attempt to gather fresh water from those places nearly costs him his life when the trucks realize what he is trying to do. Some time later, a glimmer of hope appears when the trucks begin to run out of gas and a few literally stand still from lack of fuel. An enormous semi-truck noses up to the diner and starts blasting its horn erratically. Jerry remembers from his time in the Boy Scouts that the horn blasts are Morse Code, and translates that the trucks are demanding humans start pumping fuel. The trucks assure they will not attack people who refuel them. The narrator is outvoted when he suggests they comply with this, and a bulldozer arrives and proceeds to attack the diner. The narrator and Jerry destroy the bulldozer with improvised Molotov cocktails, but the diner is half-destroyed and Jerry and the trucker are killed. The remaining three humans surrender and, taking turns, start pumping the gas into the mile-long string of waiting trucks. When the narrator exhausts the fuel reserve of the truck stop's gas station, a fuel tanker arrives to replenish the fuel cisterns. When the narrator is at a point of collapsing, he is relieved by the counterman, who starts pumping gas for his \\"shift\\". The narrator says that he will have to show the girl how to handle a fuel pump, and that she will do it because she wants to live. The narrator thinks to himself that perhaps this will last only until the trucks run out of fuel, rust, and fall apart, but he then has a grim vision of forced assembly lines churning out new generations of trucks, and the trucks, aided by construction vehicles and tanks, doing great efforts such as draining the Okefenokee Swamp and paving much of the wild backcountry, stamping it into a great plain. The story ends as a pair of planes fly overhead, and the narrator laments \\"I wish I could believe there are people in them\\". ==Adaptations== The story has been adapted into two films. In 1986 it was adapted for cinema with the King-directed Maximum Overdrive. In 1997 it was adapted again as the TV movie Trucks, starring Timothy Busfield, which was made on a considerably smaller budget than Maximum Overdrive but was much more faithful to the original story. ==See also== * Stephen King short fiction bibliography ==External links== * The story at HorrorKing.com * King's official sites * Category:1973 short stories Category:Horror short stories Category:Short stories adapted into films Category:Short stories by Stephen King Category:Works originally published in Cavalier (magazine) ","title":"Trucks (short story)"},{"id":"1443142","text":"D√ºlmen is a town in the district of Coesfeld, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. ==Geography== D√ºlmen is situated in the south part of the M√ºnsterland area, between the Lippe river to the south, the Baumberge hills to the north and the Ems river to the east.

British Library, Harley MS 1775 is an illuminated Gospel Book produced in Italy during the last quarter of the 6th century. The text is in Latin and is a mixture of the Vulgate and Old Latin translations. This text is called \\"source Z\\" in critical studies of the Latin New Testament. It is written in an uncial text with the running titles written in rustic capitals. The manuscript has enlarged initials and the opening lines of major text divisions are written in red. There are contemporary corrections in slanting uncial script which employ a Greek syllabification similar to that used by Victor of Capua. There are 468 vellum folios that are 177 by 120 mm. The text is written in a single column of 130 by 85 mm. Each Gospel is started on a new quire. The quires are numbered so as to aid in the assembly of the codex. The manuscript's decoration includes eighteen canon tables under architectural arcades, display capitals, and a colophon decoration. There is a nineteenth canon table that is more simply decorated. On folio 11 there are Tironian notes in a 9th-century French hand. The manuscript was owned by Cardinal Mazarin (d. 1668). In the early 18th century it was in the French Royal Library. It was stolen along with several other manuscripts in 1707 by Jean Aymon. It was purchased in Holland by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford (d. 1724). It was sold by the widow of Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and their daughter to Parliament as part of the Harley Collection which was one of the founding collections of the British Museum. == See also == * List of New Testament Latin manuscripts ==Further reading== *Brown, M.

They are named after John Olney, who conducted a study in 1989 to investigate neurotoxicity caused by PCP and related drugs. They are important for two reasons. Firstly, NMDA receptor antagonist are physician-prescribed drugs for therapeutic treatment of human diseases such as memantine for Alzheimer's disease and amantadine for Parkinson's disease, and also occur as street drugs that are taken recreationally. Secondly in the field of anesthesiology, the dissociative anesthesia of many general anesthetics is due to NMDA receptor antagonist properties. Because the neuronal vacuolation of Olney's lesions evolves into neuronal necrosis or death of neurons, it is important to determine whether Olney's lesions occur in humans, not only in experimental animals. The essential question is whether an NMDA receptor antagonist drug is to be considered a human neurotoxin or not. The patient safety implications for pharmacotherapy and for anesthesia would each be profound, if the answer is affirmative. ==History== In 1989, Olney et al. discovered that neuronal vacuolation and other cytotoxic changes (\\"lesions\\") occurred in brains of rats administered NMDA antagonists, including PCP, MK-801 (dizocilpine) and ketamine. Examination of neurons in the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices by electron microscopy revealed apparent lytic breakdown of mitochondria in the large vacuoles which had become apparent 2 hours after administration of an NMDA antagonist. After administration of 1.0 (mg/kg sc) MK-801 to rats, these neurotoxic changes became more apparent until about 12 hours post-dose, but the morphology of most cells appeared normal by light microscope about 24 hours post-dose. With 10 (mg/kg sc) doses of MK-801, the vacuolation reaction was still visible by light microscope 48 hours post-dose. After repeated doses of the NMDA antagonists MK-801 and PCP, the vacuolation reaction appeared consistent with the reaction after a single dose, so there was no evidence of a cumulative neurotoxic effect or that the reaction proceeded to an irreversible stage with repeated doses. The lowest doses of ketamine and tiletamine that produced neurotoxic changes visible by light microscope 4 hours post dose were 40 (mg/kg sc) and 10 (mg/kg sc), respectively. The potency of the drugs in producing these neurotoxic changes corresponded with their potency as NMDA antagonists: i.e. MK-801 > PCP > tiletamine > ketamine. Researcher Roland N. Auer conducted similar studies to look at the correlation between age and sex and the development of NMDA receptor antagonist neurotoxicity in test rats. Older rats experienced a much higher mortality rate after the development of NAN. Female rats were found, at all ages, to have a higher incidence of necrotic (dead) neurons as a result of NAN. Nitrous oxide, a common anesthetic for humans (especially in dentistry), has also been shown to cause vacuolization in rats' brains, but caused no irreversible lesions. Dextromethorphan, a common antitussive often found in cough medicines, has been shown to cause vacuolization in rats' brains when administered at doses of 75 mg/kg. However, oral administration of dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DXM HBr) to female rats in single doses as high as 120 mg/kg did not result in detectable neurotoxic changes at 4‚Äì6 hours or 24‚Äì26 hours post-dose (female rats are more sensitive to NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity). The same researchers also found no evidence of neurotoxic changes in retrosplenial or cingulate cortices of male rats orally administered up to 400 mg/(kg day) DXM HBr or female rats orally administered 120 mg/(kg day) DXM HBr, both for 30 days. Carliss et al. (2007) also found that rats administered 9 mg/(kg day sc) (+)-MK-801 hydrogen maleate for 30 days did produce detectable vacuolation as expected. When 30 mg/(kg ip) dextrorphan was administered to male rats, neurotoxic changes were observed only 30 minutes post-dose. Even if the hypothesis of gross neural apoptosis proves to be false in humans, NMDA antagonists certainly have potential to permanently alter synaptic structure due to effects upon long term potentiation, a process in which NMDA receptors plays a crucial role. Perhaps, with repeated usage, this would manifest, due to tolerance, thus downregulation, of the NMDA receptor system. This could feasibly alter the function/relationship of various structures, specifically the ventral visual stream, perhaps a cause of the anecdotal reports of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) from such chronic users of novel psychoactive substances. In 1999 an autopsy study by Johannes Kornhuber of 8 patients who had received amantadine therapy looked at the selectively vulnerable brain regions where Olney's lesions occur, the cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, and found no evidence of Olney's lesions. In 2013 a study using magnetic resonance imaging showed brain lesions in ketamine addicts with severity depending on the duration of addiction and daily intake of ketamine. Cortical atrophy and holes in superficial white matter are seen early on. After 4 years of addiction lesions spread throughout the brain and damage is evident in the pons and other deeper brain structures. ==Prevention== In medical settings, NMDA receptor antagonists are used as anesthetics, so GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators are used to effectively prevent any neurotoxicity caused by them. Drugs that work to suppress NAN include anticholinergics,[D.Wozniak - NMDA Antagonist Neurotoxicity: Mechanism and Prevention] benzodiazepines, barbiturates and Alpha-adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine. Conversely, coadministration of NMDA-antagonists with alpha-2 adrenergic antagonists, like yohimbine, could theoretically potentiate NAN. ==Controversy== In Karl L. R. Jansen's book, Ketamine: Dreams and Realities, unpublished studies are cited on monkey brains. The opinion that DXM caused Olney's Lesions therefore came under fire.

Web sites, magazines or other industries may also be facelifted, for instance when their titles and products appear dated. The term probably comes from the same term used in plastic surgery. == Purpose == It is commonly applied to many kinds of products to keep them competitive during a model's product life cycle and to increasing the sales revenue of products. To earn high sales revenue and profits for as long as possible with one product generation, one must enhance the product's attractiveness from time to time. In automotive industry, the product lifecycle of mass-produced productions is always 4 to 6 years, and during that period, the competitor company will introduce new product to hold more market share. When new cars have launched into the market for 2 and 3 years, to keep their strength in the market, company will push out a facelift version to attract new and past customers to change their cars as they observe the sales revenue starts decreasing. This process is controlled by product life cycle management. == Manifestation in Automobiles == In automobiles industry, facelift often be shown as a small change in its outlook, updating its engine output, adding some new equipments or creating a new edition etc. For instance, comparing BMW 750 with BMW 750li, it's in the fifth generation, the Seven's brief remains unchanged: offer limo comfort. The new 750li uses BMW's latest 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8, in place of the old petrol V12. It also has four-wheel-steering in an effort to improve the 7's dynamic ability. And there's a host of new technology ‚Äì including a new iDrive system ‚Äì which will eventually filter through to the rest of the BMW range. This all stands the 7 Series apart from its more obviously opulent key rivals, the Mercedes S-class and Lexus LS. This BMW is a boardroom on wheels, not a boudoir. == Sugar Water Gets a Facelift == A good facelift can bring an increasing revenue and a better reputation to the company. In 2008, Coke, Pepsi Bottles try new sizes to pump up sales. While U.S. soda sales in major retail channels overall declined 3.5% in the first quarter, convenience- store sales dropped 4.2%, according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication. The 20-ounce bottle accounts for most convenience-store soda sales. To win back sales, several Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottlers are conducting pilot tests on a variety of bottle sizes they hope will appeal to consumers put off by the 20-ounce bottle or looking for a cheaper option to cushion the blow of high food and energy prices. == Facelifts of websites == thumb Facelifts of websites may take the form of changes in the appearance of the web, a new function being added, etc. For example, to improve the GMB website, a new navigation panel was built to helps users get less confused when navigating around in the dashboard. Also, in response to the increasingly mobile nature of web usage, Facebook rolled out key updates to make Pages more mobile-friendly and user-friendly. To make Pages more mobile-friendly, Facebook has changed the layout to include tabs for each Page section ‚Äì allowing a visitor to get the information they need in a streamlined fashion, while eliminating cumbersome scrolling and clicking. When a website is not able to give the result people want, do not meet the modern functionality standards, and is not responsive and mobile-friendly, then it may need a facelift to improve the situation. ==References== Category:Product management pl:Facelifting (motoryzacja) ","title":"Facelift (product)"},{"id":"1443213","text":"A facelift, technically known as a rhytidectomy (from Ancient Greek ·ø•œÖœÑŒØœÇ (rhytis) \\"wrinkle\\" + ·ºêŒ∫œÑŒøŒºŒÆ (ektome) \\"excision\\", surgical removal of wrinkles), is a type of cosmetic surgery procedure used to give a more youthful facial appearance. There are multiple surgical techniques and exercise routines. Surgery usually involves the removal of excess facial skin, with or without the tightening of underlying tissues, and the redraping of the skin on the patient's face and neck. Exercise routines tone underlying facial muscles without surgery. Surgical facelifts are effectively combined with eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) and other facial procedures and are typically performed under general anesthesia or deep twilight sleep. According to the most recent 2011 statistics from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, facelifts were the sixth most popular aesthetic surgery performed after liposuction, breast augmentation, abdominoplasty (tummy tuck), blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery) and breast lift. ==History== Sublabial incision through which periosteum of maxilla is elevated in an endoscopic midface lift (rhytidectomy). ===Cutaneous period (1900‚Äì1970)=== In the first 70 years of the 20th century facelifts were performed by pulling on the skin on the face and cutting the loose parts off. The first facelift was reportedly performed by Eugen Holl√§nder in 1901 in Berlin. An elderly Polish female aristocrat asked him to: \\"lift her cheeks and corners of the mouth\\". After much debate he finally proceeded to excise an elliptical piece of skin around the ears. The first textbook about facial cosmetic surgery (1907) was written by Charles Miller (Chicago) entitled The Correction of Featural Imperfections. In the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) the Dutch surgeon Johannes Esser made one of the most famous discoveries in the field of plastic surgery to date, namely the \\"skin graft inlay technique,\\" the technique was soon used on both English and German sides in the war. At the same time the British plastic surgeon Harold Delfs Gillies used the Esser-graft to school all those who flocked towards him who wanted to study under him. That‚Äôs how he earned the name \\"Father of 20th Century Plastic Surgery\\". In 1919 Dr. Passot was known to publish one of the first papers on face-lifting, this consisted mainly on the elevating and redraping of the facial skin. After this many others began to write papers on face-lifting in the 1920s. From then the esthetic surgery was being performed on a large scale, from the basis of the reconstructive surgery. The first female plastic surgeon, Suzanne No√´l, played a large role in its development and she wrote one of the first books about esthetic surgery named Chirurgie Esthetique, son r√¥le social. ===SMAS period (1970‚Äì1980)=== In 1968 Tord Skoog introduced the concept of subfacial dissection, therefore providing suspension of the stronger deeper layer rather than relying on skin tension to achieve his facelift (he publishes his technique in 1974, with subfacial dissection of the platysma without detaching the skin in a posterior direction). In 1976 Mitz and Peyronie described the anatomical Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System, or SMAS, a term coined by Paul Tessier, Mitz and Peyronie‚Äôs tutor in craniofacial surgery, after he had become familiar with Skoog‚Äôs technique. After Skoog died of a heart attack, the superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS) concept rapidly emerged to become the standard face-lifting technique, which was the first innovative change in facelift surgery in over 50 years. ===Deep plane period (1980‚Äì1991)=== Tessier, who had his background in the craniofacial surgery, made the step to a subperiosteal dissection via a coronal incision. In 1979, Tessier demonstrated that the subperiosteal undermining of the superior and lateral orbital rims allowed the elevation of the soft tissue and eyebrows with better results than the classic face-lifting. The objective was to elevate the soft tissue over the underlying skeleton to re-establish the patient's youthful appearance. ===Volumetric period (1991‚Äìtoday)=== At the start of this period in the history of the facelift there was a change in conceptual thinking, surgeons started to care more about minimizing scars, restoring the subcutaneous volume that was lost during the ageing process and they started making use of a cranial direction of the \\"lift\\" instead of posterior. The technique for performing a facelift went from simply pulling on the skin and sewing it back to aggressive SMAS and deep plane surgeries to a more refined facelift where variable options are considered to have an aesthetically good and a more long-lasting effect. A recently evolving technique, on the other hand, simplifies the operation. this technique is called thread lift or non- surgical face lift. Silicone threads with barbs are used to pull the face and neck skin upwards without the need of skin excision. These are non-absorbable threads and combination of these threads with other methods of facial rejuvenation reveals even better results.Turkish J Plast Surg ==Indications== The difference between an aged eye and a youthful eye, looking at the distance from the cilliary margin to the inferior-most point of the orbicularis oculi muscle. thumbleftA. Increased redundancy of the nasolabial fold (caused by a descent of cheek fat) B. Increased distance from the ciliary margin to the inferior-most point of the orbicularis oculi muscle (caused by decreasing tone of the orbicularis oculi muscle) C. Jowl (a broken jaw line by ptosis of the platysma muscle) D. The intended effect of a facelift A facelift is performed to rejuvenate the appearance of the face. Aging of the face is most shown by a change in position of the deep anatomical structures, notably the platysma muscle, cheek fat and the orbicularis oculi muscle. These lead up to three landmarks namely, an appearance of the jowl (a broken jaw line by ptosis of the platysma muscle), increased redundancy of the nasolabial fold (caused by a descent of cheek fat) and the increased distance from the ciliary margin to the inferior-most point of the orbicularis oculi muscle (caused by decreasing tone of the orbicularis oculi muscle). The skin is a fourth component in the aging of the face. The ideal age for face-lifting is at age 50 or younger, as measured by patient satisfaction. Some areas, such as the nasolabial folds or marionette lines, in some cases can be treated more suitably with Botox or liposculpture. ==Contraindications== Contraindications to facelift surgery include severe concomitant medical problems, both physical and psychological. While not absolute contraindications, the risk of postoperative complications is increased in cigarette smokers and patients with hypertension and diabetes. These strong relative contraindications consist primarily of diseases predisposing to poor wound healing. Patients are typically asked to abstain from taking aspirin or other blood thinners for at least one week prior to surgery. Patients motivations and expectations are an important factor in order to determine the patient‚Äôs medical status. A psychiatric illness leading to unreasonable expectations for the surgical outcome, such as a distorted perception of reality, can be a contraindication to surgery. Some kinds of hypersensitivity to anesthesia are a contraindication. ==Surgical anatomy== * SMAS * Facial musculature * Facial nerve :A dissection in the deep plane can mostly be performed safely, because the facial nerve innervates the facial muscles on the deep surface of these muscles (except for the muscles which are lying deep to the facial nerve, the mentalis, the levator anguli oris and the buccinator). The fibres of the nerve are becoming more superficially medially. Therefore, the dissection of a deep plane begins further away of the surface then it ends. This allows the undermining to be carried out towards the nasolabial fold without harming the branches of the facial nerve. * Retaining ligaments :The retaining ligaments in the face provide an anchorage of superficial structures to underlying bone. Four retaining ligaments exist. The platysma-cutaneous ligaments and the platysma-auricular ligament are aponeurotic condensations which connect the platysma to the dermis. The osteocutaneous ligaments, the zygomatic ligament and the mandibular ligament, are more important. They attach to the skin and bone, leading to a counteraction of gravitational forces. These ligaments should be released surgically to obtain a fully mobile facelift flap. * Nasolabial folds * Melolabial folds (marionette lines) * Greater auricular nerve :Injury to the greater auricular nerve is the most seen nerve injury after rhytidectomy. Care should be taken in elevation over the sternocleidomastoid muscle, because of the terminal branches of the nerve that pass superficially to innervate the earlobe. * Vascularisation :The composite flap is vascularised by facial, angular and/or inferior orbital arteries. The facial artery supplies the platysma and goes on as the angular artery, which connects with the branches of the arteria supratrochlearis and arteria infraorbitalis. The parts of the face elevated are in continuity in the deep-plane and the composite rhytidectomy include the SMAS layer in the lower face, subcutaneous tissue and the skin as the arteries to these parts are preserved. With this option you can create a well vascularized tissue flap, which can be used to tighten the skin without loss of vascularization, this will result in fewer complications like skin slough and necrosis. ==Procedure== Many different procedures of rhytidectomy exist. The differences are mostly the type of incision, the invasiveness and the area of the face that is treated. Each surgeon practices multiple different types of facelift surgery. At a consultation the procedure with the best outcome is chosen for every patient. Expectations of the patient, the age, possible recovery time and areas to improve are some of the many factors taken in consideration before choosing a technique of rhytidectomy. In the traditional facelift, an incision is made in front of the ear extending up into the hairline. The incision curves around the bottom of the ear and then behind it, usually ending near the hairline on the back of the neck. After the skin incision is made, the skin is separated from the deeper tissues with a scalpel or scissors (also called undermining) over the cheeks and neck. At this point, the deeper tissues (SMAS, the fascial suspension system of the face) can be tightened with sutures, with or without removing some of the excess deeper tissues. The skin is then redraped, and the amount of excess skin to be removed is determined by the surgeon's judgement and experience. The excess skin is then removed, and the skin incisions are closed with sutures and staples. The technique of a SMAS facelift, consisting of mobilisation, repositioning and fixating. ===SMAS lift=== The SMAS (Superficial Musculo Aponeurotic System) layer consists of suspensory ligaments that encase the cheek fat, thereby causing them to remain in their normal position. Resuspension and securing the SMAS anatomical layer can lead to rejuvenation of the face, by counteracting aging and gravity caused laxity. Modifications to this technique led to development of the \\"Composite Facelift\\" and \\"Deep plane Facelift.\\" ===Deep-plane facelift=== In order to correct the deepening of the nasolabial fold more accurately, the deep plane facelift was developed. Differing from the SMAS lift by freeing cheek fat and some muscles from their bone implement. This technique has a higher risk at damaging the facial nerve. The SMAS lift is an effective procedure to reposition the platysma muscle; however, the nasolabial fold is according to some surgeons better addressed by a deep plane facelift or composite facelift. ===Composite facelift=== As well as in the deep plane facelift, in the composite facelift a deeper layer of tissue is mobilised and repositioned. The difference between these operating techniques is the extra repositioning and fixation of the orbicularis oculi muscle in the composite facelift procedure. The malar crescent caused by the orbicularis oculi ptosis can be addressed in a composite facelift. ===Mid face-lift=== The mid face area, the area between the cheeks, flattens and makes a woman‚Äôs face look slightly more masculine. The mid face-lift is suggested to people where these changes occur, yet without a significant degree of jowling or sagging of the neck. In these cases a mid face-lift is sufficient to rejuvenate the face opposed to a full facelift, which is a more drastic surgery. The ideal candidates for a mid face-lift is when a person is in his 40s, or if the cheeks appear to be sagging and the nasolabial area has laxity or skin folds. To achieve a younger appearance the surgeon makes several small incisions along the hairline and inside the mouth, this way the fatty tissue layers can be lifted and repositioned. This way there are practically no scars. The fatty layer that lies over the cheekbones is also lifted and repositioned. This improves the nose-to-mouth lines and the roundness over the cheekbones. The recovery time is rather short and this procedure is often combined with a blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery) ===Mini-facelift=== The mini-facelift is the least invasive type of facelift which is similar to a full facelift, the only difference is the omission of the neck lift in the mini lift procedure. It is also called the ‚ÄòS‚Äô lift because of the shape of the incision that is used or the ‚Äòshort- scar‚Äô facelift. This lift is a more temporary solution to the ageing of the face which also has less downtime and is done on people who have deep nasolabial folds, sagging facial structures, yet still have a firm and well- contoured neck. The position of the incision is usually made from the hairline around the ear with scars hidden in the natural crease of the skin. The mini lift can be performed with an endoscope, which is used to reposition the soft tissues. After this, the skin is repositioned by the surgeon with small sutures. This type of lift is a good alternative to the full facelift to people with premature ageing.Blue represents the incisions in the Skin only facelift. Green represents the S-lift. Red is the extensive undermining done in several facelift techniques. ===Subperiosteal facelift=== The subperiosteal facelift technique is done by vertically lifting the soft tissues of the face, completely separating it from the underlying facial bones and elevating it to a more esthetically pleasing position, correcting deep nasolabial folds and sagging cheeks. The technique is often combined with standard techniques, which provide a long-lasting rejuvenation of the face and is done in all age groups. The difference between this and other lifts is that the subperiosteal facelift has a longer period of facial swelling after the procedure. ===Skin- only facelift=== With the skin-only facelift only the skin of the face is lifted and not the underlying SMAS, muscles or other structures. As the elastin fibers disintegrate, the skin itself loses elasticity in older patients. A skin only face lift requires skill in understanding the extent of safe removal of skin and the Vector of pull to get an optimal result. It can be done with a simple ellipse of skin removed with minimal undermining of skin flaps or more extensively with large skin flaps. It can last 5 to 10 years but some patients may want a touch-up at 6 to 12 months after the procedure. The reason that this option is considered is that it has fewer complications and quicker recovery. One of the father's of plastic surgery Sir Harold Gilles described a simple ellipse of skin excision in a socialite who was pleased with her quick recovery and outcome. Can be done for a simple jowl lift in a 35 to 45 year old patient. ===MACS facelift=== The term MACS-lift ‚Äì or Minimal Access Cranial Suspension lift ‚Äì allows for the correction of sagging facial features through a short, minimal incision, elevating them vertically by suspending them from above. There are many advantages to having a MACS facelift versus a traditional facelift. For starters, the MACS-lift uses a shorter scar that is in front of the ear, instead of behind, which is much easier to hide. Overall, the MACS-lift surgery is safer because less skin is raised. This means that there is less risk of bleeding and nerve damage. The operation also takes less time, lasting 2.5 hours instead of the 3.5 hours that the traditional facelift requires. There is also a shorter recovery period, 2‚Äì3 weeks instead of 3‚Äì4 weeks. Finally, the results of the MACS-lift are very natural while the traditional facelift will often result in a \\"windswept\\" look. The MACS lift has been successfully used for to correct complication after thread-lift with APTOS ==Complications== The most common complication is bleeding which usually requires a return to the operating room. Less common, but potentially serious, complications may include damage to the facial nerves and necrosis of the skin flaps or infection. Although the facial plastic surgeon attempts to prevent and minimise the risk of complications, a rhytidectomy can have complications. As a risk to every operation, complications can be derived as a reaction to the anesthetics. Hematoma is the most seen complication after rhytidectomy. Arterial bleeding can cause the most dangerous hematomas, as they can lead to dyspnea. Almost all of the hematomas occur within the first 24 hours after the rhytidectomy. Nerve injury can be sustained during rhytidectomy. This kind of injury can be temporary or permanent and harm can be done to either sensory or motor nerves of the face. As an sensory nerve, the great auricular nerve is the most common nerve to get injured at a facelift procedure. The most injured motor nerve is the facial nerve. Skin necrosis can occur after a facelift operation. Smoking increases the risk of skin necrosis 12-fold. Scarring is considered a complication of facelift surgery. Hypertrophic scars can appear. A facelift requires skin incisions; however, the incisions in front of and behind the ear are usually inconspicuous. Hair loss in the portions of the incision within the hair-bearing scalp can rarely occur. A hairline distortion can result after undergoing a rhytidectomy. Especially facial hair by men after a facelift procedure. There is a high incidence of alopecia after rhytidectomy. The permanent hair loss is mostly seen at the incision site in the temporal areas. In men, the sideburns can be pulled backwards and upwards, resulting in an unnatural appearance if appropriate techniques are not employed to address this issue. Achieving a natural appearance following surgery in men can be more challenging due to their hair-bearing preauricular skin. In both men and women, one of the signs of having had a facelift can be an earlobe which is pulled forwards and/or distorted. If too much skin is removed, or a more vertical vector not employed, the face can assume a pulled-back, \\"windswept\\" appearance. This appearance can also be due to changes in bone structure that generally happen with age.[2] One of the most often overlooked (or not discussed) areas of a traditional facelift procedure is the effects on the anatomical positioning and angles of the ears. Most patients are, in many cases, not made aware that the vector forces in a facelift will lower the ears as well as change the angle of the ears. Ear lowering can be as much as 1 cm and change in the angle as much as 10 degrees. Infection is a rare complication for patients who have undergone a rhytidectomy. Staphylococcus is the most usual causative organism for an infection after facelift surgery. ==Society== Cost varies by country where surgery is performed, : *Canada ‚Äì US$7,000‚Äì15,000 *Pakistan ‚Äì US$5,500 *Malaysia ‚Äì US$6,400 *Panama ‚Äì US$2,500 *Russia ‚Äì US$10,000 *Singapore ‚Äì US$7,500 *South Korea ‚Äì US$6,650 *India ‚Äì US$2500 *Taiwan ‚Äì US$8,500 *Thailand ‚Äì US$5,000 *United States ‚Äì US$7,000‚Äì$15,000 Additional Notes on Costs in Europe, : *Belgium ‚Äì GBP ¬£1,650 and up *Italy ‚Äì GBP ¬£5,000 *United Kingdom ‚Äì ¬£4,000‚Äì¬£9,000 *Serbia ‚Äì GBP ¬£4000 ==See also== *Cosmetic surgery *Facial toning *Micro-current treatment (\\"non- surgical\\" facelift) *Lifestyle lift *Minimal access cranial suspension *Oral and maxillofacial surgery *Otolaryngology *Plastic surgery *Superficial muscular aponeurotic system ==Footnotes== Category:Oral and maxillofacial surgery Category:Otorhinolaryngology Category:Plastic surgical procedures Category:Surgical removal procedures ","title":"Rhytidectomy"},{"id":"1443248","text":"Bill James Presents The Great American Baseball Statbook is a book written by baseball sabermetrician Bill James in 1988.

The Succession law was an accord between Erling Skakke and √òystein Erlendsson, Archbishop of Nidaros. Erling Skakke was married to Kristin Sigurdsdatter, the daughter of King Sigurd Jorsalfar. They had a son, Magnus Erlingsson, who was deemed to be a legitimate claimant to the throne, which was left vacant with the death of King Haakon II. Archbishop Erlendsson agreed to terms under which Magnus inherited the Norwegian throne, in exchange for greater power afforded to the Church. Magnus was crowned king in 1163 at the age of eight and the succession law was enacted simultaneously. As king, Magnus had to promise to obey the Pope, while Church law was recognized on an equal level with secular laws. Erling took the title of earl and held the real power, since Magnus was a minor.

He started his college coaching career at North Carolina as an assistant coach for Dean Smith in 1978. In 1988, Williams became the head coach of the men's basketball team at Kansas, taking them to 14 consecutive NCAA tournaments, four final four appearances, two national championship game appearances, collecting a .805 win percentage and winning nine conference titles over his fifteen-year span. In 2003, Williams left Kansas to return to his alma mater North Carolina, replacing Matt Doherty as head coach of the Tar Heels. Since returning to North Carolina, Williams has won three national championships, nine Atlantic Coast Conference conference titles, three ACC tournament championships, one AP National Coach of the Year award, and two ACC Coach of the Year awards. He is third all-time for most wins at Kansas behind Phog Allen and Bill Self, and second all-time for most wins at North Carolina behind his legendary mentor Dean Smith. On January 25, 2020, with a 94-71 win over Miami, Williams reached 880 wins surpassing Smith‚Äôs 879 win total. With a total of 885 wins to date, Williams has taken his teams to nine Final Fours in his careers at Kansas and North Carolina. He is the only coach in NCAA history to have led two different programs to at least four Final Fours each and the only basketball coach in NCAA history to have 400 or more victories at two NCAA Division 1 schools. He is also tenth all-time in the NCAA for winning percentage among men's college basketball coaches. Williams was an assistant coach for Smith when North Carolina won the 1982 national championship. As a head coach, Williams has coached in a total of six NCAA championship games (1991, 2003, 2005, 2009, 2016, and 2017). On April 4, 2005, Williams won his first national title as the Tar Heels defeated the University of Illinois in the 2005 NCAA championship game. He again led the Tar Heels to a national title on April 6, 2009, against the Michigan State Spartans (see 2009 NCAA championship game). Williams won his third national championship on April 3, 2017, when he led the Tar Heels to victory against the Gonzaga Bulldogs. Williams is one of six NCAA Men's Division I college basketball coaches to have won at least three national championships. In 2006, Williams was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame. The following year, in 2007, Williams was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. ==Early years== Williams was born in Marion General Hospital in Marion, North Carolina, and spent his early years in the small western North Carolina towns of Marion and Spruce Pine. As a child his family relocated to nearby Asheville, where he grew up. Williams lettered in basketball and baseball at T. C. Roberson High School in Asheville, North Carolina, all four years.Official Bio In basketball, playing for Coach Buddy Baldwin, he was named all-county and all-conference for two years (1967 and 1968), all-western North Carolina in 1968 and served as captain in the North Carolina Blue-White All-Star Game. Williams has stated that Coach Baldwin was one of the biggest influences in his life. Williams went on to play on the freshman team at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and study the game under coach Dean Smith. When Williams was a sophomore at Carolina, he asked Smith if he could attend his practices and would sit in the bleachers taking notes on Smith's coaching.Roy williams induction article Williams also volunteered to keep statistics for Smith at home games and worked in Smith's summer camps. ==Early coaching years== Williams' first coaching job was in 1973 as a high school basketball and golf coach at Charles D. Owen High SchoolCharles D. Owen High School in Black Mountain, North Carolina. He coached basketball and boys' golf for five years and ninth-grade football for four years, and served as athletic director for two years. In 1978, Williams came back to the University of North Carolina and served as an assistant to Coach Dean Smith from 1978 to 1988. During his tenure as assistant coach, North Carolina went 275‚Äì61 and won the NCAA national championship in 1982, the first for Smith and the second for North Carolina. One of Williams' more notable events came as assistant coach when he became instrumental in recruiting Michael Jordan. ==Head coach at Kansas== In 1988, Williams left North Carolina and became the head coach of the University of Kansas Jayhawks, replacing former North Carolina assistant and UCLA head coach Larry Brown, who had taken the position as head coach of the NBA's San Antonio Spurs. He was hired just months after the Danny Manning-led Jayhawks won the 1988 NCAA championship. Weeks after Williams took the position, KU was placed on probation for violations that took place prior to his arrival. As a result, the Jayhawks were barred from postseason play for the 1988‚Äì89 season. Williams coached 15 seasons at Kansas (from 1988 to 2003). During that time he had a record of 418‚Äì101, a .805 winning percentage. At the time of his departure, he was second on Kansas' all-time wins list behind only Phog Allen; he has since been passed by current coach Bill Self. Williams' Kansas teams averaged 27.8 wins per season. Kansas won nine regular-season conference championships over his last 13 years. In seven years of Big 12 Conference play, his teams went 94‚Äì18, capturing the regular-season title in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 and the postseason tournament crown in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2001‚Äì02, KU became the first, and so far only, team to go undefeated (16‚Äì0) in Big 12 play. In 1995‚Äì98, Kansas was a combined 123‚Äì17 ‚Äì an average of 30.8 wins per season. Williams' teams went 201‚Äì17 (.922) in Allen Fieldhouse, and won 62 consecutive games in Allen from February 1994 to December 1998. Kansas was a regular in the Associated Press Top 25 from 1991 to 1999, placing in the poll for 145 consecutive weeks. Williams' teams were ranked in the Top 10 in 194 AP polls from 1990. Kansas led the nation in field goal percentage and scoring in 2002 and in scoring margin in 2003; they held opponents to the lowest field goal percentage in the country in 2001 (37.8 percent); led the nation in winning percentage in 1997 and 2002; shot better than 50 percent from the floor for the season seven times; and led the country in field goal percentage in 1990 at 53.3 percent, and in 2002 at 50.6 percent; shot a combined 49.4 percent from the floor in 15 seasons; led the nation in assists in 2001 and 2002 and was seventh in the nation in 2003; scored 100 or more points 71 times (once every 13 games); averaged 82.7 points per game in 15 years; averaged 90 or more points in two seasons (92.1 in 1990 and 90.9 in 2002). Kansas was also the winningest team of the 1990s, despite failing to win any NCAA championships during the decade. Williams had Kansas in the AP Top 25 in 242 of 268 weekly polls. Kansas reached the No. 1 ranking in the country in six different seasons and was ranked at least No. 2 in the nation in 11 of the 15 seasons. Under Williams, the team had several deep runs in the NCAA Tournament, making it to four Final Fours and appearing in the national championship game in both 1991 and 2003, losing both, to Duke and Syracuse respectively. The 1996‚Äì97 team featured future NBA players Paul Pierce, Jacque Vaughn, Raef LaFrentz, and Scot Pollard. Entering the NCAA Tournament with Pollard (foot stress fracture) and starting shooting guard (later Kansas and UNC assistant coach, and current head coach at Stanford) Jerod Haase (broken wrist) trying to play with injuries, the team was upset in the Sweet Sixteen by the eventual champion, the Arizona Wildcats.Roy, ACC Have Mixed NCAA History As No. 1 Except for his first season at Kansas (when the team was on probation), all of Williams' teams made the NCAA tournament. From 1990 to 1999 Kansas compiled a 286‚Äì60 record, giving them both the most wins and best winning percentage of any team in that decade.Division I Records From 1994 to 1998, the Jayhawks won 62 consecutive home games at Allen Fieldhouse, which was the longest such streak in the NCAA at the time. The seniors of 1998 (LaFrentz, Billy Thomas, and C. B. McGrath) went 58‚Äì0 at home during their KU careers. ===Departure from Kansas for North Carolina=== Williams had the opportunity to return to North Carolina in 2000, when Bill Guthridge left the head coaching position vacant.Sports Illustrated article, \\"Should I stay or should I go?\\" After national media sources such as ESPN prematurely announced Williams would take the position, they quickly backed off as it became clear that Williams' mind was not made up. North Carolina media continued to report that he had accepted the position. After a week of this back-and-forth, Williams held a press conference at Memorial Stadium in Lawrence, Kansas, where he announced that he was staying at Kansas. Williams took the 2003 Kansas team to the NCAA championship game against Syracuse. Syracuse defeated Kansas, 81‚Äì78, to win the championship. The end of the season brought a cloud of uncertainty over KU, as Williams' future was up in the air. During CBS' exit interview with Williams, he was consistently asked if he was taking the North Carolina job instead of his current Kansas team's effort, eventually inspiring him to say to the reporter \\"I could give a shit about North Carolina right now\\" to the live mic. Chancellor Robert Hemenway fired KU Athletic Director Al Bohl, and while he cited Bohl's involvement in an academic scandal at Fresno State, many perceived the move as a desperate move to keep Williams at KU, as the relationship between Bohl and Williams was very poor.https://www.espn.com/ncb/news/2003/0409/1536529.html Bohl reacted angrily, accusing Williams of engineering the firing. Williams accepted the North Carolina head coaching position following the controversial three-year run of Matt Doherty, who prior to coaching at North Carolina had been an assistant at KU under Williams. ==Head coach at North Carolina== With Williams' return to North Carolina, he became the school's third coach in six years. The previous two coaches ‚Äî Matt Doherty and Bill Gutheridge took over after Dean Smith. The Tar Heels were coming off of a mediocre season and two years before had suffered the worst season in school history. Nevertheless, the team still had top talent, including McDonald's All Americans Sean May, Rashad McCants, and Raymond Felton. In Williams' first season as the Tar Heels' head coach, the 2003‚Äì04 season, North Carolina finished a respectable 19‚Äì11 and returned to the national rankings for the first time since the early part of the 2002‚Äì03 season. They were knocked out in the second round of the NCAA tournament by Texas. ===2004‚Äì05: First championship=== In Williams' second year, the Tar Heels returned to national prominence. With the arrival of freshman Marvin Williams, Williams led North Carolina to a National Championship in 2005, which was his first national title as a head coach. ===2005‚Äì06=== After winning the championship, the team's top seven scorers all left, either via graduation or opting to go to the NBA early. Despite the loss of talent, the Tar Heels proved to be surprisingly successful in 2005‚Äì06, in part due to freshman Tyler Hansbrough. Williams was named Coach of the Year for his ability to turn around such a new team to such a high level of success. ===2006‚Äì07=== Williams quickly reloaded the team with top talent, bringing in recruits like Brandan Wright, Ty Lawson, Wayne Ellington and Deon Thompson. The 2006‚Äì07 team tied as ACC regular season champions, earning the tiebreak over the Virginia Cavaliers. With the #1 seed, the Tar Heels won the ACC Tournament. After earning a #1 seed in the East Region in the 2007 NCAA Tournament, Williams' team won its first-round game against Eastern Kentucky Colonels 86‚Äì65 and its second against Michigan State 81‚Äì67. North Carolina then defeated the USC Trojans 74‚Äì64 to advance to the Elite Eight. On March 24, 2007, North Carolina fell to the Georgetown Hoyas in overtime in the East Regional, ending its post-season run. Following the 2006‚Äì2007 season, Williams announced on July 18, 2007, that he had vertigo, a condition that occasionally forces him to sit down suddenly during games. ===2007‚Äì08=== The 2007‚Äì08 season was just as successful, culminating in another ACC regular season and tournament championship. Williams led the Tar Heels to a school-record 36 wins, the #1 overall ranking in the final AP poll, a #1 seed in the East Region of the tournament, the tournament's overall #1 seed, and the 2008 Final Four. The Tar Heels' run ended with an 84‚Äì66 loss in the Final Four to Kansas, Williams' former team. Two days after the defeat, he attended the tournament final between Kansas and Memphis, sporting a Jayhawk sticker on his shirt. As a result of Memphis' 2008 season being wiped from the books due to NCAA sanctions, the 2007‚Äì08 Tar Heels \\"officially\\" have the second-most single- season wins in Division I history. ===2008‚Äì09: Second championship=== With Tyler Hansbrough returning to Chapel Hill for his senior season, they were tapped by numerous prognosticators as the favorites to win the NCAA championship. The Heels started the season #1 in both polls‚Äîincluding the first-ever unanimous preseason #1 ranking in the history of the AP Poll‚Äîbecoming the first team to have back-to-back preseason #1 rankings since UNLV in 1991. They won their first 13 games before being upset by Boston College 85‚Äì78. Two games later, they fell at ACC rival Wake Forest 92‚Äì89, but went on a winning streak, including a defeat of archrival Duke by 101‚Äì87, Williams' fourth straight victory at Cameron Indoor Stadium. In defeating Duke 79‚Äì71 in the season finale, the Tar Heels secured their third straight ACC regular season title and fourth in Williams' six seasons as head coach at UNC. Although they lost in the second round of the ACC Tournament to Florida State, they still garnered the top seed in the NCAA South Region‚Äîthe fourth time in Williams' six-year tenure in Chapel Hill that the Tar Heels had been a #1 seed. North Carolina defeated Radford in the first round of the NCAA tournament, then LSU in the second round, and Gonzaga in the Sweet 16 round, followed by a 72‚Äì60 defeat of the Oklahoma Sooners in the Elite 8 that gave North Carolina its second straight berth into the Final Four in Detroit, Michigan. An 83‚Äì69 victory over Villanova vaulted the Tar Heels into the national championship game. They played the Michigan State Spartans in the National Championship game and Williams won his second title with an 89‚Äì72 victory. This capped off one of the most dominating runs in the history of the tournament. The Tar Heels only trailed for a total of 10 minutes out of a possible 240 minutes of playing time. They also won every game by at least 12 points‚Äîall the more remarkable since they upended four teams in the top 15 of the final AP Poll (#10 Gonzaga, #7 Oklahoma, #11 Villanova and #8 Michigan State). ===2009‚Äì10=== North Carolina finished the regular season at 16‚Äì15, dropped to third in all-time wins, and bowed out in the first round of the ACC tournament. The Tar Heels did not receive a post-season tournament bid by the NCAA‚Äîthe only time in Williams' coaching career that his team didn't take part in that tournament when eligible to do so. However, they did receive a bid to the NIT. The Tar Heels made it to the NIT championship game versus Dayton, which was played on April 1, 2010, at Madison Square Garden. The Tar Heels lost by a score of 79‚Äì68, bringing their overall tally to 20‚Äì17 for the 2009‚Äì10 season. This 20-win season however kept Williams' streak of 20-win seasons alive. Williams stated that the season was \\"the biggest frustration and the biggest disappointment of my professional life\\". In addition to frustrating play, Williams was criticized for comparing the season to the disaster in Haiti by stating, \\"Our massage therapist told me, she said 'You know, Coach, what happened in Haiti is a catastrophe. What you're having is a disappointment.' And I told her that depends on which chair she was sitting in, because it does feel like a catastrophe to me, and that's because it is my life.\\" Williams later apologized for his comments, stating that he misspoke and \\"neglected to say that it puts basketball in perspective.\\" ===2010‚Äì11=== The Tar Heels started out slow during the 2010‚Äì11 season, dropping early games to Minnesota, Vanderbilt, and Illinois, and also being blown out by twenty points at Georgia Tech. It was not until Williams made the difficult decision to start freshman point guard Kendall Marshall over junior Larry Drew II that the Tar Heels returned to their dominant winning ways. The Heels won the ACC Regular Season Championship after beating Duke in their final regular season game in Chapel Hill. It was Carolina's fifth ACC Regular Season title in eight years under Coach Williams. However, Carolina lost to Duke a week later in the ACC Tournament Championship game. Coach Williams was selected as the ACC Coach of the Year for the second time since becoming head coach at North Carolina for overcoming the adversity of losing some players to transfer and dismissal and winning the ACC regular season title. After defeating Long Island, Washington, and Marquette, the Heels (29‚Äì8, 14‚Äì2) lost to the Kentucky Wildcats in the Elite Eight. ===2011‚Äì12=== The 2011‚Äì12 season for the Tar Heels was more successful despite numerous injuries to key players. With losses to UNLV, Kentucky as well as a 33-point defeat against Florida State, Williams guided his Heels to another ACC Regular Season Championship after defeating Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium to close out the regular season (Duke won the first meeting in Chapel Hill). UNC entered the 2012 ACC Tournament as the #1 seed. The Heels beat Maryland in the quarterfinals and NC State in the semifinals. John Henson injured his wrist in the Maryland game and did not play in the semifinals or championship game where UNC lost to Florida State, 85‚Äì83. UNC was then awarded the #1 seed in the Midwest bracket of the 2012 NCAA Tournament. Without Henson, Dexter Strickland and sixth-man Leslie McDonald (who were both sidelined with season-ending injuries) Carolina beat Vermont in the second round of the Tournament. Henson returned to the lineup for the third-round game against Creighton. The Heels defeated Creighton, however starting PG Kendall Marshall injured his wrist in the second half of that game. Marshall had to undergo surgery and was unable to play for the rest of the season. Carolina turned to first-year PG Stilman White who helped lead the Heels to an OT win over the Ohio Bobcats in the Sweet 16. Carolina then faced #2 seed Kansas in the Elite Eight. Greatly undermanned, the Heels played Kansas close but Kansas pulled ahead late for the win. Roy Williams' 2011‚Äì2012 team finished the season with a record of 32‚Äì6, 14‚Äì2 in the ACC. ===2012‚Äì13=== The 2012‚Äì13 season for Roy Williams and his Tar Heels was a great surprise with respect to a new starting lineup in the latter half of the season. Unlike traditional Carolina teams, the Heels played more guard heavy and relied mostly on their perimeter game to score points. Coach Williams reached 700 total NCAA career head coaching victories after the Tar Heels beat Villanova in the opening round of the tournament. Unfortunately, the Tar Heels were not able to advance after a 70‚Äì58 loss to Kansas in the round of 32. It marked the third time Carolina had lost to the Jayhawks during March Madness since 2008. The Tar Heels completed their season with 25 wins and 11 losses (overall) including 12 wins and six losses against conference opponents. ===2013‚Äì14=== The 2013‚Äì14 season for the Tar Heels ended with a round of 32 loss to Iowa State in the NCAA Tournament after narrowly slipping past Providence in the opening round. The overall record ended up 24‚Äì10, which included a 13‚Äì5 conference record. ===2014‚Äì15=== Wooden Award candidate Marcus Paige came back for his junior season. With early season losses to unranked Butler and Iowa, the Tar Heels intensity and strength were questioned. The Tar Heels grabbed a four seed in the NCAA Tournament with wins against Harvard and Arkansas, but ended their run with a loss to Wisconsin in the Sweet Sixteen. The Tar Heels finished their season 26‚Äì12 with an 11‚Äì7 ACC record. ===2015‚Äì16=== During the 2015‚Äì16 season, Williams guided the Tar Heels to their fourth Final Four of his tenure, as well as winning the regular season and ACC Tournament titles. In the 2016 NCAA Tournament, North Carolina beat Florida Gulf Coast, Providence, Indiana, and Notre Dame, and Syracuse in the Final Four, to earn a spot against Villanova in the national championship game. North Carolina lost 77‚Äì74. The Tar Heels completed their season with a 33‚Äì7 overall record. ===2016‚Äì17: Third championship=== Williams led his Tar Heels to their second consecutive ACC regular season championship. Justin Jackson won ACC Player of the Year. In the 2017 NCAA Tournament, North Carolina defeated Texas Southern 103‚Äì64, Arkansas 72‚Äì65, Butler 92‚Äì80, Kentucky 75‚Äì73, Oregon 77‚Äì76 and Gonzaga 71‚Äì65 to win its third national title in the Roy Williams' era. The Tar Heels completed their season again with a 33‚Äì7 overall record. ===2017‚Äì18=== On February 12, 2018, in a North Carolina home win against Notre Dame, Williams garnered the same number of wins (418) in the same number of seasons (15) that he accumulated at Kansas. UNC lost 86‚Äì65 to Texas A&M; in the Second Round of the NCAA Tournament. ===2018‚Äì19=== Despite a slow start to the season, North Carolina had another impressive ACC conference record in the Williams era. After a dismal 21 point loss to the Louisville Cardinals, the Tar Heels would lose only one more game, finishing the regular season 26‚Äì5 overall, 16‚Äì2 in the ACC, tied atop the conference with the Virginia Cavaliers. Season highlights include a sweep of rivals Duke and North Carolina State as well as going 9‚Äì0 in conference road games. Adding great and consistent offensive production during the season, Coby White averaged 16.1 PPG in his freshman year as a Tar Heel. Williams was named the USA TODAY Sports National Coach of the Year. The Tar Heels made it to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament before falling to 5 seed Auburn 97‚Äì80. ===2019‚Äì20=== On November 27, 2019, Williams tied Adolph Rupp for 5th in all- time wins with his 876th career victory after a win over Alabama 76‚Äì67. He took sole possession of 5th place in all-time wins with his 877th victory with a 78‚Äì74 win over Oregon two days later in the consolation game of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. On December 30, 2019, Williams tied Dean Smith for 4th in all-time wins with his 879th career victory after a win over Yale 70‚Äì67. On January 25, 2020, North Carolina defeated Miami in Chapel Hill 94-71. The victory brought Williams to a total of 880 career wins, moving him past Smith and placing him fourth on the NCAA's all-time Division I coaching wins list, behind only Bob Knight, Jim Boeheim, and Mike Krzyzewski. North Carolina concluded the regular season with a 13-18 (6-14) record, losing eight games by four points or fewer. The Tar Heels lost to Syracuse in the ACC Tournament, the last ACC game played before the season and post-season were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, finishing 14-19 and ending Williams‚Äô first losing season in his college coaching career. ==NBA players coached== ===Kansas=== * Nick Collison * Drew Gooden * Darrin Hancock * Kirk Hinrich * Adonis Jordan * Raef LaFrentz * Aaron Miles * Greg Ostertag * Paul Pierce * Scot Pollard * Mark Randall * Ryan Robertson * Wayne Simien * Billy Thomas * Jacque Vaughn * Rex Walters ===North Carolina=== * Harrison Barnes * Joel Berry II * Tony Bradley * Reggie Bullock * Ed Davis * Wayne Ellington * Raymond Felton * Danny Green * P.J.

In 2009, Algonquin Books published Williams' autobiography, \\"Hard Work: A Life On and Off the Court,\\" co-written by Tim Crothers. In the book, Williams discusses his life, including that of his difficult childhood, the highs and lows of his successful coaching career and the difficult and agonizing decision to leave Kansas for North Carolina in 2003.

Its name is from the Guarani word for \\"mixture.\\"Britton, A. Scott (2004). Guarani- English/English-Guarani Concise Dictionary. New York: Hippocrene Books. The majority of Paraguayans, particularly younger ones, speak some form of Jopara. Since 2016, the language-learning app Duolingo has offered a course in Jopara for Spanish speakers. ==Social context== Speakers of both Guarani and Spanish typically employ a great deal of code-switching between the two languages, hence why the blending of the two languages is called \\"Jopara,\\" meaning \\"mixture.\\" The relative amount of Guarani or Spanish used in speech varies depending upon the birth of the speakers, the place where they speak, with whom they are speaking, the topic of discussion, and how they want their meaning to be interpreted. Generally, the rural and older population tends to use more Guarani, while the urban and younger population uses more Spanish‚Äîthe rural and older population understands more Guarani and the urban and younger more Spanish. General and every-day conversation is more suited to Guarani, while technical and specific or formal conversation is more suited to Spanish. Guarani can be interpreted as more \\"Paraguayan\\" while Spanish can be interpreted as more \\"sophisticated.\\" Since 1992, under the Paraguay's Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) Act, Guarani in its \\"pure form\\"‚Äîdifferent from the day-to-day speech of Jopara‚Äîhas been taught in schools. This led to contradictory opinions: some say that teaching pure Guarani is the best means to preserve the language's integrity, while others argue that how Guarani is taught differs greatly from how it is commonly spoken. ==Lexicon== Many grammatical markers for features found in Guarani but not in Spanish, like evidentiality markers, are borrowed from Guarani. For example (Guarani words in bold): * La ni√±a ndaje no com√≠a m√°s casi dos d√≠as voi y por eso estaba un poco desnutrida, pero el tua √°nga igual le pegaba * It is said that the girl would not eat for more than two days. Well, for that reason she was somewhat malnourished, but the stepfather would still hit her. Some Spanish words, when put in a sentence mixed with Guarani, have a different meaning from that of standard Spanish. They can come from calques of equivalent Guarani expressions. For example: * Tu hijo creci√≥ todo ya. * Your son grew all already. ==See also== *Diglossia *WikiProject Guaran√≠ ==References== Category:Languages of Paraguay Category:Language contact Category:Mixed languages Category:South America Native-based pidgins and creoles Category:Spanish-based pidgins and creoles ","title":"Jopara language"},{"id":"1443269","text":"Paul Roger Elstak (known professionally as DJ Paul Elstak; born 14 January 1966 in The Hague) is a Dutch hardcore/gabber and happy hardcore DJ and record producer. He used to use his full name to create happy hardcore and DJ Paul for hardcore gabber, but when he started Offensive Records in 2001, he started using both names for gabber. ==Biography== In 1987, his career as a DJ started when he was hired as a Struppier at Rotterdam Discoth√®que Bluetiek-Inn. Here he played with the Dutch House music pioneer Peter Slaghuis. Around this time he also hooked up with Rob Fabrie and Richard van Naamen to form Holy Noise, with whom he released a string of releases at the Hithouse record label (owned by Slaghuis). In 1991, Holy Noise had their biggest success with their release \\"James Brown is Still Alive\\". This release was a reply to the song \\"James Brown is Dead\\" by L.A. Style. In 1992, Elstak created his own record label, Rotterdam Records (under the flag of Mid-Town records) to release hardcore techno, mostly gabber and happy hardcore. The first release on this label was a Holy Noise release under the guise of De Euromasters, releasing Amsterdam Waar Lech Dat Dan? (Translated; Amsterdam, Where Is That?). This record was an implicit complaint about the Dutch media paying most attention to Amsterdam and not to Rotterdam. In 1995, he released the first DJ Paul Elstak single, \\"Life Is Like a Dance\\". After this record, a few commercial releases followed. \\"Rainbow in the Sky\\" was the most successful of these, selling 50,000 copies in 1995. Several of his singles reached the Dutch Top 40 in the mid-1990s.top40.nl After two years, Elstak decided to leave the commercial dance scene and devote his time releasing gabber. In 2001, he left Mid-Town and Rotterdam Records to start a new record label at Rige Entertainment, called Offensive Records. To this day, Paul still releases hardcore on this imprint in his own typical style. ==References== == External links == *Discogs page Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch DJs Category:Happy hardcore musicians Category:Musicians from The Hague ","title":"DJ Paul Elstak"},{"id":"1443271","text":"Laws of succession govern the order of succession to various monarchies.

And not > long after that the Earl's son, and Toirdhelbhach, the son of Donnchadh > O'Briain, were hanged; and on Corpus Christi the Earl's son was hanged, and > O'Briain's son was hanged on the morrow. ==Mayor of Galway== Martyn served as Mayor of Galway from September 1586 to September 1587. He participated in a notorious session in December 1586, as recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters: > A session was held at Galway in the month of December of this year, and many > women and men were put to death at it; and Edmond Oge, the son of Edmond, > son of Manus Mac Sheehy, and eight soldiers of the Geraldines along with > him, were put to death, information having been given against them that they > had been along with those Scots who were slain at Ardnarea. ==Later life== William √ìge also served as an interlocutor between the O'Flaherty's of Connemara and the administration in Dublin Castle in 1585 and 1586, and again in 1589 and 1590, when they rose in rebellion. He enjoyed a good working relationship with Murrough na dTuadh √ì Flaithbheartaigh.

He has also been the lead singer of the David Bowie tribute band the Cybernauts and the Mott the Hoople cover band Down 'n' Outz. He is one of the two original members of Def Leppard and one of the three to perform on every Def Leppard album. Elliott is known for his distinctive and wide ranging raspy singing voice. ==Early life and Def Leppard== Joseph Thomas Elliott Jr. was born in Sheffield to Joseph William Elliott (1930‚Äì2011) and Cynthia Gibson. He was educated at King Edward VII School. Elliott met Pete Willis (a member of a local band called Atomic Mass) in November 1977 after missing a bus. Upon finding out that they were both musicians, Elliott met the rest of the Atomic Mass members. The band spent hours talking and listening to records in Elliott's bedroom. Elliott tried out as a guitarist and, though the band had not heard Elliott sing, they were impressed by \\"his attitude and his ideas about being in a band\\" and he became the band's vocalist instead. The other members also took Elliott's suggestion to change their name to \\"Deaf Leopard.\\" Elliott had invented the name for the band in his youth. Tony Kenning suggested they change the band name to \\"Def Leppard\\" to distinguish them from contemporary punk bands like The Flying Lizards and Boomtown Rats. The band claims that any apparent similarity of the name Led Zeppelin to Def Leppard was unintentional.Fricke, David. 1987. Animal Instinct: The Def Leppard Story. Zomba Books, London. . Elliott soon became an integral part of the band while also contributing his songwriting skills. As a songwriter, Elliott has drawn from his eclectic tastes in music (ranging from pop-rock to folk) as sources of inspiration. He has noted that the lyrics to Def Leppard's music are rarely personal; they are meant to be easily accessible to the listener. He also plays guitar and drums as well as piano and electronic keyboard. Elliott currently hosts a radio show on Planet Rock radio on Saturday nights.Joe Elliott Planetrock.com. Retrieved 27 November 2011. ==Side projects== Elliott has worked with several side projects through his career such as participating in numerous tributes to other artists like Freddie Mercury, Alice Cooper, Mick Ronson, Ian Hunter and David Bowie. He appeared alongside guitarists Brian May and Slash along with the other members of Def Leppard at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992 to perform \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\". Elliott also has worked on several projects including guitarist Ronnie Wood's solo album Slide on This, Lori Spee's Those Faces, Ricky Warwick and The Almighty. Elliott and fellow Def Leppard member Phil Collen once had a side project together called Cybernauts. The project was short-lived, and the internet album that was available online has been deleted since its 2001 release. Released in September 2003 through Sanctuary Records, Ricky Warwick's Tattoos & Alibis was produced by Elliott. Elliott sang the vocals in the Mott the Hoople cover band, Down 'n' Outz on their album My ReGeneration Vol. 1. In 2012, Elliott went on tour with the Rock N Roll All Stars, a band that consisted of many of rock's most recognized performers. The band downsized and became the Kings of Chaos. The primary members with Elliott are Duff McKagan (Guns N' Roses, Velvet Revolver and Loaded), Matt Sorum (Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver), Gilby Clarke (Guns N' Roses), and Steve Stevens (Billy Idol's band). Others who rounded out the group were: Glenn Hughes (Deep Purple) and Sebastian Bach (formerly of Skid Row). The band released the cover song \\"Never Before\\" by Deep Purple. ==Personal life== Elliott currently lives in Stepaside, Dublin, Ireland and also has a residence in Los Angeles. He maintains a recording studio in his Dublin home called Joe's Garage in which he has recorded and produced many major artists. Other artists have also recorded there while he has been on the road with Def Leppard. Elliott is also a Sheffield United fan, having contributed music to the Sheffield-based film When Saturday Comes. Elliott's first marriage was to Karla Ramdhani in 1989; they divorced in 1996. Elliott met Kristine Wunschel in 2003 while she was working on the crew for the X album tour, and they were married on 1 September 2004. Their first child, Finlay, was born in December 2009 and are also parents to a daughter, Lyla, born July 2016. ==Controversies== During a performance on 7 September 1983 in Tucson, Arizona, Elliott attempted to rile the crowd during the \\"Rock of Ages\\" crowd sing-a-long. He told the crowd: \\"Last night, we played in El Paso, that place with all the greasy Mexicans, and they made a lot more noise than that.\\" Then, on 30 September he apologized on an El Paso radio station for the racial slur he made while referring to the city on 7 September. The band later followed up the apology with donations to Hispanic charities. In 2008, Def Leppard performed live on stage at a Detroit Red Wings ice hockey game. Midway through the set, Red Wing forward Darren McCarty drove a motorcycle across the stage with the Stanley Cup on the back. Another Detroit player, Kyle Quincey, handed the cup to Elliott, who unintentionally placed the Cup upside-down on its stand. Upon realizing his error, Elliott quipped to the crowd, \\"Oh it's upside down. Well never mind. We're soccer boys, what do we know?\\" The incident angered many ice hockey fans. Elliott later said, \\"[E]very other sporting cup I've ever seen, was wider at the top than the base [...] Like most of my fellow Brits, I'd never seen it before until it was handed to me sideways by which time I had a 50/50 chance of getting it right.\\" In 2010, Elliott criticised the British music press, which he accused of ignoring his band and narrowing popular taste: Before a July 2019 show in Hamilton, Ontario, Elliott was recorded on video saying that the city's FirstOntario Centre \\"stinks like 10,000 asses\\". The video surfaced in January 2020. == Discography == ;With Def Leppard *The Def Leppard E.P.

Commissioned in 1976, the ship was built by Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company of Seattle, Washington along with sister ship, . Homeported in Seattle, Polar Star operates under the control of Pacific Area and coordinates its operations through the Ice Operations Section of the United States Coast Guard. After Polar Sea was deactivated in 2010, Polar Star became the US's only heavy icebreaker, the Coast Guard's other icebreaker, , is classified as a medium icebreaker. Polar Stars current commanding officer is Captain William Woityra. ==Design== Polar Star uses four different methods of electronic navigation to overcome the difficulties of high-latitude operations, and a computerized propulsion control system to effectively manage six diesel-powered propulsion generators, three diesel-powered ship's service generators, three propulsion gas turbines, and other equipment vital to the smooth operation of the ship. The extensive use of automation and low maintenance materials have greatly reduced staffing requirements. Polar Stars three shafts are turned by either a diesel-electric or gas turbine prime mover. Each shaft is connected to a diameter, four-bladed, controllable-pitch propeller. The diesel-electric plant can produce , and the gas turbine plant a total of . Polar Star has sufficient hull strength to absorb the high-powered ice breaking common to her operations. The shell plating and associated internal support structure are fabricated from steel that has especially good low-temperature strength. The portion of the hull designed to break ice is thick in the bow and stern sections, and thick amidships. The hull strength is produced almost entirely from the internal support structure. Polar Stars hull shape is designed to maximize icebreaking by efficiently combining the forces of the ship's forward motion, the downward pull of gravity on the bow, and the upward push of the inherent buoyancy of the stern. The curved bow allows Polar Star to ride up on the ice, using the ship's weight to break the ice. The 13,000-ton (13,200-metric ton) Polar Star is able to break through ice up to thick by backing and ramming, and can steam continuously through of ice at . Polar Star alongside her sister ship near McMurdo Station, Antarctica. In the past, an installed heeling system could rock the ship to prevent getting stuck in the ice. The system consisted of three pairs of connected tanks on opposite sides of the ship. Pumps transferred a tank's contents of 35,000 US gallons () to an opposing tank in 50 seconds and generate 24,000 foot-tons (65 MN¬∑m) of torque on the ship. This system has since been removed due to maintenance issues. The crew of 15 officers and 126 enlisted have access to four sizable lounges, a library, a gymnasium, and a small ship's store. The ship also has its own U.S. Post Office, satellite pay telephones, amateur radio equipment, a computer lounge (for Internet access, distance learning, et cetera), and movie library. Polar Star can accommodate two HH-65 Dolphin helicopters during major deployments. They support scientific parties, do ice reconnaissance, cargo transfer, and search and rescue as required. The Aviation Detachment used to come from the Polar Operations Division (POPDIV) at the Coast Guard Aviation Training Center in Mobile, Alabama, but POPDIV has since been disbanded due to an overhaul on the HH-65 Dolphin airframe. ==Operations== The upward angle of Polar Stars bow is designed so that the hull rides up onto the ice surface during icebreaking operations. Subsequently the ship's weight and forward motion combine to fracture the ice. Polar Star has a variety of missions while operating in polar regions. During Antarctic deployments, the primary missions include breaking a channel through the sea ice to resupply the McMurdo Research Station in the Ross Sea. Resupply ships use the channel to bring food, fuel, and other goods to make it through another winter. In addition to these duties, Polar Star also serves as a scientific research platform with five laboratories and accommodations for up to 20 scientists. The \\"J\\"-shaped cranes and work areas near the stern and port side of ship give scientists the capability to do at-sea studies in the fields of geology, volcanology, oceanography, sea-ice physics, and other disciplines. The crew consists of personnel trained in navigation, engineering, welding, machinery repair, electronics, boat handling, firefighting, damage control, underwater diving, medicine, and other special skills. ==Reserve status, overhaul and reactivation== Under a 2006 law, since the vessels were designated primarily as research vessels, the National Science Foundation pays for and runs the United States' ice breaking vessels, using Coast Guard crews. On 30 June 2006, the USCG placed Polar Star in \\"Commission-Special\\" status in Seattle. This caretaker status required a reduced crew of 44 to keep the ship ready for a possible return to the ice. In 2009, the NSF announced that they would end funding for maintaining Polar Star. A 26 February 2008 report by the Congressional Research Service estimated a US$400 million cost for a 25-year service life extension refit for Polar Star, a US$56 million cost for an 8 to 10-year service life extension refit or US$8.2 million cost for a single season service life extension refit. In March 2010, United States Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen announced that Polar Star would receive a $62 million overhaul, to be complete by December 2012. On 14 December 2012, The United States Coast Guard announced the reactivation of Polar Star. The overhaul of Polar Star took four years and was completed by Seattle's Vigor Industrial shipyard (formerly Todd Pacific shipyard), cost US$57 million. The 34-year-old ship would undergo testing in 2013 before once again plying the frozen Arctic regions. Polar Star was back in operation in late 2013, and assigned to Antarctic operations as part of Operation Deep Freeze in early 2014. The icebreaker was dispatched from Sydney on January 4, 2014 to attempt a rescue of the Russian research ship and Chinese icebreaking research vessel Xuƒõ L√≥ng trapped at that time in Antarctic ice, the former since 24 December 2013. and However, on 8 January 2014 the Australian Maritime Safety Authority confirmed that Polar Star had been released to scheduled duties as both vessels had broken free and were proceeding to open water. In February 2015 Polar Star was involved in the rescue of the Australian fishing vessel Antarctic Chieftain, towing the ship and 27 crew to safety, through ocean ice and snow nearly deep in the Southern Ocean. In February 2017, fire crews from Polar Star were made available to help the New Zealand Fire Service and NZDF Fire Crews in fighting against the Christchurch Port Hills Fires in Christchurch, New Zealand. Polar Star is the only ship in the United States' fleet large enough to break the heavy sea ice to access McMurdo, the U.S. research station in Antarctica. However, as of 2017, this 40-year-old vessel is sometimes referred to as a \\"rust bucket\\" by members of her crew, signalling a need for further overhaul or replacement. Some spare parts have become so hard to find that crew members are reportedly sourcing them from eBay. During the 2017-2018 Antarctic season Polar Star suffered serious technical problems. On January 11, 2018 one of the cutter's three main gas turbines failed; although these are used to provide the power required for breaking up multiyear ice, local conditions allowed the ship to continue with only two turbines. Five days later a shaft seal failed, flooding the engine room; the crew were able to effect repairs and pump out the flooded space. The supply mission to McMurdo was successfully completed. On February 10, 2019 the crew of Polar Star battled a nighttime blaze for almost two hours before it was extinguished. The fire erupted in Polar Stars garbage incinerator room about north of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. No one was injured. ==References== * * * U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The Field) is a diverse middle-class neighborhood in West Philadelphia. Its borders are 53rd Street at Jefferson to the south, Philadelphia's Fairmount Park to the east, City Avenue (commonly referred to as \\"City Line\\") to the north and the Amtrak Main Line tracks to the west. Surrounding neighborhoods include Bala Cynwyd to the north, Wynnefield Heights and Belmont Village to the east, Parkside to the south, and Overbrook to the west.http://www.philaplanning.org/cpdiv/WPPpartTwo.pdf Page 5, Retrieved 10-31-2010. Its main commercial arteries are North 54th Street, Bryn Mawr Avenue (2200 block), and City Avenue. It is the home of the television station WPHL-TV (MY PHL 17). It also has connections to the motion picture industry. Wynnefield is the childhood home of actor and rapper Will Smith, film producer Lee Daniels (Monster's Ball and The Woodsman), film director Charles Stone III, politico and former Big Brother reality-TV contestant Will Mega and documentary filmmaker Tigre Hill. Local politicians with Wynnefield ties include Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter, former mayor Wilson Goode, city councilman Curtis Jones, Jr, and councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown. ==History== Like the nearby suburban community of Wynnewood, Wynnefield takes its name from William Penn's physician, Thomas Wynne, who built his home Wynnestay at 52nd Street and Woodbine Avenue in 1690. The former Woodside Amusement Park was located in nearby Fairmount Park and is now the separate community of Wynnefield Heights. Before Wynnefield's expansion in the early twentieth century, it was largely a rural and undeveloped area of farms dating back to the late 1600s. However, this changed with the construction of the Market-Frankford Elevated Train and the various trolley lines. With the creation of the lines it suddenly became easier for people to live farther from their jobs, and into the undeveloped areas of the city. Today, all but one of Philadelphia's trolley lines are exclusively operational in West Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, the Jewish-American community were discriminated in certain neighborhoods in Philadelphia, prompting them to create their own community in Wynnefield. From about 1900, Wynnefield was considered an upscale and was considered a predominately Jewish-American community. However, there were large groups of non-Jewish immigrants from Russia, Germany, and other Eastern European countries that formed the Wynnefield community. In the 1920s Wynnefield expanded again, through the purchasing of rural lots, and their conversion into smaller plotted neighborhoods of row houses. Additional streets, such as Diamond Street were put in 1923 and additional row housing increasing the population of the neighborhood. German-Catholics moved into the neighborhood, prompting the founding of Saint Barbara's Roman Catholic Church in January 1921 on Georges Lane and Lebanon Ave near 54th Street. Until the 1960s, an area near Wynnefield, Bala Cynwyd, across City Avenue in Lower Merion Township, was known as an upscale shopping district. Small, local boutiques thrived alongside of The Blum Store, Bonwit Teller, and Lord & Taylor. Betty's hat shop was a popular destination for the Main Line elite and Jackie Kennedy fans. Suburbanites would bring their families to spend the day shopping and to enjoy a meal at local haunts such as Pub Tiki and Williamson's Restaurant. Women from areas such as nearby Bucks County would ride into Bala Cynwyd on SEPTA buses, donning their best garb and wearing their white gloves. In the mid-1960s, the neighborhood began the transition into being largely African American. As of 2006, changes to the neighborhood include the expansion of St. Joseph's University, and an influx of students and new residents of non- African descent moving into the area. Today Wynnefield closely parallels highly regarded Mt. Airy as being one of the most racially diverse neighborhoods in Philadelphia with current demographics of 64.7% Black and 28.4% Caucasian as compared to Mt. Airy's 62.5% Black and 31.7% Caucasian. Much of the development of Wynnefield after the 1960s is due to the influence of the late Katie B. Jackson (1929‚Äì1993). Known by the African-American community as \\"Queen of Wynnefield,\\" Jackson founded the Wynnefield Academy, a private, co-educational PK-4 elementary school in 1975. The Katie B. Jackson Development Corporation and Katie B. Jackson Senior Citizens Complex bear her name. Har Zion Synagogue, built at 54th & Wynnefield Ave in 1924, was a longtime resident of the area before moving to larger facilities in Penn Valley, PA in 1976. The William Mann School and Wynnestay are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Education== ===Colleges and universities=== Saint Joseph's University is just outside the neighborhood.

He was the principal songwriter and lead guitarist for the English hard rock band Def Leppard, until 1991, when he died from alcohol poisoning. In 2007, Clark was ranked No. 11 on Classic Rock Magazine's \\"100 Wildest Guitar Heroes\\". In 2019, Clark was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Def Leppard. ==Biography== ===Childhood and adolescence=== Stephen Maynard Clark was born and raised in Hillsborough, Sheffield, to Barrie & Beryl (nee Beckingham) Clark. From an early age, he showed an interest in music, attending his first concert featuring Cliff Richard and the Shadows at age 6. At 11, he received his first guitar which was purchased by his father on the condition that he learn to play. Clark studied classical guitar for a year before he first heard the music of Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin at a friend's house. When Clark left school his first employer was an engineering firm called GEC Traction where he worked as a lathe operator. He was three years into a four-year apprenticeship with the firm at the time Def Leppard was signed to a record deal with Phonogram Records. ===Career with Def Leppard=== Before joining Def Leppard in 1978, Clark played cover songs with his small band, Electric Chicken, in Sheffield. Around that time, he met Pete Willis (Def Leppard's original guitarist and founder) at a technical college. Willis spotted Clark reading a guitar book and asked if he played. He then invited Clark to come and audition for his band, as they were looking to add a second guitarist. Clark never showed up, but when Willis and singer Joe Elliott bumped into Clark again at a Judas Priest gig, Willis re-issued his invitation. Clark finally came down to their rehearsal room and joined Def Leppard in January 1978. According to Elliott in Behind the Music, Clark auditioned for Def Leppard by playing all of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\" without accompaniment. While a member of Def Leppard, Clark contributed to over 90% of the music.Goldmine Magazine June 1993 and The Sun Newspaper January 9th 1991 Clark and Pete Willis shared lead-guitar duties, and Clark was nicknamed \\"The Riffmaster\\" due to his amazing talent and ability to come up with some of the coolest guitar riffs in modern rock.according to Joe Elliott in VH1's Classic Albums series featuring Def Leppard's Hysteria Toward the end of the Pyromania recording sessions, Pete Willis was asked to leave, and guitarist Phil Collen was recruited into the band to replace him. Clark and Collen quickly bonded, becoming close friends and leading to the trademark dual-guitar sound of Def Leppard. He and Collen became known as the \\"Terror Twins\\" in recognition of their close friendship and alcohol-fuelled antics off-stage. Part of their success as a duo was attributed to their ability to swap between rhythm and lead guitar, often both playing lead or both doing rhythm within the same song.on the BBC's Classic Albums show The fact that they came from entirely different musical backgrounds also contributed to their unique guitar partnership. Clark was a classically-trained musician who knew the rules of music and could read and write music and understood the theory and science of the art, as well as studying/being influenced by Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin, whereas Collen, like Willis, was self-taught and developed his fast, alternate-picking technique from studying Al Di Meola and listening to Jazz players. Steve Clark: \\"I do read and write and I know the rules of music which is great in a two-guitar band because we're so different in our approach to playing. Phil will play something if it sounds right, whereas I look at things and say: 'it's wrong to play that note; it's not musically correct.'‚ÄùInterview with Steve Clark & Phil Collen - December 1983 - Kerrang! magazine Whereas Collen stopped drinking alcohol during the mid-1980s in pursuit of a healthier lifestyle, Clark never managed to escape his addiction to alcohol. Clark primarily played Gibson Guitars during his career and signed an endorsement with Gibson sometime before the commencement of the Hysteria World Tour. Gibson made some custom-specification guitars for Clark. He was occasionally seen playing other guitars, including a Fender Stratocaster for the song and video \\"Love Bites\\". Clark would also use Fenders in the studio occasionally, due to their unique sound. Clark always stated that he was more of a traditionalist when it came to guitars.Metal Hammer Magazine Fan Pull-Out 1988 This can be seen in his selection of gear. At the time of his death, it was estimated that he owned approximately 75 guitars. Although his name appears on many songwriting credits for Def Leppard's 1992 album, Adrenalize, he did not contribute much to the recording of the album. In the liner notes of the Adrenalize deluxe edition, Joe Elliot claims that a few riffs Clark had demoed were used in a couple of places on the album. His only other contribution was a thumbs up here and there and stating something the rest of the band was working on was \\"cool.\\" Collen and Clark began working on what would become the song \\"White Lightning\\" during the recording sessions for the 1992 album, Adrenalize. Completed after Clark's death, the song described the effects of Clark's alcohol and drug addictions. ===Personal life=== Clark was engaged to an American model, Lorelei Shellist, the two having been together seven years. Shellist revealed in her autobiography, Runway Runaway, that Clark's addictions played a major role in their breakup. ===Death=== At the time of his death, Clark was on a six-month leave of absence from Def Leppard. On 8 January 1991, Clark was found dead on his couch by his girlfriend. He was 30 years old. The postmortem revealed that the cause of death was respiratory failure caused by a lethal mixture of alcohol and prescription drugs.Steve Clark Autopsy/Coroners Report 1991. At the time of his death, Clark had a blood alcohol level of .30 and morphine in his system. Daniel Van Alphen, Clark's drinking companion the night before, testified that they went to a local pub and returned to Clark's home at midnight to watch a video. He was buried at Wisewood Cemetery located in Loxley, Sheffield, near the Clark family estate.

The descendant of Herveus, Sir Robert de Keith (d.1332), was confirmed in the office of Great Marischal of Scotland by King Robert the Bruce around 1324. Robert de Keith's great-grandson, William, was raised to the Peerage as Earl Marischal by James II in about 1458. The peerage died out when George Keith, the 10th Earl, forfeited it by joining the Jacobite Rising of 1715. The role of the Marischal was to serve as custodian of the Royal Regalia of Scotland, and to protect the king's person when attending parliament. The former duty was fulfilled by the 7th Earl during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, who hid them at Dunnottar Castle. The role of regulation of heraldry carried out by the English Earl Marshal is carried out in Scotland by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The separate office of Knight Marischal was first created for the Scottish coronation of King Charles I in 1633. The office is not heritable, although it has been held by members of the Keith family. The title was forfeited in 1715, due to the last Earl's participation in the Jacobite Rising. ==Marischals and Great Marischals of Scotland== # Hervey de Keith (d. c. 1196) # Philip de Keith (d. c. 1225), paternal grandson of Hervey de Keith, older brother of David de Keith # David de Keith, paternal grandson of Hervey de Keith, younger brother of Philip de Keith (co-jointly with his brother above and paternal nephew below) # Hervey de Keith (d. c. 1250), paternal nephew of David de Keith # Richard de Keith (fl. 12??)Surtees Society; Three Early Assize Rolls for the County of Northumberland 1891; pages 204-205 # David de Keith (fl. 1269)Surtees Society; Three Early Assize Rolls for the County of Northumberland 1891; pages 204-205 # John de Keith (d. c. 1270) # William de Keith (d. c. 1293) # Sir Robert Keith (d. 1332) # Sir Robert Keith (d. 1346) # Sir Edward Keith (d. c. 1351) # Sir William Keith (d. c. 1410) # Sir Robert Keith (d. c. 1430) ==Earls Marischal of Scotland (c. 1458)== # William Keith, 1st Earl Marischal (d. 1483)Marischal, Earl (S, 1458 - forfeited 1716) Cracroft's PeerageMcGladdery, C.

Postcodes can directly affect the services an area can obtain, such as insurance prices. Despite having many non-postal uses, postcodes are only determined based on Royal Mail operations and bear little relation to local government boundaries. More broadly, there is an unequal provision of services around the country, especially in public services, such as access to cancer drugs in the healthcare system or quality of education. These are more likely to be a result of local budgets and decision-making than actual postcodes. Postcodes were devised solely for the purposes of sorting and directing mail and rarely coincide with political boundaries. However, over time they have become a geographical reference in their own right with postcodes and postcode groups becoming synonymous with certain towns and districts. Further to this, the postcode has been used by organisations for other applications including government statistics, marketing, calculation of car and household insurance premiums and credit referencing. == Changing postcodes == There are several groups, mostly on the fringes of major population centres, who are affected in one way or another by the associations of their postcode. There is a movement in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead to change the first two characters of their postcodes from to WM for vanity, so as not to be associated with Slough. A businessman in Ilford wishes to have the postcode district of changed to as he claims customers do not realise his business is based in London. Some residents of West Heath in asked to have their postcodes changed to that of adjacent Bexleyheath, citing higher insurance premiums as reason to change. Some residents of Kingston Vale in wish to have their postcodes changed to adjacent Kingston upon Thames for the same reasons. In all these cases Royal Mail has said that there is \\"virtually no hope\\" of changing the postcode, referring to their policy of changing postcodes only to match changes in their operations. Under this policy residents of the Wirral Peninsula had their postcodes changed from the (Liverpool) to (Chester) group when a new sorting office was opened. Some postcode areas straddle England's borders with Wales and Scotland. Examples of such postcodes include , , and .

The following year, at the age of eighteen, he became a member of Waller's band. He made many recordings with the band, and he is noted for having played the solo in \\"Buck Jumpin'\\". After Waller's death in 1943, he led his own trio. For two consecutive years in the 1940s, he was voted best guitarist in Esquire magazine. Beginning in 1957, he was a member of a rhythm and blues band led by King Curtis. Four years later he dropped out of music, though he returned in the 1970s to record with Helen Humes and Jay McShann. Another absence followed until 1981, when he returned to music to play with the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band. He died of colon cancer on September 11, 2005.

Ferrocement hull under construction A particularly fair ferrocement vessel, the staysail schooner \\"Rich Harvest\\" Ferrocement or ferro-cement Sometimes erroneously called called thin-shell concrete or ferro- concrete is a system of construction using reinforced mortarGani, M.

Print. or plaster (lime or cement, sand and water) applied over an \\"armature\\" of metal mesh, woven expanded-metal or metal-fibers and closely spaced thin steel rods such as rebar. The metal commonly used is iron or some type of steel. The cement is typically a very rich mix of cement and sand in a 3:1 ratio; and when used for building boats no gravel is used, so that the material is not concrete. Ferrocement is used to construct relatively thin, hard, strong surfaces and structures in many shapes such as hulls for boats, shell roofs, and water tanks. Ferrocement originated in the 1840s in France and the Netherlands and is the origin of reinforced concrete. It has a wide range of other uses including sculpture and prefabricated building components. The term \\"ferrocement\\" has been applied by extension to other composite materials, including some containing no cement and no ferrous material. The \\"Mulberry harbours\\" used in the D-Day landings were made of ferrocement, and their remains may still be seen at resorts like Arromanches. Ferro Cement is made with wire mesh of diameter 0.5mm to 1 mm reinforced between cement mortar of ratio 3:1 of cement and sand. ==Definitions== Cement and concrete are used interchangeably but there are technical distinctions and the meaning of cement has changed since the mid-nineteenth century when ferrocement originated. Ferro- means iron although metal commonly used in ferro-cement is the iron alloy steel. Cement in the nineteenth century and earlier meant mortar Chambers, William, and James Donald, eds. \\"cement\\", Chambers's Etymological Dictionary of the English Language.

Mortar is a paste of a binder (usually Portland cement), sand and water; and concrete is a fluid mixture of Portland cement, sand, water and crushed stone aggregate which is poured into formwork (shuttering). Ferro-concrete is the original name of reinforced concrete (armored concrete) known at least since the 1890s and in 1903 it was well described in London's Society of Engineer's JournalAugustus de Rohan Galbraith, \\"The Hennebique System of Ferro-Concrete Construction\\". Journal, P. F. Nursey, ed. Society of Engineers. London. E & F. N.Spon. 1903. 177-208. Print. but is now widely confused with ferrocement. ==History== The inventors of ferrocement are Frenchmen Joseph Monier who dubbed it \\"ciment arm√©\\" (armored cement) and Joseph-Louis Lambot who constructed a boat with the system in 1848.Nedwell, P. J.. Ferrocement: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Ferrocement. UMIST, Manchester, 6‚Äì9 September 1994. London: E & FN Spon, 1994. 28-30. Print. Lambot exhibited the vessel at the Exposition Universelle in 1855 and his name for the material \\"ferciment\\" stuck. Lambot patented his boat in 1855 but the patent was granted in Belgium and only applied to that country. At the time of Monier's first patent, July 1867, he planned to use his material to create urns, planters, and cisterns. These implements were traditionally made from ceramics, but large-scale, kiln-fired projects were expensive and prone to failure. In 1875, Monier expanded his patents to include bridges and designed his first steel-and-concrete bridge. The outer layer was sculpted to mimic rustic logs and timbers, thereby also ushering faux bois (fake wood) concrete. In the first half of the twentieth century Italian Pier Luigi Nervi was noted for his use of ferro-cement, in Italian called ferro-cemento. \\"ferrocement\\" being referred to as ferro-concrete or reinforced concrete to better describe the end product instead of its components. Ferro concrete has relatively good strength and resistance to impact. When used in house construction in developing countries, it can provide better resistance to fire, earthquake, and corrosion than traditional materials, such as wood, adobe and stone masonry. It has been popular in developed countries for yacht building because the technique can be learned relatively quickly, allowing people to cut costs by supplying their own labor. In the 1930s through 1950's, it became popular in the United States as a construction and sculpting method for novelty architecture, examples of which are the Cabazon Dinosaurs and the works of Albert Vrana. == Construction formwork == The desired shape may be built from a multi-layered construction of mesh, supported by an armature, or grid, built with rebar and tied with wire. For optimum performance, steel should be rust- treated, (galvanized) or stainless steel. Over this finished framework, an appropriate mixture (grout or mortar) of Portland cement, sand and water and/or admixtures is applied to penetrate the mesh. During hardening, the assembly may be kept moist, to ensure that the concrete is able to set and harden slowly and to avoid developing cracks that can weaken the system. Steps should be taken to avoid trapped air in the internal structure during the wet stage of construction as this can also create cracks that will form as it dries. Trapped air will leave voids that allow water to collect and degrade (rust) the steel. Modern practice often includes spraying the mixture at pressure (a technique called shotcrete) or some other method of driving out trapped air. Older structures that have failed offer clues to better practices. In addition to eliminating air where it contacts steel, modern concrete additives may include acrylic liquid \\"admixtures\\" to slow moisture absorption and increase shock resistance to the hardened product or to alter curing rates. These technologies, borrowed from the commercial tile installation trade, have greatly aided in the restoration of these structures.fauxboisconcrete.info Chopped glass or poly fiber can be added to reduce crack development in the outer skin. (Chopped fiber could inhibit good penetration of the grout to steel mesh constructions. This should be taken into consideration and mitigated, or limited to use on outer subsequent layers. Chopped fibers may also alter or limit some wet sculpting techniques.) ==Economics== The economic advantage of ferro concrete structures is that they are stronger and more durable than some traditional building methods. Ferro concrete structures can be built quickly, which can have economic advantages. In India, ferro concrete is used often because the constructions made from it are more resistant to earthquakes. Earthquake resistance is dependent on good construction technique. In the 1970s, designers adapted their yacht designs to the then very popular backyard building scheme of building a boat using ferrocement. Its big attraction was that for minimum outlay and costs, a reasonable application of skill, an amateur could construct a smooth, strong and substantial yacht hull. A ferro-cement hull can prove to be of similar or lower weight than a fiber reinforced plastic (fiberglass), aluminum, or steel hull. There are basically three types of methods of ferrocement. They are following #Armature system: In this method the skeleton steel is welded to the desired shape on either of sides of which are tied several layers of stretched meshes. This is strong enough, so that mortar can be filled in by pressing for one side and temporarily supporting from the other side. Filling in of mortar can also be administered by pressing in the mortar from both the sides. In this method the skeletal steel (bars) are at centre of the section and as such they add to the dead weight of without any contribution to strength. #Closed mould systems: Several layers of meshes are tied together against the surface of the mould which holds them in position while mortar is being filled in. The mould may be removed after curing or may remain in position as a permanent part of a finished structure. If the mould is to be removed for reuse, releasing agent must be used. #Integrated mould system: Using minimum reinforcement any integral mould is first to be considered to act as a framework. On this mould layers of meshes are fixed on either side and plastering is done onto them from both sides. As the name suggests, the mould remains permanently as an integral part of the finished structure. (e.g. double T-sections for flooring, roofing, etc.) Precaution should be taken to have firm connection between the mould and the layers filled in later, so that finished product as a whole integral structural unit. ==Advantages== The advantages of a well built ferro concrete construction are the low weight, maintenance costs and long lifetime in comparison with purely steel constructions.Jackson, G and Sutherland, W. Concrete Boatbuilding. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, 1969, p43 However, meticulous building precision is considered crucial here. Especially with respect to the cementitious composition and the way in which it is applied in and on the framework, and how or if the framework has been treated to resist corrosion. When a ferro concrete sheet is mechanically overloaded, it will tend to fold instead of break or crumble like stone or pottery. As a container, it may fail and leak but possibly hold together. Much depends on techniques used in the construction. Using the example of the Mulberry Harbours, pre-fabricated units could be made for ports (such as Jamestown on St Helena) where conventional civil engineering is difficult. ==Disadvantages== The disadvantage of ferro concrete construction is the labor-intensive nature of it, which makes it expensive for industrial application in the western world. In addition, threats to degradation (rust) of the steel components is a possibility if air voids are left in the original construction, due to too dry a mixture of the concrete being applied, or not forcing the air out of the structure while it is in its wet stage of construction, through vibration, pressurized spraying techniques, or other means. These air voids can turn to pools of water as the cured material absorbs moisture. If the voids occur where there is untreated steel, the steel will rust and expand, causing the system to fail. In modern practice, the advent of liquid acrylic additives and other advances to the grout mixture, create slower moisture absorption over the older formulas, and also increase bonding strength to mitigate these failures. Restoration steps should include treatment to the steel to arrest rust, using practices for treating old steel common in auto body repair. ===Insurance issues=== During the 1960s in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, home boatbuilders realised that, for a given budget, ferrocement enabled a much larger hull than otherwise. However, some builders failed to realise that hull forms only a minor part of the overall cost because a larger boat would have very much higher fitting-out costs. Consequently, several homebuilt ferrocement boats became unfinished projects, or if finished, then badly executed, overweight, lumpy \\"horrors\\". Realising that their boats were not merely disappointing but also unsaleable, some builders insured their boats and deliberately scuppered them for compensation. Insurance companies have long memories of such frauds, and today, even for well-built ferrocemment boats, it has become difficult to get insurance cover for third-party risks, while comprehensive cover is virtually unattainable. ==See also== * Types of concrete * Fran√ßois Henn√©bique * Fran√ßois Coignet * Faux Bois * Concrete ship == References == ==External links== * Ferrocement Educational Network * Barcos de ferrocemento (in spanish) Category:Building materials Category:Reinforced concrete Category:Sculpture materials Category:Soil-based building materials Category:Cement ","title":"Ferrocement"},{"id":"1443371","text":"Colin Emerle is the bass player for Echo Orbiter.

The expedition was organised by regular Everest expedition leader Eric Simonson and advised by researcher Jochen Hemmleb, with a team of climbers from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Hemmleb's investigations of sketchy reports of earlier sightings and photographs had led him to identify what he believed was the area in which Irvine's body lay, some distance below where his ice axe had been found by Percy Wyn-Harris on the expedition led by Hugh Ruttledge in 1933. The team hoped in particular to find a camera on Irvine's body which, had the pair been successful, should have contained a picture of the summit. After commencing the search on 1 May 1999, Conrad Anker mistakenly got off course and, surprisingly, found Mallory's body, not Irvine's. Mallory lay face-down, arms outstretched as if to break a sliding fall, with one broken leg and a serious wound to the skull, but otherwise very well-preserved. It seemed probable that he had been a victim of a fall while roped to Irvine. The body was only an hour or two from the safety of their camp. Many artefacts were found on the body, including a pocket knife, altimeter, and snow-goggles, but no camera. Three discoveries in particular fuel continuing speculation: *First, a pair of goggles were in Mallory's pocket, suggesting he was descending at night when he fell (though he may have had a second pair, ripped off in his fall). *Second, on an envelope he had noted the amounts of oxygen in each of their cylinders, figures which suggest a slight possibility that the pair may have taken three cylinders on their final climb, rather than two as generally believed. *Finally, it was the absence of an item which was perhaps most intriguing; it had been reported that Mallory carried a photograph of his beloved wife Ruth with him which he planned to place on the summit in the event of success; it was not found among his remaining personal possessions. The expedition interred Mallory where he lay. ==Subsequent expeditions== During a second expedition in 2001, most of the 1999 team returned to search further. Many discoveries were made, including nearly every pre-World War II camp on the mountain. Jake Norton and Brent Okita re- discovered the 1924 Camp VI, last occupied by Mallory and Irvine. Eventually, the team abandoned their search for Irvine to rescue several other climbing parties stranded on the mountain and in deep distress. The victims included two Chinese glaciologists, three Russian climbers, an American guide, and his Guatemalan client. Several of the climbers were suffering from high altitude cerebral oedema, a condition where the victim can hallucinate, lose balance, and eventually become unable to walk, due to lack of oxygen (which, high up on Everest, is only one-third the partial pressure of oxygen at sea level) in the brain. This condition has led to many deaths and injuries in mountaineering. In early 2004, Jake Norton and Dave Hahn returned to Everest with a film team and support from Sherpas Danuru and Tashi to look once more for evidence of Irvine and answers to what happened to Mallory and Irvine in 1924. While the team was able to scour the Yellow Band, the combination of a small team and uncooperative weather eliminated most chances of a major discovery. During that same season, search parties were on the mountain from the website EverestNews, as well as an expedition led by Russell Brice, which included Graham Hoyland (Howard Somervell's grand-nephew and member of the 1999 Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition). In 2007, the Altitude Everest Expedition led by Conrad Anker, who had found Mallory's body, tried to retrace Mallory's last steps. Jochen Hemmleb led another search expedition in 2010, examining new terrain on the Northeast Ridge, specifically near a feature called \\"The Worts.\\" Nothing of consequence was discovered. ==See also== *List of Mount Everest expeditions ==External links== * 1999 Mallory & Irvine Research Expedition website by MountainZone * 1999 Mallory & Irvine Research Expedition website by PBS/NOVA * 1999 Mallory & Irvine Research Expedition website by AFFIMER * Mallory and Irvine Research expedition 2001 * Mallory and Irvine Research expedition 2004 * Mallory's body shortly after its discovery on May 1, 1999 * Mallery and Irvine team member Jochen Hemmleb Interview *Mallery and Irvine team member Jake Norton Interview 1999 ","title":"Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition"},{"id":"1443381","text":"Anand Ratan Yadav (Marathi: ‡§Ü‡§®‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§∞‡§§‡§® ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§µ; 30 November 1935 ‚Äì 27 November 2016) was a Marathi writer from Maharashtra, India.

It was the Brazilian variant of the Fiat 127. Some were also built by Sevel in Argentina (where later models were named Fiat Spazio, Br√≠o and Vivace) until 1996, and assembly also took place in Colombia, Uruguay, and Venezuela. ==Brazil== During the two decades that followed the Second World War, the available fuels in Europe had featured progressively higher octane ratings, and compression ratios of European cars had increased correspondingly. However, the cheaper (so called yellow grade) petrol widely distributed in Brazil in 1976 had an octane rating of just 73, so for Brazil it was necessary to use a relatively low compression ratio of 7.2 to 1. In order to provide adequate power with the lower compression ratio, a larger engine was needed, and the Fiat 147 was launched with a unit with a five- bearing crankshaft in place of the , three-bearing engine that then was still standard in the 127s from Turin. Press reports of the time reported that the larger engine produced a much smoother and quieter drive as well as enhanced torque. The engine, along with some of the revised bodyshell elements of the 147 (most notably the rear three-quarter panels) were later introduced on the Series 2 version of the 127 itself, when it was released in Europe a year later. Early (1978) Fiat 147 The first facelift version of the 147 (Italy, carrying \\"127\\" labels) The 147 was the first modern car to use ethanol (E100) as fuel instead of petrol. The performance slightly increased and fuel consumption was 30% higher but the cost of the alcohol was a quarter of that of the gasoline because, at that time, petrol had become expensive as a consequence of the 1973 oil crisis. This version was nicknamed \\"cachacinha\\" (little cacha√ßa) because it had the smell of that drink. After having been introduced in the fall of 1976, the lineup was divided into 147, 147 L, and 147 GL in November of the next year. A year later yet the luxurious GLS was added, as was the sporty \\"Racing\\" model, fitted with a 1.3 liter engine. This engine later found its way into the mildly sporting TR (with ), as well as (in lower-tuned form) the 147 CLS, Oggi CS, and Panorama CL. A diesel engine, based on the 1,049 cc unit, was also developed but was only ever marketed abroad, as private car owners in Brazil were not allowed to register diesel cars. This version, complete with face-lifted Brazilian market bodywork, was also exported to Europe as a \\"127\\" beginning in 1981. In 1982, the diesel engine was also added to the \\"Panorama\\" station wagon, which also became available in Europe as a 127.Ward, p. 65 The 147 underwent a number of facelifts during its career. The earliest cars had a front clip similar to the European 127, but later a new, reverse-rake front appearance was developed. Later yet (1983), the front was redesigned to match Fiat's new corporate face as defined by the new Uno. The pre-facelift body remained in use for a few years on the cheapest 147 C ‚Äì to mark the newer versions as different, they received the additional \\"Spazio\\" label: this name later came to replace the \\"147\\" badge in Argentina. Along with the facelift, engine outputs all crept up by a few horsepower. In Venezuela, the Spazio was sold exclusively with the more powerful 72 PS engine as used in the Brazilian TR version. Production of the 147 C continued into 1987, after it had effectively been replaced by the new Uno. A mere 256 cars were built in 1987, however. ===Derivatives=== Based on the Fiat 147 was a saloon called the Fiat Oggi and an estate called the Fiat Panorama. The Panorama arrived first, in April 1980, originally with either the 1.05 or the 1.3 L petrol engines. The Oggi first appeared in the spring of 1983, just after the introduction of the second facelift. There were also van and pick-up versions available, sold as the Fiorino. The Panorama was also available with the diesel engine, mainly for European export but also for assembly in Uruguay, where the Panorama was sold as the Fiat 148. ==Argentinian career== Fiat 147 Sorpasso (IAVA) Argentinian production of the 147, with the Brazilian 1,049 cc engine, began in summer of 1981. In October 1982, the 1,116 cc four-cylinder unit replaced this engine. In May 1983 a five-speed transmissions arrived for the new, somewhat sporty TR 5. This also received a 1.3 liter engine. The 1.3 had already been used for the highly tuned IAVA Sorpasso since 1982, but with a twin carburettor and . With a top speed of , this is the most powerful factory-built 127 derivative ever. 405 Sorpassos were built until 1984. At the opposite end of the spectrum the 147 TRD, fitted with the same diesel engine as Brazilian-built 147s, was added during 1984. In November 1984 the new Spazio appeared, with the same front clip as the second facelift used in Brazil. Big, square headlights and bumpers, along with re-designed taillights and Fiat's current corporate grille made for a much more modern appearance. Engines and equipment levels remained unchanged, although the smaller 1.1 and the diesel disappeared by 1990. The 1.3 was complemented by a larger 1,372 cc version in 1991, this was renamed the Fiat Vivace in 1993. Production continued until 1996. An interesting sub- species was the 1987 Fiat Br√≠o - this utilized the original, pre-facelift, Brazilian bodywork from 1976 for a special bargain version with the 1.1 engine. The Br√≠o was discontinued in 1989. ==Production and markets== A total of 1,269,312 units were produced in Fiat's Brazilian factory in Betim, plus 232,807 units in the Sevel plant of C√≥rdoba, Argentina. This car was also assembled in the CCA plant in Bogot√°, Colombia. A few Fiat 147s were exported to Europe, either with the diesel engine or with the Panorama bodywork. Aside from the two different fronts used (first and second facelift), they can also be differentiated from Italian-built Fiat 127s (and the corresponding Spanish- built Seat 127s) by the extractor vents in the rear three-quarter pillar. ==References== ==External links== * Fiat 147 history 147 Category:Front-wheel- drive vehicles Category:Cars of Brazil Category:Cars of Argentina Category:Cars introduced in 1976 ","title":"Fiat 147"},{"id":"1443392","text":"Michael McManus (born June 11, 1941) is the author of \\"Ethics & Religion\\", a socially conservative but economic liberal syndicated opinion column which appears in several small and mid-range US publications.

The first President, Friedrich Ebert, who had died on 28 February 1925, had been elected indirectly, by the National Assembly, but the Weimar Constitution required that his successor be elected by the \\"whole German people\\". Paul von Hindenburg was elected as the second president of Germany in the second round of voting. Hindenburg was the candidate of a broad coalition of the political right. Many on the right hoped that once in power he would destroy Weimar democracy from the inside and restore the pre-Weimar status quo. The two other candidates who were believed to have a chance of winning were Otto Braun of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Wilhelm Marx of the Centre Party. Both the SPD and Centre were members of the Weimar Coalition, the group of parties regarded as most committed to the Weimar system. Only Marx proceeded to the second round of the election. The election was important because of the turbulent times in which it occurred and because, under the Weimar Constitution, the head of state wielded considerable power. Hindenburg would be again returned in the 1932 election and would play an important role during the rise to power of the Nazi Party. However, many of Hindenburg's 1925 backers were subsequently disappointed. Although in the years that followed his election many questioned the constitutionality of certain of his actions, Hindenburg never attempted to overthrow the Weimar constitution outright. ==Electoral system== During the Weimar Republic the law provided that if no candidate received an absolute majority of votes (i.e. more than half) in the first round of a presidential election then a second ballot would occur in which the candidate with a plurality of votes would be deemed elected. It was permitted for a group to nominate an alternative candidate in the second round. ==First round== Seventeen candidates stood in the first round. Hindenburg was not included among them as he would not be nominated as a candidate until the second round. Instead, the most popular candidate of the political right was Karl Jarres of the German People's Party (DVP), a former Minister of the Interior, Vice-Chancellor of Germany and mayor of Duisburg. Otto Braun, the SPD's candidate, was a former Minister-President of Prussia and a well known and respected figure. Zentrum's candidate, Wilhelm Marx, was the chair of the party and a former chancellor. The other significant candidates were Ernst Th√§lmann of the Communist Party (KPD) and Willy Hellpach of the German Democratic Party (DDP). The German V√∂lkisch Freedom Party (DVFP) put forward Erich Ludendorff but secured only a negligible share of the vote. The first ballot was held on 29 March, with a turnout of 68.9%. { class= style=text-align:right ! colspan=6 400x400px - ! colspan=2 Candidate ! Party ! Supported by !

Although Hindenburg had no interest in seeking public office and was especially uneasy with the prospect of becoming Germany's head of state, he reluctantly agreed to stand, supposedly only after first consulting with the deposed Kaiser. His major supporters were the German People's Party (DVP), the German National People's Party (DNVP) and the Bavarian People's Party (BVP). The DVP, and especially its leader Gustav Stresemann, had reservations about the idea of a Hindenburg presidency because of its possible repercussions for German foreign policy, but eventually came on board. Hinderburg was also endorsed by the German V√∂lkisch Freedom Party (DVFP), the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) and the Agricultural League (RLB). On the left, the Centre Party (Zentrum) refused to support Braun from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) so so Braun withdrew. The SPD agreed to support Zentrum's Marx as the common candidate to ensure the defeat of Hindenburg. The German Democratic Party (DDP) also reluctantly withdrew its candidate and supported Marx. As Marx's supporters included both the moderate left and the political centre, he was believed to have a high chance of winning. The three participants in the second round were therefore Hindenburg, Marx, and Th√§lmann of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). The election was on 26 April, with a turnout of 77.6%. Hindenburg won on a plurality of the vote, with 48.3% to Marx's 45.3%. The BVP's support of Hindenburg, rather than Marx (even though Marx represented the BVP's sister party), and Th√§lmann's participation splitting the left-wing vote, provided Hindenburg the margin of victory. { class= style=text-align:right ! colspan=2 Candidate !

A local Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union representative, Adams was voted in as General Secretary in 1994. Towards the right of the trade union political spectrum, he vigorously opposed the Conservative governments' privatisation of British Rail via the Railways Act 1993, and was attacked and labelled by the right wing tabloids, most famously as \\"The Black Prince of Militancy\\" by the Daily Mail during the 1995 rail strike.Curriculum vitae: Lew Adams BBC News - 19 October 1998 However, in 2004 Adams declared: \\"I was vehement that we wanted to stay in the public sector, and of course there were all the usual concerns trade unionists have regarding privatization, safety issues, job losses, protecting the conditions of service, and pensions. But accepting the will of Parliament, it was time to look at the arguments. So we said to management, ‚ÄòWell, if that‚Äôs what you want, this is what we want.‚Äô Today I cannot argue against the private entrepreneur coming into the rail industry. We are running 1,700 more trains per day since it was privatized. The entrepreneurs built traffic to the extent that we are having to build more infrastructure. What is true is true: 4.2 billion pounds spent on new trains. We never saw that in all the years I‚Äôve been in the rail industry. All the time it was in the public sector, all we got were cuts, cuts, cuts. And today there are more members in the trade union, more train drivers, and more trains running. The reality is that it worked, we‚Äôve protected jobs, and we got more jobs. If a private company is making more money, I look at that from a union‚Äôs point of view, ‚ÄòWell, that looks like a wage increase to me.‚Äô And we can argue that. And the more secure they are and the more productive they are in delivering train services, well, that means more jobs. I was there when the public railways had some 600,000 people and it came down to 100,000 in the time I worked in the rail industry.

His great-grandfather was Romulus Zachariah Linney, a prominent North Carolinian who served in the American Civil War and as a U.S. Congressman. Linney grew up in the town of Madison, Tennessee where his father was a regular M.D. He also lived with his extended family for a few years during the Great Depression in the Linney/Coffey homestead in Boone, North Carolina and returned to the homestead to visit his favorite cousins, the Coffeys, throughout his life. Linney recalled that his mother \\"was a very good amateur actress\\" and when she starred in the Nashville Community Theatre's 1940 production of Our Town as Mrs. Gibbs, he was deeply moved by her performance, particularly by her character's death. \\"I became really connected to my mother and it was the first time I was really shattered by a play. And in many ways that was the beginning. It, in a very visceral way, showed me the profound impact theater can have... Music might give you exultation or something else equally profound, but theater at a great stroke can just shatter you, can break you.\\" Linney's father died of throat cancer when Linney was 13 years old. Linney said about his father's death, \\"I've never gotten over it. My father was a very good man...I think his death is in everything I do. All other experiences in life pall beside the death of a parent you dearly love, when you have to deal with that as a child. No religion can console you for it. Nothing can.\\" After his father's death, Linney and his mother moved to Washington, D.C., where he attended middle school and high school. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Oberlin College and a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Yale School of Drama. He is an alumnus of HB Studio in New York City. He authored three novels, four opera librettos, twenty short stories, and 85 plays which have been staged throughout the United States from South Coast Repertory in California to the Virginia Museum Theater (VMT) in Richmond, and in Europe and Asia. His plays include The Sorrows of Frederick, Holy Ghosts, Childe Byron, Heathen Valley, and an adaptation of Ernest J. Gaines's novel, A Lesson Before Dying, which has been produced in New York and in numerous regional theaters. Many of his plays were set in Appalachia (Tennessee, Holy Ghosts, Sand Mountain, Gint and Heathen Valley), while others focused on historical subjects (The Sorrows of Frederick, King Philip, 2: Goering at Nuremberg). His adaptations for the American stage of several modern foreign classics‚Äîplays and tales from Tolstoy, Chekhov, Ibsen and others‚Äîhave been performed from New York to Minneapolis, and his melding of two novels by Henry Adams into the comedy Democracy was premiered by artistic director Keith Fowler at VMT.Linney, Romulus, Democracy, Dramatists Play Service, Inc., NY, NY. Linney's vivid biographical reconstructions of controversial personalities are remarkable for their power to retain a lifelike vigor‚Äîas in his treatment of Hermann Goering in 2: Goering at Nuremberg, and Lord Byron in Childe Byron.Childe Byron provoked a controversial charge of attempted censorship following its 1977 premiere at VMT in Richmond, Virginia. In 2010 before his death, Linney completed a libretto for an opera based on his first play The Sorrows of Frederick commissioned by The Metropolitan Opera and Lincoln Center Theater. He also completed a full-length play about Alzheimer's disease, Over Martinis, Driving Somewhere, which received a workshop at New York Stage and Film in the summer of 2010. Among Linney's many awards were two Obie awards, one for sustained excellence in play writing; two National Critics Awards; three Drama-Logue Awards; and fellowships from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations, the New York Foundation for the Arts and the National Endowment of the Arts. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which conferred upon him its Award in Literature, Award of Merit and its highest award, the gold medal. He received an honorary doctorates from Oberlin College in 1994, from Appalachian State University in 1995, and from Wake Forest University in 1998. He was a member of the Ensemble Studio Theatre, the Fellowship of Southern Writers, National Theatre Conference, College of Fellows of the American Theatre, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Corporation of Yaddo. Linney had been chair of the MFA Playwriting program at Columbia University‚Äôs School of the Arts and Professor of Playwriting in the Actors Studio MFA Program at The New School in New York. He also taught over the years at Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, Connecticut College, and the Sewanee Writers Conference among others. Linney was the founding playwright of Signature Theatre Company, which named a theater in his honor in the new Signature Center, which opened in 2012. On his birthday September 21, 2012, the University of North Carolina at its Appalachian State University campus in Boone, NC opened his archives for researchers and scholars. ==Death== Romulus Linney died on January 15, 2011, aged 80, from lung cancer at home in Germantown, NY. ==Family== He was the father of two daughters, Susan Linney and actress Laura Linney.Linney, Romulus (2004). \\"Laura Linney\\" , BOMB Magazine.

However, unlike modern limited releases, roadshow releases were presented as major events similar to live theatre productions, and included features such as: * An intermission between the two \\"acts\\" of the film, with the first act frequently longer than the second. * Films that are typically longer than the usual motion picture, lasting anywhere from slightly more than two hours to four hours or more, counting the intermission. * There are no short subjects accompanying the film, and rarely any promotional trailers. * Screenings are limited to one or two a day, sold on a reserved seat basis, and admission prices were always higher than those of regular screenings. The two-screening days were usually limited to Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. During the rest of the week, the films would be shown only once a day. This mimics the performance schedule of live theatre such as Broadway theatre. * Souvenir programs containing photos from the film, photos and biographies of its cast and principal crew, and information on the film's production are sold. * Films are presented in a city for a limited number of weeks before moving to another city. ==U.S. releases== The roadshow format had been used since the days of silent films, but the rise of widescreen and stereophonic sound in the 1950s made it especially attractive to studio executives, who hoped to lure audiences away from television by presenting films in a way that an audience at that time could never hope to see at home. Possibly, the first film ever shown in a roadshow engagement was the French film Les Amours de la reine Elisabeth in America in 1912, a 53-minute motion picture which starred the legendary stage actress Sarah Bernhardt. Films shown in a roadshow format before 1951 included: *The Birth of a Nation (1915) *Intolerance (1916) *The Covered Wagon (1923) *The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) *The Ten Commandments (1923) *Ben-Hur (1925) *The Big Parade (1925) *Wings (1927) , the first Best Picture Academy Award winner *The Jazz Singer (1927) , the first feature length part-talkie *Chicago (1927), the silent film based on the play that inspired the Kander and Ebb Broadway musical and Oscar-winning film *The Broadway Melody (1929) *Show Boat (1929), a part-talkie based not on the 1927 stage musical but on Edna Ferber's original novel from which the musical was adapted *Hollywood Revue (1929) *The Desert Song (1929) *Rio Rita (1929) *Paris (1929) *Sally (1929) *Howard Hughes' Hell's Angels (1930) *The Sign of the Cross (1932) *Grand Hotel (1932), winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture *Cavalcade (1933) *A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) *The Great Ziegfeld (1936) *In Old Chicago (1937) *Lost Horizon (1937) *Gone with the Wind (1939) *Fantasia (1940) *For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943) *The Song of Bernadette (1943) *This Is the Army (1943) (shown only in roadshow format on initial release) *Since You Went Away (1944) *Spellbound (1945) *The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) *Duel in the Sun (1946) *Mourning Becomes Electra (1947) *Ingrid Bergman's Joan of Arc (1948) *Samson and Delilah (1949) *Quo Vadis (1951). However, the theatre exhibitors of Quo Vadis took the unusual step of opening the film in two New York theatres simultaneously, where it was shown in roadshow format in one theatre, while the other one ran the nearly three-hour film in the more conventional, \\"continuous performances\\" manner. ==Selected notable British releases== British films that were shown as roadshow attractions in the US included: *Henry V (1944 in England and 1946 in the U.S.) *Hamlet (1948), *The Red Shoes (1948). ==Distinguishing features== In a roadshow release, a large-scale epic film would open in larger cities in an engagement much like a theatrical play or musical, often with components such as an overture, the first act, the intermission, the entr'acte, the second act, and the exit music. The overture should not be confused with the main title music. The overture, recorded on film without a picture (and years later, on tape), was always played before the beginning of the film, while the lights were still up and the curtains were still closed. As the lights dimmed, the overture ended, the curtains opened, and the film began with its main title music and opening credits. Likewise, the exit music should not be confused with the end title music. The exit music, also recorded without a picture on film, was always played after the end of the film, while the lights were up and the curtains were closed. As the lights came on, the end title music ended, the curtains closed, and the exit music began. Most movie theaters until the 1980s had curtains which covered the screen, and which would open when the show actually began and close when it ended. ==Examples== An early example of this was Gone with the Wind (1939). Running almost four hours in length, the film was divided into the above components, so that the film patron can experience the film as if they were seeing an actual play in a theater. The original theatrical release of Walt Disney's Fantasia, presented in Fantasound in selected large cities in the United States, never had an overture, entr'acte, or exit music. Still, Fantasia was first released in the roadshow format, included an intermission in its first run, and was originally presented without on-screen credits to perpetuate a concert-going experience‚Äîthe printed souvenir program, given out to patrons as they entered the theater, presented the film's credits. The original New York run of the English-language film Cyrano de Bergerac (1950), starring Jose Ferrer and based on Edmond Rostand's 1897 French play, was likewise presented in a roadshow format (that is, one or two performances a day), although the film is only two hours long, was not produced on a large budget, and does not contain an intermission. The 1951 Show Boat was also shown in a roadshow format in some theaters, despite being less than two hours long, and not having an overture, intermission, entr'acte, or exit music. ===1950s to 1970s=== With the rise of television, beginning in 1952 and continuing through the early 1970s, studios tried to bring movie audiences back to theaters by making widescreen epics, again using the \\"roadshow\\" formula. Films shot in 3D sometimes were also shown in a roadshow format with intermission, regardless of actual length, as well as many films shot in various larger widescreen processes, such as CinemaScope, Todd-AO, MGM Camera 65, and Super Panavision 70 were given roadshow presentations, as well as films that were blown up to 70mm from the 35mm negative. As a result, there was an avalanche of roadshow films during those decades, often more than one in a single year. Among them were: *This Is Cinerama (1952) *The Robe (1953) *Hondo (1953) *House of Wax (1953) *A Star is Born (1954) *Dial M for Murder (1954) *Oklahoma! (1955) *Richard III (1955) *East of Eden (1955) *Guys and Dolls (1955) *Cinerama Holiday (1955) *High Society (1956) *Helen of Troy (1956) *War and Peace (1956) *Around the World in 80 Days (1956) *The Ten Commandments (1956) *Seven Wonders of the World (1956) *Giant (1956) *The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) *Raintree County (1957) *Search for Paradise (1957) *Windjammer (1958) *South Pacific (1958) *South Seas Adventure (1958) *The Big Country (1958) *Porgy and Bess (1959) *The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) *Ben-Hur (1959) *Sleeping Beauty (1959) (without intermission) *The Alamo (1960) *Spartacus (1960) *Exodus (1960) *Can-Can (1960) *Scent of Mystery (1961) *West Side Story (1961) *Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) *El Cid (1961) *Barabbas (1961) *King of Kings (1961) *Lawrence of Arabia (1962) *Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) *The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962) *How the West Was Won (1962) *The Longest Day (1962) *It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) *The Cardinal (1963) *Cleopatra (1963) *55 Days at Peking (1963) *Hamlet (1964) *Becket (1964) *Cheyenne Autumn (1964) *The Carpetbaggers (1964) *My Fair Lady (1964) *The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) *Mary Poppins (1964) *The Sound of Music (1965) *The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) *Othello (1965) *Doctor Zhivago (1965) *The Great Race (1965) *Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines (1965) *The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965) *Battle of the Bulge (1965) *Khartoum (1966) *Cinerama's Russian Adventure (1966) *Hawaii (1966) *The Bible: In the Beginning... (1966) *The Blue Max (1966) *The Sand Pebbles (1966) *Grand Prix (1966) *Half a Sixpence (1967) *Camelot (1967) *Doctor Dolittle (1967) *Far from the Madding Crowd (1967) *The Happiest Millionaire (1967) *Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) *Ice Station Zebra (1968) *The Lion in Winter (1968) *2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) *Oliver!

(1970) *Scrooge (1970) *Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) *Mary, Queen of Scots (1971) *Fiddler on the Roof (1971) *Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) *Young Winston (1972) *The Great Waltz (1972) *1776 (1972) *The Cowboys (1972) *Jeremiah Johnson (1972) *Man of La Mancha (1972) *Tom Sawyer (1973) *Lost Horizon (1973) *Pete's Dragon (1977) Not all of these post-1951 roadshow releases were hits. Several of them, especially the musicals, were box-office flops that cost the studios fortunes, even if they had previously been hits as stage shows. Some of the films, such as the Olivier Othello or the Burton Hamlet, were not even designed to be box-office smashes as films, but were merely meant to bring these productions to a wider public than could have seen them onstage, much as American Film Theatre would do in the mid-1970s. Many of these newer roadshow releases, including the Disney Sleeping Beauty, were shown in six-track stereophonic sound, a then non-standard feature of motion pictures. West Side Story although shown in 70mm and six track stereophonic sound, was shown with intermission with all 70MM prints as well as its 70MM re-releases, but was, in most areas, shown without one in order to increase the tension in the plot‚Äîan idea recommended by the filmmakers themselves. The Special Limited Edition DVD release includes an option for watching the two- and-a-half hour film both with and without a break. Some films like The Guns of Navarone were often occasionally shown as roadshows for international releases, even if they weren't intended as roadshows for domestic release. In 1961, The King and I, which had originally been shown in 35mm 4-Track stereophonic sound and without an overture, intermission and exit music, was re-released in a 70mm format with an overture, intermission and exit music, remixed into six-track stereophonic sound, and shown in a roadshow format. The film had originally been made in Cinemascope 55 and through advances in technology was now able to be re-released in a process called Grandeur 70. Films made in three-camera Cinerama always received roadshow releases to show off the technology. The special requirements needed to show films in Cinerama‚Äîa theater with a huge, ultra-curved screen, three projectors running simultaneously, and seven-track stereophonic sound‚Äîmade it impossible to show its films in wide release unless the picture was converted to standard one projector format (i.e. Panavision). Since most of those cut off the sides of the original combined picture, eventually, with the advent of anamorphic lenses, a number of Cinerama roadshows were able to be compressed onto normal 5-perf 70MM film and with the extra-wide screens installed, normal 70MM theaters were able to play these reformatted Cinerama titles. ==Exceptions== There were some notable exceptions to the standard roadshow release format, three of them Shakespeare productions. One was Othello (1965), which was essentially a filmed visual record of the already famous Laurence Olivier 1964 London stage production, shot in a movie studio, but on enlarged stage settings. The nearly three-hour color film, made in Panavision and shown in 35MM and mono sound in many areas, was shown in 70MM and six-track stereophonic sound in exactly one engagement - in London in 1966, Being a film that lay somewhere between a photographed play and a true motion picture, the film did not make sufficient use of the spectacular vistas that 1960s widescreen epics usually boasted. In addition, while it had no overture, entr'acte music, or exit music, it was still shown on a two-performance-a-day basis with an intermission, as nearly all roadshow releases were. However, it was shown in U.S. cinemas for an extremely limited release: only two days, in contrast to the customary and lengthy months-long engagements enjoyed by most roadshow films. The same was true of the Richard Burton Hamlet, which was presented in the same type of extremely limited engagement as Othello. Filmed over two days in a quickie black-and-white process called Electronovision, which resembled a 1960s videotaped broadcast, this three hours plus production featured none of the epic features that were a standard of roadshow theatrical release - no impressive scenery, no gorgeous color, no beautiful costumes, or stereophonic sound, only an intermission halfway through the performance. It was not even, strictly speaking, a full-scale film version of the play, but merely a visual recording of a performance of it at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, with a live audience. At three hours and eleven minutes, it was the longest film version of Hamlet to that date. Another exception was Franco Zeffirelli's hugely successful 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet, which, although photographed in beautiful settings and certainly having the look of an epic, was shown in most areas in monaural sound (although its three soundtrack albums were all made in stereo) and was projected at a screen aspect ratio of 1.66:1; that is, roughly the dimensions of today's average movie screen or HDTV screen, not the very wide screens required for films made in Ultra Panavision, CinemaScope, Todd-AO or any of the other ultrawide processes invented in the 1950s meant that the film lacked many of the customary roadshow elements opf the period. However The Mexican release of the picture, DID feature a six-track stereo surround mix and was shown with its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio matted to a 2.2 in standard 70MM.) Similarly, the film version of James Goldman's The Lion in Winter (1968), although a roadshow release filmed on location to qualify for the gorgeous color and beautiful scenery requirements, instead of being released in 70MM and 6-track stereo sound - even though it was shown in Technicolor, it was only from 35MM Panavision (anamorphic) film and mono sound. Only in Australia and in its 1973 London re-release was the picture shown in both 70MM and stereophonic sound. 1971's Nicholas and Alexandra, another roadshow release, was also shown in 70mm 6-track only in Europe, while its U.S. release was in regular Panavision with monophonic sound. In addition to the above, The Diary of Anne Frank (1959), Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) and The Longest Day (1962) were three epics that were shown in black and white instead of Technicolor. Before then, roadshow epics alternated between getting released in black and white or color. ===Edited versions and restoration=== It was common practice for studios to cut some of these epics for general release in order for theaters to book more showings a day and present the film at reduced \\"popular prices\\", especially if the film ran longer than two hours. Sometimes this was done to a successful film, such as South Pacific, but more often to one that had been a notable flop, in an effort to make it a success on its second run. As a result, some of these films have not been seen in their entirety since their first release, as the original edited footage is either missing or no longer exists. With the work of film preservationists and restoration, such roadshow flops as A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935), Mourning Becomes Electra (1947), Joan of Arc (1948), A Star Is Born (1954) and Fantasia (1940), along with the hugely successful films For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia, Around the World in 80 Days and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, all of which had significant footage missing, have been restored in recent years to match the filmmakers' original intent. However, several extremely popular long films, such as Gone With the Wind and The Ten Commandments, have never been released in edited form, and were nearly always shown on a two performance-a- day basis. In Old Chicago, despite its roadshow presentation running only 110 minutes, was edited down to 95 minutes for general release, but restored to its full length on DVD. Frequently, unless the film was exceptionally long, the intermission, along with the overture, ent'racte music, and exit music would be eliminated when it went into general release, in order to save twenty minutes and possibly squeeze in more showings, and the film would be shown just like any other motion picture. Often too, the souvenir programs that were a part of the roadshow release of the films were no longer given out during the wide release. ===Rise of the limited release=== The practice of roadshow presentation began dying out in the 1970s, partly due to a string of costly box-office flops, and partly due to the rise of the multiplex. As multiplexes began to increase in number, and as more and more skyscraper hotels and office buildings took the place of the oldtime movie palaces, theater exhibitors began showing long films in a more informal format. Francis Ford Coppola's Oscar-winning epics The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II (1974), for instance, were made with mono sound, shown without intermissions, and were given more than two performances a day, despite their extreme length. Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975) was shown more than twice a day, but included an intermission. Although some very long films such as Gone with the Wind which was re-released in 70MM and six track sound in 1967 would always be shown with an intermission.Some films like Huckleberry Finn would be released with overtures until 1979, \\"reserved seat\\" showings of new films became extremely rare. The last film musical to officially receive a reserved seat engagement was Lost Horizon (1973), a financial and critical disaster. In the late 1970s, only three films (two popular and one a legendary disaster) received a reserved seat engagement. Michael Cimino made the successful film The Deer Hunter, which was a commercial and critical success, winning the Oscar for Best Picture. In its initial run, it was enlarged to 70mm film and given a roadshow release. Francis Ford Coppola, director of The Godfather, made Apocalypse Now, another three-hour epic which garnered some favorable reviews and is now considered one of his best. The film had a difficult production history, and after five years of production it premiered in a U.S. reserved seat engagement in 70mm. It became a great financial success, and made even more money years later when the director's cut was released. Cimino's next film in 1980 was Heaven's Gate, which is infamous for being one of the biggest box office bombs ever. It had a roadshow release and premiered in a 70mm version with an intermission. The roadshow engagement was the shortest in history, for only three theaters held the screenings. Its New York run lasted three days, the Toronto run was shown once, and the Los Angeles engagement was cancelled. One development that diminished the novelty of the modern roadshow release was that, beginning with Star Wars (1977), stereophonic sound began to be used more and more in films, even films that were not really big-budget spectaculars. Most films, however, were at that time still released only with mono sound. Jaws, for example, made a mere two years before Star Wars, was originally released in this format. Although as late as in 1982, the hugely successful Tootsie was also released with mono sound, as was the 1983 Best Picture winner Terms of Endearment. By about 1984, mono sound was abandoned completely in American films, and stereo (often the six-track variety) finally became the norm.. However, 1982's Gandhi and 1983's Scarface originally received 70mm releases with intermissions, due to their extreme lengths. By 1984, the entire roadshow format had also largely been abandoned, as the rise of the multiplex and competition from cable TV and home video began forcing changes in the nature of film industry. For example, Carmen (1984), an uncut two-and-a-half hour film version of the popular Georges Bizet opera, was not released as a roadshow nor shown with an intermission, despite the fact that the film was so faithful to the opera that it kept the stage version's original division into four acts. The 1984 Carmen was also filmed in six-track stereo and on location, like many epics. Even though the format had died out, 1993's Gettysburg, 1996's Hamlet and 2003's Gods and Generals were screened with intermissions due to their extreme lengths on their original releases. While all three films had no official overture, entr'acte or exit music, cinemas choose to show the films accompanied with the commercially available film soundtracks playing as the audience entered and exited theaters. Gettysburg and Hamlet were screened with two screenings a day while Gods and Generals was not. The 1997 film Titanic was 195 minutes long, prompting some cinemas to add a short mid-film break or to screen it without commercials for health and safety reasons. It has been restored twice (in 70mm and later 3D 4K) and rereleased in a limited engagement format each time. Today, a practice of first premiering a film in larger cities is more common, mainly towards the end of the year, in order to qualify for film award consideration, including the Academy Awards. Such recent films that have gone the limited release route include Million Dollar Baby (2004), The Aviator (2004), March of the Penguins (2005), and the Disney film The Princess and the Frog (2009); these and other such limited release films eventually opened wide. Sometimes this is done to allow a film to receive a wide release shortly after the first of the year, while qualifying for the previous year's Academy Awards. Often, smaller films (often art and independent) will receive an initial release in New York and Los Angeles, and later expand to other cities based on results; this is called \\"platforming\\" or a platform release. Occasionally roadshow releases are done for special event films. In 2006, the film Dreamgirls, based on the Broadway stage musical, was given a three-theater road show release, with reserved seats and program guides. Tickets were significantly higher priced than normal, at $25. The film itself was not shown with an intermission. In 2008 and 2009, the four-hour biopic Che, starring Benicio del Toro as Che Guevara, was shown in a roadshow format for a limited time in a number of large cities. Quentin Tarantino, who remembers the roadshow era fondly, released The Hateful Eight in selected theaters on Christmas Day before expanding into a wide release on December 30, 2015. Tarantino shot the film in anamorphic 70mm (specifically the single-strip 6-track stereo Cinerama format described above) and managed to get the film booked in roughly 100 theaters worldwide that were provided 70mm projectors and lenses to equip the theaters to cope with the Cinerama format by The Weinstein Company to screen the film as the director intended. Deadline Hollywood referred to this release as a roadshow presentation, as it included all the hallmarks of a traditional roadshow release, such as programs, an overture and an intermission with entr'acte music.Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight'-Resurrects Nearly Obsolete Technology New York Times December 11, 2015 ==See also== *Film release ==References== Category:Films by type ","title":"Roadshow theatrical release"},{"id":"1443432","text":"A bee using buzz pollination Bumble bee buzz-pollinates Solanum dulcamara Buzz pollination or sonication is a technique used by some bees, such as solitary bees (Andrena carantonica) to release pollen which is more or less firmly held by the anthers. The anthers of buzz-pollinated plant species are typically tubular, with an opening at only one end, and the pollen inside is smooth- grained and firmly attached. With self-fertile plants such as tomatoes, wind may be sufficient to shake loose the pollen through pores in the anther and accomplish pollination. Visits by bees may also shake loose some pollen, but more efficient pollination of those plants is accomplished by a few insect species who specialize in sonication or buzz pollination. In order to release the pollen, solitary bees are able to grab onto the flower and move their flight muscles rapidly, causing the flower and anthers to vibrate, dislodging pollen. Pollination involving vibrations is called buzz pollination. Honeybees cannot perform buzz pollination. About 9% of the flowers of the world are primarily pollinated using buzz pollination.Buchmann, S. J. Kansas Entomol. Soc. 1985 Bees Use Vibration to Aid Pollen Collection from Non-Poricidal Flowers. Sennas poricidal anthers. == Flower morphology == Plants that rely on buzz pollination have a unique anther shape compared to other flora. In buzz pollinated plants, this process can only happen if pollinators visit the flowers to extract pollen. Only a few insect species are able to pollinate these plants. The flower morphology of buzz pollinated plants is different from other flora that do not use this type of pollination. The anthers are completely sealed except for a small pore at the top or have very small slits that open along the sides. The pores and slits are small enough that insects cannot easily enter the anther, but large enough pollen can exit. Because of this shape, they are often referred to as poricidal anthers. These poricidal anthers are only able to release pollen when vibrated at a specific frequency. The stigmas of these flowers are often located below the anthers. This is could be an evolutionary strategy to prevent self-fertilization, also known as selfing, by creating distance between the stigma. == Plants pollinated by buzz pollination == The following plants are pollinated more efficiently by buzz pollination: * All Dodecatheon (shooting stars) * Heliamphora * Many members of the family Solanaceae ** Most species of the genus Solanum *** Eggplants *** Potatoes *** Tomatoes *** Buffalo bur *** Solanum cinereum, an Australian shrub * Hibbertia * Dianella (flax lilies) ** Many members of Ericaceae ** Some members of the genus Rhododendron ** Some members of the genus Vaccinium *** Blueberries *** Cranberries ** Arctostaphylos ‚Äì manzanita * Some Fabaceae ** Senna Andrena cornelli, the azalea andrena performing buzz pollination of azalea. == Examples of buzz pollinating bee species == * Bombus terrestris * Xylocopa frontalis * Euglossa sp. * Melipona sp. * Protandrena sp. * Nomia sp. * Oxea sp. == Evolutionary origins == The earliest evidence of ancestors of plants that use this mode of pollination in the fossil record has been dated to the Cretaceous period. Also, some extant flora such as members of the family Myrtaceae show a spectrum of anther shapes including poricidal anthers and are thought to resemble some morphological aspects of ancestral buzz pollinated flowers. As these plants have evolved complex floral structures, pollinators have coevolved with these plants. Although pollination results from the bees visiting these flowers, this is not the primary reason they visit plants with poricidal anthers. Pollen contains a substantial amount of protein compared to nectar, the sugary liquid the majority of plants produce as a reward for their animal pollinators. Bees eat pollen as well as make a paste with it to feed their larvae. The pollen paste is then sealed into the nest to create a reserve for the young bees. Bees rely on this resource for food; therefore they are also dependent on flowers that produce substantial amounts of accessible pollen, including flowers with poricidal anthers. Bees from Bombus and Xylocopa are thought to pollinate these flowers because their adaptive behavior allows them to easily extract pollen that is less available to other insects. Since bees have a source of plentiful pollen that they do not have to compete with other insects for, they are more likely to visit these flowers. This then allows the flowers to be more successful reproductively because the plants maximize their pollen dispersal with each bee visit, and less pollen is lost. The relationship between buzz pollinated plants and bees benefits both groups and could be why poricidal anthers have been successful evolutionarily. Pollinator and flower relationships have been observed in Orphium frutescens, a small shrub that has poricidal anthers. Bees visited these plants outside of the University of Cape Town and continued to visit the plants even when all of the pollen had been extracted. Although the bees did not know the O. frutescens would benefit from these multiple visits as the plants continue to produce pollen during the flowering season. ==Economic impacts== Scientists can now import pollinators, such as bumblebees, where there might be a shortage of pollinators. In New Zealand, the red clover plant population was restored when bumblebees were imported from Europe to help with the pollination. Maintaining red clover population in New Zealand at the time was critical to the country's crop production rate. However, in North America, the managed honeybee industry experienced decline in the early 2000s due to colony collapse disorder. This has led to higher expenses for farmers from the east to the west coast of the United States and Canada to help pollinate almonds, cucumbers and certain seed plants. One of the most common plants that are assisted by buzz pollination is the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). In greenhouses worldwide, up to 50 bumblebee colonies are used per hectare during growing season, bringing in values of approximately ‚Ç¨13 million a year for a 40,000 hectare globally. Due to competition between producers and an increase in success rate of rearing, the total costs for the bumblebee colonies have diminished severely. This common practice has led to producers branching out and selling not only bumblebees but other insects who may have mutualistic relationships with plants. The total profit of this industry has been recorded to produce over ‚Ç¨111 million a year, with ‚Ç¨61 million coming in from bumblebees alone. ==Environmental impacts== Some conservation organisations complain about the potential environmental impacts of introducing bumblebees around the world to aid in pollination. In Australia, as bumblebees are not native, and Australia has a number of widely publicised environmental disasters caused by escaped introduced species (\\"feral species\\"), research is under way to adapt the use of the Australian native Amegilla cingulata (blue banded bees) for the same task.Dollin A. (2006). \\"Blue Banded Bee Pollination Trials at Adelaide Uni.\\" Aussie Bee, September 2006. Australian Native Bee Research Centre. == Alternative means of pollination == Greenhouse grown tomatoes are unproductive without aid in pollination. Traditionally, pollination has been done by shaking using electric vibrators (one brand name was \\"Electric Bee\\"), however, it has been found to be less expensive in human labor and plant breakage to use bumblebees within the greenhouses. Home growers and amateurs can be seen on YouTube using electric toothbrushes to pollinate their flowers. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=toothbrush+pollination ==ReferencesBuzz Pollination, Anne Leonard Lab. * * Carl Zimmer, Unraveling the Pollinating Secrets of a Bee‚Äôs Buzz, New York Times, July 11, 2013. * Sue Rosenthal, Buzz Pollination, Bay Nature, June 11, 2008. * Buzz pollination and bee learning, Vallejo-Marin Lab Category:Bees Category:Pollination ","title":"Buzz pollination"},{"id":"1443443","text":"Judge Dredd is a franchise based on the comic book strip which appears in the British science fiction anthology 2000 AD.

Following two introductory chapters dealing with the oneness of mind and motivations for the text's composition, part three focuses on two aspects of mind to clarify the relationship between enlightenment and ignorance, nirvana and samsara, or the absolute and the phenomenal. Part four describes five practices that aid in the growth of faith, emphasizing calmness and insight meditation. Part five describes the benefits that result from cultivating the five practices. Written from the perspective of Essence-Function (), this text sought to harmonize the two soteriological philosophies of the Buddha-nature (tathagatagarbha) and Eight Consciousnesses (or Yogacara) into a synthetic visionLusthaus, Dan (1998).

London: Routledge. based on the One Mind in Two Aspects: ==Commentaries== Commentaries on the Awakening in Faith were composed in China, Japan, and Korea by numerous exegetes. Commentaries composed before the mid 9th century in Chinese and Korean include those by Jingying Huiyuan Ê∑®ÂΩ±ÊÖßÈÅ† Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 44, No. 1843 Â§ß‰πòËµ∑‰ø°Ë´ñÁæ©Áñè Dasheng qixinlun yishu; two by Wonhyo ÂÖÉÊõâ Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 44, No. 1844 Ëµ∑‰ø°Ë´ñÁñè Gisillon so and Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 44, No. 1845 Daeseung gisillon byeolgi; by Fazang Ê≥ïËóè Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 44, No. 1846 Â§ß‰πòËµ∑‰ø°Ë´ñÁæ©Ë®ò Dasheng qixinlun yiji; and by Zongmi ÂÆóÂØÜ, as well as others no longer extant. ==Influence== Although often omitted from lists of canonical Buddhist texts, the Awakening of Faith strongly influenced subsequent Mahayana doctrine. It reflects an important stage in the synthesis of Indian and Chinese Buddhist thought, and the elevation of the tathagatagarbha doctrine to a central place in Chinese Buddhist soteriology. ===Chinese Buddhism=== The Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana had a great influence on Chinese Buddhism. One of the reasons for this is the status of the commentator Fazang Ê≥ïËóè as state preceptor (Guoshi) and third patriarch of the Huayan school. The Awakening of Faith is thought to have played a role in the Huayan doctrine of the interpenetration of phenomena. ===Korean Buddhism=== In great part due to the commentaries by Wonhyo,Park, Sung-bae (2003). Wonhyo's Faith System, as seen in his Commentaries on the Awakening of Mahayana Faith, International Journal of Buddhist Thought and Culture 2 (2), 25-45 the Awakening of Faith ended up having an unusually powerful influence in Korea, where it may be the most oft-cited text in the entire tradition. It also provided much of the doctrinal basis for the original enlightenment thought found in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment. ===Chan (Zen)=== The view of the mind in the Awakening of Faith had a significant import on the doctrinal development of the East Mountain Teaching.Zeuschner, Robert B. (1978). \\"The Understanding of Mind in the Northern Line of Ch'an (Zen)\\", Philosophy East and West 28 (1), 69-79 It is also considered to have strongly influenced the Chan doctrine of \\"seeing one's nature and attaining Buddhahood\\" (jianxing chengfo). ===Japanese Buddhism=== In Tendai, it is often used to explain the original enlightenment thought (doctrine). Medieval Tendai Original Enlightenment Thought is established. It indirectly influenced the sects of the Kamakura period. ===Modern Confucianism=== Mou Zongsan (Chinese: ÁâüÂÆó‰∏â) has used this and Tien Tai to develop his school of thought related to Confucianism, in particular about how to tie between two different aspects of the world. ==English translations== ===The Awakening of Faith=== The translations by Hakeda and Jorgensen et al. are based on ParamƒÅrtha's version of the Chinese text (Taisho No. 1666) while Suzuki's translation is based on ≈öik·π£ƒÅnanda\`s version (Taisho No. 1667). * * Jorgensen, John; Lusthaus, Dan; Makeham, John; Strange, Mark, trans.

Since attendance at debates is not mandatory in most legislatures, it is often the case that a quorum of members is not present while debate is ongoing. A member wishing to delay proceedings (for example, to allow other members time to get to the chamber in order to join debate) may request that the presiding officer determine whether a quorum is present. If a quorum does not appear to be present, debate is suspended. ==Overview== What happens after debate stops depends on the legislature in question. In the United States Congress, bells are rung in the various congressional office buildings to indicate to members that their presence is required in their respective chambers. Members of the House use the same electronic system as is used for voting to register their presence; in the Senate, one of the clerks will read out a roll call of senators, who indicate their presence when called. In fact, if any Senator \\"suggests the absence of a quorum\\", the Presiding Officer must direct the roll to be called. For practical purposes, a quorum call is a delaying measure that permits the Senate leadership to work out some difficulty or to await a Senator's arrival.\\"Quorum call\\" on the United States Senate website Because of differences in procedure between the two bodies, quorum calls in the House are fairly rare, but they are quite common in the Senate. In both houses, while quorum calls officially last fifteen minutes, the actual amount of time given is at the discretion of the presiding officer. A motion to adjourn for lack of a quorum may be raised after the quorum call if an insufficient number of members present themselves. However, if the business is especially important, the members present may instead move a call of the house which will force all members to attend.

Versatile is a Canadian brand of agricultural equipment that has produced augers, swathers, and combine harvesters. In the 1960s, it was an independent operation, founded by Peter Pakosh and Roy Robinson, which had 70% of the 4WD tractor market. Versatile was the first company to mass-produce articulated four-wheel-drive tractors, starting in 1966 with the D100 and G100 four-wheel drives. Those ground-breaking tractors were primitive by modern standards, with a 6-cylinder diesel or 8-cylinder gas engine producing 100 horsepower. 1966 models sold for less than CA$10,000. A Versatile 856 tractor in Carrollton, Ohio Daniel Pakosh also developed the first bi-directional tractor in the world. The Versatile 150 launched in 1977. The Versatile brand, known historically for four-wheel drive tractors, has expanded to include front-wheel assist tractors, self- propelled sprayers, precision seeding & tillage equipment, and combines. In its earlier days (1970s to 1980s), the company made iconic tractors colored red, yellow, and black. The tractors were also known for their flat, boxy appearance, and hardly any curvature as seen on modern tractors. A great example of this is the Versatile 856 (Pictured Below). Four-wheel drive demand increased significantly, with Versatile becoming one of the leaders in four- wheel-drive development and production. By the late 1970s, the Versatile lineup included tractors ranging from 220 to 330 horsepower. With the 1980s came an expanded line of four-wheel-drive tractors that stretched to 470 horsepower in the Versatile 1150. They entered the race to build the largest tractor in the world with \\"Big Roy\\", named after one of the founders, in 1977. Roy produced 600 HP on the draw bar. In 1987, Ford New Holland brought Versatile. Ford New Holland quickly started assimilating the Versatile range of tractors, the decals were replaced with the Ford name and Versatile name was reduced in size and placed below the model number. As well that, the iconic Versatile colors were replaced with the iconic blue and white of the Ford tractors. Throughout Versatile's time under Ford-New Holland, various changes and updates were made to the line. Two of the most notable changes were the transition from the flat square sheetmetal, to a more rounded and modernized design, and the addition of a powershift transmission. In 1991, Fiat Geotech purchases Ford New Holland to create New Holland. Then in 1999, New Holland merges with Case Corporation to create CNH Global, as part of this merger Versatile had to be sold, as the Case Corporation had the Steiger brand since 1986. Versatile was sold to Buhler Industries Incorporated, returning the iconic red to the tractors, but replacing yellow with white. On November 1, 2007, Combine manufacturer Rostselmash Inc. acquired 80% of the common shares of Versatile and it was announced that the Versatile brand name will again be the sole name associated with the tractor division. In 2016, Versatile expanded its tractor range by adding the DeltaTrack system of four tracks replacement of the wheels on their Articulated tractors. In 2017 Versatile returned to its iconic color scheme of red, yellow, and black. == Models == === 4 Wheel Drives (Articulated) === * D100-1966 * G100 -1966 * 118 1967-71 (118 HP) * 125 1967-68 (125 HP) * 145 1967-71 (145 HP) * 700 1972-77 (210 HP) * 900 1972-77 (300 HP) * 300- 1973 (155 HP) * 800 1973-77 (235 HP) * 850 1973-77 (250 HP) * 150 1977-81 (71 HP) * 500 1977-79 (192 HP) * 825- 1977 (250 HP) * 950 1977-82 (350 HP) * 1080- 1977 (600 HP) * 835 1978-84 (230 HP) * 855 1978-83 (250 HP) * 875 1978-84 (280 HP) * 555 1979-84 (210 HP) * 895 1980-84 (310 HP) * 1150 1981-85 (470 HP) * 160 1982-83 (84 HP) === 2 Wheel Drives === ==References== * Versatile Tractors (A Farmer Boy's Dream), by Jarrod Pakosh, published by Japonica Press, ==External links== * * Versatile Tractor Brand *http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/tractor- brands/versatile/versatile-tractors.html Category:Tractor manufacturers of Canada Category:Manufacturing companies based in Winnipeg Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1966 Category:1966 establishments in Canada Category:Canadian brands ","title":"Versatile (company)"},{"id":"1443465","text":"If Only is a 2004 romantic fantasy drama film directed by Gil Junger and starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and Paul Nicholls. ==Plot== Ian Wyndham (Nicholls) is an English businessman who lives with his American musician girlfriend, Samantha Andrews (Hewitt), in London. Taking us through a day in Ian and Sam's life, the film opens by showing different events such as Sam getting burnt on a kettle, Ian's watch breaking, Sam getting Coca-Cola on her and Ian being interrupted by Sam during an important meeting at work. Sam gets angry at Ian as he always treats her as his second priority and tells him that she just wants him to love her. Ian makes one last attempt to reconcile with Sam. An angry Sam gets into a taxi and asks Ian whether he is coming in or not. The taxi meets with an accident and Sam dies. A heartbroken Ian goes back to his apartment, finds Sam's notebook and opens it, finding a song she was working on. He falls asleep clutching the notebook close to him. When he gets up the next morning, he hears Sam talking and sees her in the bed right next to him. He is scared at first but after the initial confusion, Ian comes to the conclusion that the previous day must have been a dream. Ian feels happy to have Sam by his side. The events of the next day are similar to those he already experienced in the dream, although occurring at different times and in different ways. Ian is sure that he had a premonition and that the end of the day will be same and Sam will die. Sam gets Coca-Cola spilt on her. But Ian's watch remains in working order. After talking to the taxi driver he realizes that the driver is the man from the dream who asks Ian to love Sam. After convincing her to come with him, they travel to Ian's rural home town. In the town below, the two have drinks and Ian tells Sam about his father, who lost his beloved job before becoming an alcoholic and dying sometime later. The two travel back to London and Ian takes Sam on the London Eye as another surprise. They then travel back to their apartment and Ian takes a page from her notebook and brings it to a nearby photocopying shop while Sam travels to her concert with her violin. Before the show begins Ian gives the photocopied pages to an organizer. After the performance in which Sam is a violinist, the organiser announces Sam's name as the next performer. A nervous Sam proceeds onto the stage as the orchestra begins to play the song printed on Ian's photocopied sheets. She sings the song she wrote for Ian in her notebook and the crowd burst into applause at her performance. Instead of going to Tantra, the restaurant that Ian had made reservations for, they go to a more intimate restaurant that Sam chooses, but Ian loves it as well. Ian gifts her a bracelet with meaningful charms. They have a nice time. After the dinner, as both of them are standing outside of Tantra, where they ate in the dream, Ian tells Sam why he loves her. As the taxi pulls over and Sam gets in, she asks him again whether he is getting in or not. This time Ian gets in and sees that the cab driver is the same again. As the clock strikes 11, the taxi meets with an accident. The same scene is repeated again, when Sam's friend is shown running in the hospital corridor. Only this time, unlike the dream, its Sam who is sitting and crying instead of Ian, implying that Ian died in the crash. The film ends with a montage of Sam packing up the apartment she shared with Ian while looking at his watch, finally getting to the top of the mountain that she tried to climb with Ian while stopping at the cabin that they stopped at, and then performing onstage while wearing the bracelet that Ian gave her with tears in her eyes but smiling.. ==Production and distribution== Filming was done between November 2002 and January 2003. The movie made its world premiere at the Sarasota Film Festival in January 2004. However it was not picked up for US distribution. It went on to play around the world throughout late 2004 and 2005. American audiences were given a chance to see this film when it premiered on the American ABC Family television network on January 15, 2006. The film premiered on UK television on the Hallmark channel, on July 28, 2009. ==Production and location== Filming locations in London, where either Ian or Samantha appears include (in chronological order): Kensington Park RoadWest London Film Networks: History West London films where the house of Ian and Samantha is located, CityPoint where Ian works, Piccadilly where Ian is seen running towards the M√©ridien hotel, Westminster tube station exit, the London Eye. ==Soundtrack== Hewitt performed both songs from the soundtrack, \\"Love Will Show You Everything\\" and \\"Take My Heart Back\\".

With none of the original stock preserved, it had to provide a new fleet, which consisted of a rake of air- conditioned Mark 2 carriages fitted with Pullman style lighting, topped and tailed by Class 47 diesel locomotives. As no Mark 2 kitchen cars were built, two Mark 1 carriages were included in the set.

It is subordinate to goal intentions as it specifies the when, where and how portions of goal-directed behavior. The concept of implementation intentions was introduced in 1999 by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer.Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503. Studies conducted by Gollwitzer in 1997 and earlier show that the use of implementation intentions can result in a higher probability of successful goal attainment, by predetermining a specific and desired goal-directed behavior in response to a particular future event or cue.Gollwitzer, P. M., & Brandstaetter, V. (1997). Implementation intentions and effective goal pursuit. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, 186-199. ==History== The concept of implementation intentions originated from research on goal striving throughout the late 1980s and 1990s. Developing research suggests that \\"the correlations between intentions and behavior are modest, in that intentions account for only 20% to 30% of the variance in behavior.\\" Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503. Strong intentions (\\"I strongly intend to do X\\") were observed to be more often realized than weak intentions. Past behavior still tended to be a better predictor for a person's future behavior when it was compared to goal intentions. The research also suggested that the weak intention-behavior relation is a result of people having good intentions, but failing to act on them.Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503. This inspired a growing body of research to help determine ways in which peoples' good intentions could be made more effective in accomplishing desired goals. Emerging research proposed the notion that successful goal attainment is in part attributable to the manner in which goal setting criteria are framed. For example, a person will perform better when set goals are challenging and specific as compared to goals that are challenging but vague (known as the goal-specificity effect).Locke, E. A., Latham, G. P., (1990). A theory of goal setting & task performance. In: Englewood Cliffs, NJ, US: Prentice-Hall, Inc. (1990). xviii, 413 pp. Emerging research also suggested a goal-proximity effect (wherein proximal goals lead to better performance than distal goals).Bandura A, & Dale H. (1981), Cultivating competence, self-efficacy, and intrinsic interest through proximal self-motivation, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 41(3), Sep 1981, 586-598. The strategy of implementation intentions was developed on the basis of these findings. ==Concept== People generally have positive intentions, but often fail to act on them.Orbell, S., & Sheeran, P. (1998) Regulation of behaviour in pursuit of health goals: Commentary. Psychology and Health, 13, 753-758 The question is how to ensure that the set goal intentions will reliably lead to the desired goal-directed behaviors, and subsequent attainment of those goals. Implementation intentions offer a practical solution for such a problem. Achieving one's goals requires that certain goal-directed behaviors be instituted, but people are often unsuccessful in either initiating or maintaining these behaviors. The problems of initiating and maintaining goal- directed behavior can be addressed by using the implementation intention process. This if-then plan is a very specific approach as compared to goal intentions. A goal intention may be phrased in the following way: \\"I want to reach X!\\" Implementation intentions on the other hand are much more specific and seek to connect a future critical situation (an opportunity for goal attainment) with a specific goal-directed behavior, thereby leading to what could be called automatization in goal attainment. They are often phrased in the following way: \\"When situation X arises, I will perform response Y!\\"Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503. Where goal intentions are more general and abstract, implementation intentions are much more concrete and procedural. Having formed a concrete plan involving a specific situation, this situation then becomes mentally represented and activated, leading to better perception, attention and memory concerning the critical situation. As a result, the chosen goal-directed behavior (the then-part of the plan) will be performed automatically and efficiently, without conscious effort. The automatization of the behavior in response to the future situation or cue, removes all hesitation and deliberation on the part of the decision maker when such a critical situation arises. This also has the effect of freeing cognitive resources for other mental processing tasks, and also for avoiding goal-threatening distractions or competing goals. It is also assumed that an implementation intention, once set, will continue operating non-consciously. This process is called strategic automaticity. The strength of commitment related to both the plan set and the goal is very important for the implementation intention to have an effect on people's behavior. Without commitment, an implementation intention will hardly have any effect on goal- directed behavior. In the phase model of action, the use of implementation intention takes place in the post-decisional phase (implemental mindset, volition is the driving force of action) which follows the predecisional phase (deliberative mindset, motivation is the driving force of setting goals).Gollwitzer, P. M. (1990). Action phases and mind-sets. In E. T. Higgins & R. M. Sorrentino (Eds.), The handbook of motivation and cognition: Foundations of social behavior (Vol. 2, pp. 53-92). New York: Guilford Press. In the implemental mindset, a person is already committed to a goal and an implementation intention can be a good strategy to reach this goal. The basic structure of an implementation intention is as follows: IF {situation} THEN I will {behaviour} ==Theory== Actively prompting individuals to make plans increases their likelihood of following through. Effective planning prompts guide people to consider when, where, and how they can act upon their intentions.Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503. Facilitating plan creation helps to increase follow-through for several reasons. First, it helps people to consider logistic obstacles and develop specific tactics to navigate around them.Rogers, T., Milkman, K. L., John, L. K., & Norton, M. I. (2015). Beyond good intentions: Prompting people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks. Behavioral Science & Policy , 1(2) (December 2015). Second, the process helps to reduce the likelihood that someone will underestimate the time required by a task.Rogers, T., Milkman, K. L., John, L. K., & Norton, M. I. (2015). Beyond good intentions: Prompting people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks. Behavioral Science & Policy , 1(2) (December 2015). Third, plan creation helps people to remember to act.Rogers, T., Milkman, K. L., John, L. K., & Norton, M. I. (2015). Beyond good intentions: Prompting people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks. Behavioral Science & Policy , 1(2) (December 2015). Lastly, the formation of an action plan serves as a commitment to act. Research shows that breaking commitments generates discomfort.Cialdini, R. B. (1984). Chapter 3: Commitment and consistency: hobgoblins of the mind. Influence: The psychology of persuasion. New York, NY: Harper Collins Publishing. As such, plans are particularly effective when they are made as commitments to another person.Rogers, T., Milkman, K. L., John, L. K., & Norton, M. I. (2015). Beyond good intentions: Prompting people to make plans improves follow-through on important tasks. Behavioral Science & Policy , 1(2) (December 2015). Todd Rogers, Katherine L. Milkman, Leslie K.

Behavioral Science & Policy , 1(2) (December 2015). suggest the following situations in which the use of planning prompts is most effective: ==Empirical support== Implementation intentions have been very successful in helping individuals achieve targeted and specific goals over the years, as indicated by a survey of the research. ===Voting plans=== Implementation intentions can help to increase voter turnout. A study by David W. Nickerson and Todd Rogers (2010) found that voters in a high-salience election were more likely to vote when they received an implementation intentions phone call facilitating the creation of a voting plan.Nickerson, D. W., & Rogers, T. (2010). Do You Have a Voting Plan?: Implementation Intentions, Voter Turnout, and Organic Plan Making. Psychological Science , 21 (2), 194-199. Voters who were contacted with an implementation intentions phone script were asked three questions to facilitate plan-making: what time they would vote, where they would be going to the voting place from, and what they would be doing immediately prior to voting.Nickerson, D. W., & Rogers, T. (2010). Do You Have a Voting Plan?: Implementation Intentions, Voter Turnout, and Organic Plan Making. Psychological Science , 21 (2), 194-199. Voters who were contacted via this phone script were 4.1 percentage points more likely to vote than those who did not receive a call.Nickerson, D. W., & Rogers, T. (2010). Do You Have a Voting Plan?: Implementation Intentions, Voter Turnout, and Organic Plan Making. Psychological Science , 21 (2), 194-199. ===Flu shots=== Planning prompts can also increase the likelihood that individuals will get flu shots. In a study conducted by Katherine L. Milkman, John Beshears, James J. Choi, David Laibson, and Brigitte C. Madrian (2011)Katherine L. Milkman ; John Beshears ; James J. Choi ; David Laibson ; Brigitte C. Madrian Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 28 June 2011, Vol.108(26), p.10415, randomly assigned employees at a Midwestern company received a mailing that prompted them to write down the date and time that they would get their flu shot, while the remaining employees received a letter with only the clinic information. Those who received the plan-making letter were 4 percentage points more likely to get a flu shot.Katherine L. Milkman ; John Beshears ; James J. Choi ; David Laibson ; Brigitte C. Madrian Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 28 June 2011, Vol.108(26), p.10415 ===Physical health goals=== Implementation intentions have been found to be particularly effective in unpleasant goal pursuits such as health- promotion (e.g. balanced and nutritious diet) and disease-prevention (e.g. daily exercise) behaviors, where there may be significant immediate costs and only long-term rewards. Of women who set themselves the goal of performing a breast self-examination over the next month, 100% actually did so if they were induced to form an implementation intention, compared to 53% of women who were not induced to form an implementation intention.Gollwitzer, P.M. & Oettingen, G. (1998), The emergence and implementation of health goals, Psychology & Health, 13, 687-715 In a 2-month study investigating the effect of implementation intentions on weight loss, obese women between the ages of 18-76 were either instructed to create specific implementation intentions regarding their dieting and exercise (e.g. when, where, and what I will eat during the upcoming week; Where, when, how will I exercise during the upcoming week), or simply attend health, diet and stress-related group meetings. The women who were asked to create specific implementation intentions lost on average 4.2 kg, compared to those who only attended weekly group meetings, who on average lost only 2.1 kg over the 2-month period.Luszczynska, A., Sobczyk, A., Abraham, C.(2007), Health Psychology, 26, 507-512 In another example, a study sought to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables in a young- adult population. Participants who created \\"if-then\\" implementation intentions significantly increased reported fruit and vegetable intake by portions of 50% per day (over the course of one week), as compared to participants who made more global and less specific implementation intentions - reportedly consuming 31% more portions per day.Chapman, J., Armitage, C. J., Norman, P. (2009), Psychology & Health, 24, 317-332 ===Emotion regulation=== In 2009 Schweiger Gallo, Keil, Gollwitzer, Rockstroh and McCulloch published another study that was conducted to address the effectiveness of implementation intentions in regulating emotional reactivity.Schweiger Gallo, I., Keil, A., McCulloch, K. C., Rockstroh, B., & Gollwitzer, P. M. (2009). Strategic automation of emotion regulation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 96, 11-31. The two studies required that disgust (in Study 1) and fear (in Study 2) eliciting stimuli were viewed by participants subject to three different self-regulation instructions: # The first group was given the simple goal intention to not experience fright or disgust, and was told to believe \\"I will not get frightened.\\" # The second group was given the first goal intention, with an additional implementation intention, and was told to believe \\"And if I see a spider, I will stay calm and relaxed.\\" # The third group was given no-self- regulation as the control group and did not receive any instruction prior to the event. Disgust was selected because it is almost universally considered to be a basic emotion in the applicable literature. Fear was selected because anxiety disorders, such as panic disorders or phobias are common, and they affect the life of many people. The participants reported on the intensity of the elicited emotions by rating experienced arousal. Only group two, the implementation intention participants, succeeded in reducing their disgust and fear reactions compared to the other two groups. These results support the idea that self-regulation by using simple goal intentions can run into problems when immediate and strong emotional reactivity has to be down- regulated, whereas implementation intentions appear to be an effective tool for self-regulation. Implementation intentions inhibit the automatic activation of stereotypical beliefs and prejudicial feelings.Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503. In a more recent study, the use of implementation intentions was applied to interactions with new acquaintances as well as interracial interactions. The notion is that interactions with new acquaintances can be laden with anxiety and also decrease interest and desire for long-term contact. The study found that implementation intentions actually increased interest in sustained contact during anxiety provoking interactions and also led to closer interpersonal distance in anticipation of interracial interactions. The results also suggest that anxiety itself was not reduced by means of implementation intentions, but rather, implementation intentions shielded individuals from the negative effects of anxiety during social interactions.Stern, C. & West, T. V. (2014), Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,50,82-93 ==Mechanism== The earlier developments of the concept suggest that implementation intentions cause the mental representation of the anticipated situation to become highly activated and therefore easily accessible. The stronger the relationship between the cue or future situation and the predetermined behavior or response, the greater the success of initiating the desired goal-directed behavior. Since all components of the future behavior are predetermined (e.g. the when, where, and how), the association and relationship between said cue and behavior become automatic over time. That is, action initiation becomes immediate, efficient, and does not require conscious intent. In a more condensed explanation, implementation intentions automate action initiation.Gollwitzer, P. M. (1999). Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans. American Psychologist, 54, 493-503. More contemporary developments of the concept look not only at the initiatory aspects of implementation intentions, but look also at the longer- term phenomenon of behavior maintenance as it related to implementation intentions. The research suggests that implementation intentions result not only in an association between cue and behavior, but it's the act of planning into the future that actually serves as the foundation for this phenomenon. An experiment conducted by Papies et al., investigated the rate of goal completion by means of both implementation intentions and also the learning of cue-behavior association. Initially, both approaches led to the same rate of goal completion, but a week later, only the effect of implementation intentions was maintained. This lends evidence to the notion that implementation intentions rely on more complex mechanisms than simple cue- behavior associations, as was believed to be the case in earlier research.Papies, E. K., Aarts, H., de Vries, N. K. (2009), Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 45(5), 1148-1151 ==Implementation Intentions and Goal Shielding== A large amount of research has been conducted on implementation intentions to better understand the questions relating to the initiation of goal striving.Gollwitzer, P. M., & Sheeran, P. (2006). Implementation intentions and goal achievement: A meta-analysis of effects and processes. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 38, 69-119 Unfortunately, the prior study of shielding of ongoing goal striving has been neglected in that research. One study regarding this question was reported by Achtziger, Gollwitzer and Sheeran .Achtziger, A., Gollwitzer, P. M., & Sheeran, P. (2008). Implementation intentions and shielding goal striving from unwanted thoughts and feelings. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34, 381-393. It was shown in that study that implementation intentions can even assist people to shield goal striving from unwanted thoughts and feelings, such as cravings for junk food and from distracting thoughts. Two field experiments, concerning dieting (Study 1) and performance in sports (Study 2), have shown that there was a significant positive influence of implementation intentions on protecting ongoing goal striving. Participants who formed implementation intentions were more successful with long-term dieting, as well as concentration and performance in a tennis match. The focus on \\"If-then-plans\\" is the prevention of distracting thoughts and an efficient accomplishment of cognitive, motivational and emotional barriers of goal striving. As these studies were run in \\"everyday\\" situations outside of an artificial laboratory, they possess a high external validity, and thus display the importance and meaningfulness of implementation intentions for everyday life. ==Limitations== As reported by Theodore A. Powers and colleagues, implementation intentions seem to have a negative effect on the performance in people who score high on socially prescribed perfectionism.Powers, T. A., Koestner, R.,& Topciu, R. A. (2005). Implementation Intentions, Perfectionism, and Goal Progress: Perhaps the Road to Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions.

Both his grandfather and his father were organists in Troyes. Siret was a friend and admirer of Fran√ßois Couperin, and his first collection of harpsichord pieces, published approximately in 1709, was dedicated to Couperin. The suites of this collection all begin with a French overture, following the tradition established by Jean-Baptiste Lully. Siret's second volume of harpsichord pieces (Second livre de pi√®ces de clavecin, published in 1719) was, along with Couperin's L'art de toucher le clavecin, one of the last publications to include unmeasured preludes.

Inspired by the KLRU/PBS music series of the same name, the festival is produced by Austin-based company C3 Presents, which also produces Lollapalooza. The ACL Music Festival has eight stages where musical groups from genres including rock, indie, country, folk, electronic and hip hop perform for fans. The concerts continue from 10 AM to 10 PM on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday during the festival with various stages spread out in the park. Approximately 450,000 people attend the festival each year. In addition to the music performances, there are food and drinks, an art market, a kids area for families, and other activities for attendees. ==History== Founded in 2002, the festival began as a one-weekend event and remained as such through the 2012 date. On August 16, 2012, Austin City Council members voted unanimously to allow the Austin City Limits Music Festival to expand to two consecutive weekends beginning in 2013. Artists who have played at the festival include Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Depeche Mode, The Cure, Arctic Monkeys, Guns N' Roses, Tame Impala, Robyn, Arcade Fire, The Rolling Stones, Muse, Vampire Weekend, The Flaming Lips, Radiohead, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, and many more. In July 2020 the festival was called off due to the COVID-19 crisis. === Relationship to television series === The reputation of the ACL television show helped contribute to the success of the first music festival. The historic Austin City Limits television series focused for many years on Texas singer/songwriters, country and folk performers, and instrument specialists. That has changed as the award-winning television series now resembles the Festival lineup and spotlights artists of every musical genre from rhythm and blues to rock, jazz, and alternative. Now that the festival is an established destination, it brings major bands to the television show that might not otherwise have made the trip. In past years, Pearl Jam, My Morning Jacket, Wilco and The National have all performed for both the festival and the show. ==Vendors== The Austin Eats food court in 2004. The Festival's food court, called Austin Eats, was modeled after the Jazz Fest in New Orleans. Austin Eats features vendors from local Austin restaurants an offers gluten-free and vegetarian options. The ACL Art Market features numerous art vendors and is located in the center of Zilker Park; all booths are open throughout the duration of the festival. == International expansion == ===Auckland City Limits=== In 2015 it was announced that the Auckland City Limits Music Festival would debut at Western Springs stadium in Auckland, New Zealand in early October 2016. The festival will showcase over 40 artists from a broad spectrum of musical genres, and highlight local culinary, artisans, festival fashion, an area for children, and a new festival forum for speaking on and exchanging cultural and innovative ideas. ===Sydney City Limits=== In spring of 2018 Sydney City Limits made its debut at Brazilian Fields and Parade Grounds at Centennial Park in Sydney, Australia. This festival was one day and featured 28 bands on four stages. It had many of the same activities and features as Austin City Limits such as Sydney Eats, Sydney Market, and Sydney Kiddie Limits. == List of lineups by year == == See also == * South by Southwest (SXSW) * 35 Denton == References == == External links == * Austin City Limits Festival * Steve Hopson ACL Photography Category:Pop music festivals in the United States Category:Festivals in Austin, Texas Category:Music of Austin, Texas Category:Rock festivals in the United States Category:Music festivals in Texas Category:Austin City Limits Category:Music festivals established in 2002 Category:Indie rock festivals ","title":"Austin City Limits Music Festival"},{"id":"1443532","text":"Life Begins Again is the debut studio album by the Jimmy Chamberlin Complex (side project band of The Smashing Pumpkins/Zwan drummer Jimmy Chamberlin).

The concept was initially developed to apply in the heavy vehicle industry in regulated areas such as speeding, fatigue and mass, loading and dimension. It has since spread to other transport sectors, particularly in Victoria where it has been applied in laws which apply to the rail, bus, marine and taxi industries. == Background == The chain of responsibility concept initially developed out of a recognition that unlawful behaviour by truck drivers is influenced and often controlled by the actions of other parties. Concerns arose that transport laws had often focussed on the actions of drivers while failing to sufficiently recognise and regulate the actions of other key parties. Chain of responsibility laws therefore seek to provide that these other parties cannot encourage, create incentives for, demand or allow drivers to undertake unlawful actions. == Victorian reforms == === Transport Legislation Review === In recent years, the chain of responsibility concept has been widely used as a basis for the reform of transport laws in the State of Victoria. A major review of policy and legislation in that State, the Transport Legislation Review, has led to the concept being adapted for use in a number of new statutes including the Rail Safety Act 2006, the Bus Safety Act 2009 and the Marine Safety Act 2010. === Rail Safety Act === Victoria faced the problem of ageing and inadequate transport legislation which failed to reflect modern policy. During his second reading speech for a new rail safety statute in Victoria, the then Minister for Transport explained that - ::\\"It is now recognised that this legislative framework has not kept pace with contemporary developments in safety regulation ... (T) the legislation does not establish a coherent chain of responsibility for the effective management of rail safety risks. For example, unlike other modern safety legislation, the (current) Act does not identify the key parties or individuals who can control risks and does not impose performance-based safety responsibilities.\\"Hon Peter Batchelor MP, Second Reading Speech, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, Parliament of Victoria, 6 October 2005. As a result, the Minister explained that - ::\\"... the Bill now before the House and include the establishment of performance- based rail safety duties for rail operators, managers of rail infrastructure, contractors working on rolling stock or rail infrastructure, and rail safety workers including drivers and maintainers of rolling stock and infrastructure to ensure safety so far as reasonably practicable. This effectively imposes rail safety duties and obligations on each person in the rail industry who is in a position to affect safety and clearly identifies the roles and the safety chain of responsibility between them. The duties emphasise the responsibility of each participant to take steps as far as reasonably practicable to identify hazards and manage risks to safety that are within their control. This includes persons whose influence on safety exists 'upstream', such as persons involved in design, manufacture, maintenance, repair and modification of rail infrastructure and rolling stock.\\"Hon Peter Batchelor MP, Second Reading Speech, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, Parliament of Victoria, 6 October 2005. The Rail Safety Act which emerged from that process therefore imposes a chain of responsibility across all key parties in the rail industry in Victoria who can influence safety outcomes. Accountability at law and sanctions and penalties are allocated according to the level of responsibility each party has for creating and managing safety risks. Similar approaches were taken by the Transport Legislation Review in its work which led to new statutes in Victoria in the bus, marine and taxi industries. === National impact === The Victorian work has had influence beyond that State. Following the enactment of the Victorian Rail Safety Act in early 2006, Australian Transport MinistersThrough their participation on the Australian Transport Council. approved a national Model Rail Safety Bill in June 2006 which drew heavily on the Victorian work including its adaption of the chain of responsibility concept. The national Bill proposal has since been adopted by all other States and Territories which have passed Rail Safety Acts reflecting the framework.See the article on the Rail Safety Act. ==See also== * Quintinshill rail crash * Vicarious liability * Transport Legislation Review * Rail Safety Act * Bus Safety Act * Transport Integration Act == References == ==External links== * Essay from the Republic of Letters in re McDonald's case * The Winograd Commission * National Transport Commission * Department of Transport, Victoria * DOT, Transport Legislation Review * Chain of Responsibility * Chain of Responsibility Industry Terminology Category:Supply chain management Category:Tort law Category:Vehicle law Category:Transport in Australia ","title":"Chain of responsibility"},{"id":"1443542","text":"Richard Paul \\"Rooster\\" Burleson (born April 29, 1951) is an American former Major League Baseball shortstop. Burleson, who played for three American League teams over 13 seasons, was a very intense ballplayer. Former Boston Red Sox teammate Bill Lee once said of Burleson, \\"Some guys didn't like to lose, but Rick got angry if the score was even tied.\\" ==Minor leagues== Burleson was originally drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft upon graduation from Warren High School, but did not sign. After a year at Cerritos Junior College, the Boston Red Sox selected Burleson #5 overall during the January secondary phase of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft. Burleson spent his first professional season with the Winter Haven Red Sox of the Florida State League. He batted only .220, and committed 38 errors at short. In , Burleson was named an Eastern League All-Star while assigned to the Pawtucket Red Sox. Following Luis Aparicio's retirement, he battled Mario Guerrero for the starting shortstop job in spring training . ==Boston Red Sox== Though Guerrero won the job, Burleson still managed to earn a call to the major leagues by May. On May 4, Burleson tied a major league record by committing three errors in his major league debut, and was replaced by Guerrero at short by the end of the game. Despite the inauspicious start to his career, he would eventually end up being considered among the best defensive shortstops of his generation, earning a Gold Glove Award in . Burleson was batting .298 with one home run, 28 runs batted in and 45 runs scored to be elected the starting American League shortstop at the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. For the season, Burleson batted .293 with three home runs, 52 RBIs and 80 runs scored, and was second to Jim Rice among team hit leaders with 194 base hits. Burleson received All-Star nods in and as well. In 1979, Burleson batted .278, scored 90 runs and earned the AL's Gold Glove Award at short to earn his first of two consecutive Thomas A. Yawkey Awards as the Most Valuable Player of the Boston Red Sox. He batted .278 with a career high eight home runs and 89 runs scored, and set a major league record for double plays by a shortstop in a single season with 147 en route to winning the award the following season. From to , he played in at least 145 games and got at least 140 hits each season. ==California Angels== Following the season, Burleson was traded to the California Angels with Butch Hobson for Carney Lansford, Rick Miller and Mark Clear. His first season with the Angels, he batted .293 with 33 RBIs and 53 runs scored while playing 109 of the Angels' 110 games during the strike shortened season. He won the Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting shortstop in the American League and the Gene Autry Award as the MVP of the California Angels. A year later he injured his throwing arm, appearing in only 51 games over the next three seasons, and missing the entire season. He returned in to bat .284 with five home runs, 29 RBIs and 35 runs scored in 93 games for the American League Western division winning Angels. Along with backing up Dick Schofield at short, he appeared in 38 games as a designated hitter, and played second and third base for the first time since his rookie season. Following the season, he signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles. He batted .209 in 55 games as a second baseman for the Orioles in before he was released during the All-Star break. ==Coaching and Managerial career== Following his playing career, shortstop Rick Burleson was an Oakland Athletics Minor league infield instructor in and scout in . He was an A's coach in and a member of the Boston Red Sox staff the next two seasons, (‚Äì). He was a California Angels Minor league Baserunning Instructor in and a coach for the California Angels (‚Äì). Since the season, he has managed in the minors for the Lancaster JetHawks (1997-), San Bernardino Stampede (), where he won the California League championship, San Antonio Missions (), Billings Mustangs (-), where he won Pioneer League championships in and , and Louisville Bats (-), before returning to Billings for two seasons (-). In , he replaced Pat Kelly as manager of the GCL Reds, after Kelly was named bench coach by the Cincinnati Reds. In , Burleson switched to the Arizona Diamondbacks system and worked as a coach for the Visalia Oaks. From 2009 to 2012, Burleson served as hitting coach and first base coach for the Reno Aces of the Pacific Coast League, the triple-A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks. ==Private life== Burleson is the father of three sons, Tyler, Chad and Kyle, and a daughter, Lauren. ==See also== *List of AL Silver Slugger Winners at Shortstop *List of Boston Red Sox awards ==References== *The ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia ‚Äì Gary Gillette, Peter Gammons, Pete Palmer.

The Xbox version is no longer maintained.FBWiki : FaqPgxbox According to its official Web site,freeBASIC Programming Language: Official Web site FreeBASIC provides syntax compatibility with programs originally written in Microsoft QuickBASIC (QB). Unlike QuickBASIC, however, FreeBASIC is a command line only compiler, unless users manually install an external integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice. IDEs specifically made for FreeBASIC include FBide and FbEdit.FbEdit on sourceforge, retrieved 13 May 2017 ==Compiler features== On its back end, FreeBASIC makes use of GNU Binutils in order to produce console and graphical user interface applications. FreeBASIC supports the linking and creation of C static and dynamic libraries and has limited support for C++ libraries. As a result, code compiled in FreeBASIC can be reused in most native development environments. C style preprocessing, including multiline macros, conditional compiling and file inclusion, is supported. The preprocessor also has access to symbol information and compiler settings, such as the language dialect. ===Syntax=== Initially, FreeBASIC emulated Microsoft QuickBASIC syntax as closely as possible. Beyond that, the language has continued its evolution. As a result, FreeBASIC combines several language dialects for maximum level of compatibility with QuickBASIC and full access to modern features. New features include support for concepts such as objects, operator overloading, function overloading, namespaces and others. Newline characters indicate the termination of programming statements. A programming statement can be distributed on multiple consecutive lines by using the underscore line continuation char (_), whereas multiple statements may be written on a single line by separating each statement with a colon (:). Block comments, as well as end-of-line remarks are supported. Full line comments are made with an apostrophe \`'\`, while blocks of commented code begin with \`/'\` and end with \`'/\`. FreeBASIC is not case-sensitive. ===Graphics library=== FreeBASIC provides built-in, QuickBASIC compatible graphics support through FBgfx, which is automatically included into programs that make a call to the \`SCREEN\` command. Its backend defaults to OpenGL on Linux and DirectX on Microsoft Windows. This abstraction makes FBgfx graphics code cross-platform compatible. However, FBgfx is not hardware accelerated. Users familiar with external graphics utilities such as OpenGL or the Windows API can use them without interfering with the built-in graphics library. ===Language dialects=== As FreeBASIC has evolved, changes have been made that required breaking older-styled syntax. In order to continue supporting programs written using the older syntax, FreeBASIC now supports the following dialects: * The default dialect (-lang fb as a command-line argument) supports all new compiler features and disallows archaic syntax. * The FB-lite dialect (-lang fblite) permits use of most new, non-object-oriented features in addition to older-style programming. Implicit variables, suffixes, \`GOSUB\` / \`RETURN\`, numeric labels and other features are allowed in this dialect. * The QB dialect (-lang qb) attempts to replicate QuickBASIC behavior and is able to compile many QuickBASIC programs without modification. ==Example code== Standard programs, such as the \\"Hello, World!\\" program are done just as they were in QuickBASIC. Print \\"Hello, World!\\" sleep:end 'Comment, prevents the program window from closing instantly FreeBASIC adds to this with support for object-oriented features such as methods, constructors, dynamic memory allocation, properties and temporary allocation. Type Vector Private: x As Integer y As Integer Public: Declare Constructor (nX As Integer = 0, nY As Integer = 0) Declare Property getX As Integer Declare Property getY As Integer End Type Constructor Vector (nX As Integer, nY As Integer) x = nX y = nY End Constructor Property Vector.getX As Integer Return x End Property Property Vector.getY As Integer Return y End Property Dim As Vector Ptr player = New Vector() *player = Type(100, 100) Print player->getX Print player->getY Delete player Sleep 'Prevents the program window from closing instantly In both cases, the language is well suited for learning purposes. ==References* ;IDEs * WinFBE - Modern FreeBASIC Editor for Windows * fbide.freebasic.net ‚Äî FBIDE Integrated Development Environment for freeBASIC * FBEdit (current) ‚Äî FBEdit source code editor for FreeBASIC, version 1.0.7.6c * * ‚Äî VisualFBEditor Category:BASIC compilers Category:Free compilers and interpreters Category:Object-oriented programming languages Category:Free computer libraries Category:Self-hosting software Category:Articles with example BASIC code Category:Free software programmed in BASIC Category:DOS software Category:Programming tools for Windows Category:Linux programming tools Category:Programming languages created in 2004 Category:Software using the GPL license Category:Programming languages Category:High-level programming languages Category:2004 software Category:BASIC programming language family ","title":"FreeBASIC"},{"id":"1443567","text":"NBCC may stand for: *National Black Catholic Congress *National Board for Certified Counselors *National Building Code of Canada *New Brunswick Community College *National Black Chamber of Commerce *National Book Critics Circle *National Breast Cancer Coalition *NBCC (India) Limited (National Buildings Construction Corporation), Govt. of India *Nagaland Baptist Church Council ","title":"NBCC"},{"id":"1443575","text":"The Bush administration payment of columnists refers to the payment of public funds to right-wing media commentators by several U.S. executive departments under Cabinet officials to promote various policies of U.S. President George W.

An heiress to the Mellon-Scaife family fortune, she was one of the wealthiest women in the United States. Her philanthropy and political causes included environmentalism, birth control and family planning, overpopulation control measures, making English the official language of the United States, and strict immigration restrictions to the United States. According to The New York Times, \\"she bankrolled the founding and operation of the nation‚Äôs three largest restrictionist groups‚Äîthe Federation for American Immigration Reform, NumbersUSA and the Center for Immigration Studies,\\" and she left the bulk of her assets to the Colcom Foundation, whose major activity has been the sponsorship of immigration restriction. ==Biography== === Early life and education === On September 24, 1928, May was born as Cordelia Mellon Scaife in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. May's father was Alan Magee Scaife and her mother was Sarah Cordelia Mellon Scaife. May's maternal grandfather was Richard B. Mellon. May is the grand-niece of Andrew W. Mellon. May and her brother Richard Mellon Scaife grew up at the family estate in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. May attended Foxcroft School, a boarding school for girls. According to May, her childhood was largely unhappy; her \\"eccentric\\" mother Sarah was \\"just a gutter drunk\\" who let nannies do the work in raising her. May attended Carnegie Institute of Technology, now known as Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Pittsburgh briefly, but left school to get married. === Personal life === On June 30, 1949, Cordelia Scaife married Herbert A. May Jr. The marriage lasted only a few months; they soon divorced. After May's divorce, she resumed a childhood friendship with Robert Duggan. However, they were unable to be married for a long period of time, as both their families disapproved. To the wealthy and Protestant Mellons, Duggan was a lower-class Catholic beneath the family's stature; to Duggan's family, May was a divorcee ineligible for a Catholicism-sanctioned marriage. On August 29, 1973, Duggan and May secretly civilly married in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Duggan was by then the Allegheny County District Attorney of Pennsylvania. The marriage was kept secret at first, but eventually leaked to the press. Duggan was under federal investigation by United States Attorney Dick Thornburgh for allegations of racketeering and corruption. On March 5, 1974, he was found dead of gun shot wounds hours before being indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of income tax evasion. His death was ruled a likely suicide, but May maintained that he was murdered. The incident resulted in May falling out with her brother Richard, and by extension the family advisors that were shared between her and the family, as she came to the belief that her brother was somehow responsible for the death. Afterward, May lived reclusively, corresponding mostly by mail with new friends such as the activist John Tanton. May lived a reclusive life, especially after the death of her second husband in 1974.\\"Friends gather to honor memory of Cordelia May\\", Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, February 11, 2005. === Death === On January 26, 2005, May died at her home, Cold Comfort Farm, in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania at age 76, and was cremated. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer. She was survived by her estranged brother Richard, although the two had partially reconciled in 1999. == Political and philanthropic donations == May made charitable donations to land conservation, watershed protection, environmental education, and population causes.Pro, Johnna A. and Pitz, Marylynne, \\"Obituary: Cordelia Scaife May\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 27, 2005. When her mother died in 1965, May inherited a sizable portion of the Mellon fortune. She would distribute tens of millions of dollars to charity through the Laurel Foundation, Colcom Foundation (established 1996), and directly, most on the condition her name not be revealed. Most of the Colcom Foundation's donations go to anti-immigration causes. May was routinely listed on the Forbes list of the wealthiest Americans; in 2004, the year before her death, she had a net worth of $825 million and was #363 on Forbes' list of wealthiest Americans. In 1951, May established Laurel Foundation, a private foundation based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1996, May established Colcom Foundation. May served as the chairman of both foundations until her death in 2005. In the year 1972, May was the single largest contributor to candidates running for Congress. In 2005, the year of her death, May gave more to charity than any other individual in the United States. Her charitable donations for the year were almost one-tenth of the $4.3 billion donated by the nation's leading philanthropists.\\"Cordelia May tops givers list\\", Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, February 20, 2006. ===Pittsburgh area initiatives=== May's largesse helped fund a number of projects in the Pittsburgh area, including the Pittsburgh National Aviary, the Montour Trail, the Riverlife Task Force, the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, and the Women's Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh. === Population control === May became aware of overpopulation issues in childhood, when she was introduced to the work of Margaret Sanger by her grandmother.Vondas, Jerry, \\"Philanthropist Cordelia Scaife May dies at 76\\", Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, January 27, 2005. By 1952 she began to actively address national population issues. There is a bust of Margaret Sanger in the National Portrait Gallery which was a gift from May.\\"Margaret Sanger\\", National Portrait Gallery, (accessed August 10, 2018). By 1974, she had resigned from Planned Parenthood, based on her view that family planning was a waste of money in the presence of massive immigration. === Anti-immigration=== May opposed immigration. She argued the United States was \\"being invaded on all fronts\\" by immigrants who \\"breed like hamsters\\" and exhaust America's resources. Her anti-immigration activism began in the 1970s. May's contributions, both directly and through her foundations, have principally funded anti-immigrant initiatives, including the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), the Center for Immigration Studies, the American Immigration Control Foundation, Californians for Population Stabilization, the California Center for Immigration Reform, and Numbers USA. The Center for Immigration Studies is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Los Angeles Times reported that Scaife May was the single largest donor to anti-immigrant causes and \\"An ardent environmentalist more comfortable with books and birds than with high-society galas, May believed nature was under siege from runaway population growth. Before her death in 2005, she devoted much of her wealth to rolling back the tide--backing birth control and curbing immigration, both legal and illegal.\\" The Times also wrote that May donated $200,000 to conservative columnist Samuel T. Francis, who called for a halt to all immigration and who opposes the mixing of the races. May also supported English-only movements, guided by John Tanton. Originally that was through the group U.S. English, which successfully lobbied for an Arizona ballot proposition to conduct all state business in English. After Tanton was kicked out of the group for memos that endorsed eugenics and denounced a \\"Latin onslaught\\", Tanton founded a new group, ProEnglish. May helped be a prominent funder for ProEnglish, keeping with Tanton. According to Roger Conner, the first chairman of FAIR, \\"John [Tanton] became the one who would carry her legacy forward the way a son or a daughter would... John assured her what she believed in her life would carry on. She also funded the republication and distribution of the dystopian novel The Camp of the Saints in 1983, a novel popular among the far right and widely described as racist by critics; the Southern Poverty Law Center has compared it to The Turner Diaries. == See also == * Mellon family == References == ==Further reading== * Category:1928 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American philanthropists Category:Mellon family Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:People from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Category:Deaths from cancer in Pennsylvania Category:Carnegie Mellon University alumni Category:Council of Conservative Citizens Category:Foxcroft School alumni ","title":"Cordelia Scaife May"},{"id":"1443589","text":"Rutlish School is a state comprehensive school for boys, formerly a grammar school with the same name originally located on Rutlish Road, Merton Park, and relocated in 1957 on nearby Watery Lane, Merton Park, in southwest London. It is particularly noted for its most famous former pupil, the former Conservative politician and British Prime Minister Sir John Major, in its grammar school period in the 1950s. ==History== The school is named for and honours the benefactor William Rutlish, embroiderer to Charles II. Rutlish was a resident of the parish of Merton and is buried in the churchyard of the parish church of St Mary. Rutlish died in 1687 and left ¬£400 for a school (about ¬£ today) for the education of poor children of the parish.Students of Rutlish schools should be thankful to William Rutlish as he is the main reason why the school had started and that is why students are having free education currently at Rutlish.British History Online, A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4 (1912), 'Parishes: Merton', pages 64-8 By the 1890s the charity had accumulated a considerable excess of funds and John Innes, a local landowner and chairman of the board of trustees, used some of the excess to establish a school. ===Grammar school=== The first school building, established as a grammar school in the 1890s, was located in what is still designated Rutlish Road, off Kingston Road, by Merton Park station (now a tram stop). After World War II the school had outgrown its Victorian buildings (and the science block, built in the 1930s, had been destroyed as a result of enemy action) so in the early 1950s, John Innes buildings off nearby Mostyn Road were converted for use as the Junior School. Though the work was not completed and the heating system was not installed, this opened after a delay, in late September 1953. A new building was planned for the rest of the school, on the present site south of Watery Lane. The new school buildings opened in September 1957. Both this and the Junior School were on land that had belonged to John Innes and which had been occupied until 1945 by the John Innes Horticultural Institution (now the John Innes Centre in Norwich). The original buildings in Rutlish Road were later temporarily used as a girls' school (Surrey County Council, Pelham County Secondary Girls School) and then a Middle School (London Borough of Merton, Pelham Middle School, until 1974), buildings subsequently demolished to be replaced by a mix of retirement and warden-assisted flats. ===School buildings=== The 1957 school buildings are arranged around three sides of a quadrangle. To the north is a four-storey main entrance block (which contained the school library on the top floor, and a CCF rifle range in the roof space) and a three-storey central block of general purpose classrooms facing Watery Lane. To the west is a two-storey science block and to the east a two-storey block containing the canteen on the ground floor and the school hall on the first floor. Attached to the rear of the east block is the school gym. Also in the middle of the two buildings is a maths block on the second floor. Among the existing school buildings is one which has ties to John Innes. The \\"Manor House\\" adjacent to the school entrance on Watery Lane was Innes's home; a blue plaque records his association. The Manor House was used as the staff room and headmaster's office on the ground floor, and sixth form rooms on the first floor. Now demolished were school buildings next to the playing field; these were once the library and offices of the John Innes Institution and had ranges of greenhouses attached. In the 1950s and early 1960s these old buildings were used by the first and second year classes (known as forms 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D) and the long greenhouse was used as a lunchtime canteen and a cloakroom. Later, in the 1980s, they were art and music rooms. A little-known feature of the old building was a warren of hidden crawlspace passages, accessible from the second floor music room, from where clandestine spying operations on other classes could be undertaken. In the 1970s, part of the roof-space housed the 4 mm scale model railway layout. To the southeast aspect of the buildings was the Croquet Lawn, elegantly laid on a slope comparable to that of Yeovil Town Football Club, a small allotment area for the Gardening Club adjoined as well. There was also a pair of 'Fives' courts (Fives is a game like squash, but played with the hands not rackets). As part of the CCF, during the 1970s the school also had a bungie launched glider. A number of additional buildings have been constructed over the years to supplement the facilities of the 1950s buildings. ===Comprehensive=== Following the education reforms of the late 1960s, the school became a comprehensive although it retained many of its grammar school traditions long after the conversion - school houses (named after ancient warrior nations or groups), uniforms with house and school colours, a Combined Cadet Force, and prefects. For many years the school maintained a croquet lawn for the use of the headmaster and the prefects. The school also operated an exchange programme with Eton College for a number of years. ===Three-tier system=== In the 1970s the education system in Merton was altered to use a three-tier structure (primary, middle and high school) in place of the former two-tier structure and Rutlish lost the first three of its years. The school still retained the old year names; however, so that pupils starting at the school began as \\"fourth\\" years. The following years were named \\"remove\\", \\"fifth\\", \\"transitus\\" and \\"sixth\\" (actually a pupil's fifth year at the school if he remained that long). Transitus and sixth-form pupils had their own common room on the first floor of the main block. ==School motto== * The school motto is: Modeste Strenue Sancte; meaning: \\"Be modest, be thorough and find righteousness\\". ==School houses== Additional to division into classes and years, the pupils of the school have been for most of the school's history allocated to one of eight school houses. Although, in recent years the system has been unused, it was reinstated in January 2010 with the houses: * Argonauts Throughout the school year, various inter-house competitions are held, often of a sporting nature, at which pupils compete individually or in teams as representatives of their houses. ==Old Rutlishians' Association (ORA)== Since 1906 the Old Rutlishians' Association (\\"Old Ruts\\"), with a large ground and clubhouse in Poplar Road, Merton Park, has existed as an Old Boys sports and social club linked to the school which former pupils of the school are eligible to join. With the loss of the sixth forms the number of former pupils joining the association fell and membership has been opened to all-comers. ==Notable Old Rutlishians== * Baron Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, Member of the House of Lords from 2010 * James Boiling, cricketer * Tom Braddock, Labour MP from 1945 to 1950 of Mitcham (1898‚Äì1903) * Raymond Briggs, illustrator, best known for The Snowman (1945‚Äì52) * Derek Cons, Judge of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong * Gerry Cottle, owner Gerry Cottle's Circus, Moscow State Circus, Chinese State Circus, Wookey Hole Caves (1956‚Äì61; ran away to join the circus) * Jason Cundy, Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Tottenham football player. * The Rt Rev John Dennis, (1942‚Äì49), Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich from 1986 to 1996 and father of Hugh Dennis * Lt Col John Dimmer VC MC, d.1918 * Sir Frank Edward Figgures CB CMG, first secretary general from 1960 to 1965 of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and director general from 1971 to 1973 of the National Economic Development Office (NEDO) (1921‚Äì28) * Steve Finnan, Liverpool and Ireland footballer (1989‚Äì1992) * Sir David Follett, director from 1960 to 1973 of the Science Museum (1919‚Äì26) * Edward Brian Tubby Hayes, jazz musician (1946‚Äì51) * Neville Heath, murderer, executed in 1946 (1928‚Äì33) * Tariq Knight, TV illusionist (1996‚Äì2000) * Sir John Major KG, CH, Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997 (1954‚Äì59) * Dean McDonald English professional footballer (1998‚Äì2002) * Sir Morien Morgan CB, aeronautical engineer and master from 1972 to 1978 of Downing College, Cambridge (1924‚Äì31) * Geoff Norcott, comedian, writer and political commentator * Sir Patrick Geoffrey O'Neill, Professor of Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London * Sir Frederick Page CBE, aeronautical engineer (1928‚Äì35) * Geoffrey Paul, Bishop of Bradford from 1981 to 1983 (1932-9) * Chris Perry, footballer * Bernarr Rainbow, FRSA, organist (1926‚Äì33) * John Rostill, musician, The Shadows third bass guitarist (1953‚Äì59) * Douglas Seale, actor and director (1925‚Äì32) * Stephen Shaw CBE, Prisons and Probation Ombudsman since 2001 and director from 1981 to 1999 of the Prison Reform Trust (1964‚Äì71) * Keith Sutton, artist (1935‚Äì40) * Mick Talbot, musician * Frank Taylor Conservative MP from 1961 to 1974 for Manchester Moss Side (1919‚Äì26) * Mark Thomas (1980‚Äì85) editor, 2003-08 of The People newspaper * Chris Wormald, permanent secretary of the Department of Education 2016 ==References== ==External links== * Official school website * Old Rutlishians' Association * Rutlish Foundation * EduBase Category:Boys' schools in London Category:Secondary schools in the London Borough of Merton Category:Educational institutions established in 1895 Category:1895 establishments in England Category:Voluntary controlled schools in London ","title":"Rutlish School"},{"id":"1443591","text":"Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles (BW&BK;) is a Canadian heavy metal magazine.

The bar is most famous for allegedly being the birthplace of spicy chicken wings known outside the Buffalo area as Buffalo wings. ==History== The Anchor Bar, on Main Street in Buffalo, New York, was established in 1935 by Frank and Teressa Bellissimo. It became famous for trademarking the Buffalo-style chicken wing. Frank Bellissimo died in October 1980 at the age of 84. Teressa Bellissimo, who opened the Anchor Bar with her husband Frank, and is credited with inventing the Buffalo Wing, died in her apartment above the bar in November 1985. She was 84. Dominic, the son of Frank and Teressa, who later owned the establishment and actively promoted the bar and its wings, died in March 1991 at the age of 68. On November 20, 2018, Ivano Toscani, owner of the Anchor Bar, died from a long illness eight days before his 69th birthday. Toscani began working for the Bellissimos at the bar in the mid-1970s. ==Chicken wings== Buffalo wings and celery at the Anchor Bar Buffalo, New York's now- famous Anchor Bar Restaurant's association with Buffalo wings originated in the 1960s after trademarking the recipe created by John Young. On March 4, 1964, Dominic Bellissimo was tending bar. Late that evening, a group of Bellissimo's friends arrived at the bar. He asked his mother, Teressa, to prepare something for his friends to eat. With little food left, Teressa took some chicken wings, which were normally used for soups or thrown out, deep- fried them and put a spin on Young's original recipe using a mixture of Frank's RedHot sauce, butter, cayenne pepper and other ingredients on them. She brought out some cut celery and blue cheese for dipping as hors d'oeuvres. That began the Buffalo tradition started by John Young. The wings were initially offered free of charge. Authentic Buffalo Wings are never battered. They are not grilled, but only deep-fried and slightly crispy. The sauce is added after the wing has been cooked. ‚ÄúWings,‚Äù as they are called in Buffalo (versus ‚ÄúBuffalo Wings) are traditionally served with chunky blue cheese dressing and celery (freshly cut carrots are often served, as well). Today, Anchor Bar sauces are sold in the United States at Tops Friendly Markets, Wegmans and in Canada at Sobey's and Metro stores. In 2007, Iron Chef and Food Network personality Bobby Flay appeared at the Anchor Bar for a Buffalo wing \\"throwdown\\" with the self-proclaimed \\"Wing King\\", Drew Cerza. ==Other locations== In the summer of 2012, it was announced that a second location would open in Hamilton, Ontario. The second location will be located in the Jackson Square mall. In 2013, a quick service version of The Anchor Bar opened at the Darien Lake amusement park about half an hour away from Buffalo. This location has a limited menu compared to the original, but still offers the original wing sauce both on wings and sold in bottles along with other menu choices. On October 1, 2014, another Anchor Bar location opened on Transit Road outside of the Eastern Hills Mall. On October 22, 2015, the newest Anchor Bar location opened in the Millcroft Shopping Plaza, located at Appleby Line and Upper Middle Street in Burlington, Ontario. In 2015, it was announced that a franchise would open in the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian in Las Vegas. The location closed February 19, 2016. In September 2016 a third Ontario location opened in Toronto, Ontario located at Dixon and Martin Grove roads. On May 17, 2018, Anchor Bar opened in New York City. In June 2018, a fourth Ontario location opened in Mississauga, Ontario on Hurontario Street. The Anchor Bar has a restaurant location in the Main Terminal at Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Besides the restaurants in New York state, there are others: in Frederick, MD, Rochester Hills, MI, and two in Texas: San Antonio & Schertz. The first location in the Southeast opened in Kennesaw, GA in June of 2020. == In popular culture == The Anchor Bar appears in a driving montage in The Simpsons episode D'oh Canada (Season 30, episode 21). ==See also== * List of chicken restaurants == References == ==External links== * Category:1935 establishments in New York (state) Category:Italian-American culture in Buffalo, New York Category:Italian restaurants Category:Poultry restaurants Category:Restaurants established in 1935 Category:Restaurants in Buffalo, New York Category:James Beard Foundation Award winners ","title":"Anchor Bar"},{"id":"1443599","text":"George Snavely Rentz (July 25, 1882 - March 1, 1942) was a United States Navy chaplain who served during World War I and World War II. For selfless heroism following the loss of in the Battle of Sunda Strait, he was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross-- the only Navy Chaplain to be so honored during World War II. ==Personal history== George Rentz was born in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He received his undergraduate degree in 1903 from Gettysburg College which was then known as Pennsylvania College. While attending he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Rentz subsequently graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary and was ordained in 1909. For the next eight years he served as a Presbyterian minister for the Presbytery of Northumberland, as well as pastoring churches in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Upon the entry of the United States in World War I, he was appointed acting chaplain with the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade and assigned to the 11th Marine Regiment in France, where he served until 1919. Rentz attained the rank of Commander in 1924. As chaplain, he served aboard , , , and his final duty station, Houston. During his military career, Rentz also served at the Marine Barracks in Port Royal, South Carolina, Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, and Naval Air Station San Diego, California. ==USS Houston== Commander Rentz transferred from the Augusta to the Houston in 1940 when it relieved Augusta as the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet. Rentz was a crew favorite, even going so far as to ignore regulations and dispense nips of alcohol as needed to the exhausted sailors. During a Japanese attack on Houston at the Battle of Makassar Strait on February 4, 1942, Commander Rentz spurned cover and circulated among the crew of the anti-aircraft battery, keeping up their spirits. It was noted that, when crew members at the guns \\"‚Ä¶ saw this man of God, walking fearlessly among them, they no longer felt alone.\\"Schulz, p. ?? In the Flores Sea, during this attack, Houston took a direct hit that disabled turret III and killed 48 men. Less than a month later, Houston and the Australian light cruiser HMAS Perth (D29) were directed to proceed to Ceylon, where they were supposed to attack Japanese naval supply lines. En route, the two ships unexpectedly encountered a Japanese invasion force, resulting in the encounter now known as the Battle of Sunda Strait. Though outnumbered by the Japanese convoy, both ships persisted. In the ensuing melee one of the Japanese destroyers fired a spread of torpedoes that passed by the allied cruisers and sunk four of their own troopships. In the end, the Japanese forces proved too much for the wounded Perth and Houston. The final attack on these two cruisers sank first Perth and then Houston shortly before midnight on March 1, 1942. ===Eyewitness accounts of heroism=== It was during the abandonment of the sinking Houston that Commander Rentz entered the water and attained partial safety along with other crewmembers on a destroyed airplane's float. Seeing extreme overcrowding and the fact that the pontoon was taking on water, he attempted to relinquish his space and lifejacket to wounded survivors nearby. He declared \\"You men are young, I have lived the major part of my life and I am willing to go.\\"Schulz, p. 204 According to Houston survivor Private Jim Gee, no one would oblige the generous, fearless chaplain. Each time Rentz attempted to leave he was brought back by his shipmates. He ultimately relinquished his lifejacket to Seaman First Class Walter L. Beeson, who recounts that Rentz \\"told me his heart was failing him; told me he couldn't last much longer.\\" Following a brief prayer, the Chaplain gave the lifejacket to Beeson, who refused to put it on. Rentz kicked away from the float and disappeared. Gee recalled \\"No one realized what had happened. It's just one of those things that one minute he's there, and the next minute... he wasn't.\\" When Beeson realized that Rentz was gone, he put on the lifejacket. For these actions, Rentz was posthumously awarded the United States Navy's second highest award for valor, the Navy Cross. Chaplain Rentz had less than one year to serve before retiring. He was one of 800 men who perished out of the original crew of 1,168 aboard Houston. Of the 368 crew members who made it to shore and were captured by the Japanese, 77 would die in captivity. 291 survived to the end of the war.Hornfischer, p. 2; p. 149 ==Namesake== The was named in his honor. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * (On the webpage, scroll down to \\"Commander George S.

The reserve comprise two small islands, situated in the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean, approximately northeast of . ==Features== According to indigenous folklore from the Bundjalung people, a jealous husband threw his spear at the canoe of his wife and her lover. The canoe broke in two and sank to the bottom of the ocean. Only the back and the front of the boat stuck out of the water. The islands were sighted by Captain James Cook when he passed through the area in 1770. However, he did not name them. The rocks are referred to as the Juan and Julia Rocks in Staff Commander Howard‚Äôs 1883 survey report of Cape Byron Bay and in his sketch of Byron Bay. The origin of this name is unknown. In 1982, after pressure from locals, the area surrounding the rocks was established as a marine reserve, with all fishing and commercial exploitation banned for a range around the rocks. The area is home to large numbers of marine species, including leopard sharks, grey nurse sharks, wobbegong, a variety of nudibranchs. It's one of about a dozen critical habitats for the grey nurse shark in NSW. Scuba divers identify the site as one of the top sites in Australia for its wide variety of marine life. From May to September, humpback whales are commonly spotted traveling between the rocks and the mainland and are a common sighting on the short boat trip between the mainland and the rocks. The Cape Byron Marine Park, declared in 2002, surrounds the reserve.

Hexenkopf (The Witch's Head), ==Biography== August Natterer, given the pseudonym Neter by his psychiatrist to protect him and his family from the intense social stigma associated with mental illness at the time, was born on 3 August 1868 in Schornreute near Ravensburg, Germany, the son of a clerk and the youngest of nine children. Natterer studied engineering, got married, travelled widely and had a successful career as an electrician, but was suddenly stricken with delusions and anxiety attacks. On April Fool's Day 1907 he had a pivotal hallucination of the Last Judgment during which \\"10,000 images flashed by in half an hour\\". He described it as follows: > I saw a white spot in the clouds absolutely close ‚Äì all the clouds paused ‚Äì > then the white spot departed and stood all the time like a board in the sky. > On the same board or the screen or stage now images as quick as a flash > followed each other, about 10,000 in half an hour‚Ä¶ God himself occurred, the > witch, who created the world ‚Äì in between worldly visions: images of war, > continents, memorials, castles, beautiful castles, just the glory of the > world ‚Äì but all of this to see in supernal images.

Natterer thereafter maintained that he was the illegitimate child of Emperor Napoleon I and \\"Redeemer of the World\\". The vision had inspired an intense production of drawings, all documenting images and ideas seen in the vision. August Natterer died of heart failure in an institution near Rottweil in 1933. ==Artistic works== Axle of the World, with Rabbit), 1919 Natterer was one of the \\"schizophrenic masters\\" profiled by Hans Prinzhorn in his field-defining work Artistry of the Mentally Ill. His drawings are attempts to capture the \\"10,000 images\\" of his April Fool's Day hallucination, and are always rendered in a clear, objective style, like that of a technical drawing. This may be due to his background as an electrician. Natterer once claimed that Axle of the World, with Rabbit, which can be seen to the right, had predicted World War I. The rabbit represented \\"the uncertainty of good fortune. It began to run on the roller... the rabbit was then changed into a zebra (upper part striped) and then into a donkey (donkey's head) made of glass. A napkin was hung on the donkey; it was shaved\\".

The University offers undergraduate degrees in chemical, electrical, mechanical, and petroleum engineering. A graduate program for chemical engineering (Master's degree) commenced in 2011. ==History== Texas A&M; University's campus in Qatar was established in 2003. The campus was set up through an agreement between Texas A&M; and the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science, and Community Development, a private institution under the laws of the State of Qatar. The Qatar Foundation was started by then-emir Shiekh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife and mother of the current emir Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. The campus was opened as part of Qatar's \\"massive venture to import elite higher education from the United States to Doha using the oil and natural gas riches of the tiny Persian Gulf nation\\". Since 2003, there have been 635 graduates. The original agreement was for undergraduate programs in chemical, electrical, mechanical, and petroleum engineering. In 2010, an additional agreement established a graduate studies program in engineering. In 2011, a third agreement established a research program. The two initial agreements ended in June 2013 and in January 2014 a renewal agreement was signed for a period of ten years. ==Academics== According to the agreement between Qatar and TAMU, the curriculum at the Doha campus will \\"duplicate as closely as possible\\" the curriculum at TAMU's main campus. Questions have arisen over whether schools such as TAMUQ in Education City are truly able to grant students the same freedom of thought, expression and association as is available to students at the U.S. campuses due to Qatar's much stricter laws that inhibit these freedoms. This causes doubt over whether TAMUQ can really uphold the same academic curriculum and academic standards as Texas A&M;, College Station. ==Administration== The 2014 agreement states that TAMU and TAMUQ are responsible for selecting and supervising all faculty and staff, admitting, enrolling and instructing students, developing plans to ensure the university satisfies the terms of the agreement, and designing and implementing the school's academic curriculum and programs. The Qatar Foundation and TAMU established a Joint Advisory Board to oversee TAMUQ. Three members are appointed by each TAMU and the Qatar Foundation, and three members are jointly appointed by both sides. The board provides advice to the Dean of TAMUQ, reviews the budget, and conducts ongoing review and evaluation of the success of TAMUQ. ===Funding=== Texas A&M; receives more than $76.2 million each year to operate its campus in Qatar. The Qatar Foundation purchases and owns all property, pays salaries, and reimburses expenses to Texas A&M; for its campus in Doha. In addition, TAMU earns a management fee which is inclusive of all of its costs and fees for establishing, managing, and operating TAMUQ. In the budgets approved for FY2014 and proposed for FY2015-2018, TAMU's management fee is $8.2 million. Tuition at the university is $28,900 for undergraduates. In the agreement between the two parties it is stated that \\"the tuition and fees for students at TAMUQ shall be no less than the highest rates applicable to out of state students at TAMU‚Äôs main campus\\". The Qatar Foundation is responsible for collecting all tuition paid by students. According to the agreement, the Qatar Foundation is responsible for all financial aid awarded to international, non-U.S. citizen undergraduate students at TAMUQ. For graduate students, the Qatar Foundation will provide limited financial assistance to Qatari students who are not otherwise funded but is not required to provide assistance to non-Qatari students, although it may do so on a case by case basis. The endowment of the program is owned by the Qatar Foundation and managed on behalf of the program unless a donor specifies that it should be otherwise managed. Property or equipment purchased by the Qatar Foundation or acquired through a gift to the Qatar Foundation are property of the Foundation. Anything acquired through a gift to TAMU or TAMUQ will be property of TAMU. Texas A&M; at Qatar also allows students the opportunity to participate in sports such as basketball and soccer. In the 2008 and 2009 seasons, the men's basketball team completed a historic run where they went undefeated for 46 straight games. ==Undergraduate admissions== Texas A&M; University at Qatar follows the same admissions standards in place at the home campus in College Station, Texas. Texas A&M; University has a research collaboration with Habib University in Pakistan. TAMU agreed that the undergraduate population of its campus in Doha would be 70% Qatari citizens. About 40% of TAMUQ's students are women, a much higher percentage than in most engineering programs. ==Criticisms== As with many other universities with campuses abroad, Texas A&M; Qatar has drawn some criticism over whether it upholds the same standards for its Qatar campus as it does for its U.S. campus. Some critics have said that the pool of applicants for TAMUQ is smaller, which leads to a higher acceptance rate and a lower quality of students. However, there is no definitive evidence that the standards are actually lower and TAMUQ has often received praise for its Qatari campus and awards for the research performed there. ===Activities in Israel=== In the winter 2013, Texas A&M; publicized their plans to open a $200 million \\"peace campus\\" in Nazareth, Israel.http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking- news/texas-am-kills-200-million-arab-university-in-nazareth-opens-6-million- center-in-haifa-instead/2015/12/14/ Student at the school's Doha campus protested the move with Qatari students claiming it was \\"an insult to [their] people\\". Shortly after, in May 2014, Texas A&M; received $31.7 million from the Qatar National Research Fund. Texas A&M; did not open the campus in Nazareth, instead opting for a much more modest $6 million marine research center in Haifa, Israel. ===Contract with Qatar Foundation=== In fall 2015, The Washington Post asked Texas A&M; for a copy of its contract with the Qatar Foundation. Texas A&M; originally declined and referred the request to the Texas attorney general's office. The Qatar Foundation's attorneys at the law firm Covington & Burling told the attorney general's office that releasing the records \\"would cause substantial competitive harm\\". The attorney general's office eventually concluded that the contract must be disclosed. ===Death on campus=== In May 2014, a laboratory worker was killed in an accident in the Engineering Building. The victim was Hassan Kamal Hussein, an Egyptian expat who worked in the lab. The campus and its students, in partnership with Qatar Charity, held fundraisers to help support Hussein's family in the wake of the accident. Since then an engineer who tried to fix the faulty equipment, and the equipment's manufacturer have been sued over the incident. ==References== ==External links== *Texas A&M; University at Qatar Qatar Category:Education City Category:Universities in Qatar Category:Educational institutions established in 2003 Category:2003 establishments in Qatar Category:Texas A&M; University Category:Ricardo Legorreta buildings ","title":"Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar"},{"id":"1443634","text":"William John Donovan Jr. (born May 30, 1965) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach of the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA), a position he took in September 2020. Donovan had been the head coach of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder from 2015 until 2020, and previously spent 19 seasons as the head basketball coach at the University of Florida, where he became the program's all-time leader in coaching wins. His Florida Gator teams won back-to-back NCAA championships in 2006 and 2007, and Donovan led the Gators to more NCAA tournament appearances, NCAA tournament wins, and Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships than all other Florida coaches combined. Donovan was born and raised in Rockville Centre on Long Island, New York. As the starting point guard for Rick Pitino's University of Providence squad, Donovan led the Friars to the 1987 Final Four. As such, he is one of only four men (Dean Smith, Joe B. Hall and Bobby Knight being the others) to appear in the NCAA Final Four as a player and win the NCAA national championship as a coach. After college, Donovan spent the 1987‚Äì88 and 1988‚Äì89 basketball seasons split between the developmental Continental Basketball Association and the NBA's New York Knicks, who were led by his college coach, Rick Pitino. Donovan left professional basketball in 1989, and briefly worked as a Wall Street stock broker before following Pitino to his new job at the University of Kentucky. Donovan served as an assistant coach for the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball from 1989 to 1993, working his way from serving as a unpaid graduate assistant to being the top assistant and lead recruiter. He accepted his first head coaching position at Marshall University in 1994 and led the Thundering Herd to a 35‚Äì20 record over two seasons. Donovan was hired to revive Florida's basketball program in 1996. After two losing seasons while he rebuilt the roster through relentless recruiting, Donovan's Gators began a streak of sixteen straight 20-win seasons, a period which included multiple conference championships, four Final Four appearances, two NCAA championships, and three SEC coach of the year awards. During Donovan's tenure at Florida, he was often rumored to be a candidate for various NCAA and NBA head coaching positions. In June 2007, after leading the Gators to their second consecutive national title, he accepted an offer to become the head coach of the NBA's Orlando Magic. However, he immediately had second thoughts, and after a week, he persuaded the Magic to release him from his newly signed contract and allow him to return to Florida, where he remained for eight more seasons. In April 2015, Donovan left Florida to accept an offer to coach the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder. In his first season with the team, Donovan led the Thunder to a first-place finish in their division and a trip to the conference finals, where they lost to the Golden State Warriors in 7 games after building a 3‚Äì1 series lead. In subsequent seasons under Donovan, the Thunder finished each season with a winning record and an NBA playoff berth but did not progress past the first round. Donovan was named the National Basketball Coaches Association Coach of the Year for the 2019-2020 season. Soon thereafter, he left the Thunder by mutual agreement and accepted an offer to coach the Chicago Bulls in September 2020. ==Early life== Donovan was born and raised in Rockville Centre on Long Island, New York along with a younger sister by his parents, Bill Donovan Sr. and Joan Donovan. Bill Donovan Sr. is the third leading scorer in the history of the Boston College Eagles men's basketball program, and he sometimes coached his only son's youth basketball teams while working in the textile industry. Billy Donovan Jr. attended St. Agnes Cathedral High School in Rockville Centre, where he played basketball under coach Frank Morris. Donovan was described as a \\"gym rat\\" who would play basketball as often as possible, even sneaking into his high school gymnasium late at night to practice. With Donovan starting at point guard, St. Agnes won the Long Island Catholic High School Championship during his senior year. ==Playing career== ===Providence College=== Upon graduation, Donovan accepted an athletic scholarship to Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island. He was not a starter during his first two seasons with the Providence Friars men's basketball team and averaged two points per game as a freshman and three as a sophomore under coach Joe Mullaney. Mullaney retired after the 1984‚Äì85 season, and New York Knicks assistant coach Rick Pitino became Providence's new head coach. Soon after, Donovan informed Pitino that he would like to transfer to Fairfield or Northeastern to get more playing time. However, when Pitino called the coaches of those smaller conference schools on Donovan's behalf, they declined to offer him a scholarship, so Pitino advised Donovan to stay at Providence and get himself into better physical shape for the upcoming season. Donovan flourished in Pitino's system, which emphasized the new three- point shot on offense and a fast-paced full-court press defense. \\"Billy the Kid,\\" as Providence fans soon nicknamed him (after the 19th-century outlaw), averaged 15.1 points per game as a junior and 20.6 as a senior, when he led the sixth-seeded Friars to the 1987 Final Four and earned Southeast Regional Most Valuable Player honors. Donovan was also named to the 1987 All-Big East first team, the 1987 Big East All-Tournament team, and was an honorable mention All-American. Pitino would later say, \\"I've never in my life had anyone work as hard to improve as (Donovan).\\" ===Professional career=== Donovan was drafted by the Utah Jazz in the third round (68th overall) of the 1987 NBA draft, but was waived before the regular season began. He signed with the Wyoming Wildcatters of the Continental Basketball Association, hoping for another chance to play in the NBA. Pitino left Providence after the team's Final Four run and returned to New York as the head coach of the New York Knicks. In December 1987, Donovan was reunited with his college coach when the Knicks signed him to a one-year contract. He served as a reserve guard for the remainder of the 1987‚Äì88 season and averaged 2.4 points and 2.0 assists over 44 games. The Knicks waived Donovan in March 1988. He did not make an NBA roster during the 1988‚Äì89 preseason, so he returned to the CBA, averaging 10.1 points per game with the Rapid City Thrillers.1989‚Äì90 CBA Official Guide and Register, page 256 ==Before coaching== Donovan had not received another NBA offer by the end of 1988 and came to the conclusion that he did not have a long-term future as a professional basketball player. He left the CBA in January 1989 and took a job with a Wall Street investment banking firm. Donovan was \\"miserable\\" during his brief stint as a stock broker, and he especially hated the required cold-call stock sales. After just a few weeks at the firm, he called Pitino to seek advice about becoming a basketball coach. Donovan had not been a vocal leader as a player, and Pitino doubted if he had the necessary communication skills required for coaching, so he suggested that Donovan give the financial sector more of a chance before rushing to change careers. Donovan called Pitino again in April 1989 to reaffirm his interest in coaching basketball. At the time, Pitino was in the process of leaving the Knicks to become the head coach at the University of Kentucky, and he agreed to bring along Donovan as a graduate assistant to see if he had a future in coaching. ==Collegiate coaching career== ===Kentucky assistant (1989‚Äì94)=== Pitino was tasked with rebuilding a Kentucky basketball program which had been devastated by sanctions levied by the NCAA due to earlier rules violations. The Wildcats quickly returned to national prominence, and Donovan's coaching career progressed quickly as well. After one season as a graduate assistant, he was promoted to assistant coach in 1990 and to associate head coach in 1992. In that position, Donovan served as Pitino's top assistant during Kentucky's 1993 Final Four run, and he helped to recruit the members of UK's 1996 national championship team. ===Marshall University (1994‚Äì96)=== Donovan's association with Kentucky's success plus Pitino's recommendation earned him an offer to become the head basketball coach at Marshall University, where the Thundering Herd had struggled to a 9‚Äì18 record during the 1993‚Äì94 season. Donovan accepted the offer, making him (at 28 years old) the youngest head basketball coach in NCAA Division I. At Marshall, Donovan installed the fast- paced offense and defensive schemes employed by Pitino. A previously scheduled early season match-up pitted Marshall against Kentucky in December 1994. Before the game, Pitino advised his young protege to \\"try to whip Kentucky's ass, because we'll try to do the same to you.\\" Though he was warmly received by the Rupp Arena crowd, Donovan's team did not feel as welcome, losing 116‚Äì75. The rest of the season was more successful. Donovan's first Marshall squad doubled its win total from the previous year, earning an 18‚Äì9 record and winning the Southern Conference North Division title as Donovan was named the 1995 Southern Conference Coach of the Year. In Donovan's second season, 1995‚Äì96, the team went 17‚Äì11 and led the Southern Conference in scoring and three-point field goals. Donovan was also successful on the recruiting trail, convincing nationally sought prep star Jason Williams to decline scholarship offers from more established programs and remain in state to attend Marshall. Williams would later follow Donovan to Florida. In all, Donovan's Marshall teams compiled a 35‚Äì20 record over two seasons. ===University of Florida (1996‚Äì2015)=== In March 1996, University of Florida basketball coach Lon Kruger resigned to take the same position at the University of Illinois. The Florida basketball program had only fleeting success over its history, and although the Gators reached their first Final Four under Kruger in 1994, his teams slipped back to mediocre levels. Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley sought a \\"young, energetic, and enthusiastic\\" coach to bring sustained success, and after a wide-ranging search, he decided that 30-year-old Billy Donovan was the best fit. To assure Donovan that he would be given enough time to build up the program, Foley offered him a six-year contract. With few talented players on the roster, Donovan's first two Florida squads had records of 13‚Äì17 and 15‚Äì16. There were some signs of improvement, however, as the 1997‚Äì98 team was invited to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), and Donovan's \\"relentless\\" recruiting during this period set the foundation for future success. Donovan finally brought lasting success to the Florida basketball program during the 1998‚Äì99 season. The Gators went 22‚Äì9, earning 20+ wins for only the fifth time in history and starting a streak of 16 consecutive 20-win seasons. The Gators continued to play well in the 1999 postseason, as they made their third NCAA Sweet Sixteen appearance and became the second squad in school history to appear in the final top 25 polls (No. 17 in the ESPN/USA Today Poll and No. 23 in the Associated Press Poll). The 1999‚Äì2000 season saw Donovan lead the Gators to their first regular season SEC Championship and their second NCAA Final Four appearance, defeating North Carolina in the national semi-finals before falling to Michigan State in the NCAA championship game. The Gators again won the SEC regular season championship during the 2000‚Äì01 season, and on February 3, 2003, the team achieved a No. 1 ranking in the ESPN/USA Today poll for the first time in school history, returning there the following season on December 8, 2003. The 2004‚Äì05 season was highlighted by Florida defeating Kentucky 70‚Äì53 to win the SEC Tournament Championship, the first time that the Gators won the conference tournament. While successful during the regular season, Donovan's Florida squads from 2001 to 2005 consistently underperformed in the NCAA tournament, losing to lower-seeded teams in the first or second round every year despite rosters stocked with highly recruited players. Still in his thirties, some commentators speculated that Donovan was an excellent recruiter who was unable to make in-game adjustments or develop talented players once they were on the UF campus. Back-to-back national championships In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Donovan's sophomore-led Gator squad posted the school's best-ever win streak to start a season, reeling off 17 straight wins and reaching No. 2 in the nation in the AP Poll. However, the team failed to reach the top spot as they lost its first SEC game of the season to the Tennessee Volunteers. This loss was followed by a surprising season sweep at the hands of the eventual 2006 National Invitation Tournament champion South Carolina Gamecocks as Florida posted a 10‚Äì6 conference record, good for second place in the SEC Eastern Division. Donovan's young Gator squad would come together in the postseason. Florida reached the SEC Tournament championship and avenged their surprising regular season defeats by beating South Carolina in the finals, earning the school's second conference tournament title. In the 2006 NCAA tournament, the 3rd-seeded Gators finally reached the Sweet 16 and beyond. They defeated Villanova (who had knocked them out the tournament the previous season) to reach the Final Four, and in the championship game, they defeated UCLA 73‚Äì57 to win the school's first NCAA basketball title. 2006‚Äì07 Gators, with U.S. President George W. Bush at the White House in 2007. During a post- championship celebration in the O'Connell Center, the Gators' entire starting five of (Lee Humphrey, Joakim Noah, Al Horford, Corey Brewer, and Taurean Green) announced they would return the following year and attempt to win another championship (the last back-to-back title winner was 1991 and 1992 Duke) instead of declaring early for the NBA draft. Accordingly, the Gators were named preseason favorites to repeat by many media pundits. The Gators raced out of the gates, losing just two non-conference games (versus Kansas and at Florida State). On December 20, 2006, Donovan became the winningest basketball coach in Florida history, earning his 236th win to surpass Norm Sloan's total. The 2007 Gators looked even more mature in terms of their unselfishness, passing and shooting abilities and overall team play. Although the Gators sputtered down the stretch during SEC play, losing three of four games beginning with a loss at Vanderbilt, the team rebounded with its sixth consecutive win over its archrivals, the Kentucky Wildcats, to regain momentum and claim the SEC regular season championship. The Gators then repeated as SEC Tournament champions with dominating performances that culminated in a win over the Arkansas Razorbacks in the finals. Florida earned the number one overall seed in the 2007 NCAA Tournament and defeated Jackson State, Purdue, Butler and Oregon to reach the Final Four. The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 title game against UCLA, and Donovan's Gators prevailed 76‚Äì66. The Gators secured their repeat championship two nights later with an emphatic 84‚Äì75 victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes, coached by Thad Matta. With the Florida Gators football having won the 2007 BCS National Championship Game (also over Ohio State) three months prior, the University of Florida became the first school in NCAA history to hold both the football and basketball national championships at the same time. Donovan's first decade in Gainesville brought a new level of success to the University of Florida's basketball program. The Gators were invited to the NCAA Tournament in every season between 1999 and 2007 (a streak of nine straight appearances), reached three national championship games, and won two NCAA titles. In contrast, Florida basketball squads had only appeared in five NCAA Tournaments in 81 years of play before Donovan's arrival and had never reached an NCAA championship game. In conference play, Florida had captured only one regular season SEC championship and had never won the conference tournament before Donovan's arrival. From 1996 until 2007, the Gators won three SEC regular season titles and three SEC tournament titles. After announcing his return to Gainesville, Donovan signed the top-ranked 2007 recruiting class, as rated by Rivals.com. Despite the loss of all five starters from the previous year, the Gators surprised many pundits with Donovan's tenth straight twenty-win season.Florida Gators Orlando Sentinel However, after an 18‚Äì3 start, the team struggled during the final third of the season, winning just three of its last eleven games and snapping the Gators' nine-year streak of NCAA Tournament invitations. The young Gator team rebounded to reach the semifinals of the 2008 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) before falling to the UMass Minutemen. The 2008‚Äì09 Gators started out the season ranked No. 19 and 5‚Äì0 before falling to Syracuse. A loss two weeks later to the Florida State Seminoles knocked the Gators out of the top twenty-five ranked teams. Though the team won twenty-two regular season games, it once again was not enough to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. However, the Gators were given a number one seed in the 2009 NIT, where they lost to the Penn State Nittany Lions in the quarterfinals. The Gators returned to the NCAA tournament during the 2009‚Äì10 season, but lost in the first round to the BYU Cougars in double overtime. During the season, Florida defeated Florida State, ending a three-game losing streak to the Seminoles. They also defeated Michigan State, a preseason favorite to win the NCAA tournament and an eventual Final Four team, en route to winning the 2009 Legends Classic tournament. With three returning senior starters, the 2010‚Äì11 Gators posted an improved record. They won the SEC regular season title, and were the runners-up in the 2011 SEC Tournament. In the 2011 NCAA Tournament, the Gators defeated the Jimmer Fredette-led BYU Cougars, before losing in overtime to the Butler Bulldogs in the Elite Eight. On March 8, 2011, Donovan was named the 2011 SEC Coach of the Year. Despite appearing in three national title games and winning two national titles, it was Donovan's first time winning the award. Gators forward Chandler Parsons also became the first Gator to ever win SEC Player of the Year honors. The 2011‚Äì12 Gators were again invited to the NCAA Tournament, this time as a seventh-seed. They defeated the tenth-seeded Virginia Cavaliers and fifteenth-seeded Norfolk State (who had beaten second-seeded Missouri) to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, then defeated Marquette 68‚Äì58 to return to the Elite Eight for the second straight year. In the Elite Eight, Donovan and the Gators faced off against Louisville and Donovan's former coach Pitino. The Gators fell in a very close game, 72‚Äì68. Donovan recorded his 400th career victory at the University of Florida on January 19, 2013 with an 83‚Äì52 win over the Missouri Tigers. The Gators won the 2013 SEC regular season championship (Donovan's fifth regular season conference championship), finished as runner-up in the 2013 SEC Tournament (losing to Ole Miss in the championship game), and advanced to a third consecutive Elite Eight (defeating Northwestern State in the second round, Minnesota in the third round, and Florida Gulf Coast in the Sweet Sixteen, before losing to Michigan in the regional final). 2013‚Äì14 Donovan cutting the net after the Gators beat Dayton in the Elite Eight Donovan's 2013‚Äì14 squad started the year with several players injured or suspended and faced one of the most challenging non-conference schedules in college basketball. Florida dropped two close road games to ranked teams and entered the conference portion of their schedule with an 11‚Äì2 record and a No. 10 national ranking. The Gators would not lose again during the regular season, becoming the first team in SEC history to finish with an 18‚Äì0 conference record while also setting numerous school records. Florida then won the 2014 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament to run their overall record against SEC opponents to 21‚Äì0. The SEC regular season championship was the third in four seasons for Donovan's Gators, and their conference tournament championship was their fourth in school history, all coming under Donovan. He was named the SEC's Coach of the Year for the third time, and his players won many of the conference's individual awards. Senior point guard Scottie Wilbekin was named Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year and the SEC Tournament MVP, senior center Patric Young was named the Defensive Player and Scholar-Athlete of the Year, junior forward Dorian Finney-Smith was named Sixth Man of the Year, and senior guard Casey Prather was named to the All-SEC First Team. The Gators earned the number one overall seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament, and their winning streak stretched to 30 games as they reached the Final Four by defeating each of their first four tournament opponents by double digit margins. However, the Gators' season ended with a national semifinal loss to the 7-seed and eventual national champion UConn Huskies, who had been the last team to beat Florida the previous December. 2014‚Äì15 On February 28, 2015, Donovan became the second youngest coach in NCAA Division I history to earn 500 career wins, accomplishing the feat in the Florida Gators' 66‚Äì49 victory over the Tennessee Volunteers. Donovan joined Bob Knight as the only coaches to reach 500 wins before turning 50 years old. However, his Gator squad finished the season with a 16‚Äì17 record, ending the Gators' winning season and 20-win season streaks at 16 years apiece. In 18 years at Florida, Donovan led the Gators to 14 NCAA Tournament appearances, six SEC regular season titles (four outright, two shared) and four SEC Tournament titles. By comparison, the Gators had only made three \\"official\\" NCAA Tournament appearances (not counting two under Sloan which were vacated), one regular season conference title, and no tournament titles in their entire history before Donovan's arrival. ==Professional coaching career== ===Orlando Magic (June 2007)=== During Florida's national championship runs, rumors abounded that Donovan was considering an offer to become the head coach at the University of Kentucky. He later said that, while UK may have had some interest, he \\"never had any official contact with Kentucky.\\" After winning the 2007 national championship, Donovan announced that he had no plans to leave Florida for another college job and was working on a contract extension with UF. However, in late May, the NBA's Orlando Magic offered Donovan their head coaching job to replace Brian Hill, who had been fired after two consecutive losing seasons. Donovan struggled with the decision until June 1, 2007 when he agreed to accept the Orlando Magic's contract offer, reportedly worth $27.5 million over five years. Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley contacted Anthony Grant, Donovan's former assistant who was the head coach at Virginia Commonwealth University at the time, to inquire about his interest in replacing Donovan. Donovan held an introductory press conference in Orlando on June 1, 2007, followed by an emotional farewell press conference in Gainesville later that day. The next morning Donovan began having second thoughts about his decision, and informed Jeremy Foley and the Magic front office that he had changed his mind about leaving Florida. After failing to change his mind, the Magic reached an agreement with Donovan on June 6, 2007, releasing him from his contract, thereby leaving leaving him free to return as the head coach of the Florida Gators basketball team. As a stipulation of his release, he reportedly agreed not to coach in the NBA for the following five seasons. Donovan issued apologies to all involved parties, and the Orlando Magic soon after hired Stan Van Gundy as their head coach. ===Oklahoma City Thunder (2015‚Äì2020)=== On April 30, 2015, Donovan was named the head coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder, reportedly agreeing to a five-year deal replacing Scott Brooks amounting to nearly $30 Million,https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/billy-donovan-bulls-get- proven-winner-and-another-sign-new- era#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%20night%2C%20the%20Bulls,with%20the%20Oklahoma%20City%20Thunder. who previously coached the Thunder for seven seasons. On September 8, 2020, it was announced that Donovan would not be returning to the team as the two sides failed to agree on a contract extension.https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29840761 Over his five seasons in Oklahoma City, Donovan went 243‚Äì157 while making the postseason each year, advancing past the first round just once. Following the 2019‚Äì20 season, Donovan's contract was not renewed, and both sides agreed to mutually part ways. ===Chicago Bulls (2020‚Äìpresent)=== On September 22, 2020, the Chicago Bulls hired Donovan as their new head coach with a four-year deal worth a reported $24 millionhttps://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/billy-donovan-says-he- wanted-to-join-bulls-as-new-coach-due-to-their-iconic-place-in-the-history-of- the-game/ ==National team career== Donovan has been chosen to be a head coach for USA Basketball on three occasions. He coached the 2012 U18 team to the 2012 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship, going 5‚Äì0 in the tournament. He then led many of the same players to the 2013 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, going 9‚Äì0 in that tournament. The following summer, he again coached the US team at the 2014 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship and again led them to the tournament championship with another 5‚Äì0 record. Some commentators have opined that Donovan should succeed Mike Krzyzewski as the head coach of the United States men's national basketball team at the 2020 Summer Olympics. ==Awards== The United States Sports Academy presented Donovan with the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award in 2006. Donovan was the recipient of the John R. Wooden Award's \\"Legends of Coaching Award\\" in 2010. Donovan was recognized by his peers as the SEC Coach of the Year in 2011, 2013 and 2014. ==Personal life== Donovan married his wife, Christine (n√©e D'Auria), in 1989. The Donovans have four children: Connor, Bryan, Hasbrouck and William Donovan III, who transferred to Florida from Catholic University and walked on to his father's team as a reserve guard. A fifth child, Jacqueline, was delivered stillborn in 2000, prompting Donovan to become involved in several children's charities and to help raise funds for a children's hospital in Gainesville. Similar tragedies struck the families of Pitino, former assistant coach Anthony Grant, and current assistant John Pelphrey, forging a closer bond between them. Donovan's parents bought a home in Gainesville in 1996, and Bill Donovan Sr., has been a fixture at most Gator games and practices ever since. Donovan is a Roman Catholic. He has been described as politically conservative by some of his players and in the media; however, he is a registered independent. ==Philanthropy== In October 2008, coach Donovan and then-head Florida Gators football coach Urban Meyer were named co-chairmen of an effort to raise $50 million to support the Florida Opportunity Scholars Program.Meyer & Donovan to raise funding The Florida Opportunity Scholars Program was created by University of Florida President Bernie Machen in 2006, and is intended to increase the opportunities for academically prepared first-generation students who have experience significantly different needs and financial challenges. Donovan was instrumental in fund-raising and pushing for the development of a Catholic high school in Gainesville, which did not have a Catholic secondary school when Donovan arrived at the University of Florida in 1996. St. Francis High School opened in 2004 and expanded in 2008 with much help from Donovan; his children attended the school. ==Head coaching record== ===College=== ===NBA=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Oklahoma City  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  825527 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1st in Northwest18117 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Lost in Conference Finals -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Oklahoma City  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  824735 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2nd in Northwest514 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Lost in First Round -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Oklahoma City  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  824834 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2nd in Northwest624 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"Lost in First Round -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Oklahoma City  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  824933 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4th in Northwest514 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Lost in First Round -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Oklahoma City  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  724428 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2nd in Northwest734 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Lost in First Round - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! align=\\"center\\" colspan=2Career ! 400243157 411823 ==See also== * Florida Gators * History of the University of Florida * List of NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament Final Four appearances by coach * List of Providence College alumni * Marshall Thundering Herd * Providence Friars * University of Florida Athletic Association ==References== ==External links== Category:1965 births Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball coaches from New York (state) Category:Basketball players at the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from New York (state) Category:Chicago Bulls head coaches Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:Florida Gators men's basketball coaches Category:Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball coaches Category:Living people Category:Marshall Thundering Herd men's basketball coaches Category:New York Knicks players Category:Oklahoma City Thunder head coaches Category:People from Rockville Centre, New York Category:Point guards Category:Providence Friars men's basketball players Category:Rapid City Thrillers players Category:Sportspeople from Nassau County, New York Category:Sportspeople from Staten Island Category:Utah Jazz draft picks Category:Wyoming Wildcatters players ","title":"Billy Donovan"},{"id":"1443637","text":"Sandra Keith Boynton (born April 3, 1953) is an American humorist, songwriter, director, music producer, children's author and illustrator. Boynton has written and illustrated more than fifty books for both children and adults, as well as over four thousand greeting cards, and five music albums. She has also designed calendars, wallpaper, bedding, stationery, paper goods, clothing, jewelry, and plush toys for various companies. ==Early life and education== The third of the four daughters of Jeanne () and Robert W. Boynton, Sandra was born in Orange, New Jersey, and grew up in the Mount Airy section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father was a noted progressive educator, scholar (collaborating on textbooks with Shakespearean scholar Maynard Mack), and publisher and co-founder of Boynton/Cook Publishers, now owned by Heinemann. Boynton's parents became Quakers when she was two years old. From kindergarten through 12th grade, she and her sisters attended Germantown Friends School, where their father taught English and was Head of the Upper School. Boynton has frequently cited as central to her own \\"upbeat offbeat\\" sensibility Germantown Friends' arts-centered curriculum, as well as its thorough integration of the values of pacifism, independent inquiry, and individualism. She also spent part of her 10th grade year at Ackworth School near Pontefract, England. She studied Latin for five years in high school, mostly in order to avoid science classes, the scheduling of which invariably conflicted with Latin. She went on to Yale, entering in 1970 in the college's second year of coeducation. She spent the second semester of her junior year studying in Paris through Wesleyan University's program. At Yale, she majored in English, and also sang sporadically with the Yale Glee Club; she had joined the Glee Club when additional singers were needed for a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at Carnegie Hall, under the direction of Leopold Stokowski. Boynton has described herself as \\"an enthusiastic but undistinguished alto\\". At her graduation from Yale in 1974, she received a Special Master's Magna solemnly bestowed by Charles Davis, the Master of Boynton's residential college, Calhoun College. Unbeknownst to the graduation audience, the honor was actually a fiction. Boynton's grade point average did not in fact entitle her to any degree honor; but shortly before the ceremony, she had told Professor Davis in mock earnest that \\"my parents are here, so I'd really appreciate it if you could just mumble some Latin after my name\\". Boynton intended to become a theater director. For graduate studies in drama, she attended the University of California, Berkeley for one year, then transferred to the Yale School of Drama D.F.A. program, but she did not complete the program. With the birth of her first child in 1979, Boynton postponed indefinitely a career in the theater, judging the demands of that profession not easily compatible with raising a family. During her undergraduate and graduate years, her teachers included Cleanth Brooks, Harold Bloom, Richard B. Sewell, Maynard Mack, Maurice Sendak, Richard Gilman, Rocco Landesman, David Milch, Stanley Kauffmann, and William Arrowsmith. In an autobiographical talk given at Yale in 2002, \\"The Curious Misuse of a Yale Education\\", Boynton refers to her book Grunt (an illuminated book and recording of plainchant in Latin and Pig Latin) as \\"the culmination of a lifetime spent joyfully squandering an expensive education on producing works of no apparent significance\\". ==Career== ===Greeting cards=== Boynton's greeting card designs for Recycled Paper Greetings were at the forefront of the Alternative Cards commercial movement that began in the mid-1970s. According to RPG co-founder and president Mike Keiser, nearly 500 million copies of Boynton's distinctive humorous cards‚Äîfeaturing an assortment of unnamed cartoon animal characters, spare layout, and droll messages‚Äîsold between 1973 and 2003. The best known of these is a 1975 birthday card bearing images of four animals and the message \\"Hippo Birdie Two Ewes\\", a pun playing on the phrase \\"Happy Birthday to You\\". The card has sold over ten million copies to date. ===Books=== Since the 1977 release of Hippos Go Berserk!, Boynton has published many children's books, as well as several illustrated humor books for the general market. Her books are most typically for very young children, offered in the laminated paperboard format known as board books. Nearly all of Boynton's books have been published by either Workman Publishing or Simon & Schuster. Four of her books have been New York Times best sellers: Chocolate: The Consuming Passion (1982); Yay, You! (2001); Consider Love (2002); and Philadelphia Chickens (2002), which reached the number one position on the list, and was on the list for nearly a year. Six Boynton books were on the 2001 Publishers Weekly All-Time Bestselling Children's Books list: Moo, Baa, La La La!, The Going to Bed Book, Barnyard Dance, A to Z, Blue Hat, Green Hat, and Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs!. More than 60 million copies of her books have been sold. ===Theater=== In May 1995, Boynton wrote and directed a benefit reading, On Stage‚Äîfeaturing Jill Clayburgh, Joe Pacheco, and Jane Curtin‚Äîfor Sharon Stage in Connecticut.

Meltzer died of esophageal cancer in 2009.New York Times: Milton Meltzer, Prolific Author, Dies at 94 ==Personal Life== Meltzer was born in Worcester, Massachusetts to Benjamin and Mary Meltzer, semi-literate immigrants from Austria-Hungary. One of three sons, Meltzer was the only child to graduate from high school, furthering his education at Columbia University from 1932 to 1936, he had to drop out of college before graduating to support his family after his father died of cancer. Meltzer became a staff writer for the Works Project Administration, a program designed by the Federal Government to provide jobs for the millions of unemployed during the Great Depression where he worked until 1939. Meltzer was a staunch advocate for human rights, and much of his work he claimed was his way of speaking out against injustices and dictatorships. Meltzer wed Hilda \\"Hildy\\" Balinky on June 22, 1941. Meltzer served in the military during World War II, and rose to the rank of sergeant. After serving during the war, Meltzer became a writer for the CBS radio broadcasting network and then took an executive position with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. While traveling the country for Pfizer, Meltzer did research at historical societies, local archives and museums and collected nearly 1,000 illustrations to begin a career writing history books with a focus on social justice. Having dropped out of university, he was a self- taught historian, and conducted much of his research in person, even developing his own notation system.New York Times: Milton Meltzer, Prolific Author, Dies at 94 He originally intended to be a teacher, and did not begin his interest in writing books until he turned 40. Milton and Hildy Meltzer had two daughters and grandchildren. Hildy Meltzer died in 2008.

He wrote several biographies, including ones of Langston Hughes and Thomas Jefferson. Though most of his books are nonfiction he wrote two historical fiction novels, The Underground Man and Tough Times. The Underground Man is about a white abolitionist in the 1800s United States who is imprisoned for helping escaped slaves. Tough Times details the life of a young man coming of age during the Great Depression and draws on some of Meltzer's personal experiences growing up during the period. Some of Meltzer's other works focus on topics such as piracy, ancient Egypt, and early American wars with the Seminole people. Meltzer co-authored with Harlem Renaissance writer Langston Hughes the book A Pictorial History of the Negro in America, which was published in 1956. He also collaborated with Hughes on Black Magic: A Pictorial History of the African-American in the Performing Arts, though Hughes passed shortly after the book went to the press. Meltzer won several awards for single books and career achievements. In 1981 he was an American Book Award finalist for All Times, All Peoples: A World History of Slavery. Meltzer's Never to Forget: The Jews of the Holocaust was the 1976 recipient of the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award in the non-fiction category and winner of the National Jewish Book Award. He won the Boston Globe-Horn Award in 1983 for Jewish Americans: A History in Their own Words, 1650-1950.

J. Caruso and starring Val Kilmer and Vincent D'Onofrio. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles, at LA Center Studios, and the Salton Sea.Inland Empire Film Commission: IEFC Film Credits ==Plot== While playing the trumpet in a burning room, the protagonist's voice is heard in narration. His story begins with him posing as \\"Danny Parker\\", a speed freak addicted to methamphetamine, who hangs out with friends while indulging in drugs. He also moonlights as an informant for two corrupt cops, Gus Morgan and Al Garcetti. He is trying to set up a large meth score with notorious drug dealer Pooh Bear, an eccentric psychopath who lost his nose to excessive snorting of \\"Gak\\" (meth), while also attempting to set up a sting operation for Morgan and Garcetti. When he returns home, Danny sheds his clothes and his personality, and basks in his past life as trumpet player \\"Tom Van Allen\\". He reveals to an abused neighbor named Colette that he was once happily married, only to watch as his wife was gunned down by masked thieves during a stopover at the Salton Sea. When meeting with Pooh Bear, Danny becomes fearful of Pooh Bear's displays of bizarre homicidal behavior, so he tapes a gun to the bottom of a table. Danny's parents-in-law track him down, believing he has sunk into depression after his wife's death, but he tells them he doesn't want their help. As the deal approaches, it becomes known that Danny is not only working for the police but FBI agents working to take down Morgan and Garcetti, who have committed multiple murders. It is also revealed that they were the men who killed his wife and wounded him as they robbed a drug dealer. Danny had started his own investigation when he found out who Morgan was and delved into the drug underworld to become a believable junkie. On the night of the deal, Danny, with the help of his best friend Jimmy, leads the FBI to the wrong location. Meanwhile, Danny arrives at Pooh Bear's house. At the dinner table, surrounded by Pooh Bear's armed friends, tensions rise and one of Pooh Bear's men tries to kill Danny, who retrieves the gun he stashed earlier and shoots the rest of the gang. Shot in the chest by Pooh Bear, Danny collapses to the floor. Pooh Bear, wounded in the leg, goes to take a shot of meth while mumbling incoherently. Morgan and Garcetti arrive, find the massacre, and Garcetti kills Pooh Bear, whose drug-filled hypo drops to the floor. Garcetti is then killed by Danny, whose life was saved by a bulletproof vest. Morgan is shot twice by Danny, who reveals to Morgan that he knows he murdered his wife. Morgan manages to snatch Danny's gun away, but finds it empty. Danny finds Pooh Bear's syringe on the floor and plunges it into Morgan's neck, then picks up a pistol and briefly contemplates suicide, but then shoots Morgan several times and flees. Back in his apartment, he dons his Tom Van Allen identity again, but is shot by Colette's \\"boyfriend\\", who is in fact an agent tasked with exacting vengeance for the Mexicali Boys, a leader of whom Danny turned in to the police before the events of the film's present day timeline. Collette says she was forced to betray Danny because her daughter was being held hostage. The room catches fire, and Danny plays one more tune on his trumpet before passing out. He regains consciousness to find that Jimmy has saved him from the fire and taken him to a hospital. After he recovers, he leaves the city, and the identities of Danny and Tom, behind. ==Cast== * Val Kilmer as Danny Parker/Tom Van Allen * Vincent D'Onofrio as Holland Dale \\"Pooh-Bear\\" Monty * Adam Goldberg as Kujo * Luis Guzm√°n as Quincy * Doug Hutchison as Gus Morgan * Anthony LaPaglia as Al Garcetti * Glenn Plummer as Bobby * Peter Sarsgaard as Jimmy the Finn * Deborah Kara Unger as Colette Vaughn * Chandra West as Liz Van Allen * B.D.

The army gave it the designation \\"Type 2 Two-Seat Fighter\\"; the Allied reporting name was \\"Nick\\". ==Design and development== In response to the rapid emergence in Europe of twin-engine heavy fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 110, the army ordered development of a twin-engine, two-seat fighter in 1937, and assigned the proposal by Kawasaki Shipbuilding the designation of Ki-38. This only went as far as a mock up, but by December of that year the army ordered a working prototype as the Ki-45, which first flew in January 1939. Results from the test flights, however, did not meet the army's expectations. The Ha-20 Otsu engine was underpowered and failure-prone, while the airframe suffered from nacelle stall. The Ki-45 did not enter service, but the army, insistent on having a working twin-engine fighter, ordered Kawasaki to continue development. Kawasaki responded by replacing the engines with the proven Nakajima Ha-25. Flight tests were promising. In October 1940, the army ordered continued improvements such as switching to 805 kW (1,080 hp) Mitsubishi Ha-102 engines. This craft, designated Ki-45 Kai, was completed in September 1941 and was officially adopted for use by the army in February 1942 as the \\"Type 2 two-seat fighter\\". The prototype of a single-seat fighter variant, the Ki-45 II, was also built; development continued under the designation Ki-96. ==Operational history== Kawasaki Ki-45 KAIc Army Type 2 two-seat fighter Model C of the 53rd Hiko Sentai The Ki-45 was initially used as a long-range bomber escort. The 84th Independent Flight Wing (Dokuritsu Hik≈ç Chutai) used them in June 1942 in attacks on Guilin, where they encountered, but were no match for, Curtiss P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers. In September of the same year, they met P-40s over Hanoi with similar results. It became clear that the Ki-45 could not hold its own against single-engine fighters in aerial combat. It was subsequently deployed in several theaters in the roles of interception, attack (anti-ground as well as anti-shipping) and fleet defense. Its greatest strength turned out to be as an anti-bomber interceptor, as was the case with the Bf 110 in Europe. In New Guinea, the IJAAF used the aircraft in an anti- ship role, where the Ki-45 was heavily armed with one 37 mm (1.46 in) and two 20 mm cannons and could carry two 250 kg (550 lb) bombs on hard points under the wings. 1,675 Ki-45s of all versions were produced during the war. The first production type (Ko) was armed with two 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine gun in the nose, a single Type 97 20 mm cannon in the belly offset to the right, and a trainable 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine gun in the rear cabin; this was followed by the Otsu with the lower 20 mm cannon replaced by a 37 mm (1.46 in) type 94 tank gun, to counter B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. While the firepower was devastating, manual reloading meant that typically only two rounds could be fired on each gunnery pass. The next type (Hei) restored the 20 mm cannon, and this time placed an automatic 37 mm (1.46 in) gun in the nose. A later addition in the Tei type were twin obliquely-firing 20 mm Ho-5 cannons behind the cockpit, and often propulsive exhaust stacks. Soon after entering service, the Ki-45 was assigned to home defense, and several were dispatched against the Doolittle raid, though they did not see action. The craft's heavy armament proved to be effective against the B-29 Superfortress raids which started in June 1944. However, its performance was insufficient to counter B-29s flying at 10,000 m (32,800 ft). Modifications such as reduction of fuel and ordnance were attempted to raise performance, to little avail, and in the end aircraft were used effectively in aerial ramming attacks. They were also used in kamikaze attacks, such as the attack on USS on 2 April 1945 off Okinawa. The commanding officer and 54 crew were killed when a Toryu clipped the stacks from astern, and rammed the bridge. A second Toryu hit the foredeck, opening a 7 m (23 ft) hole in the deck. The ensuing fires demolished the ship, and after the surviving crew was rescued by fellow fast transports, destroyer escort and destroyer-transport , the ship was towed out to sea and scuttled.\\"Dickerson\\". Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. US Navy Naval Historical Centre. Retrieved: 15 October 2008. Remains of the only surviving Ki-45 KAIc, on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, with a Schr√§ge Musik-type vertical cannon mount behind the cockpit In 1945, the forward and upward-firing guns showed some results with the commencement of night time bombing raids, but the lack of radar was a considerable handicap. By the spring of 1945, the advent of American carrier- based fighters and Iwo Jima-based P-51s and P-47s escorting B-29s over the skies of Japan brought the Ki-45's career to an end. The next version, the Kawasaki Ki-45 KAId, was developed specifically as a night fighter, which was supposed to be equipped with centimetric radar in the nose; due to production difficulties, this did not occur. The aircraft took part in night defense of the Home Islands and equipped four sentais from the autumn of 1944 to the war's end. They obtained notable successes, and one Ki-45 sentai claimed 150 victories, including eight USAAF B-29 Superfortresses in their first combat. The Ki-45 was to be replaced in the ground-attack role by the Ki-102, but was not wholly supplanted by the war's end. Three Ki-45s fell into communist Chinese hands after World War II. Unlike most captured Japanese aircraft, which were employed in the training role, the three Ki-45s were assigned to the 1st Squadron of the Combat Flying Group in March 1949 and were used in combat missions. These aircraft were retired in the early 1950s. ==Variants== There is sometimes a confusion in the different subtypes. The information below is based on Japanese work, not on usual 'western' data. Even the NASM claims that the Ki-45 on display is a hei (c) type whereas Japanese press would read it is a tei (d) type nightfighter version with dorsal armament.

Unlike the albums that followed, this album still possessed a distinct Southern rock overtone that up to this time had predominated Zakk Wylde's solo writing style. The album was initially released in Japan on October 28, 1998. It contained 13 tracks (lacking \\"Lost My Better Half\\" and \\"No More Tears\\"); the cover art was printed on clear plastic, with a separate paper booklet. The back cover was printed with golden ink, and the packaging was, overall, a lot higher quality than all later versions. There was a long delay before it was released outside Japan, because the drums and vocals were buried on some of the tracks towards the end of the disc, so it was collectively decided to remix it for the US release. Due to the delay, Wylde and drummer Phil Ondich decided to give the USA an added bonus and went to the studio in California and recorded the aggressive \\"Lost My Better Half\\" as a one-off bonus track for the album - the recording of which reportedly prompted Wylde to pursue a heavier direction for the band's music thereafter. Sonic Brew was finally released on May 4, 1999 with a standard gloss-printed booklet. Early copies came packed with a free Zakk Wylde guitar pick. Subsequently, the Johnnie Walker whisky company issued a cease and desist order to Wylde on the album cover, which had been designed to match, except for its wording, the distiller's graphic design for its bottles of Black Label Whisky. The band decided to reissue the album with a different album cover, this time merely the band's skull logo and as an added incentive, they wanted to record a further bonus track for the fans who wanted to buy this now-third version of the album. Wylde, Ondich, and Mike Inez of Alice in Chains (who alongside Wylde had helped write the original) recorded their cover of Ozzy's \\"No More Tears\\" accordingly. Born to Lose\\" and \\"No More Tears\\" were released as promotional singles for the album, though no videos were made. Bored to Tears had a promotional video released for the album's 20th anniversary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2KW0y2AFcU. ==Track listing== Notes * The song \\"Mother Mary\\" originated as an unreleased Pride and Glory demo, a live version of which was performed during Pride and Glory's set at the Donington Monsters of Rock Festival in 1994.

More than once, he employed trains to explain the practical effects of his General Theory of Relativity. In 1965, a prototype for the high-speed Metroliner passed through the station at the record speed (at that time) of on a short demonstration run. Very few sections of the Northeast Corridor were capable of handling that speed, and most had to be upgraded before Penn Central's Metroliner service was introduced in 1969. A speed of was achieved on the same portion of track on December 20, 1967, when the U.S.-built UAC TurboTrain set the rail speed record in North America. A plaque at the station commemorates the event. The present station house was built in 1987. Most of Amtrak's Princeton Junction service prior to 2005 was Clocker service commuter traffic to New York, Newark, or Philadelphia. On October 28, 2005, the Clockers were replaced by NJT trains that run only as far south as Trenton. ===Transit village=== Princeton Junction has been designated the core of the West Windsor transit village, a smart growth initiative to promote transit-oriented development which can include government incentives to encourage compact, higher density, mixed-use development within walking distance of the station. Development adjacent to the station permits higher densities and will include retail end entertainment elements. ==Service== Princeton Branch \\"Dinky\\" in 1971 As of 2017, Princeton Junction was the 6th-busiest station in the NJ Transit rail system, with an average of 6,817 weekday boardings. In addition to the Northeast Corridor Line, NJT operates a spur line, the Princeton Branch, to Princeton station located at the Princeton University campus in Princeton. The shuttle is colloquially known as the \\"Dinky\\", and has also been known as the \\"PJ&B;\\" (for \\"Princeton Junction and Back\\"). Two train cars, or sometimes just one, are used. A single switch connects the branch to the Northeast Corridor tracks north of the station. Service on the Princeton Branch was suspended from October 14, 2018 through May 11, 2019, replaced by shuttle buses, as part of NJT's systemwide service reductions during the installation and testing of positive train control. Amtrak provides two early-morning trains to Washington, D.C., and two evening returns, as well as one morning train to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and one evening return, all of which call at Philadelphia. Many more Amtrak trains stop at the nearby Trenton Transit Center. Until 2007, all Amtrak Pennsylvanian trains stopped at Princeton Junction. The southbound Amtrak Palmetto began stopping in Princeton Junction in October 2015. The Central Jersey Route 1 Corridor BRT is a proposed bus rapid transit system which would use Princeton Junction as its hub. ==Station layout== The station has two high-level side platforms. Most of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor lines bypass the station via the inner tracks, except for select Keystone and Northeast Regional trains and the weekday westbound Palmetto. The next northbound station is , but all northbound trains originating in Trenton skip this station and service , with other trains originating at Jersey Avenue. {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=8 width=75P Platform level style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Shuttle style=\\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê toward (Terminus) termination track ‚Üí - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text- align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the left or right - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the right - Track 4 ‚Üê toward () ‚Üê limited service toward Northern Virginia (Trenton) ‚Üê limited service toward () ‚Üê weekday service toward (Trenton) - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Track 3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê services do not stop here - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Track 2 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" services do not stop here ‚Üí - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Track 1 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" limited service toward New York () ‚Üí limited service toward Boston (New Brunswick) ‚Üí toward New York (New Brunswick) ‚Üí - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Side platform, doors will open on the right - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"G style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Street level style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=500Station building, parking, buses } ==References== == External links == *West Windsor Parking Authority *Princeton Junction Amtrak & New Jersey Transit Station (USA RailGuide ‚Äì TrainWeb) *Princeton Junction, NJ - Great American Stations *Station from Google Maps Street View Category:NJ Transit Rail Operations stations Category:Stations on the Northeast Corridor Category:Amtrak stations in New Jersey Category:Railway stations in Mercer County, New Jersey Category:Rail junctions in the United States Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1864 Category:West Windsor Township, New Jersey Category:Stations on the Princeton Branch Category:Former Pennsylvania Railroad stations ","title":"Princeton Junction station"},{"id":"1443760","text":"The Themis family (adj.

Abergavenny is a market town in South East Wales with a castle established by the Norman lord Hamelin de Balun . The feudal barony of Abergavenny came into existence shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066.Sanders, I.J. English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, p7, Barony of Miles of Gloucester & p.66, Braose Baronies in Wales: Radnor, Brecon, Abergavenny, Builth The barony by writ was first created in 1392 for Sir William de Beauchamp, a younger son of the 11th Earl of Warwick. This creation passed to his son, who succeeded as 2nd Baron, and who was subsequently created Earl of Worcester. On his death, the Earldom of Worcester became extinct, but the Barony passed to his daughter, who by modern doctrine succeeded as 3rd Baroness. She died in 1447 when the Barony descended to her son, who succeeded as 4th Baron. In 1450, Sir Edward Nevill, widower of the 3rd Baroness, was summoned to Parliament as Lord Bergavenny. It has been assumed that this summons was intended to be in the right of his wife, but as she was already dead and the Barony was already vested in her son by Nevill, by modern doctrine this served to create a new Barony by writ. This second creation merged with the first creation in 1476, when the 1st Baron (of the second creation) died and his son, the aforementioned 4th Baron of the first creation, also became 2nd Baron of the second creation. In 1587, on the death of the 6th Baron (of the first creation) and 4th Baron (of the second creation), by modern doctrine both Baronies descended to his daughter, Mary, Lady Fane, wife of Sir Thomas Fane, who thus became de jure 7th and 5th Baroness. The title (for it was believed at the time only to be one Barony) was claimed by Edward Nevill, the heir male of the 4th and 2nd Baron, and in 1604 he was summoned to Parliament as Lord Bergavenny. As he was not entitled to either of the existing Baronies, this served to create a further Barony by Writ. By modern doctrine, the first and second creations descended to the Earls of Westmorland, heirs of the 7th and 5th Baroness, until both became abeyant on the death of the 7th Earl (and 14th and 12th Baron) in 1762. The wrongful assumption that the Barony descended to heirs male continued, and this pattern (heirs general being deprived of their rightful title and heirs male being summoned to Parliament, with a new title being created in the process) was repeated several times, resulting in the fourth to seventh creations. The fourth and fifth creations became extinct on the death of the first holder of each, who both died without heirs, and the sixth became abeyant in 1811. The provenance of the third creation is unclear. None of these new creations were recognised as such at the time. The last creation, and the only one in the Peerage of Great Britain, came in 1724, in favour of William Nevill. His son, who succeeded as 2nd Baron, was created Earl of Abergavenny in 1784, and the 5th Earl was created Marquess of Abergavenny in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1876. The Barony descended with the Earldom and then also the Marquessate (both of which were limited to heirs male) until 1938 when the 3rd Marquess died leaving no surviving sons but two surviving daughters, whereupon the Barony fell into abeyance between them. The heirs of those daughters, the 6th Marquess Camden and the 23rd Baron Hastings by the principle of moiety title are the co-heirs to one half of the Barony each and neither has petitioned for the title to be settled upon one or the other (c.f. Baron Arlington). ==Feudal Barons of Abergavenny== Dates below are the dates when they possessed Abergavenny. *Hamelin de Balun (tempore William I)Sanders, p.66, Barony of Much Marcle, note 2: \\"Hamelin was at one time lord of Abergavenny but he lost control of this estate\\" *Brientius de Insula (d. c. 1147)Sanders, p.7, Barony of Miles of Gloucester: \\"In (1140/2) Brian FitzCount was allowed to enfeoff Miles (of Gloucester) with the castle and honour of Abergavenny for the service of 3 knights' fees.

bullying and harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students. In the United States, students take a day-long vow of silence to symbolically represent the silencing of LGBTQ students. The Day of Silence has been held each year in April since 1996. Since 2011, the event was held on the second Friday in April, except in 2018, when it was observed on Friday, April 27, and 2020, when it was observed on Friday, April 24. ==Organization== The Day of Silence is organized by the GLSEN. Students are encouraged to obtain permission from their school before organizing the event. GLSEN states that hundreds of thousands of students at more than 8,000 schools participated in the 2008 Day of Silence. ==History== Created by then-student Maria Pulzetti, the first event was organized by students at University of Virginia in 1996. Pulzetti explained: \\"I wanted to do something for BGLAD week that would impact many people at the school and that would be very visible...I knew that if we held panel discussions and events like that, the only people who would come would be the people who already were fairly aware.\\" In 1997, Day of Silence went national, with almost 100 colleges and universities participating. In 2000, Pulzetti's classmates Jessie Gilliam and Chloe Palenchar, and GLSEN National Student Organizer Chris Tuttle, developed the proposal for the day to become an official project of GLSEN. GLSEN developed its first-ever \\"student leadership team\\" as part of the Day of Silence. In 2008, the Day of Silence was held in memory of Lawrence \\"Larry\\" King, an eighth grader from E.O. Green Middle School who was shot by classmate Brandon McInerney. In the last several years, over 10,000 participants have registered their participation with GLSEN each year. These participants attend middle schools, high schools, colleges, and universities. They include students from all 50 states in the U.S.A. as well as students from around the world, including New Zealand, Singapore, and Russia. ==Opposition== In 2005, the Alliance Defense Fund, which has been labelled as an anti-LGBT hate group, began sponsoring a yearly counter-protest called the Day of Truth. \\"Events like these actually end up promoting homosexuality in public schools, and that actually creates a hostile climate for students of faith,\\" said Candi Cushman, an education analyst for Focus on the Family. A card carried by participants in the Day of Truth reads: \\"true tolerance means that people with differing--even opposing--viewpoints can freely exchange ideas and respectfully listen to each other. It's time for an honest conversation about homosexuality. There's freedom to change if you want to. Let's talk.\\" Other socially conservative organizations, including the American Family Association, Concerned Women for America, Mission America, Traditional Values Coalition, Americans for Truth, and Liberty Counsel, opposed the Day of Silence in 2008 by forming a coalition urging parents to keep their kids home on the DOS if students at their school were observing it. The Rev. Ken Hutcherson, the principal supporter of those who skipped school, said, \\"We want education, not indoctrination.\\" In April 2010, in opposition to the Day of Silence, several students in Laingsburg High School in Laingsburg, Michigan wore T-shirts stating \\"Straight Pride\\" on the front side and bore a reference to on the back. That Bible verse refers to homosexual behaviour as an abomination and prescribes death as the penalty for it. The same protest, which was organized on a Facebook group, also took place in the St. Johns and Bath school districts. On October 6, 2010, CNN reported that Exodus International, which promotes \\"freedom from homosexuality through Jesus Christ\\", would not support the 2011 annual Day of Truth as the organization had done in 2010. President Alan Chambers stated, \\"All the recent attention to bullying helped us realize that we need to equip kids to live out biblical tolerance and grace while treating their neighbors as they'd like to be treated, whether they agree with them or not.\\" In 2011, Focus on the Family acquired the ‚ÄúDay of Truth‚Äù event and renamed it into the ‚ÄúDay of Dialogue‚Äù. As of 2012, the Day of Dialogue website stated: \\"Now it boasts a new name, while maintaining the same goal it‚Äôs always had since its founding ‚Äî encouraging honest and respectful conversation among students about God‚Äôs design for sexuality.\\"Focus on the Family, \\"Day of Dialogue History,\\" (accessed April 2, 2012) ==See also== *Ally Week *Athlete Ally *National Coming Out Day *Student voice *Transgender Day of Remembrance *List of LGBT awareness days ==References== ==External links== * *Facebook page Category:Anti-homophobia Category:April observances Category:Civil awareness days Category:Education in the United States Category:LGBT and education Category:LGBT events in the United States Category:LGBT youth Category:Silence Category:Unofficial observances ","title":"Day of Silence"},{"id":"1443773","text":"Santa Marta de Penagui√£o ( or ) is a Portuguese municipality in the district of Vila Real, in the northern region of Douro.

The forals provided detailed explanations of the rights, privileges and responsibilities of the local landowners, covered within the limits of the municipality. During the 17th-18th century there was a marked increase in the homes, estates, churches and patrimony constructed in the municipality, while documents refer to expensive land rents obtained by seigneurial landowners. This was primarily due to export of wine and the cultivation of vineyards, which occupied a great part of the terraced landholdings of the local gentlemen. This success also brought a lot of opportunism, the mixing of castes, and later, the collapse of wine sales, as the quality deteriorated. In order to overcome these problems, and in order to rejuvenate exports, (through the influence of the friar Jo√£o de Mansilha and the Marquess of Pombal), King Joseph signed into existence (10 September 1756) the Companhia Geral de Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro. This company improved the production of wine sales in the Douro valley, establishing a Demarcated Export product with specific quality expectations: wines that could not meet these levels of quality could not be sold as \\"Douro Wines\\". The Companhia Geral was also responsible for affixing similar demarcation to the Porto Wine, before any non-Douro brands began appearing in Europe. In the 19th century, through the administrative reforms, and owing to the regions importance to the Demarcated Region of the Douro, Santa Marta retained its municipal status. ==Geography== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } Administratively, the municipality is divided into 7 civil parishes (freguesias): * Alva√ß√µes do Corgo * Cumieira * Fontes * Louredo e Fornelos * Medr√µes * Lobrigos (S√£o Miguel e S√£o Jo√£o Baptista) e Sanhoane * Sever ==References== Category:Municipalities of Vila Real District Category:Towns in Portugal ","title":"Santa Marta de Penagui√£o"},{"id":"1443775","text":"KCDX (103.1 FM) is a radio station broadcasting from Globe, Arizona to the east of Phoenix since March 2002 with a commercial-free rock music format.

He used the signal as a 2.7-kW personal MP3 player, broadcasting to central and eastern Arizona. The station now has a website with a live Internet feed and a rolling playlist. The station's website has advertising. On 08/10/2000, Tucker filed a Minor Change to a Licensed Facility Application with the FCC to move the main transmitter to a mountain NW of Oracle, AZ. while increasing power to 95 kW. Three engineering amendments were filed in 2003 and 2004. If approved, the signal upgrade would include new areas of Mesa, Apache Junction and N Tucson in the coverage area.

The band consisted of three brothers Charlie, Ronnie, and Robert Wilson; and it was named after streets (Greenwood, Archer, and Pine) in the historic Greenwood neighborhood in the brothers' hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma. After 43 years together, they retired in 2010. ==History== ===Early years=== The band received its first big break by being the back up band for fellow Oklahoman Leon Russell's Stop All That Jazz album released in 1974. Early on, the group took on a funk sound reminiscent of the early 1970s.The Gap Band (1977) at [ allmusic] This style failed to catch on, and their first two LP's, 1974's Magicians Holiday which was recorded at Leon Russell's historic The Church Studio and 1977's The Gap Band (not to be confused with their 1979 album), failed to chart or produce any charting singles. Afterwards, they were introduced to LA producer Lonnie Simmons, who signed them to his production company Total Experience Productions (named after his successful Crenshaw Boulevard nightclub), and managed to secure a record deal with Mercury Records. ===Success=== On their first album with Simmons, The Gap Band, they found chart success with songs such as \\"I'm in Love\\" and \\"Shake\\"; the latter became a Top 10 R&B; hit in 1979. Later that year, the group released \\"I Don't Believe You Want to Get Up and Dance (Oops!)\\" on their album The Gap Band II. Although it did not hit the Hot 100, it soared to #4 R&B;, and the album went gold. The song, and the band's musical output as a whole, became more P-Funk-esque,The Gap Band II on [ allmusic] with expanded use of the synthesizers and spoken monologues within songs (see audio sample). The song \\"Steppin' (Out)\\" also reached the top 10 R&B.;RIAA Certifications at RIAA.com Charlie Wilson provided background vocals on Stevie Wonder's 1980 hit \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" from Wonder's album Hotter Than July (1980). The band reached a whole new level of fame in 1980 with the release of the #1 R&B; and #16 Billboard 200 hit, The Gap Band III. That album had soul ballads such as the #5 R&B; song \\"Yearning for Your Love\\", and funk songs such as the R&B; chart-topper \\"Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)\\" and \\"Humpin'\\". They repeated this formula on the #1 R&B; album Gap Band IV in 1982 (the first album released on Simmons' newly launched Total Experience Records), which resulted in three hit singles: \\"Early in the Morning\\" (#1 R&B;, #13 Dance, #24 Hot 100), \\"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\\" (#2 R&B;, #31 Hot 100, #39 Dance), and \\"Outstanding\\" (#1 R&B;, #24 Dance). It was during this time that former Brides of Funkenstein singer Dawn Silva joined them on tour.Dawn Silva Biography Their 1983 album, Gap Band V: Jammin', went gold, but was not quite as successful as the previous works, peaking at #2 R&B; and #28 on the Billboard 200. The single \\"Party Train\\" peaked at #3 R&B;, and the song \\"Jam the Motha'\\" peaked at #16 R&B;, but neither made it onto the Hot 100.

That year, lead singer Charlie Wilson and singer Shirley Murdock provided backing vocals on Zapp & Roger's #8 R&B; \\"Computer Love\\". ===Later years=== While their 1986 cover of \\"Going in Circles\\" went to #2 on the R&B; charts, and the album it was released on, Gap Band VII, hit #6 R&B;, the album almost became their first in years to miss the Billboard 200, peaking at a mere #159. While they were beginning to struggle stateside, the group found their greatest success in the UK when their 1986 single \\"Big Fun\\" from Gap Band 8 reached #4 in the UK Singles Chart. 1988's Straight from the Heart was their last studio album with Total Experience. The Gap Band caught a small break in 1988 with the Keenen Ivory Wayans film I'm Gonna Git You Sucka. They contributed the non-charting \\"You're So Cute\\" and the #14 R&B; title track to the film (The first was not on the soundtrack, but was used in the film).Soundtrack Listing at IMDB Their first song on their new label, Capitol Records, 1989's \\"All of My Love\\" (from their album Round Trip), is, to date, their last #1 R&B; hit. The album also produced the #8 R&B; \\"Addicted to Your Love\\" and the #18 R&B; \\"\\"We Can Make it Alright.\\" They left Capitol Records the next year and went on a five-year hiatus from producing new material. During the 1990s, the band released three non-charting studio albums and two live albums. ==Legacy== In 1992, Charlie ventured into a solo career and has had several moderate R&B; hits on his own. Wilson's vocals were credited in part for inspiring the vocal style of new jack swing artists Guy, Aaron Hall, Keith Sweat, and R. Kelly. The band reunited in 1996, and issued The Gap Band: Live and Well, a live greatest hits album. On August 26, 2005, The Gap Band was honored as a BMI Icon at the 57th annual BMI Urban Awards. The honor is given to a creator who has been \\"a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers\\". \\"Outstanding\\" alone remains one of the most sampled songs in history and has, astonishingly, been used by over 150 artists.

In 2005, he was executed by the state of Connecticut, making his execution the first in Connecticut (and all of New England) since 1960, and the last execution in Connecticut before the state repealed capital punishment in 2012. == Early life == Ross was born in Putnam, Connecticut on July 26, 1959 to Patricia Hilda Laine and Dan Graeme Ross. The oldest of four children, having two younger sisters and a younger brother, he grew up on a chicken farm in Brooklyn, Connecticut. Ross's home life was extremely dysfunctional; his mother, who had abandoned the family at least once and had been institutionalized, beat all four of her children, saving the worst for him. Some family and friends have suggested that he was also molested by his teenaged uncle, who committed suicide when Ross was six. He was a bright boy who performed well in school. He graduated from Killingly High School in Killingly, Connecticut in 1977, and graduated from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he studied agriculture, in May 1981. He became an insurance salesman. He exhibited antisocial behavior from a young age. Ross began stalking women in his sophomore year of college and, in his senior year, he committed his first rape. His first murder followed soon after. == Crime spree == Between 1981 and 1984, Ross murdered eight girls and women aged between 14 and 25 in Connecticut and New York. He raped seven out of his eight murder victims. He also was alleged to have raped, but not killed a 21-year- old woman named Vivian Dobson in 1983. Plainfield police rejected the possibility that Ross had been Vivian Dobson's rapist. They did not press charges and Ross made no confession. Ross confessed to each of the eight murders and was convicted for the last four of them. He was sentenced to death on July 6, 1987 in Connecticut by judge G. Sarsfield Ford and spent almost 18 years on death row before his execution in May 2005. ==Victims== # Dzung Ngoc Tu (25) May 12, 1981.

Powers broke up with Ross in 2003 but still visited him until his death. He became a devout Catholic after his arrest in 1984, meeting regularly with two priests through the years and praying the rosary each morning. During his time in prison Ross translated documents into Braille, acted as a mentor to other inmates, and financially sponsored a child from the Dominican Republic.Haigh, Susan (January 29, 2005). \\"Pastoral adviser: Ross 'upset, frustrated, angry' with delay\\". Journal Inquirer. Retrieved on January 1, 2009. == Execution == Though he opposed the death penalty, Ross strongly supported his own death sentence in the last year of his life, saying that he wanted to spare his victims' families any more pain. According to Kathry Yeager, a Cornell graduate, Ross believed that he had been \\"forgiven by God\\" and that he would be going to \\"a better place\\" once he was executed. She said, \\"He's not being punished. He's moving on to life eternal. That's what is ironic about the death penalty. He's looking forward to the peace.\\" Yeager also said that Ross had come to believe there was no way his death sentences would be commuted without forcing the victims' families to suffer through more legal hearings; and that he knew his life would be meaningful, even behind bars: \\"He's had a horrible life, and he's wanted to do good.\\" In spite of this, an hour before the execution was to take place in the early hours of January 26, 2005, Ross's lawyer, acting on behalf of Ross's father, obtained a two-day stay of execution. Ross was then scheduled to die by lethal injection on January 29, 2005, at 2:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. However, earlier in the day, the execution was again postponed because of doubts that Ross was mentally competent; having fought against his death sentence for 17 years, he suddenly waived his right to appeal. His attorney claimed that Ross was incompetent to waive appeals, as he was suffering from death row syndrome. In his final days, Ross became an oblate, or associate, of the Benedictine Grange, a Roman Catholic monastic community in West Redding, Connecticut. Ross was executed by lethal injection on May 13, 2005, at Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers, Connecticut. He was 45 years old. Ross did not request a special last meal before facing his execution, thereby dining on the regular prison meal of the day: turkey √† la king with rice, mixed vegetables, white bread, fruit, and a beverage. When asked if he would like to make a last statement, he said, without opening his eyes, \\"No, thank you.\\" Ross was pronounced dead at 2:25 a.m. His remains were buried at the Benedictine Grange Cemetery in Redding, Connecticut. ==After execution== After the execution, Dr. Stuart Grassian, a psychiatrist who had argued that Ross was not competent to waive appeal, received a letter from Ross dated May 10, 2005, which read \\"Check, and mate. You never had a chance!\\" Ross's execution was the first in Connecticut (and in all of New England) since 1960. It was also the first and only execution in Connecticut administered by lethal injection. As of June, 2020, Ross is the most recent inmate executed in Connecticut since the abolition of the death penalty in Connecticut on April 25, 2012. Vivian Dobson, whom Ross was alleged to have raped, became a vocal opponent of the death penalty in an effort to save Ross's life. The execution of Michael Bruce Ross was the first in Connecticut in 2005, the first execution in Connecticut since 1960, the 22nd execution in the United States in 2005, and the 966th execution in the United States since 1976. Ross was also a suspect in other rapes and murders in the state of Indiana. ==Popular culture== Michael Ross appeared in a British television series about serial killers in 1995. The filmmakers who produced the segment gave him the nickname \\"The Roadside Strangler\\" because the other killers in the series had nicknames. One of the producers of the series said the name may have been the result of a brainstorming session at a motel bar. Ross was not called \\"The Roadside Strangler\\" by the Connecticut media or by local law enforcement while he was alive. In 2015, The Man in the Monster: An Intimate Portrait of a Serial Killer, a detailed account of Ross' killing spree, capture, trial, time in prison and execution, was published by Penguin Press. Written by former Columbia School of Journalism professor Martha Elliott, the book documents the ten-year telephone and prison visit relationship that developed between the author and her subject. Generally well received, the book garnered positive reviews by Library Journal, Kirkus, the Boston Globe, Booklist and The National Book Review. Elliott's experience with Ross was featured on Criminal, a Radiotopia podcast on crime, in Episode 34: The Stay. == See also == * List of serial killers in the United States == References == == External links == * (dead link) 8-2-Lethal-injection-table.jpg Photograph of Connecticut Lethal Injection Table * * It's Time for Me to Die By Michael B.

The first flight was in January 1958. A total of 66 T-1 planes were built.Simpson 2001, p.246 It was retired in March 2006. ==Design and development== After World War II, Japanese aircraft industry was banned from research as well as the destruction of materials and equipment related to aircraft. In 1952, a partial ban on aircraft research was lifted, making it possible to develop Japan's own domestic jet aircraft. In the spring of 1954, the Defense Agency's plan to develop and domesticate a training jet aircraft emerged, which later lead to the development of the T-1 training plane. The T-1 was the first indigenously designed Japanese jet aircraft to be developed since World War II. It was Japan's first mass-produced jet and the first aircraft to apply a swept wing. The development of a domestic jet engine was not completed in time, so the T-1A was powered by the British-designed Bristol Siddeley Orpheus turbojetFUJI T-1 at faqs.org and made its first flight on May 17, 1960. The T1-B was powered by the Ishikawajima-Harima J3 turbojet and 20 were produced between June 1962 and June 1963. Fuji was the successor to the Nakajima Aircraft Company (famous for building several aircraft such as Nakajima Ki-43 and Nakajima Ki-84 during WW2). The first aircraft of Fuji's own design was the T-1 jet trainer.Archives at Flightglobal.com More than 200 T-1s were to be produced, but with the introduction of the Lockheed F-104J/DJ fighters, the education system changed and the Lockheed T-33A, which was in large numbers, took on the same role, and only 66 T-1s were introduced.

It is a day to draw attention to the continued violence endured by transgender people. Transgender Day of Remembrance was founded in 1999 by Gwendolyn Ann Smith, a transgender woman, to memorialize the murder of transgender woman Rita Hester in Allston, Massachusetts. It has slowly evolved from the web-based project started by Smith into an international day of action. In 2010, TDoR was observed in over 185 cities throughout more than 20 countries.St. Pierre, E. (2010). TDoR Events and Locations 2010. Transgenderdor.org. Typically, a TDoR memorial includes a reading of the names of those who lost their lives from November 20 of the former year to November 20 of the current year,* * and may include other actions, such as candlelight vigils, dedicated church services, marches, art shows, food drives and film screenings. GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) has extensively covered TDoR. GLAAD has interviewed numerous transgender advocates (including actress Candis Cayne), profiled an event at the New York City LGBT Community Center, and discussed media coverage of TDoR. ==History== Rita Hester (November 30, 1963 ‚Äì November 28, 1998) was a transgender African American woman who was murdered in Allston, Massachusetts on November 28, 1998.'Remembering Rita Hester' November 15, 2008, Edge Boston In response to her murder, an outpouring of grief and anger led to a candlelight vigil held the following Friday (December 4) in which about 250 people participated. The community struggle to see Rita's life and identity covered respectfully by local papers, including the Boston Herald and Bay Windows, was chronicled by Nancy Nangeroni. Her death inspired the \\"Remembering Our Dead\\" web project and the Transgender Day of Remembrance. == Race, TDoR, and Transgender Women of Color == CeCe McDonald speaks at the 2015 Transgender Day of Remembrance in San Francisco. While TDoR is a critical event, scholars and activists committed to advancing intersectional approaches to trans politics continue to highlight the importance of seeing transphobic violence as inherently connected to race, gender, and class. This is reflected in the disproportionate instances of violence against trans women of color in general, black and Latina transgender women in particular. The transgender pride flag being raised above the California State Capitol on the Transgender Day of Remembrance in 2019. Theorists C. Riley Snorton and Jin Haritaworn critique how images and narratives centering on the deaths of trans people of color‚Äîmost often transfeminine bodies of color‚Äîare circulated within social movements and spaces headed by white gay and trans activists, such as TDoR. Reflecting on the case of African American trans woman Tyra Hunter, Snorton and Haritaworn observe the dangers of positioning trans women and transfeminine bodies of color as legible only in the aftermath of their deaths, and failing to see such violence as effects of both systematic transphobia and racism. Resonating alongside (but not limited to) trans activists CeCe McDonald, Reina Gossett, Sylvia Rivera, and Dean Spade, Snorton and Haritaworn's work advocates for the importance of an intersectional approach to events such as TDoR and transgender activism in general. Scholar Sarah Lamble (2008) argues that TDoR's focus on a collective mourning risks producing the white spectator as innocent of, rather than complicit in, the violence that produces the deaths of trans women of color they are mourning. Lamble states that: \\"Our task then is to push these further‚Äînot only with respect to TDOR but also in the many ways we recount and confront violence. None of us are innocent. We must envision practices of remembrance that situate our own positions within structures of power that authorize violence in the first place. Our task is to move from sympathy to responsibility, from complicity to reflexivity, from witnessing to action. It is not enough to simply honor the memory of the dead‚Äîwe must transform the practices of the living\\". Transgender activist Mirha-Soleil Ross criticizes TDoR for conflating the motivation behind the murders of transgender women sex workers. In an interview with scholar Viviane Namaste, she presents examples of transgender sex workers who were murdered in Toronto for being sex workers and accuses the organizers of TDoR of using these women who died for being sex workers as martyrs of the transgender community. ==Recognition by governments== The Canadian province of Ontario unanimously passed the Trans Day of Remembrance Act, 2017 on December 12, 2017, officially recognizing TDoR and requiring the Legislative Assembly of Ontario to hold a moment of silence every year on November 20. ==See also== * Hate crime * History of transgender people in the United States * International Transgender Day of Visibility * List of transgender-rights organizations * List of people killed for being transgender * Trans bashing * Trans Day of Action * Transgender rights movement ==References== ==External links== * Smith, Gwendolyn Ann. \\"Transgender Day of Remembrance: Rita Hester and Beyond\\", Huffington Post, 2013-11-20. * International Transgender Day of Remembrance * Transgender Day Of Remembrance ‚Äì Manchester, UK * Trans Day of Remembrance UK Category:Transphobia Category:Discrimination against transgender people Category:Violence against LGBT people Category:Civil awareness days Category:Transgender events Category:November observances Category:Recurring events established in 1999 Category:International observances ","title":"Transgender Day of Remembrance"},{"id":"1443814","text":"Stronger Than Death is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Black Label Society (BLS).

They refer to one-loop processes in which a quark temporarily changes flavor (via a W or Z loop), and the flavor-changed quark engages in some tree interaction, typically a strong one. For the interactions where some quark flavors (e.g. very heavy ones) have much higher interaction amplitudes than others, such as CP-violating or Higgs interactions, these penguin processes may have amplitudes comparable to or even greater than those of the direct tree processes. A similar diagram can be drawn for leptonic decays. They were first isolated and studied by Mikhail Shifman, Arkady Vainshtein, and Valentin Zakharov.

Francis (born April 1, 1973) is an American entrepreneur, film producer and was the founder and creator of the Girls Gone Wild entertainment brand. Francis worked as a production assistant on the syndicated program Real TV before releasing the direct-to-video film Banned from Television in 1998. Francis has, at various times, been convicted of tax evasion, bribery, false imprisonment, assault causing great bodily injury, dissuading a witness, and record-keeping violations; and has pleaded no contest to child abuse and prostitution. ==Biography== Joe Francis was born on April 1, 1973 in Atlanta, Georgia to Raymond and Maria Francis, the latter of whom was from Austria. According to Francis, when he was seven years old, the family moved to Newport Beach, California, where he attended Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Elementary School, and then a series of boarding schools. He then lived in Laguna Beach and attended Laguna Beach High School. His first job was at a computer and video store. Francis attended the University of Southern California's Business Administration program, concentrating his education at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. He also took several courses in film and television, graduating in 1995 with a Bachelor's Degree from the USC Entrepreneurial Program. ==Business ventures== ===Banned from Television=== Francis's first business venture began when he was working as a production assistant for Real TV, a syndicated reality television program that aired footage of extraordinary events that were not usually covered in mainstream news. It was there that Francis came up with the idea for Banned from Television. During his time at Real TV, people who worked in the studio would often view footage involving car accidents, violent attacks and other graphic events. Francis licensed the footage, which he then sold through the Banned from Television videos which he marketed via infomercials. The first Banned from Television video was released in 1998, followed by two sequels that were also released the same year. Some of the more famous footage included in the series was: footage of Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination; the rampage of circus elephant Tyke; the executions of Roberto Gir√≥n and Pedro Castillo; footage of the Royal Jomtien Resort Hotel fire; and the death of Mary T. Wojtyla, a woman hit by a speeding train in Downers Grove, Illinois. Other footage included: the murder of Pete Shrum, the murder of Lea Mek, the attempted suicide of Terry Rossland, the extrajudicial execution by burning of Rodolfo Hernandez, footage of the 1998 C√∫a hostage crisis, footage of a 1990 Lucas Oil 200 (ARCA) race in which Slick Johnson was killed and paramedic Mike Staley was injured, and the deaths of motorcycle stunt riders Corey Scott and Butch Laswell. Due to the films' graphic content, Francis stopped the series after three films, because he found it too disturbing to watch them back-to- back. While viewing footage for inclusion on Banned from Television, Francis came across footage of female college students flashing their breasts during Mardi Gras and spring break. It was this footage that sparked Francis's next business venture with Girls Gone Wild. ===Girls Gone Wild=== Francis created the Girls Gone Wild franchise in 1997 when he began using direct-response marketing, such as infomercials, to sell videos that he had produced. The videos were of college-aged women who willingly exposed their bodies or acted wildly on camera. In its first two years, Girls Gone Wild made more than $20 million. By 2002, Francis had produced 83 different Girls Gone Wild titles and was airing 30-minute infomercials on all major U.S. networks. In 2005, the company planned to donate 100% of their gross sales of their Mardi Gras-themed DVDs to the Red Cross to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. Abbey Wilson, who won Girls Gone Wild's \\"Search for the Hottest Girl in America\\" contest in 2012, became Francis's long-term girlfriend. In 2013, Wilson's iPad, containing private sexual videos of Francis and Wilson, was stolen. In retaliation, and to prevent distribution of the video before it was sold to any media outlets, Francis's lawyer David Houston threatened, \\"When we catch you, we will see that you are prosecuted to the fullest extent of both the criminal and civil laws.\\" In 2014, Wilson became pregnant with twins via in vitro fertilization. On October 7, 2014, she gave birth to two girls. ==Legal issues== ===Civil=== In June 2007, Ashley Alexandra Dupr√© alleged that Francis and his company filmed her without permission, but she dropped her lawsuit after Francis released footage showing her consent. The following year, four women sued Girls Gone Wild for allegedly filming them as minors. Francis represented himself for part of the trial, until the judge cited him for contempt of court and fined him $2,500 for asking a plaintiff during cross- examination if she was a prostitute. Francis hired two lawyers the same day to represent him for the duration of his trial. Francis ultimately pleaded no contest to child abuse and prostitution charges. In February 2012, Clark County, Nevada judge Mark Denton awarded $7.5 million to businessman Steve Wynn for defamatory statements made by Francis. In September 2012, a jury awarded $20 million to Wynn in a slander case against Francis for claiming that Wynn had threatened to kill him over a gambling debt. Francis's witnesses all denied hearing Wynn make such threats. The jury added an additional $20 million in punitive damages. In November 2012, Judge Joanne O'Donnell reduced Wynn's award to $19 million, reasoning that the jury's award was \\"speculative\\" and based on their dislike of Francis. ===Criminal=== State In 2003, officials in Panama City Beach, Florida attempted to halt Girls Gone Wild from filming, prompting Francis to sue them for violating his First Amendment rights. The same officials arrested Francis for racketeering; he was released on bond. At a July 2006 hearing, the judge disallowed most of the evidence and in January 2007 dismissed most of the charges. Francis pleaded guilty to record-keeping violations, was fined $1.6 million and sentenced to community service. Francis later pleaded guilty for having contraband in his cell. He served 339 days and paid over $60,000 in fines. In January 2011, Francis brought a group of three women to his home, leading to five charges: three misdemeanor counts of false imprisonment, one of assault causing great bodily injury, and one of dissuading a witness. On May 6, 2013, Francis was convicted on all five charges. He faced a maximum of five years in prison and/or $13,000 in fines. On May 22, Francis did an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, calling the jurors \\"mentally ... retarded\\" and suggesting they \\"should be euthanized.\\" He later apologized for his remarks, but stated that he had been manipulated by the media. On August 27, 2013, Francis was sentenced to serve at least 270 days in county jail, 36 months' probation, and was ordered to complete a Level 3 Anger Management course and a year of psychological counseling. Francis's attorneys immediately filed a new trial petition. Federal In April 2007, in Reno, Nevada, Francis was indicted by a grand jury for two counts of tax evasion. The Department of Justice alleged that Francis claimed over $20 million in false deductions on his corporate returns in 2002 and 2003. In April 2008, the venue for the trial was changed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. At a hearing in July 2008, Francis pleaded not guilty to tax evasion. His attorney, Robert Bernhoft, said that tax returns for the businesses were prepared and filed by a former accountant and not shown to Francis. Bernhoft said that when the accountant left the company, he reported the returns to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect a bonus from the Tax Whistleblower Program. In September 2009, Francis pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of filing a false return and bribery. He received credit for time served. In November 2009, U.S. District Judge S. James Otero accepted Francis's plea including $250,000 in restitution to the IRS. ===Blackmailed=== In 2004, by orders of the mob, Riley Perez broke into Francis' home where he filmed a humiliating blackmail video and arranged for payment so that the video didn‚Äôt go viral. Held at gunpoint, Francis was forced to disrobe on camera.Page SixLA Times ===Bankruptcy=== Francis's corporation GGW Brands, the parent company for the Girls Gone Wild entertainment brand, filed for bankruptcy in February 2013. The bankruptcy was meant to block Wynn Resorts from seizing the assets of the company for repayment of Francis's gambling debts. In May 2015, a U.S. District Court judge issued an arrest warrant for Francis after he failed to comply with terms of his bankruptcy agreement. As of 2015, he was reportedly living in Mexico with his girlfriend and their twin daughters.

The station provides access to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) via the AirTrain monorail which connects the station to the airport's terminals and parking areas. It is served by New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Line and North Jersey Coast Line and Amtrak's Northeast Regional and Keystone Service trains. The station, located in the Dayton neighborhood of the city, has no pedestrian access, bus service, parking facility, or drop-off area. ==History== An Amtrak Northeast Regional train at the station in 2007 The station opened on October 21, 2001. It is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), the airport's operator, and therefore has a different design than NJT and Amtrak stations, especially the signage, which is the same as used throughout the airport. The Port Authority originally intended to name the station \\"Newark Airport\\" but changed it to \\"Newark Liberty International Airport\\" after the airport's renaming, which honors the victims of the September 11 attacks and the proximity of the airport to the Statue of Liberty. ==Station layout and service== ===Northeast Corridor=== On the NEC, it is a 6-minute trip to Newark's Penn Station, where connections are available to the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) system to Jersey City, Hoboken and Lower Manhattan as well as the Newark Light Rail and regional bus services. New York City's Penn Station, where connections are available to Long Island Rail Road and the New York City Subway, is a 22-to-25-minute trip. Trenton is a 31-to-50-minute trip and Philadelphia is a 59-to-67-minute trip. NJT local trains stop at Secaucus Junction, where connections are available to other New Jersey Transit Rail Operations commuter lines in northern New Jersey and Metro-North Railroad's West of Hudson services. ===AirTrain Newark=== Passengers connecting between the Northeast Corridor and AirTrain Newark must pass through faregates and pay a fee. This fee is usually included in the ticket price and encoded on magnetic stripes of NJT tickets with the station as the origin or destination (denoted with **EWR**). Monthly pass holders who do not have Newark Airport as the origin or destination for their pass need to pay the fee, which is waived for children 11 and under. There is a staffed Amtrak ticket counter between AirTrain and the NEC platforms. Although there are NJ Transit staff on site, passengers are required to use the ticket vending machines (TVMs) on either side of the faregates for NJT service. ===Platform layout=== NJ Transit trains typically stop on the outer platform tracks, while Amtrak trains typically stop on the inner platform tracks. The two center tracks, which do not serve the station, are often used by express NJ Transit trains, as well as Amtrak service that does not stop here (the Acela Express, some Northeast Regional, most Keystone trains, and all long- distance services). {cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=75M style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Mezzanine style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=550Connection between Northeast Corridor and AirTrain - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=8P NEC platforms style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Track 5 style=\\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê toward Rahway, Jersey Avenue or Trenton (North Elizabeth or ) ‚Üê toward South Amboy, Long Branch or Bay Head (North Elizabeth or ) - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Track 4 style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê toward Northern Virginia (Metropark) ‚Üê limited service toward Harrisburg (Metropark) - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Track 3 style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê PM express service does not stop here ‚Üê PM express service does not stop here ‚Üê services do not stop here - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Track 2 style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" services do not stop here ‚Üí AM express service does not stop here ‚Üí AM express service does not stop here ‚Üí - Track 1  limited service toward New York (Newark Penn Station) ‚Üí toward Boston (Newark Penn Station) ‚Üí - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Track A style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" toward New York (Newark Penn Station) ‚Üí toward Hoboken or New York (Newark Penn Station) ‚Üí - style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=2 style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"No service style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê No passenger service ‚Üí - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"No service style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê No passenger service ‚Üí - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=3P AirTrain platforms Track 2 ‚Üê toward Terminals (Parking Lot 4) - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Track 1 style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê toward Terminals (Parking Lot 4) } ==PATH extension proposal== In September 2012, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced that work would commence on a study to explore extending the PATH system to the station. The new station would be located at ground level to the west of the existing NJ Transit station. A storage yard for PATH trains would also be built. There would be a park and ride facility at the stop, with a new entrance to the surrounding Dayton neighborhood, and an overpass to the existing NJ Transit and AirTrain platforms. In 2014, the PANYNJ proposed a 10-year capital plan that included the PATH extension, which was approved by the Board of Commissioners on February 19 of that year. However, in late 2014, there were calls for reconsideration of Port Authority funding priorities. The PATH extension followed the route of existing Manhattan-to-Newark Airport train service , while there was no funding for either the Gateway Tunnel under the Hudson River, or the replacement of the aging and overcrowded Port Authority Bus Terminal. On January 11, 2017, the PANYNJ released its 10-year capital plan that included $1.7 billion for the extension. Under the plan, construction is projected to start in 2020, with service in 2026. Two public meetings on the project were scheduled for early December 2017. ==References== ==External links== *Newark Airport Amtrak & New Jersey Transit Station (USA RailGuide -- TrainWeb) *Newark-Airport, NJ (EWR) (Amtrak's Great American Stations) Category:NJ Transit Rail Operations stations Category:Amtrak stations in New Jersey Category:PATH stations in New Jersey Category:Stations on the Northeast Corridor Category:Port Authority of New York and New Jersey AirTrain Category:Newark Liberty International Airport Category:Transportation in Newark, New Jersey Category:Airport railway stations in the United States Category:Railway stations in Essex County, New Jersey Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2001 ","title":"Newark Liberty International Airport Station"},{"id":"1443839","text":"Binary Finary are a British trance act, originally comprising Matt Laws, Ricky Grant and Stuart Matheson, who were later joined by Sasha Vatoff who acts as DJ and live performer.

She was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1993 to 1996, representing the electorate of Capricornia. Henzell graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts and Diploma of Social Studies before becoming a social worker.Biography at Australian Parliamentary Handbook At the time of her election to parliament, she managed a counselling service supporting the employees of two coal mines at Middlemount and Tieri outside Rockhampton, along with their associated communities. She was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1993 federal election, defeating disgraced ex-Labor MP Keith Wright, who was recontesting as an independent despite facing criminal child sex charges. Henzell became the first woman MP to hold the seat in its history. She later described her ability to be elected as a woman in Capricornia at that time as a \\"quirk of history\\" and that she was \\"only here\\" because of Wright's conduct. Henzell was aligned with the party's Labor Left faction. She was appointed deputy chairman of the Labor caucus in 1993. As a new MP, Henzell described Question Time as \\"a bit of a boys' locker room\\" and described her own approach to parliament as a woman as \\"I won't sit around being patted on the head. We didn't get here to be sweet and malleable, but we can play hard ball without personal abuse.\\" She publicly criticised senior colleague John Dawkins for referring to opposition MP Kathy Sullivan as \\"sweetheart\\" in parliament in 1993. In 1994, she questioned her own party's Prime Minister, Paul Keating, about his decision to personally take over the women's affairs portfolio following the resignation of Ros Kelly, asking him if he did not believe anyone in the caucus was sufficiently able; an angry Keating claimed Henzell was sexist, and Henzell expressed her annoyance at not being taken seriously over the issue. In 1994, as chairwoman of a federal parliamentary inquiry into the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Black Deaths in Custody, Henzell attacked state governnments for not using or inappropriately using $50 million in federal implementation funding, stating (in relation to New South Wales) that \\"two years down the track no service has been put into place for the people they were designed to assist\\", criticising the poor state of services for Aboriginal people, and stating \\"the only conclusion you can draw is the fact that there is a continuing abrogation of people's rights...the fact that we are tolerating this sort of racism diminishes us as a country.\\" She also lambasted the Victorian government for failing to implement key recommendations of the Royal Commission and failing to submit reports on its implementation progress. In October 1994, in relation to a contentious debate on a sexual privacy bill, Henzell claimed in parliament that \\"we are all born bisexual\\", which made front-page news in the Rockhampton newspaper The Morning Bulletin and led to her receiving many angry letters from constituents; she subsequently clarified that her comment \\"was not referring to people's sexual orientation; it referred to the fact that we all have male and female traits and hormones and that human sexuality is a widely misunderstood subject\\". In September 1995, she was one of several Labor MPs to speak in parliament against a bill to sell off the Australian National Line, even though she later voted for it in line with caucus solidarity rules. Throughout all or most of her term, she was a member of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues and the House of Representatives Standing Committees on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and Long Term Strategies. She was defeated by National Party candidate Paul Marek at the 1996 federal election. She later relocated to Armidale in New South Wales and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Armidale Dumaresq Council in 2004. She remained involved with the Labor Party and served as secretary of the party's Armidale State Electoral Council. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Capricornia Category:Women members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Marjorie Henzell"},{"id":"1443842","text":"A Hirayama family of asteroids is a group of minor planets that share similar orbital elements, such as semimajor axis, eccentricity, and orbital inclination. The members of the families are thought to be fragments of past asteroid collisions. Strictly speaking, families and their membership are identified by analysing the so-called proper orbital elements rather than the current osculating orbital elements, which regularly fluctuate on timescales of tens of thousands of years. The proper elements are related constants of motion that are thought to remain almost constant for times of at least tens of millions of years. The Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama (1874‚Äì1943) pioneered the estimation of proper elements for asteroids, and first identified several of the most prominent families in 1918. Kiyotsugu Hirayama initially identified the Koronis, Eos, and Themis families, and later recognized also the Flora and Maria families.

Designed by William Burn and built in 1843. View from north Garden of Muckross House Muckross House () is located on the small Muckross Peninsula between Muckross Lake and Lough Leane, two of the lakes of Killarney, from the town of Killarney in County Kerry, Ireland. In 1932 it was presented by William Bowers Bourn and Arthur Rose Vincent to the Irish nation. It thus became the first National Park in the Irish Free State (now Republic of Ireland) and formed the basis of the present day Killarney National Park. ==History== Muckross House is a mansion designed by the British architect, William Burn, built in 1843 for Henry Arthur Herbert and his wife, the watercolourist Mary Balfour Herbert. With sixty-five rooms, it was built in the Tudor style. Extensive improvements were undertaken in the 1850s in preparation for the visit of Queen Victoria in 1861. It is said that these improvements for the Queen's visit were a contributory factor in the financial difficulties suffered by the Herbert family which resulted in the sale of the estate. In 1899 it was bought by Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun who wanted to preserve the dramatic landscape. He did not live in the house himself, but rented it out to wealthy groups as a hunting lodge. In August 1911, not long before the First World War, Muckross House and its demesne were again sold to William Bowers Bourn, a wealthy Californian mining magnate. He and his wife passed it to their daughter Maud and her husband Arthur Rose Vincent as a wedding present. The couple lived there until Maud's death from pneumonia in 1929. In 1932 her parents Mr and Mrs Bourn and their son-in-law Arthur Vincent decided to present Muckross House and its 11,000 acre estate to the Irish nation. Being called the ‚Ä≥Bourn-Vincent Memorial Park‚Ä≥, it thus became the first National Park in the Republic of Ireland and formed the basis of present-day Killarney National Park. In later years the park was substantially expanded by the acquisition of land from the former Earl of Kenmare's estate. ==Description of Muckross House== ===The interior=== The front entryway has a plethora of mounted trophy heads, including an enormous rack of antlers from the Irish Elk (extinct), found preserved in a local bog. ==See also== *Muckross Abbey ==External links== *Muckross House official website Category:Buildings and structures in County Kerry Category:Museums in County Kerry Category:Historic house museums in the Republic of Ireland Category:Farm museums in the Republic of Ireland Category:Gardens in County Kerry Category:Killarney Category:Open- air museums in the Republic of Ireland Category:Tudor Revival architecture Category:1843 establishments in Ireland ","title":"Muckross House"},{"id":"1443870","text":"\\"He Don't Love You\\" is a song by Human Nature, released as the first single from their album Human Nature.

Hruska was known as one of the most vocal conservatives in the United States Senate during the 1960s and 1970s. Hruska was also co-founder of the Douglas Theatre Company, based in Nebraska. ==Life and career== Hruska was born in David City, Nebraska, one of 11 children of Czech immigrant parents. In 1917, his family moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he graduated from high school. He attended the University of Omaha (now University of Nebraska‚ÄìOmaha) and the University of Chicago Law School and graduated from the Creighton University School of Law in 1929. He returned to Omaha to practice law. In 1944, Hruska first entered politics when he accepted a seat on the Douglas County, Nebraska, Board of Commissioners in place of a friend who recently resigned. He served as a regular member from 1944 to 1945 and as chair from 1945 to 1952. During his time on the board of commissioners, Hruska also sat on the advisory committee of the Nebraska Board of Control from 1947 to 1952. He was president of the Nebraska Association of County Officials from 1950 to 1951 and vice president of the National Association of County Officials from 1951 to 1952. Hruska was elected to the United States House of Representatives from the Omaha-dominated second district of Nebraska in 1952. He served only part of one term, as he ran for a United States Senate seat in 1954, which was vacated by the death of Hugh Butler. Hruska won, and was reelected in 1958, 1964 and 1970 and served in the Senate until his retirement in 1976. His opponent in 1958 and 1970 was Frank B. Morrison. Hruska did not run for reelection to a fourth full term. Even after Nixon resigned, Hruska defended him and claimed Watergate only became a scandal as part of a partisan effort to attack Nixon. Hruska became an influential member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hruska voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. Though Congress was controlled by Democrats for his entire time in the Senate, he was known as a skillful legislator, and was said to have influenced much of the federal criminal justice system's changes during his era. He was the ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee at the time of his retirement. On October 10, 1978, President Carter signed into law a bill which renamed the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) located in Clay County, Nebraska, after former Senator Roman L. Hruska. The Roman L. Hruska Federal Courthouse in Omaha is also named in his honor. ===Mediocrity=== In 1970, Hruska addressed the Senate, urging them to confirm Richard Nixon's nomination of G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court. Responding to criticism that Carswell had been a mediocre judge, Hruska argued: > Even if he were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and > lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they, and a > little chance? We can't have all Brandeises, Frankfurters and Cardozos. Democrats seized upon Hruska's remarks, and the Carswell nomination failed. ==Retirement== Hruska moved back to Omaha in 1976, and lived there until his death. On April 10, 1999, he fell, broke his hip, and died fifteen days later from complications during treatment. He was buried in Bohemian Cemetery in Omaha. ==Personal life== Hruska was married to Victoria Kuncl Hruska. They had three children: Jana, Quentin and Roman, Jr. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1999 deaths Category:County supervisors and commissioners in Nebraska Category:People from David City, Nebraska Category:American people of Czech descent Category:Nebraska Republicans Category:United States senators from Nebraska Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Nebraska Category:Nebraska lawyers Category:Politicians from Omaha, Nebraska Category:University of Nebraska Omaha alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Creighton University School of Law alumni Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:Accidental deaths in Nebraska Category:Republican Party United States senators Category:Czech-American culture in Nebraska Category:Sokol members Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Lawyers from Omaha, Nebraska ","title":"Roman Hruska"},{"id":"1443914","text":"\\"The Stones I Throw (Will Free All Men)\\" was the A-side to the 1965 single by Levon and the Hawks, released on Atco Records.

He would subsequently produce Load (1996), ReLoad (1997), the new material for the band's cover album, Garage Inc. (1998), and St. Anger (2003). Rock also wrote and played all of the bass guitar parts on St. Anger, as Jason Newsted left Metallica in January 2001, and was the bassist for the band's few live performances until Robert Trujillo joined the band in February 2003. Rock was featured prominently in the 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which dealt with Metallica's internal strife and their struggles with the creative process during the recording of St. Anger. In February 2006, Metallica chose producer Rick Rubin to produce their next album, ending the band's long-time relationship with Rock. At Metallica's 30th Anniversary Concert on December 10, 2011, Rock joined Metallica onstage, and performed bass alongside Trujillo on the songs \\"Dirty Window\\" and \\"Frantic\\". ==Awards== Rock's career both as a producer and musician was recognized at the 2007 Juno Awards ceremony in Saskatoon for his lifetime contribution to popular music.

In addition to various solo projects completed by members of the family, DeBarge was active between 1979 and 1989. The group originally consisted of Mark, Randy, Bunny and El. James joined the group a year later for their second album. Bobby and Chico joined in 1987 and 1988 respectively, replacing Bunny and El. DeBarge released six studio albums, four of them with Motown's Gordy Records: The DeBarges (1981), All This Love (1982), In a Special Way (1983), and Rhythm of the Night (1985). The latter became the group's best-selling album and contained the single \\"Rhythm of the Night\\", which hit No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it their highest charting single in the United States. DeBarge entered its decline in 1986, when El and Bunny were offered solo deals with Motown, and DeBarge was released from its contract. The remaining members signed with Stripe Horse Records, an independent label, in 1987, which released their final studio album, Bad Boys. The group continued to perform for an additional two years, with Chico DeBarge joining the group in 1988. A member of the group, Bobby, along with his other brother Chico were arrested for drug trafficking in 1989. Personal problems, legal issues, compounded with the ever changing musical tastes of the public led to the group's dispersion in 1989, 10 years after its inception. ==History== ===Family background=== The DeBarge family are the children of Robert DeBarge, Sr. (died 2009), a white man of French descent, and Etterlene DeBarge (n√©e Abney), a black woman born in Michigan in 1935. They married when Etterlene was 17, a year after the death of her father James Abney, a church choir leader and peanut retailer. They separated in the mid-1970s and divorced in 1974. Etterlene remembers Robert DeBarge, Sr. as physically and emotionally abusive to her and the children, and said he used her youth, the absence of her father, and continuous pregnancy to control her. DeBarge, Sr. has been characterized as \\"domineering and physically abusive to his wife,\\" and some of the DeBarge children have accused him of having sexually abused them. Bunny Debarge, the eldest, recalls being sexually abused by him between the ages of seven to 13.DeBarge - Unsung episode (TVOne). The group, named for their shared surname, hailed from the East Side of Detroit, Michigan, United States, where the siblings were born and raised; they later relocated to Grand Rapids, Michigan. Members included sister Bunny and brothers Mark (or \\"Marty\\"), William (or \\"Randy\\"), Eldra (or \\"El\\"), and James (younger siblings Chico, Darell, and Carol \\"Peaches\\" DeBarge are also singers though not with the group). ===Early years of the group and Switch=== The siblings who became DeBarge started performing in various groups together in the Detroit, Michigan area in the mid 1970s. In 1979, brothers Randy, Mark, and El were part of the SMASH band, which was a release on Source Records/MCA in the USA/Canada before it was released as Pall Mall Groove HOT ICE in Germany by Polydor. Bernd Lichters, who rented a home in Cerritos, CA, bought them instruments, and they were mentored by members of the Motown group Switch, including their elder brothers Tommy and Bobby and co-founding member and family friend Gregory Williams. Bunny DeBarge had joined her younger brothers in 1979 as well, and they formed as The DeBarges in 1980. That year, because of Bobby's success with Switch, younger brother El was able to perform live on the piano and sing for Motown CEO and founder Berry Gordy, who was impressed by the group and agreed to sign them that year. For a year the group worked alongside members of Switch, helping to add background vocals, instrumentation, arranging, and musical and lyrical composition to the band's works, most prominently in \\"I Call Your Name\\", \\"My Friend in the Sky\\", and \\"Love Over and Over Again\\". By 1981, Bobby and Tommy had left Switch and returned the favor to their siblings working with them on their debut album, which was released that year with Bobby, Bunny, and El as main producers. The only single, the Bobby-led ballad \\"What's Your Name\\", failed to chart. ===Success=== In 1982, they added their 18-year-old brother James to the lineup and worked on their second album, All This Love, produced by El and Iris Gordy. The album launched them into R&B; stardom with the records \\"I Like It\\" and \\"All This Love\\". Both songs also became crossover pop hits with \\"All This Love\\" later going to number one on Billboard's adult contemporary chart. In 1983, the group made an impression after appearing on Motown 25, where they performed alongside High Inergy. Later in 1983, the group issued their third album, In a Special Way, which spawned two further hit singles, \\"Time Will Reveal\\" and \\"Love Me in a Special Way\\". Like All This Love before it, the album reached gold status in the United States. Following that album's success, DeBarge were handpicked by Luther Vandross to open for him on his \\"Busy Body Tour\\" to support his album of the same name. Also in 1984, James DeBarge made headlines when he secretly eloped with Janet Jackson of the famed Jackson family, but their marriage was quickly annulled the following year. When the tour ended in late 1984, the group recorded the Diane Warren composition, \\"Rhythm of the Night\\", for the soundtrack to the Motown-produced film, Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon from 1985. The song was released in early 1985 and became a hit single, eventually reaching the top five in several countries, mainly in the US and UK, becoming the band's biggest-selling and their best-known hit. ===Siblings leave and the end of the group=== Sensing that El DeBarge was emerging as the \\"star\\" of the group, Motown had El working on the group's next album primarily by himself, with the label failing to call on the other siblings' help. It's hinted Motown was fearful of the other members' growing dependencies to drug addiction, only trusting El as he seemed to be the most reliable. The Rhythm of the Night album became the band's best-selling work, going platinum and featuring further hits such as \\"Who's Holding Donna Now\\" and \\"You Wear It Well\\". Following the end of its successful promotion, however, both El and Bunny DeBarge departed from the group after Motown offered them lucrative solo deals. Without the powerful harmonies of the brother and sister duo, the rest of the DeBarges were not considered commercial enough to keep going, and they were dropped from the Motown label in 1986. In 1987, Bobby joined the group, and failing to find deals with major labels, the group (still known as DeBarge) signed with the independent label Striped Horse Records, later releasing what turned out to be their final studio album, Bad Boys. Since Striped Horse had financial problems promoting the album and without the help of Motown, and although two singles were released ‚Äì \\"Dance All Night\\", which peaked at number 33, and the ballad \\"I Got You Babe\\", which only reached number 73 ‚Äì the album itself failed to chart. DeBarge continued their career into 1988, even bringing along younger brother Chico (who had a successful hit \\"Talk to Me\\") with them as their opening act. The brothers made a guest appearance on the television show Punky Brewster in 1988. Later in 1988 Bobby and Chico were arrested for drug trafficking in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They were eventually convicted of the charges and sentenced to two different prisons to serve their sentences. The arrests and subsequent convictions brought an end to the group as a musical entity and it was disbanded in 1989. In the end the group DeBarge released nine Top 40 R&B; singles, five top 40 pop singles, two Pop top 10 hits, five top 10 R&B; singles, two number-one R&B; singles, one number-one single on the dance chart, and three number-one hits on the adult contemporary chart. ===Setbacks, solo projects, and some success=== Despite the group's highly publicized drug addictions and several members serving jail time for drug offenses, the siblings have continued to perform together occasionally. In 1991, Randy and James contributed to a gospel album featuring their mother Etterlene and younger siblings Darryl (Young DeBarge) and Carol (Peaches DeBarge), billed as \\"the DeBarge Family.\\" Several members of the family made several solo albums during the 1990s and 2000s, but never reached the fame and popularity of their original group. The DeBarges' story of their rise and fall was documented in late 2008 as the debut episode of the TV One show, Unsung. In 2010 El, after a six-year sabbatical of releasing solo albums, and following a period of drug addiction and several arrests, released the well-received Grammy-nominated album, Second Chance and went on tour in support of R&B; singer Mary J. Blige in 2011, but relapsed and went back to drug rehab to address his continuing issues. In 2011, James, Randy and Bunny appeared on Dr. Drew's Lifechangers to discuss their troubles with drug addiction, later agreeing to attend a rehabilitation facility. While Randy and James left the facility on a follow-up episode, Bunny still attended and told Dr. Drew of her recovery, even performing a gospel song on the show. Drug abuse has also brought various group members several tragedies and setbacks over the years: Bobby DeBarge died at a hospice in Grand Rapids after contracting AIDS following years of heroin addiction; Tommy DeBarge, who also suffered drug addiction, is on kidney dialysis but has nonetheless continued to perform, sometimes with surviving members of Switch and with his family members; Randy DeBarge and Mark DeBarge are said to have \\"incurable diseases,\\" according to their mother. James DeBarge was sentenced to prison for drug offenses. ===Musical legacy=== The group's material has been either frequently sampled or covered: * Their collaborations with Switch on their recordings, \\"I Call Your Name\\" and \\"My Friend in the Sky\\" have been sampled as well as their own material, including \\"I Like It\\", \\"Stay with Me\\" and \\"A Dream\\". * Rapper The Notorious B.I.G.'s remix of \\"One More Chance\\", which sampled \\"Stay With Me\\". * Mary J. Blige, a fan of DeBarge, also sampled and covered their work, including \\"Share My World\\" (adding the group's intro ad-libs from that song on her song of the same name), \\"A Dream\\" and \\"Don't Go\\" (which interpolated the ending of \\"Stay With Me\\"). * Rapper Tupac Shakur interpolated the melody of \\"A Dream\\" for his posthumous hit, \\"I Ain't Mad at Cha\\". * R&B; group Blackstreet sampled the music of \\"A Dream\\" for their hit, \\"Don't Leave Me\\", and have said they were big fans of DeBarge (Teddy Riley calling El DeBarge \\"a living legend\\" in the liner notes of their 1994 debut album) and had covered \\"I Like It\\". On their platinum album Another Level the group did a gospel version of DeBarge's hit \\"Time Will Reveal\\". In 1998 Riley also sampled parts of Switch's \\"My Friend in the Sky\\" (co-composed by Bobby, Bunny and El) for rapper Queen Pen's album track, \\"No Hooks\\" off her My Melody album. (The same song would be sampled in 2005 for Raheem DeVaughn's title track off The Love Experience.) * The melody of \\"Stay With Me\\" was revisited by Ashanti on her single, \\"Foolish\\" and later by Mariah Carey on her single I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time from E=MC¬≤. * In 2007 rapper Rich Boy's hit \\"Throw Some D's\\" sampled Switch's \\"I Call Your Name\\", which was co-written by Bobby and arranged by Bobby and El. * \\"I Like It\\" is their most sampled, with several acts sampling the music or interpolating the song's popular bridge (sung by El and written by Bunny), and \\"All This Love\\" has also been covered and sampled frequently by other artists. ===Re-release of their classic albums and usage of their music in film=== * In 2011, Motown Records/Hip-O Select released the three-disc set Time Will Reveal: The Complete Motown Albums. This collection presents all four Motown/Gordy albums, spread out over the first two discs, and offers a third disc containing remixes, rarities and unreleased material. * In 2016 \\"Rhythm of the Night\\" appeared in Ghostbusters: Answer the Call. The track also appears on the official 2016 soundtrack. ==Personnel== *Etterlene \\"Bunny\\" DeBarge ‚Äì vocals (1979‚Äì1986) *Eldra \\"El\\" DeBarge ‚Äì vocals, piano/keyboards (1979‚Äì1986) *Mark \\"Marty\\" DeBarge ‚Äì vocals, trumpet, saxophone (1979‚Äì1989) *William \\"Randy\\" DeBarge ‚Äì vocals, bass guitar (1979‚Äì1989) *James DeBarge ‚Äì vocals, piano/keyboards (1982‚Äì1989) *Robert \\"Bobby\\" DeBarge, Jr. ‚Äì vocals, piano/keyboards, drums (1987‚Äì1989) *Jonathan \\"Chico\\" DeBarge ‚Äì vocals, piano/keyboards (1988‚Äì1989) ==Discography== * The DeBarges (1981) * All This Love (1982) * In a Special Way (1983) * Rhythm of the Night (1985) * Bad Boys (1987) ==See also== * List of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart * Kristinia DeBarge ==References== ==External links== *DeBarge biography and updates at Soul Tracks *DeBarge History ‚Äì The early days *The DeBarge Network * *Vibe article \\"The Rise and Fall of the DeBarge Family\\" from the October 2007 issue: Part 1; Part 2; Part 3; Part 4 Category:American soul musical groups Category:Family musical groups Category:African-American musical groups Category:Motown artists Category:American dance music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1979 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1989 Category:Musical groups from Michigan Category:Musical groups from Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:DeBarge family Category:Musical quintets ","title":"DeBarge"},{"id":"1443921","text":"POTY may refer to: * Person of the Year * Player of the year award ==People== * √âdouard Poty, Belgian sports shooter * Poty Lazzarotto (1924‚Äì1998), Brazilian artist ","title":"POTY"},{"id":"1443926","text":"Silver Lake is the name of both a reservoir and an adjacent neighborhood in the New York City borough of Staten Island. ==History== Silver Lake Park, located on Staten Island's north shore, is bounded by Forest Avenue, Victory Boulevard and Clove Road. The original Silver Lake was a spring-fed body of water formed at the end of the ice age, and now makes up the south basin of the reservoir at this site. Silver Lake was once known as Fresh Pond, but maps show that by the middle of the nineteenth century, the name Silver Lake had come into use and the two were used interchangeably until about 1860. Silver Lake was named after Mark Silver, who founded the a philanthropic organization today known as the Hebrew Free Burial Association. Mark Silver Americanized his name from Marks Silva. The Association purchased land which became the Silver Lake Cemetery and was used for charitable burials, many of the victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire are buried there. Silver Lake has a long history of both recreational and commercial uses. During the 19th century, a casino and saloon existed on the lakeshore and several companies harvested its ice. Staten Islanders used the lake for boating and ice skating in that era, and in February 1897, Silver Lake hosted the National Skating Amateur Championship races. By the end of the 19th century, the population of Staten Island was growing rapidly and residents were calling for land to be set aside for parks. Noting that it was prohibitively expensive and time- consuming for families to visit Manhattan's Central Park or Brooklyn's Prospect Park, prominent Staten Island writer and resident John De Morgan appealed in February 1900 to the State Assembly Committee on Cities to appropriate funds to establish Silver Lake Park. ‚ÄúThe people of the community have a right to recreation and pleasure grounds,‚Äù he addressed Assembly members in Albany, ‚ÄúWhere . . . their children [can be] kept from the contaminating influence of the saloon.‚Äù De Morgan's plea to the State Assembly worked; the Silver Lake Park Commission was created and in their 1900 session legislators appropriated a modest amount for acquiring the land around the lake. The original parcels for Silver Lake Park around the perimeter of the lake were condemned and purchased in 1901, 1902, and 1904, at which point Staten Island parks officials began to convert the area to its current state. As modern refrigeration replaced ice harvesting, in 1913 the lake was drained and converted to a working reservoir by the Board of Water Supply. The Board was created by the state legislature in 1905 to build the Catskill water supply system. Silver Lake Reservoir in its current form was created in 1917 when water was piped in to fill it from the Ashokan Reservoir in Ulster County, New York, 119 miles (192 km) away. The water started arriving on October 25, and the reservoir would become the largest body of fresh water on Staten Island. The park's underbrush began to be removed in 1921 and the natural oaks (Quercus), tulip trees (Liriodendron tulipifera) and sassafras (Sassafras albidum) were supplemented with shrubs, spruce (Picea) and pine (Pinus) trees, and flowerbeds. A January 1921 letter to the editor in the Staten Island Advance lamented the loss: ‚ÄúNature [should be] encouraged rather than operated on [by Staten Island parks officials] who are so anxious to improve upon nature.‚Äù Although the park's scenery is dominated by the reservoir, other parts of the park are notable. Land from Marine Cemetery, a nineteenth-century burial site for the Marine Hospital Quarantine in Tompkinsville, was added to the park in 1924. In 1928 the land was converted to a golf course, and in 1994 researchers discovered documentation linking the site to its past use as a cemetery. Today it is thought that perhaps several thousand immigrants, including many Irish escaping the Great Famine of Ireland, who died from contagious diseases after landing in the United States are buried under the 18th fairway of the golf course. The golf course itself was completed in 1929 and tennis, biking, softball, and playground facilities were added as Silver Lake Park became a recreational hub for the developing borough. ‚ÄúYou can visit Silver Lake Park in your Sunday suit and come away untarnished,‚Äù a 1954 Staten Island Advance piece on the borough's parks claimed. The reservoir was used for potable water until 1971 when an underground storage tank system was completed, the largest of its kind in the world. Today the reservoir is used as part of the drainage system for the tanks. In 1988, Staten Island Borough President Ralph J. Lamberti provided $1.4 million for a new administration building and children's play area. Again in 1997, Borough President Molinari allocated $700,000 to repave walkways and to add new plants, benches, fences, guiderails, play equipment, handball courts. ==Features== Silver Lake Park has many attractions, such as tennis courts, an 18-hole public golf course, a baseball field, play area, and dog run. The neighborhood to the east and south features several large privately owned apartment buildings and three cemeteries along Victory Boulevard. Also included in the neighborhood, on the other side of the adjacent Silver Lake golf course, is a series of mostly dead-end streets located above Forest Avenue and Hart Boulevard. The dead end streets are Lakewood Road, Park Court, Edstone Drive, Rose Court and Silver Court. They comprise approximately eighty-eight homes and are part of the Silver Lake Park Association. At the very top of Hart Boulevard are the Silver Lake Tennis Courts. Adjacent to the tennis courts is a baseball field. To the west of this neighborhood are Grymes Hill, Wagner College and Sunnyside, where the Mid-Island region is said to begin (the Silver Lake section being reckoned as part of the North Shore). ==Transportation== Silver Lake is served by the local/limited buses and the express bus. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Reservoirs in New York (state) Category:Neighborhoods in Staten Island Category:Parks in Staten Island Category:Reservoirs in Richmond County, New York ","title":"Silver Lake, Staten Island"},{"id":"1443931","text":"thumb \\"Go Go Liza Jane\\" was the A-side of the 1968 single released by Atco Records in order to capitalize on the growing success of The Band, who had recorded the track along with two others (\\"The Stones I Throw\\" and \\"He Don't Love You\\") in 1965 under the moniker Levon and the Hawks.

Although no complete plays by Cratinus are preserved, they are known through hundreds of fragments: he was noted in antiquity both for a mastery of plot and for the obscene vehemence of his attacks on Pericles.J Boardman ed., The Oxford History of the Classical World (Oxford 1986) p. 176 ==Aristophanes and his contemporaries== Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in The Clouds, and in his racy anti-war farce Lysistrata. Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis. Classical literary criticism placed Aristophanes somewhere between the harshness of Cratinus and the smoothness of Eupolis.H Nettleship, A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (London 1894) p. 67 All the Old Comedy writers worked within a highly structured format ‚Äì parados, agon, and parabasis ‚Äì which paradoxically offered maximum scope for improvisatory flights of fancy.I Ousby ed., The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (Cambridge 1995) p. 195 Song, dance, costume, and chorus all played important roles, as did the parody of the ‚Äòsenior‚Äô drama, tragedy.S H Butcher, Harvard Lectures on Greek Subjects (London 1904) p. 175 and p. 181-4 Possibly due to the influence of tragedy was the important role of a heroic figure in Aristophanic comedy: as Northrop Frye put it, ‚ÄúIn Aristophanes there is usually a central figure who constructs his (or her) own society in the teeth of strong opposition‚Äù.N Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton 1971) p. 43 The diminished role of the protagonist (and chorus) in his latest works marks a point of transition to the Middle comedy.S Halliwell, Aristophanes: Birds and other plays (Oxford 1998) p. 202 ==Later influence/parallels== *Horace claimed a formative role for the Old Comedy in the making of Roman satire.A Palmer ed., The Satires of Horace (London 1920) p. 18 and p. 156 *The Old Comedy subsequently influenced later European writers such as Ben Jonson, Racine, and Goethe.S Halliwell, Aristophanes: Birds and other plays (Oxford 1998) p. lx Also, Fran√ßois Rabelais, Miguel de Cervantes, Jonathan Swift, and Voltaire may have derived elements from it. Western writers took particular inspiration from Aristophanes' disguising of political attacks as buffoonery. Old Comedy displays similarities to modern- day political satires such as Dr. Strangelove (1964) and the televised buffoonery of Monty Python and Saturday Night Live.Seth Lerer, Comedy through the Ages (recorded lecture series), Springfield, Virginia: The Teaching Company, 2000. *George Bernard Shaw was profoundly influenced by Aristophanian comedy-writing. According to Robert R. Speckhard \\"like Shaw, Aristophanes wrote comedies of ideas, and, though one finds no evidence that Shaw is indebted to Aristophanes, it is clear that in facing much the same dramatic problem that Aristophanes faced, Shaw came up with much the same solution. Because the comic machinery is easier to spot in Aristophanes (where there is no attempt, as in Shaw, to disguise it with any surface realism), what Aristophanes has done becomes a helpful point of reference from which to study what Shaw has done.\\"Shaw and Aristophanes: How the Comedy of Ideas Works, Robert R.

The Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans are two exercise plans developed for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) by Dr. Bill Orban in the late 1950s, first published in 1961. The 5BX plan (Five Basic Exercises) was developed for men; a corresponding program was developed for women under the name XBX (Ten Basic Exercises) and the two plans were subsequently published together as one book. The popularity of the programs in many countries around the world helped to launch modern fitness culture. ==History== Wing Commander John Tett was appointed Special Education Officer in the RCAF in 1952. His mandate was to establish a directorate and trade for the development of physical fitness, sports and recreation. In 1956 he hired Bill Orban and directed him to devise a program which emphasized the development of a high level of fitness, but would consume only a relatively small amount of the RCAF personnel's time. The program was intended for RCAF pilots, a third of whom were not considered fit to fly at the time. While performing research at the University of Illinois in the early 1950s, Orban had noticed, when testing oxygen intake, that long periods of exercise did not necessarily lead to significant improvement. This led him to the conclusion that the intensity of exercise was more important to improving fitness than the amount of time spent on it. He incorporated this conclusion into his proposed exercise plan for the RCAF. This concept drew a negative reaction from others in the field at the time but it proved its worth in the three years of testing that the RCAF performed before releasing the program in 1961. Based on this research and testing, Orban came up with five basic exercises (5BX), four to improve flexibility and strength and one to boost aerobic fitness. The plan was innovative in two respects. Firstly, it did not require access to specialized equipment. Many RCAF pilots were located in remote bases in northern Canada, with no access to gymnasium facilities, so it was important to offer a means of keeping fit without their use. Secondly, the plan only required that eleven minutes be spent on the exercises per day. After further research and testing involving over 600 volunteers, he produced a program with ten basic exercises (XBX) for women that required twelve minutes to complete. The programs proved popular with civilians. A U.S. edition was published in 1962 under the title Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans For Physical Fitness. The publication became popular around the world and was translated into thirteen languages. In total, twenty-three million copies of the booklets were sold to the public. Orban, creating the program as a public servant, received no additional income from the success of the plan. In English, it was republished throughout the 1960s, 70s, 80s and in 1992. John Walker's book The Hacker's Diet (first published in 1991) contains a simplified version, that is claimed to be suitable for everyone. The original 5BX programme has also been updated by three Australian fitness trainers under the title Goodbye Couch! Len Deighton's novel Only When I Larf contains a reference to the 5BX program. Celebrity practitioners of the program included the late George Burns. Present-day practitioners include Helen Mirren and the British princes Philip, Charles, William and his wife Kate. The book was republished in 2016. ==5BX Plan== The 5BX Plan For Physical Fitness is composed of six charts arranged in increasing order of difficulty. Each chart is composed of five exercises that are performed within eleven minutes. The first four exercises are calisthenics and the last is an aerobic exercise. As the individual progresses within the system, the number of each type of exercise that must be performed increases and the difficulty of each exercise increases. ===Exercises=== Throughout the charts and levels, the five exercises are the same, but more difficult variations are introduced: #Stretching #Sit-up #Back extension #Push-up #Running in place A walk or run may be substituted for the final exercise; the distances to be covered and the time to be taken are also specified in the plan. ==XBX Plan== The XBX Plan For Physical Fitness was developed for women. The program consists of charts that get progressively more difficult, and takes 12 minutes per day after users get past the beginning levels. ===Exercises=== The first four exercises are primarily for flexibility; exercises 5-9 are primarily to improve muscle strength; and exercise 10 is to develop aerobic capacity: # Toe touching # Knee raising # Lateral bending # Arm circling # Sit-ups # Chest and leg raising # Side leg raising # Push-ups # Leg lifting # Running and jumping in place Two optional supplementary exercises are also described. ==See also== *Fitness boot camp ==References== ==External links== * Five Basic Exercises Royal Canadian Air Force 5BX Training Film (1959) * Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans Canadian Government (1962) * XBX Plan, copy of the original booklet in PDF format *What is 5BX?, Fit for Fifty Category:Physical exercise Category:Royal Canadian Air Force ","title":"Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans"},{"id":"1443957","text":"This article lists French composers who wrote for the harpsichord during the 17th and 18th centuries. == Chronology == File:Timebar clavecin france version 1.0.png == 1640-1710: Beginnings of harpsichord music in France == *Jean-Henri d'Anglebert (1629-1691) *Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res (1601-1672) *Louis Couperin (c.1626-1661) *Louis-Nicolas Cl√©rambault (1676-1749) *Charles Dieupart (1667-1740) *Jean-Nicolas Geoffroy (1633-1694) *√âlisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre (1665-1729) *Nicolas Leb√®gue (1631-1702) *Gaspard Le Roux (1660-1707) *Louis Marchand (1669-1732) *Nicolas Siret (1663-1754) == 1710-1789: Second period == *Claude-B√©nigne Balbastre (1724-1799) *Joseph Bodin de Boismortier (1689-1755) *Fran√ßois d'Agincourt (1684-1758) *Jean-Od√©o Demars (1695-1756) *Josse Boutmy (1697-1779; Flemish) *Bernard de Bury (1720-1785) *Jean-Joseph Cassan√©a de Mondonville (1711-1772) *Michel Corrette (1707-1795) *Armand-Louis Couperin (1727-1789) *Fran√ßois Couperin (1668-1733) *Jean-Fran√ßois Dandrieu (1681-1738) *Louis-Claude Daquin (1694-1772) *Louis- Antoine Dornel (1680-1756) *Jacques Duphly (1715-1789) *Pierre F√©vrier (1696-1760) *Jean-Baptiste Forqueray (1699-1782) *Pierre-Claude Foucquet (1694-1772) *Jean-Adam Guilain (1680-1739; German) *C√©lestin Harst (1698-1778) *Christophe Moyreau (1690-1772) *Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764) *Joseph Nicolas Pancrace Royer (1705-1755) *Philippe-Fran√ßois V√©ras (fl. 1740) Harpsichordists Harpsichordists ","title":"List of French harpsichordists"},{"id":"1443964","text":"In the United States, 80/20 housing is multifamily housing that meets federal guidelines for tax-exempt financing.

Niazi or General Niazi was a lieutenant- general in the Pakistan Army and the last Governor of East Pakistan, known for commanding the Eastern Command of the Pakistan Army in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) during the Eastern and the Western Fronts of the Indo-Pakistani war until the unilateral surrendering on the 16 December 1971 to Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora (GOC-in-C) of the Eastern Command and the Bengali Liberation Forces. Niazi had the area responsibility of defending the borders of East Pakistan from India and was held morally responsible by authors and critics within Pakistan's military for surrendering the Eastern Command, consisting of ~92,000 - 95,000 servicemen (sources vary), to the Indian Army when the preparations were underway to lay siege on Dacca. Thus ending the liberation struggle led by the Bengali Mukti Bahini which also ended the war with India amid a unilateral ceasefire called by Pakistan in 1971. After taken and held as a prisoner of war by the Indian Army, he was repatriated to Pakistan on 30 April 1975. Niazi was dishonored from his military service after confessing at the War Enquiry Commission led by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman. The War Commission leveled accusations against him for human rights violations, supervising the smuggling of goods during the Indian supported civil war in the East and held him morally responsible for military failure during the course of the war. Niazi however rejected the base allegations and sought a military court-martial while insisting that he had acted according to the orders of the Army GHQ. The court-martial was never granted. After the war, he remained active in national politics and supported the ultra- conservative agenda under the conservative alliance against Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government in 1970s. In 1999, he authored the book Betrayal of East Pakistan, in which he provided his \\"own true version of the events of that fateful year.\\" On 1 February 2004, Niazi died in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan . ==Biography== ===Early life and British Indian Army career=== Amir Abdullah Niazi was born in 1915 in a small village, Balo Khel, located on the east bank of the Indus River in Mianwali, Punjab, British India. After educating from a local school in Mianwali, he joined the British Indian Army as an \\"Y cadet\\" in 1937 and selected for an emergency commission as he had passed out from the Officers Training School in Bangalore. He gained commission during the World War 2 in 8 March 1942 into the 4/7 Rajput Regiment which was then-part of the 161st Infantry Brigade led by the Brigadier D.F.W. Warren. ===World War II and Burma campaigns=== On 11 June 1942, Lt. Niazi was stationed in the Kekrim Hills located in regions of Assam-Manipur to participate in the Burma front. That spring, he was part of the 14th Army of the British Army and the British Indian Army commanded by General Slim. During this period, the 14th Army had halted the offense against the Japanese Imperial Army at the Battle of Imphal and elsewhere in bitterly fought battles along the Burma front. His valor of actions were commendable and General Slim described his gallantry in a lengthy report to General Headquarters, India, about his judgment of the best course of action. They agreed on Niazi's skill in completely surprising the enemy, his leadership, coolness under fire, and his ability to change tactics, create diversions, extricate his wounded and withdraw his men. At the Burmese front in 1944, Lt. Niazi impressed his superior officers when he commanded a platoon that initiated an offense against the Japanese Imperial Army at the Bauthi-Daung tunnels. Lt. Niazi's gallantry had impressed his British commanders in the GHQ India and they wanted to award him the Distinguished Service Order, but his rank was not high enough for such a decoration. During the campaign, Brigadier D.F.W. Warren, commanding officer of the 161st Infantry Division of the British Army, gave Niazi the soubriquet \\"Tiger\\" for his part in a ferocious fight with the Japanese. After the conflict, the British Government decorated Lt. Niazi with the Military Cross for leadership, judgement, quick thinking and calmness under pressure in action along the border with Burma. On 11 July 1944, his military commission was confirmed as permanent and the new service number was issued as ICO-906. On 15 December 1944, Lord Wavell, Viceroy of India, flew to Imphal and knighted General Slim and his corps commanders Stopford, Scoones, and Christison in the presence of Lord Mountbatten. Only two British Indian Army officers were chosen to be decorated at that ceremony‚Äî one was Lt. Niazi and the other was Major Sam Manekshaw of the Frontier Force Regiment. After World War II, in 1945, he was promoted as army captain and sent to attend the Command and Staff College in Quetta which he graduated with a staff course degree under then-Lt. Col. Yahya Khan. ===Staff and war appointments in Pakistan Army=== In 1947 the United Kingdom, through the Indian Independence Act 1947, announced their intention of partitioning British India amid the failure of the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India. After the creation of Pakistan in August 1947, Major Niazi decided to opt for Pakistani citizenship and joined the newly established Pakistan Army where his S/No was redesigned as PA‚Äì477 by the Ministry of Defence of Pakistan. He continued serving at the Command and Staff College in Quetta and briefly completed his tenure as an instructor. His career in the army progressed well and he continued to climb in army grade. In the 1950s as he was decorated with the Sitara-i-Khidmat (lit. Service Star) for his contributions and service with the army. In 1960‚Äì64, he was promoted as Brigadier and offered discussion on infiltration tactics at the Command and Staff College. Subsequently, he published an article on infiltration and promoted talks on military-supported local rebellion against the enemy. Brigadier Niazi went on to participate in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the second war with India, as he commanded the paratrooper brigade stationed in Sialkot. Initially, he commanded the 5th AK Brigade directing military operations in Jammu and Kashmir but later assumed the command of 14th (Para) Brigade in Zafarwal sector where he gained public notability when he participated in the famous Battle of Chawinda tank battle against the Indian Army which halted the Indians troop rotation. His role in a tank battle led him to be decorated with the Hilal-e-Jurat by the President of Pakistan. His leadership credentials led him to be appointed martial law administrator of both Karachi and Lahore to maintain control of law in the cities of West Pakistan in 1966‚Äì67. In 1968, he was promoted as Major-General and made General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 8th Infantry Division, stationed in Sialkot, Punjab, Pakistan. In 1969, Major-General Niazi was made GOC of 10th Infantry Division, stationed in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. In 1971, he was promoted to three star assignment and promoted as Lieutenant-General, initially appointed Commander of the IV Corps in Lahore. ==East Pakistan== ===Eastern Command in 1971 war=== Niazi's strategy of defending the India-East Pakistan border by deploying the troops at the border. Lieutenant-General Niazi volunteered for transfer to East Pakistan when Lieutenant-General Bahadur Sher Khan declined the post. There were two other generals who had also refused postings in the East. However, Niazi said \\"yes\\" without necessarily realizing the risks involved and how to counter them. After General Tikka Khan had initiated the Operation Searchlight military crackdown in March 1971, many officers had declined to be stationed in the East and Niazi arrived in Dhaka on 4 April 1971 to assume the Eastern Command from Tikka Khan. Furthermore, the mass killing of Bengali intellectuals in 1971 at the University of Dhaka had made the East Pakistani people hostile towards the Pakistani military, which made it hard for Niazi to overcome the situation. On 10/11 April 1971, he headed a meeting of his senior commanders to assess the situation but, according to eyewitnesses, he used abusive language aimed at the Bengali rebels. From May through August 1971, the Indian Army trained Mukti Bahini led Operation Jackpot, a series of counter guerrilla campaigns against the Eastern Command, and Niazi began taking countermeasures against the Bengali rebellion. By June 1971, he sent reports on the rebellion and noted that 30,000 insurgents were hurriedly trained by India at the India-East Pakistan border. In August 1971, Niazi formulated a plan to defend the borders from the advancing Indian Army based on a \\"fortress concept\\" which mean converting the border towns and villages into a stronghold. By September 1971, he was appointed the martial law administrator in order to provide his support to Governor Abdul Motaleb Malik who appointed a civilian cabinet. On the issue of the 1971 East Pakistan genocide, Niazi had reportedly told his public relations officer and press secretary, Major Siddique Salik, that \\"we will have to account every single rape and killing when back in (West) Pakistan. God never spares the Tyrant.\\" The Government of East Pakistan appointed Niazi as commander of the Eastern Command, and Major-General Rao Farman Ali as their military adviser for the East Pakistan Rifles and East Pakistan Coast Guard. In October 1971, he created and deployed two ad-hoc divisions to strengthen the defence of the East from further infiltration. In October 1971, Niazi lost contact with the Pakistan Army GHQ and was virtually independent in controlling the Eastern Command from the central government in Islamabad. On November 1971, General Abdul Hamid Khan, the Chief of Staff, warned him of an eminent Indian attack on the East and advised him to redeploy the Eastern Command on a tactical and political base ground but this was not implemented due to shortage of time. In a public message, Niazi was praised by Abdul Hamid Khan saying:\\"The whole nation is proud of you and you have their full support\\". No further orders or clarification was issued in regards to the orders as Niazi had been caught unawares when the Indian Army planned to launch a full assault on East Pakistan. On 3 December 1971, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) launched Operation Chengiz Khan, the pre-emptive PAF air-strikes on Indian Air Force bases that officially led to start of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the third war with India. According to author Sagar, Niazi, surprisingly, was not aware of the attack and had no prior knowledge of the attack. Credibility of this claim is given by Niazi's press secretary and public relations officer, then-Major Siddique Salik, who wrote in Witness to Surrender, that Niazi's chief of staff Brigadier Baqir Siddiqi reportedly scolded him of not notifying Niazi and his staff of an aerial attack on India. ===Surrendering of Eastern Command=== Instrument of Surrender under the gaze of Indian Army's Eastern Command's commander Lt. Gen. J.S. Aurora (sitting beside Niazi), on 16 December 1971 in Dhaka. When Indian Army soldiers crossed the borders and charged towards Dhaka, General Niazi panicked when he came to realise the real nature of the Indian strategy and became frantically nervous when the Indian Army successfully penetrated the defence of the East. Niazi's military staff further regretted not heeding the intelligence warnings issued 20 years earlier in the 1952 'Cable 1971' report compiled by Major K. M. Arif, the military intelligence official on Niazi's staff. According to the testimonies provided by Major-General Farman Ali in the War Enquiry Commission, Niazi's morale collapsed as early as 7 December and he cried frantically over the progress report presented to Governor Abdul Motaleb. He ultimately blamed Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan for turning the East Pakistanis hostile towards the Government of Pakistan, and the creation of the Mukti Bahini. Major accusations were also directed toward Lieutenant-General Yakob Ali Khan, Admiral S. M. Ahsan and Major-General Ali for aggravating the crisis, but Niazi had to bear most responsibility for all that happened in the East. General Niazi, alongside with his deputy Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff, nervously tried reassessing the situation to halt the Indian Army's penetration by directing joint army-navy operations with no success. The Pakistani military combat units found themselves involved in a guerrilla war with the Mukti Bahini under Atul Osmani, and were unprepared and untrained for such warfare. On 9 December, the Indian Government accepted the sovereignty of Bangladesh and extended its diplomatic mission to the Provisional Government of Bangladesh. This eventually led Governor Abdul Motaleb to resign from his post and he took refuge with his entire cabinet at the Red Cross shelter at the Inter-Continental Dacca on 14 December. Niazi eventually took control of the civilian government and reportedly received a telegram on 16 December 1971 from President Yahya Khan: \\"You have fought a heroic battle against overwhelming odds. The nation is proud of you ... You have now reached a stage where further resistance is no longer humanly possible nor will it serve any useful purpose ... You should now take all necessary measures to stop the fighting and preserve the lives of armed forces personnel, all those from West Pakistan and all loyal elements\\". During this time, the Special Branch of the East Pakistan Police notified Niazi of the joint Indo-Bengali siege of Dhaka as the Eastern Command led by Lieutenant-General Jagjit Singh Aurora began encircling Dhaka. Niazi then appealed for a conditional ceasefire to Lieutenant-General Jagjit Singh Aurora which called for transferring power to the elected government, but without the surrender of the Eastern Command led by Niazi. This offer was rejected by Indian Army's Chief of Army Staff General Sam Manekshaw and he set a deadline for surrender, President Yahya Khan considered it as \\"illegitimate. Niazi then once again appealed for a cease- fire, but Manekshaw set a deadline for surrender, failing which Dhaka would come under siege. Subsequently, the Indian Army began encircling Dhaka and Lieutenant-General Jagjit Singh Aurora sent a message through Major-General Rafael Jacob that issued an ultimatum to surrender in a \\"30-minutes\\" time window on 16 December 1971. Niazi agreed to surrender and sent a message to Manekshaw despite many army officers declined to obey, although they were legally bound. The Indian Army commanders, Lieutenant General Sagat Singh, Lieutenant General J.S. Aurora, and Major-General Rafael Farj Jacob arrived at Dhaka via helicopter with the surrender documents. The surrender took place at Ramna Race Course, in Dhaka at local time 16:31 on 16 December 1971. Niazi signed the Instrument of Surrender and handed over his personal weapon to J. S. Aurora in the presence of Indian and Bangladesh force commanders. With Niazi, nearly 90,000 personnel of the Eastern Command surrendered to the joint Indian and Bangladesh Army. ==War prisoner, repatriation, and politics== Niazi, who was repatriated to Pakistan, was handed over to Lieutenant-General Abdul Hamid, then corps commander of the IV Corps, by Indian Army from the Wagha checkpoint in Lahore District, Punjab, in April 1975, in a symbolic gesture of last war prisoner held by India. Upon arriving in Lahore, he immediately refrained from speaking to news media correspondents, and was immediately taken under the custody of the Pakistan Army's Military Police (MP) who shifted him via helicopter to Lahore Cantonment where he was detained despite his strong protests. He was immediately dismissed from his military commission and his war honors were withdrawn from him. Subsequently, he was placed in solitary confinement for sometime, though he was later released. Being the last to return supported his reputation as a \\"soldier's general\\", but did not shield him from the scorn he faced in Pakistan, where he was blamed for the surrender. Bhutto discharged Niazi after stripping him of his military rank, the pension usually accorded to retired soldiers, and his military decorations. His three-star rank was eventually reduced to Major- General, a two-star rank, but he was dismissed from the service in July 1975. He was also denied his military pension and medical benefits, though he lodged a strong complaint against the revoking of his pension. In 1980s, the Ministry of Defence quietly changed the status of \\"dismissal\\" to \\"retirement\\" but did not restore his rank. The change of order allowed Niazi to seek a pension and the medical assistance benefits enjoyed by retired military personnel. Niazi remained active in national politics in 1970s and supported the ultraconservative agenda on a conservative Pakistan National Alliance platform against the Pakistan Peoples Party. In 1977, he was again detained by the police when the Operation Fair Play military coup occurred on 5 July, overthrowing the government of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Martial law was enforced and Niazi sought retirement from politics. ==War Enquiry Commission== In 1982, Niazi was summoned and confessed to the War Enquiry Commission led by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman and the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the events involving the secession of East Pakistan in April 1975. The War Commission leveled accusations against him of several kinds of ethical misconduct during his tenure in East Pakistan. The Commission opined that Niazi supervised the betel leaf and imported paan using an official aircraft, from East Pakistan to Pakistan. The Commission indicted him for corruption and moral turpitude while noting his bullying of junior officers who opposed his orders. Niazi tried placing the blame on the Yahya administration, his military adviser Maj. Gen. Farman Ali, Admiral S.M. Ahsan, Lieutenant-General Yakob Ali, and the military establishment. The Commission partially accepted his claims by critically noting that General Niazi was a Supreme Commander of the Eastern Command, and that he was responsible for everything that happened in the East.\\" Though he showed no regrets, Niazi refused to accept responsibility for the Breakup of East Pakistan and squarely blamed President Yahya. The Commission endorsed his claims that Yahya was to blame, but noted that Niazi was the Commander who lost the East. The Commission recommended a court-martial be held by the Judge Advocate General that would indite Niazi for serious breaches of military discipline and the military code. No such court-martial took place, but nonetheless, he was politically maligned and indited with the war crimes that took place in East Pakistan. Niazi did not accepted the Commission's inquiries and fact-findings, believing that the Commission had no understanding of military matters. Niazi claimed that a court-martial would have besmirched the names of those who later rose to great heights, and that he was being used as a scapegoat. In 1998, he authored a book, The Betrayal of East Pakistan, which was a record of the events that led to 16 December 1971. In 2001, he appeared on Views On News, and was interviewed by Dr. Shahid Masood at ARY News shortly before his death. ==Death and legacy== After giving an interview to ARY News, Niazi died on 1 February 2004 in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. He was buried in a Military Graveyard in Lahore. Political commentators described Niazi's legacy as a mixture of the foolhardy, and the ruthless. He was also noted for making audacious statements like: \\"Dacca will fall only over my dead body\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20061207140306/http://www.bharat- rakshak.com/1971/Dec12/index.html According to Pakistani author, Akbar S. Ahmed, he had even hatched a far-fetched plan to \\"cross into India and march up the Ganges and capture Delhi and thus link up with Pakistan.\\" This he called the \\"Niazi corridor theory\\" explaining: \\"It was a corridor that the Quaid-e-Azam demanded and I will obtain it by force of arms\\".The Betrayal of East Pakistan. A.A.K Niazi In a plan he presented to the central government in June 1971, he stated in his own words that \\"I would capture Agartala and a big chunk of Assam, and develop multiple thrusts into Indian Bengal. We would cripple the economy of Calcutta by blowing up bridges and sinking boats and ships in Hooghly River and create panic amongst the civilians. One air raid on Calcutta would set a sea of humanity in motion to get out of Calcutta\\".Online snippets of Niazi's comments A journalist from the Dawn newspaper had observed him thus: When I last met him on 30 September 1971, at his force headquarters in Kurmitola, he was full of beans. From the mass of evidence coming before the War Enquiry Commission from witnesses, both civil and military, there is little doubt that Niazi came to acquire a bad reputation in sex matters, and this reputation has been consistent during his postings in Sialkot, Lahore and East Pakistan. The allegations regarding his indulgence in the export of Pan by using or abusing his position in the Eastern Command and as Commander of his command also prima facie appear to be well-founded. ==References== ==External links== * Pakistan: Independence and Military Succession * Video of Surrender By General Niazi, A.

She was a first cousin of Jacqueline Onassis and Lee Bouvier Radziwill. She is best known for her participation (along with her mother, with whom she lived) in the 1975 documentary film Grey Gardens by Albert and David Maysles. ==Early life== Beale was born in New York City, the only daughter of Phelan Beale, a lawyer, and Edith Ewing Bouvier (known as \\"Big Edie\\"), the daughter of Phelan‚Äôs law partner, John Vernou Bouvier Jr. She was born at 1917 Madison Avenue (now the site of the Carlyle Hotel). She had two brothers, Phelan Beale, Jr. and Bouvier Beale, and had a privileged upbringing. Beale attended The Spence School and graduated from Miss Porter's School in 1935. Known as \\"Little Edie,\\" Beale was a member of the Maidstone Country Club of East Hampton. She had her debut at the Pierre Hotel on New Year's Day 1936. The New York Times reported on the event, where she wore a gown of white net appliqued in silver with a wreath of gardenias in her hair. While Beale was young, her mother pursued a singing career, hiring an accompanist and playing at small venues and private parties. In the summer of 1931, Phelan Beale separated from his wife, leaving Big Edie, then 35 years old, dependent on the Bouviers for the care of herself and children. In 1946, he finally obtained a divorce, notifying his family by telephone from Mexico. In her youth, Little Edie was a clothes model at Macy's in New York and Palm Beach, Florida. She later claimed to have dated J. Paul Getty and to have once been engaged to Joe Kennedy, Jr. (although in reality she only met him once).Grey Gardens DVD (2009). HBO. Audio commentary with executive producers Michael Sucsy, Lucy Barzun Donnelly and Rachael Horovitz. During the 1961 inauguration of John F. Kennedy, she told Joe Kennedy, Sr. that, if young Joe had lived, she would have been First Lady instead of Jackie. Once, Beale ran away to Palm Beach, where she was found by her father and brought home. From 1947 to 1952, she lived in the Barbizon Hotel for Women. When she was in her late 30s, Beale developed alopecia totalis which caused her body hair to fall out and prompted her to wear her signature headscarves. Beale's cousin, John Davis, claims Beale once climbed a tree at the house and set her hair on fire, suggesting Beale might have contributed to her own baldness. ==Grey Gardens== Grey Gardens, Joseph Greenleaf Thorp, architect, 1897. Landscape by Anna Gilman (Mrs. Robert C.) Hill. On July 29, 1952, Beale returned to live with her mother in the East Hampton estate Grey Gardens.https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/22/archives/grey- gardens-cinema-verite-or-sideshow-cin-ma-verit-or-sideshow.html In October 1971, police raided Grey Gardens and found the 28-room house \\"full of litter, rife with the odor of cats and in violation of various local ordinances\\". The Suffolk County, New York, Board of Health prepared to evict Beale and \\"Big Edie\\" due to the unsafe condition of the property. Following the publicity, Beale's family paid a reported $30,000 to refurbish the property, settle back taxes, and give Beale and \\"Big Edie\\" a stipend (the two women's trust fund income had run out some years before). The eviction proceedings were dropped. Beale's cousin Lee Radziwill hired documentary filmmakers Albert and David Maysles in 1972 to work on a film about the Bouvier family. At the outset, the brothers filmed Beale and \\"Big Edie\\". The original film project was not completed, and Radziwill kept the footage that had been shot of the Beales. However, the Maysles brothers were fascinated by the strange life the two women led. After raising funds for film and equipment on their own they returned and filmed 70 more hours of footage with Beale and Big Edie. The resulting film, entitled Grey Gardens (1976), is widely considered a masterpiece of the documentary genre. It was later adapted as a 2006 musical of the same name, in which the characters Lee and Jackie Bouvier appear as visiting children in retrospect. An HBO television movie based upon the documentary and surrounding story of the Beales' lives, also called Grey Gardens, appeared in 2009. == Later life == After her mother's death in February 1977, Beale attempted to start a cabaret career at age 60 with eight shows (January 10‚Äì14, 1978) at Reno Sweeney, a Manhattan night spot at 126 W. 13th Street. The club kept the bad reviews from her (The New York Times, on January 12, 1978, called it \\"a public display of ineptitude\\"), and she faced two new audiences per night, even through a fever and recent cataract surgery. She continued to live in Grey Gardens for about two years, according to her mother's wishes, holding out against selling the house as a teardown. In 1979, she sold the mansion to Ben Bradlee, then the executive editor of The Washington Post. Beale moved to Bal Harbour, Florida, in late 1997. She was found dead in her apartment on Monday, January 14, 2002, aged 84. The inscription on her grave marker reads: \\"I came from God. I belong to God. In the end‚ÄîI shall return to God.\\" ==Legacy== Interest in the Beales' story has resulted in a variety of publishing and media projects and various mentions in popular culture. These include: * The original 1975 Maysles brothers' documentary, Grey Gardens. * The musical Grey Gardens: A New Musical debuted off-Broadway in March 2006, starring Christine Ebersole, and played on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theatre November 2, 2006 ‚Äì July 28, 2007 for 300+ performances. Little Edie was portrayed in the first act by actresses Sara Gettelfinger (off-Broadway) and Erin Davie (on Broadway). Ebersole played Little Edie in the second act. Ebersole and Mary Louise Wilson won Tony Awards. * Grey Gardens, the 2009 Emmy Award‚Äìwinning made-for-television movie for HBO, starred Jessica Lange as \\"Big Edie\\" and Drew Barrymore as \\"Little Edie\\". It was directed and co-written by filmmaker Michael Sucsy. Lange won an Emmy for her performance. * In the 2011 episode of 30 Rock titled \\"Mrs. Donaghy,\\" Liz Lemon (portrayed by Tina Fey) does an impression of Drew Barrymore's impersonating Little Edie. * Musician Rufus Wainwright wrote a song titled \\"Grey Gardens\\", which appears on his 2001 album Poses. The song's narrative is partly composed of references to the 1975 documentary Grey Gardens and to Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice (or to Luchino Visconti's film of the same title). * The Spring 2010 issue of the online literary journal BigCityLit features a pantoum by American poet Joel Allegretti called \\"The Belles of Grey Gardens\\", which is made up entirely of dialogue from the Maysles' documentary. * In a February 2013 episode of RuPaul's Drag Race, Little Edie was imitated by drag queen Jinkx Monsoon in the Snatch Game challenge. Inspired by that episode, Jinkx Monsoon and Peaches Christ mounted a live 90-minute musical drag parody of Grey Gardens titled Return to Grey Gardens. * The first episode of the IFC mockumentary series Documentary Now! spoofed Grey Gardens in 2015 with Fred Armisen and Bill Hader as mother and daughter in Sandy Passage. * A documentary film, \\"That Summer\\" was released in 2018. It contains the \\"prequel\\" footage to Grey Gardens, filmed in 1972. * Episode 9 of season 3 of the series Gilmore Girls opens with mother and daughter Lorelai and Rory watching the Grey Gardens documentary, admiring the Edies and saying that will be them in a few years. ==References== ==Further reading== * My Life at Grey Gardens: Thirteen Months and Beyond by Lois Wright (2005). . * Grey Gardens: From East Hampton to Broadway, a documentary by Albert Maysles about the making of the musical Grey Gardens. ==External links== * * Category:1917 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American female dancers Category:Dancers from New York (state) Category:Female models from New York (state) Category:Beale family Category:Bouvier family Category:Disease- related deaths in Florida Category:Miss Porter's School alumni Category:People from East Hampton (town), New York Category:People with alopecia universalis Category:Spence School alumni Category:Writers from New York City ","title":"Edith Bouvier Beale"},{"id":"1443986","text":"William McCombe Callaghan (August 8, 1897 ‚Äì July 8, 1991) was a United States Navy officer who served as the first captain of the battleship Fowler, G.

When Callaghan saw the broken body of his sworn enemy lying upon his ship, he saw him not as an enemy, but simply as a man.\\" At a 1998 reunion of Missouri veterans, many of those present who had served during World War II felt that, on reflection, their captain had acted correctly.

He was inducted in the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988.Whiting, Robert, \\"Kawakami's philosophy as manager never wavered\\", Japan Times, 28 November 2013, p. 16, retrieved 28 November 2013 Nicknamed \\"The Emperor\\" because he was the most dominant pitcher in Japan during his prime, Kaneda holds numerous Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) career records. He won 400 games despite being on a horrific team, the Kokutetsu Swallows, for most of his career. About 90% of his 400 career wins came with the Swallows. Kaneda batted and threw left-handed. ==Career== Kaneda was born, in Heiwa, Aichi Prefecture. He quit high school in 1950, and joined the Kokutetsu Swallows (current Tokyo Yakult Swallows) in the middle of 1950. The Swallows were a very weak team at that point in Japanese baseball. Kaneda quickly became recognized as the best pitcher in Japan for his fastball and trademark drop curve. Kaneda also had terrible control during the first few years of his career, walking over 190 batters in 1951 and 1952. Although his control got better as his career progressed, he eventually established the all-time Japanese record for walks. The speed gun was not introduced to Japan until after Kaneda had retired, but he claims that the velocity of his fastball reached 110 mph during his prime. In Kaneda's rookie year, player Masayasu Kaneda (no relation) from the Osaka Tigers complained that Kaneda's pitches appeared too fast because the mound was set too close to the batter's box. The game was stopped as the umpire measured the distance with a tape measure; the mound was found to be set the correct distance away from the batter's box. In later years, Noboru Aota admitted Kaneda's fastball was faster than Eiji Sawamura's one. Despite the poor team surrounding him, Kaneda won 20 or more games for 14 straight seasons, including amassing 31 wins in 1958. However, despite marking an ERA under 2.00 for many of his seasons with the team, Kaneda still lost over at least 10 games a year in his first 15 professional seasons, including six seasons where he lost 20 or more games. (While Kaneda was on the team, the Swallows didn't finish with a .500 record until 1961, and even then only finished in third place in the Central League.) He pitched a no-hitter against the Osaka Tigers in September 1951, and a perfect game against the Chunichi Dragons on August 21, 1957. This was the fourth perfect game in Japanese professional baseball history. In this game, he suffered from a stomach ache, and Dragons took a long timeout to protest for the call in ninth with one out. After timeout, he told \\"Only 6 strikes, so you guys get ready to go home.\\" to his teammates, and he had done it. In the 1958 season opener, Kaneda struck out Yomiuri Giants rookie Shigeo Nagashima in all four of his at bats. He did the same in 1959 against the Giants' Sadaharu Oh in Oh's first professional game. Kaneda's massive workload and overuse of the curveball caused massive amounts of pain in his pitching arm during the last few years of his career; he eventually developed an underhanded changeup during his later years. In 1965, Kaneda became a free agent and joined the Yomiuri Giants. Kaneda contributed to the teams' nine- year league championship streak, and retired in 1969, after marking his 400th win. His jersey number, 34, was retired by the Giants in 1970. Notable NPB records Kaneda holds include: complete games (365), wins (400), losses (298), strikeouts (4490), innings pitched (5,526), and walks (1,808). With 82 career shutouts, he is only one behind Victor Starffin for most all-time in NPB.Wilbert, Warren N. The Shutout in Major League Baseball: A History (McFarland, 2013), p. 108. He also hit the most home runs of any Japanese pitcher (36), and is one of the few pitchers that played in over 1,000 games. He led the league in strikeouts 10 times, victories three times, ERA three times, and won the Eiji Sawamura Award three times. He also held the NPB record for career ejections (eight times), before being passed by Tuffy Rhodes in 2005. ==Post-retirement== Kaneda worked as a commentator before being called upon to manage the Lotte Orions (currently known as the Chiba Lotte Marines) from 1973 to 1978, and again from 1990 to 1991. The Orions won the Japan Series championship in 1974, with Kaneda's younger brother, Tomehiro, pitching for the Orions and winning the MVP award. The Orions used uniforms designed by Kaneda for 19 seasons. In 1978, Kaneda founded the Meikyukai, one of the two Japanese baseball halls of fame. The Meikyukai honors players born during the Sh≈çwa period (1926‚Äì1988).

It contains the Centro Galleria, Perth's second-largestCentro Galleria , about-australia.com commercial shopping centre, constructed in 1994. The Morley bus station is near the Centro Galleria. From the late 1950s, Morley (originally known as Morley Park) began to develop as a major shopping and commercial centre. The name Morley began appearing on maps around the turn of the twentieth century and was adopted when the Morley Park Estate was subdivided for urban development after the First World War. The most likely explanation for its use is that it commemorates Charles William Morley, who is known to have farmed in the area during the 1860s and 1870s. ==History== The Morley area was in the early days of the Swan River Colony developed with agriculture. The area was originally known as Morley Park. In 1929 a landowner progress association petitioned the Bayswater Road Board for improved roads and lighting for improved transport of produce to markets. Commercial icons appeared in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the Wirrina Drive In, the Morley Park Hotel and the Boans department store. Parallel with the commercial growth, a settlement program resulted in the residential development of Morley. This was achieved through a series of town planning schemes undertaken by Margaret Feilman, the consultant town planner to the Shire of Bayswater. These schemes especially catered to the needs of the home building companies whose style of large scale development was a new phenomenon of the 1960s. Tonkin Highway was constructed through Morley in 1984, bisecting the suburb. After Boans burnt down in 1986, the Galleria Shopping Centre was built, opening in 1994. In 2015 the City of Bayswater adopted an activity centre plan for the improvement of the Morley commercial precinct. It aims to build upon the strengths already present in the City Centre and promote an improved street interface with the Galleria Shopping Centre; Progress Street as the Centre's Main Street; and an enhanced Morley bus station. ==Facilities== Morley Recreation Centre facilitates various sporting activities, such as indoor soccer, basketball, badminton, netball,http://www.morley.ymca.org.au/Team-Sports-%281%29.aspx roller skating and roller derby. Teams compete in weekly matches and winners receive trophies at the end of each season. ==Education== Primary schools in Morley: *Hampton Park Primary School (independent public school) *Infant Jesus Primary School (private catholic school) *Morley Primary School (independent public school) *Weld Square Primary School (public school) High schools in Morley: *Hampton Senior High School (independent public school) *John Forrest Secondary College (independent public school) Morley Senior High School is located in the nearby suburb of Noranda. ==Notable people== Australian test cricketer Michael Hussey, singer Samantha Jade and Victorian Bushranger cricketer David Hussey were all raised in Morley. ==References== ==External links== * City of Bayswater website Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia Category:Suburbs in the City of Bayswater ","title":"Morley, Western Australia"},{"id":"1444005","text":"Pavla Brantalova is a female bodybuilder and session wrestler born in the Czech Republic in 1977.

He was murdered in 1497. He was the brother of Cesare, Gioffre, and Lucrezia Borgia. Giovanni, commonly known as Juan (or sometimes, Joan), is believed to be the eldest of the Pope's four children by Vannozza dei Cattanei,Christopher Hibbert: The Borgias and Their Enemies. Harcourt, Inc. 2008, p. 30Sarah Bradford: Cesare Borgia; His Life and Times. London, 1876, p. 17 but this is disputed. Due to the contents of a number of papal bulls issued after his murder, it is unclear whether Giovanni was born in 1474 or 1476. == Early life, marriage, and family== Disputation of St. Catherine by Pinturicchio in the Borgia Apartments. The mounted male figure on the far right may be a depiction of Juan. Giovanni Borgia was probably born in Rome to then-cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (later to become Pope Alexander VI), and his mistress, Vannozza dei Cattanei, who was married to Domenico da Rignano. Giovanni married Maria Enriquez de Luna, the Spanish betrothed of his deceased older half-brother, Pedro Luis, in September 1493. He was made 2nd Duke of Gandia, Duke of Sessa, Grand Constable of Naples, Governor of St. Peter's, and Gonfalonier and Captain General of the Church. Giovanni and Maria had three children: twins Juan de Borja y Enr√≠quez (known as Juan Borgia, father of Saint Francis Borgia), who became the 3rd Duke of Gand√≠a, and Francisca de Jes√∫s Borja, who became a nun at a convent in Valladolid. Their third child, Isabel de Borja y Enr√≠quez, was born after her father was killed; she grew up to be abbess of Santa Clara in Gandia. == Murder == Coat of arms of the dukes of Gand√≠a of the House of Borja or Borgia Borgia was murdered the night of 14 June 1497 near what later became the Piazza della Giudecca in the ghetto of Rome. Giovanni was last seen alive when he was leaving from a feast that his mother had in his honor at her villa with his other siblings Cesare, Lucrezia, and Gioffre; Gioffre's wife Sancha of Aragon, their cousin Juan Borgia Lanzol, and Vannozza's husband, Carlo Canale, were all in attendance. The next morning his horse came back without its rider and with one of the stirrups cut. He was reported missing. A search party found his body in the Tiber river with his throat slit, and about nine stab wounds on his torso. His grief-stricken father launched an intensive investigation into the murder, only to end it abruptly a week later. While the Orsini family had ample motive to kill Giovanni, it was later rumored that his younger brother Gioffre Borgia murdered him due to Giovanni's relationship with Gioffre's wife, Sancha. His richly-attired body was recovered from the Tiber with 30 golden ducats untouched in the purse at his belt. To the immense grief of the pope, this act occasioned the epigram by Sannazzaro on the pope as \\"fisher of men.\\" Borgia's only attendant was also slain, so there were no known witnesses.Sabatini, II.4. ==In popular culture== In most adaptations, he is referred to by his Spanish name, Juan. In Alexandre Dumas' Celebrated Crimes (1839), he is referred to as Francesco. In Mario Puzo's historical novel The Family, Giovanni Borgia's murder by his younger brother Geoffre is central to the drama and plot of the story. In the 2010 animated short film, Assassin's Creed: Ascendance, a fictionalised version of Juan's death is depicted at the hand of Cesare Borgia, who hires a prostitute to murder him. In the 2011 Showtime series, The Borgias, Juan is played by David Oakes. In this adaptation he is younger than Cesare, and is killed by him in the second season of the series, in \\"World of Wonders\\". In the 2011 French/German series, Borgia, Juan is played by French actor Stanley Weber. He is a main character in the first season and dies in that season's finale \\"The Serpent Rises\\". In this adaptation, he is the eldest child of Rodrigo and Vannozza, and his murder is perpetrated primarily by Lucrezia‚Äîwith the help of her lover, Pedro Caldes. Both portrayals depict Juan as haughty, selfish, and cruel, with few redeeming features. The CBBC television show Horrible Histories features a song portraying the Borgia family, with Ben Willbond as Giovanni Borgia. == See also == *List of unsolved murders *Route of the Borgias ==Notes== ==External links== * Borja ‚Äì Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre * Borja o Borgia * Diario Borja ‚Äì Borgia Tres siglos de Historia d√≠a a d√≠a Category:1475 births Category:1497 deaths Category:15th-century Italian people Category:Captains General of the Church Category:Condottieri Category:Deaths by stabbing in Italy 202 Giovanni Borgia, 2nd Duke of Gandia Category:Illegitimate children of popes Category:Italian murder victims Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:Male murder victims Category:People from Rome Category:Pope Alexander VI Category:Unsolved murders in Italy ","title":"Giovanni Borgia, 2nd Duke of Gand√≠a"},{"id":"1444026","text":"A fixed asset register (FAR) is nothing more than a list of fixed assets that belong to an entity.

Today, it has become one of the most recognizable brand logos in the world, and the most valuable, having a worth of $26 billion alone. Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight founded Nike on January 25, 1964, as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS). Upon changing its name to Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971, the company adopted the Swoosh as its official logo the same year. Carolyn Davidson, a student at Portland State University during the time Knight taught there, created the logo, attempting to convey motion in its design. The logo has undergone minor changes from its original design in 1971, today most commonly seen as a solo swoosh, although for much of its history, the logo incorporated the NIKE name alongside the Swoosh. Over the years, the orange and white color palette has traditionally been used on the logo, although most recently a solid black swoosh has gained significant popularity. The Swoosh has appeared alongside the trademark \\"Just Do It\\" since 1988. Together, these two make up the core of Nike's brand, and has been the face of the company, with many high-profile athletes and sports teams around the world sporting the logos. ==History== The Nike Swoosh corporate trademark was created in 1971 by Carolyn Davidson while she was a graphic design student at Portland State University. Davidson started as a journalism major but switched to design after taking a design course to \\"fill an empty elective.\\" She attained a bachelor's in graphic design in 1971. It was here that she met Phil Knight, who was at the time teaching accounting classes at the university. Knight had overheard that Davidson was in search of extra funds in order for her to take oil painting classes, so he offered to pay Davidson to do some freelance work for his company, then named Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS). Knight offered to pay Davidson $2 per hour (about $14 per hour today) for the work that she completed. For seven years after its founding in 1964, BRS primarily imported Onitsuka Tiger brand running shoes from Japan. In 1971, Knight decided to launch his own brand of shoes, which would first appear as cleated shoes for football or soccer, and had a factory in Mexico ready to make the shoes. All Knight needed was a \\"stripe\\"‚Äîthe industry term for a shoe logo‚Äîto go with his new brand, so he approached Davidson for design ideas. He had asked Davidson to make sure the stripe conveyed motion and did not look similar to the three stripes of Adidas. Over the ensuing weeks, she created at least a half-dozen marks and gathered them together to present to Knight, Bob Woodell and Jeff Johnson (two BRS executives) at the company's home office, at the time located in Tigard, Oregon. The logo designed by Davidson for Nike in 1971, for which she was paid $35. The emblem, with some later revisions (right), has remained as the company logo since then, becoming one of sport's most iconic images They ultimately selected the mark now known globally as the Swoosh. \\"I don't love it,\\" Knight told her, \\"but I think it will grow on me\\". Once the choice was made, Davidson asked for more time in order to refine the work she had done on the Swoosh; however, Knight stated that the company had production deadlines to meet and needed the logo as soon as possible. For her services, the company paid her $35 ($206 in 2015 dollars), citing that she worked 17.5 hours on creating the Swoosh, although Davidson claims that she is certain she worked more hours on the design. The Swoosh was officially trademarked on June 18, 1971 and in June 1972, at the U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, Nike's first official track shoe, the Nike Cortez, was released to the athletes sporting the fresh new Swoosh. Davidson continued working for Blue Ribbon Sports (it officially became Nike, Inc. in 1972) until the design demands of the growing company exceeded one person's capacity. In 1976, the company hired its first external advertising agency, John Brown and Partners, and Davidson went on to work on other clients' needs. In September 1983, Knight gave Davidson a golden Swoosh ring with an embedded diamond and 500 shares of Nike stock (which have since split into 32,000 shares) to express his gratitude. Of the gift, Davidson says, \\"this was something rather special for Phil to do, because I originally billed him and he paid that invoice.\\" Davidson went on to be known as \\"The Logo Lady\\". She claims to this day that she is not a millionaire but lives comfortably. Davidson retired in 2000 and now engages in hobbies and volunteer work, including at the Ronald McDonald House at Legacy Emanuel Hospital & Health Center in Oregon. ==Design and color== The logo at the former Highbury Stadium, London. Nike co-founder Phil Knight was adamant that his company's new logo be a simple design that is fluid and conveys motion and speed. The logo is also said to symbolize the wing of the Greek goddess of victory, Nike. When first released, the design was displayed in a variety of colors in order to stand out on the track from other shoe manufacturers. Nike primarily used the red and white color palette on its logo for much of its history. The red is meant to exemplify passion, energy, and joy, while the white color represents nobility, charm and purity. Until 1994, the official Nike corporate logo for Nike featured the name \\"NIKE\\" in Futura Bold, all-caps font, cradled within the Swoosh. In 1995, Nike began using the stand-alone Swoosh as its corporate logo as a form of debranding, and continues to use it that way today, while also using a simple black color palette for the Swoosh. == Brand image == One of the most recognized brand logos in the world, the Swoosh has made Nike one of the most successful brands and most highly valued. The Nike brand alone is valued at $26 billion. Nike spends about 10% of its annual revenue on advertising and promotions. Harvard Business School professor Stephen A. Greyser has described the logo as \\"the living, vibrant symbol of the firm\\". Nike has made great use of the Swoosh logo in athlete endorsements. The endorsements of Romanian tennis player Ilie NƒÉstase and distance runner Steve Prefontaine kicked off Nike's brand sponsorships and today they endorse hundreds of athletes. Nike's endorsements of Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Kobe Bryant in basketball, Cristiano Ronaldo in soccer, Tiger Woods in golf, and Rafael Nadal in tennis are among the 15 biggest athlete endorsement deals in sports history. == Nike's heritage == Nike is the winged goddess of victory in Greek mythology, who sat at the side of Zeus in Olympus. Nike is said to have presided over history's earliest battlefields as she flew around rewarding the victors with glory and fame, symbolized by a wreath of leaves. She was often found next to the goddess of wisdom, Athena, who is said to never put up with defeat. In statues and paintings Nike is represented as a woman with wings dressed in a flowing robe, with a wreath in her outstretched hand. To represent her role as the messenger of victory, she is shown with the staff of Hermes. In Athens, the statue of Nike is portrayed without wings and is called Nike Apteron (Wingless Victory). Nike's wings were removed from the statue so she would not fly away, as the Athenians believed doing so would indicate her permanent stay in the city. A sculpture of Nike at Ephesus is said to contain the Swoosh in the flowing dress, but there is no evidence this is the origin of the design. == Controversy == In May 2010, a report was written where Nike copied the Swoosh logo from the cigarette brand Newport. The comparison was made, because Newport was introduced in 1957 and used a logo they call the \\"spinnaker\\", while Nike was formed on January 25, 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports by Bill Bowerman and Philip Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. in 1978. The Nike swoosh is a logo design created in 1971 by Carolyn Davidson, over a decade after Newport cigarettes were launched. Despite some claims, there has never been found any specific evidence that Nike stole the logo from Newport. In 2006, Lorillard (the previous owner of Newport) and Nike sued graphic designer Ari Saal Forman after he released his Ari Menthol 10s shoes, which combined the design of the Nike Air Force 1 with Newport's spinnaker and colors. According to Forman, the shoes were \\"dedicated to the two brands who have taken the most and given the least.\\" As a result of the lawsuit, Forman is not legally allowed to own a pair of Menthol 10s. ==References== Category:Commercial logos Category:Nike brands Category:Symbols introduced in 1971 ","title":"Swoosh"},{"id":"1444048","text":"Yi Ku (29 December 1931 16 July 2005) was a Korean prince who was head of the House of Yi from 1970 until 2005.

Although Dumangas is less than an hour drive from the port city of Iloilo, it continues to retain its provincial standing, but whose commitment to certain fundamental community values and innovation has produced many in the way of medicine, law and education. The town is one of the seven first class municipalities in Iloilo and the richest and the most populated municipality in the fourth district of Iloilo. It is also a fast-growing municipality and expected to become a component city in the future. ==Barangays== Dumangas is politically subdivided into 45 barangays. * Burgos-Regidor (Poblacion) * Aurora-del Pilar (Poblacion) * Buenaflor-Embarcadero (Poblacion) * Lopez Jaena-Rizal (Poblacion) * J.M.

Thinking that he was asked of the name of the trees under which the Spaniard was resting, he answered in crude Spanish \\"dos manggas\\", meaning two mango trees. Another version which is the most probable, tells about Legazpi's Spanish-French officer and a creole who was one of the leaders of the foraging party who come to Araut. Having seen mango trees growing abundantly in the place, he gave a verbal report to the Adelantado upon is return to Cebu mentioning \\"Sitio Du Manggas\\" as the place they got plenty of food. Being a creole and was accustomed to substandard Spanish he mispronounced the Spanish article \\"de\\" as \\"du\\" thus, the place was identified and recorded as \\"Pueblo de Dumangas\\". ==Climate== ==History== ===Early settlement=== The old village of Dumangas started as a settlement of old Malays who made a clearing along the Talaguis River and established a community sometime in the 12th or 13th century. The community was called Araut ( variant of Jalaud ), the term is derived from the old Malayan word laut meaning sea or pa-laut or laud which means towards the sea. When the Spaniards arrived in Panay they found the coastal village of Araut, a thriving agricultural community. During the first few years of Spanish arrival in the Islands , the Spaniards established their first settlement in Leyte and Butuan. The Spanish settlement in Cebu was often attacked by Portuguese invaders and aside from that the Island of Cebu had a shortage of food provision to support the Spaniards. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, sent various expeditions to look for food and to find another settlement other than Cebu to evade the attacks from the Portuguese explorers. The royal treasurer to the Philippines Guido de Lavezaris writes (June 5, 1569) to King Philip II of Spain that the danger of Portuguese attack leads the Spaniards to remove their camp to Panay. The governor general Miguel Lopez de Legazpi sent Mateo del Sanz who landed in Araut (now Dumangas) in June of 1565 and ‚Äúfound many provisions and the inhabitants hospitable‚Äù. The colonizers were able to get enough food supplies and went back to Cebu to report to Legazpi what they had found.http://vicilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-2.html ===Hispanization=== In June 1565, Captain Luis de la haya left Cebu for Araut. With him was Fray Juan de Alva, an Agustinian friar ordered by his superiors to preach and to convert the people of Araut to Christianity. The inhabitants then were animistic believers. Like other pre-Hispanic Filipinos, they worshipped environmental spirits, but Fray de Alva did not find much difficulty in converting the natives, to the new faith. Of the early Agustinian fathers who came to Panay, he was the first to learn the native tongue which was Kinaray-a, hence and as such he can relate to the people easily. Shortly he was able to initiate the construction, of a church with the help of the coverts in 1572. In the 16th century, Araut gained prominence, being the first community trodded by the Spaniards when they came to Panay. It was also the first town in Panay to have received the blessing of Christianity and first to have a temporary church erected. In 1605, thirty years after it was established as a town (founded in 1572) the Spanish clergy, who then ruled the community together with the cabeza de barangay, changed the name Araut to Dumangas. Fifty nine years later the church was again razed to the ground. Bair and Robertson recorded: \\" it was Saturday March 15, 1687 the church and the house in Dumangas was burned. Burned together with the edifices were offering (actually tributes of natives) from Cebu and other Visayan Island and 2,000 canvas of rice which was stored in the hours.\\" ===Dumangas and world trade=== Before the opening of Iloilo to foreign trade, Dumangas have produced huge quantities of the rice. In 1842, the rice shipped from Iloilo were drawn mainly from the vast plains of Dumangas and its neighboring towns. The opening of the port of Iloilo to foreign trade in 1855 paved way for further progress in Dumangas. The town had indirectly shared on the lucrative trade. Sugar became the main bulk of production and export which were produced in farms called haciendas. Local sugar planters built sugar mills for local production of muscovado sugar sold to Chinese merchants. ===Revolutionary period of Dumangas=== When revolution broke out in Luzon in 1896, the revolutionaries spread quickly throughout the country. However, most of the fighting were centered in Luzon. Alarmed by the possibility that the revolution might spread to Visayas and Mindanao, Colonel Ricardo Monet, the Commander of the Spanish Forces in the Visayas came to Dumangas in the early part of 1898 to recruit volunteers to help defend the colonial government. Colonel Monet appointed Don Mariano Dolar better known as Tente Mariano to organize the voluntaries but the latter primer, the young and brave Don Quintin Salas and was asked to organize the cuerpos voluntaries of Dumangas. Unknown to Spanish authorities, the volunteers organized by Quintin Salas were trained to be revolutionaries. Pursuant to agreed points of the revolution, simultaneous with other towns, Dumangas, \\"Cried for Freedom and Liberty\\" on October 28, 1898. They easily subdued the civil guards in the town of Dumangas, Quintin Salas and his rayadillo army continued to liberated leaving only the capital ‚Äì Iloilo City. On December 24, 1898 the Spanish Colonial Government headed by Don Diego de los Rios surrendered Iloilo City to the revolutionaries. Upon the surrender of the Spaniards a revolutionary government was established in the province and Don Simon Deocampo was appointed administrator of Dumangas. On December 28, 1989, four days capitulation of the Spaniards to the rebel forces of Iloilo, the American troops under Gen. Marcus Miller arrived. The American Armanda was stranded at Iloilo Bay for 45 days for Iloilo government did not allow them to land unless approved by Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. This incident was known in history as \\" Iloilo Fiasco \\". The Filipino ‚Äì American hostilities broke out in Manila on February 4, 1989 and on February 11, the American forces bombarded Iloilo City. Due to inadequate arms, the Ilonggo revolutionaries retreated from the city. Slowly the towns of Iloilo fell in the hands of the Americans. When the American soldiers reached Dumangas, they made the Dumangas church, as their headquarters. They experienced fierce retaliations from the rayadillo in Dumangas led by Col. Quintin Salas. There were ambushes initiated by Salas and His rayadillo in Sitio Ambacan in barrio Calao with Sgt. Salvador Dolar as in- charge and at Lublub bridge under the leadership of Lts. Juan Decolongon and Felipe Togonon resulting to the death of a certain Capt. Smith of the American Army. The ambuscades if the rayadillo angered the Americans that they burned the whole poblacion. It was because of the said arson that no colonial houses in Dumangas can be seen today. When Don Simon Deocampo, the revolutionary government administrator of Dumangas, surrendered to the Americans in the late 1899, the administration of the town was changed to Provisional American Military Government under the leadership of Frederick Wilson. Even with the establishment of the military government, Col. Salas with the support of the Dumangasanon continued to defy the Americans. After realizing that he was left alone the battlefield because his companion had already accepted the Benovolent Assimilation Policy of the Americans, he surrendered on October 4, 1901 earning the title as the \\" Bravest Ilonggo Revolutionary\\". After the surrender of Salas, a civil administration was established. With it, the Dumangasanon accepted the American colonial rule and peace was restored. ===American colonial administration=== The surrender of Col. Salas to the Americans marked the restoration of peace in Dumangas. Dumangasanon who left the town during the war started to return and rehabilitated their war torn lives and livelihood. Since there was no fully constituted authority to administer the town, a committee was formed headed by Don Urbano Dolar, who simultaneously organized a police force to maintain peace and order. In 1903, Dumangas was fused with Barotac Nuevo for the third time, with the seat of administration in the former. However, due to irregularities committed by some elected official, the seat was transferred to Barotac Neuvo a year after. The two towns were again separated in 1910 after the people of Dumangas led by Vicente Doronila petitioned the colonial government for autonomy. It was granted and Doronila became the Municipal President. ===Japanese occupation=== After forty years of peace and freedom, the Filipinos and Dumangasanons in particular were again faced with another war ‚Äì against the Japanese signaled by the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 8, 1941. One by one, the island of the archipelago were subjugated by the Japanese. They reached Dumangas in 1942 and established garrison and a puppet government. Jose Dimzon was appointed Puppet Mayor and Tomasito Buenaflor as Chief of Police. These two persons had sacrificed a great deal to save numerous Dumangasanon from the cruelty of the Japanese. Even with the establishment of a puppet government, thelocal government of Dumangas continued to exist in concealment with Julito Diasnes Sr. as the town head. Tomas Confesor organized the Civil Resistance Movement and fought against the invaders. Many men of Dumangas were enlisted to the cause. As guerilla's they attacked the Japanese garrisons and undertook ambuscades. The people of the town left their homes and sought refuge in the interior barrios to escape the Japanese atrocities. These evacuations changed the dismal barrio life at the bank of the Halauod River; where most of the evacuees from the town proper and Iloilo City were concentrated. To lessen their fears and difficulties the people conducted sports tournament, dances and cockfights. Sitio Talauguis was transformed to an important business center, as it became a trading port of goods from Iloilo City, Negros, Guimaras and other towns of Iloilo. ===Philippine Republic=== After the war, the political arena in Dumangas was dominated by some pre ‚Äì war personalities and some new faces who have tried their luck in politics. One of them was Atty. Gaudencio Demaisip who has elected Congressman in 1948. In his capacity he brought many improvement in his native town. Politics then in Dumangas was the battleground for the bright, able and service oriented Dumangasanonn. Election after election, many successful Dumangasanon rose to prominence by occupying important government post. During their terms of office they labored hard to propel the town towards progress. Among them was Atty. Ramon Duremdes, who was apromising lawyer upon his entrance to the political sphere as mayor from 1960-1969. Atty. Duremdes administration was marked with numerous projects which helped uplift the economic and social status of his townsmates. Under his administration were the construction of the Dumangas Emergency Hospital, the Dacutan Wharf, barangay feeder roads and bridges among others. Duremdes love concern for Dumangas were manifested by the services he rendered and the developments he brought to the town. He bid for vice ‚Äì governorship in 1971 and won, the office he held up in 1992. When Mayor Duremdes transferred to the provincial Capital, the administration of the town was taken over by Jesus Decolongon Jr. by the virtue of his victory in the 1969 election. During is term he worked hard to further improve the town. Among his project was the rehabilitation of the public market, paving the streets, the construction of the hall of justice and many others. Mayor Decolongon was dubbed as the only mayor who served Dumangas for a quarter of a century. Another Dumangasanon came into limelight during the 1978 election, Dr. Narciso Dolar Monfort who was elected Congressman, a position he held up to the present (tough with interruption when he run for senator in 1982). He had brought marvelous improvements in Dumangas. It was through his initiative that two colleges were established in the town. In addition to these, were the establishment of a telephone system and waterworks, rehabilitation of roads, repair of bridges and schools to name a few. The landmark project he undertook was the construction of the coastal road connecting Dumangas to Iloilo City, shortening the travel time and consequently decongesting the traffic in the city. Congressman Monfort showed hid intense love for Dumangas through the unparalleled improvements he brought to the town which made life easier and comfortable. Mayor Danilo Deocampo is not being counted last in terms of improvements, in the town. Many projects of national funding were enacted through his efforts. His milestone project was rehabilitation of town market. Mayor Deocampo's sincerity and love for Dumangas is visible through the project he implemented. When Mayor Rolando Biaca Distura catapulted to power, tandemned with the leadership of Vice Mayor Rose Marie Duremdes- Doromal, a remarkable change visibly surfaced. Foremost is the consistent rally to address the five- old leadership focus namely: (1) Stability of peace and Order condition; (2) Improvement of the Delivery of the Basic Services Emphasizing on Health and Sanitation; (3) Economic Development Geared Towards Agricultural and Aquaculture Productivity; (4) Enhancement of Education Program; and (5) Protection and Preservation Ecology and Coastal Resources. Serving his second term now Mayor Distura proved his capability and extraordinary leadership and administrative skills. The municipal hall of Dumangas became one of the few municipal halls that are fully air conditioned aside from the numerous renovation and face- lifting of the 85- year old edifice. Agricultural development is enhanced by the rehabilitation of irrigation system, farm to market roads and technical support to farmers. Recently the PAGASA opened its Agro-Met in Dumangas that would benefit not only the farmers but the whole community as well. Mayor Distura with the help of Congressman Monfort, rehabilitated the town plaza making it a good place for recreation at day and a nice promenade at night. The auditorium was roofed securing the activities held in the place from rain. What have been enumerated are only few of the numerous programs and the projects of the present administration. The present administrations have carved a name for Dumangas through its achievement that gained national recognition. The town from second to the last for several years leaped to second place and third place in the Clean and Green Program of the Provincial Government. The town's Peace and Order Council became a Grand Slam winner for consistently topping the National Search for Outstanding Peace and Order Council of the Philippines. These are only a few of the numerous distinctions received by the town under the leadership of Mayor Distura.http://dumangas.gov.ph/about-us/history-of- dumangas ==Demographics== In the , the population of Dumangas, Iloilo, was people, with a density of . ==Infrastructure== === Wharf === The wharf in the Municipality of Dumangas is located at Barangay Dacutan, 6.2 km from the Poblacion area. This wharf serves as a landing area for pump boats and motor boats carrying fish, rice, salt, sugar, woods, etc. from Negros and Guimaras Islands to Dumangas and other part of Iloilo and vice versa. === Port === The Port of Dumangas is one of the major ports operating in the Province of Iloilo. It is located in Sitio Nalu-oyan at Barangay Sapao, Dumangas, Iloilo. Roll-on Roll-Off (RORO) Vessels carrying passengers and cargoes plying Dumangas, Iloilo ‚Äì Bacolod and vice versa are now operational. It also serves as an outlet for rice, sugar, fish products, etc. for central and eastern towns of Iloilo. === Municipal Slaughter House === Dumangas is one of the biggest poultry and livestock raising municipalities in the Province of Iloilo. A modern Slaughterhouse was established and constructed at Barangay Balabag, this Municipality to accommodate the bulk of poultry and livestock being slaughtered within the municipality. The slaughterhouse is strategically located in Barangay Balabag, which is accessible to other poultry-and livestock-raising municipalities such as Barotac Nuevo, Zarraga, Pototan and New Lucena. === Ice Plant === The Municipal Ice Plant was constructed beside the Municipal Slaughterhouse at Barangay Balabag. It is funded through the Department of Agriculture Regional Field Unit VI (DA-RFU VI) and the National Meat Inspection Commission (NMIC). Specifically, the DA-RFU VI had intended P1.5M for the Ice Plant building and the P5M from the NMIC for the Ice Plant equipment. Meat needs to reach its target market in good quality. The role of the Municipal Ice Plant is to ensure that the slaughterhouse operation will provide quality meat to the customers. At present, the Ice Plant was rented by local entrepreneur and is fully operational or at service to those who need its product. === Irrigation System === The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) for the purpose of increasing rice production among farmers, is maintaining irrigation system in the Municipality of Dumangas. 5,948.95 has. of rice land in the municipality are considered as irrigated areas. Portions of this area which cannot be reach by the irrigation system from the NIA has tube wells ‚Äútasok‚Äù as their source of water for irrigation. === Power === The Municipality is being supplied with electricity by the Iloilo Electric Cooperative II (ILECO II) sub-station located at Barangay Pagdugue, Dumangas, and Iloilo. Source of power from this sub-station is directly supplied by the NAPOCOR with a capacity of 5 M.V.A. (Mega Volt Amperes), which supplies the area of Dumangas, Zarraga and Barotac Nuevo. 100% of the barangays in the Municipality of Dumangas are connected to this electrical grid. === Water === The Municipality of Dumangas is being supplied with potable water by the Dumangas-Barotac Nuevo Water District (DBNWD) with its main office located at P.D. Monfort North, Dumangas, Iloilo. Water sources comes from 5 Pumping Stations located at Barangays Cali, P.D. Monfort North (Lublub), Calao, Sulangan and Pagdugue capacity were turn down due to el ni√±o phenomenon. Before Cali yields 81ps, 11lps, 15lps, 25lps now it‚Äôs well yields only 4lps, 6lps, 8lps, 10lps and additional of Pagdugue which 7lps respectively. Based on the capacity of these sources, there is insufficient supply of water due to higher demand, DBNWD put up a water filtration plant to augment the need of residents and future industries rises within the municipality and DBNWD utilized Jalaur River for its another source of potable water and will deliver 5,000 cum/day which is sufficient enough to the Municipality of Dumangas up to year 2021. Presently there is a total of 2,115 concessionaries in the municipality 2,072 of which are residential and institutional, 43 are commercial and industrial. Out of the 45 barangays in the Municipality of Dumangas, 39 Barangays are now being served by the DBNWD and there are still 6 barangays which are not served by DBNWD and are now in the priority plan of the Water District for expansion especially those areas identified for commercial and industrial purposes ==Historical sites and landmarks== * Saint Augustine Catholic Parish or Dumangas Church is of Gothic architectural style.

She was the president of the International Women's Air and Space Museum and a member of United Flying Octogenarians. ==Early life== She was born as Nancy Hopkins on May 16, 1909 in Washington, D.C.. Her father was Alfred Francis Hopkins I (1879‚Äì1955) who was born in Wayne, Pennsylvania and worked as an antique salesman. Alfred was said to be related to the Hopkins family that started Johns Hopkins University; Alfred's father was from Maryland, and his mother from Maine. Nancy's mother was Anne DeWolf Gibson (1877‚Äì1963). Nancy had a brother, Alfred Francis Hopkins II (1914‚Äì1988), an illustrator, and two sisters, Frances and Betty. She was a niece of Lady Nancy Astor and her uncle, Charles Dana Gibson (1867‚Äì1944), was the creator of the Gibson Girl. ==First flight== In November 1927 she had her first flight from Hoover Field in Arlington, Virginia, and in 1929 she received limited commercial license #5889 at Roosevelt Field in New York.

It contains the system initialization code and all built-in device drivers. It also loads the DOS kernel (IBMDOS.COM) and optional pre- loadable system components (like for disk compression or security), displays boot menus, processes configuration files (like CONFIG.SYS) and launches the shell (like COMMAND.COM). The file is part of IBM's PC DOS (all versions) as well as of DR DOS 5.0 and higher (with the exception of DR-DOS 7.06). It serves the same purpose as the file IO.SYS in MS-DOS, or DRBIOS.SYS in DR DOS 3.31 to 3.41. (For compatibility purposes with some DOS applications the IBMBIO.COM file name was briefly also used by the IBM version of OS/2 1.0, where it resembled the OS2BIO.COM file as used by Microsoft.) The file is located in the root directory of the bootable FAT-formatted drive/partition (typically C:\\\\\\\\) and typically has the system, hidden, and (since DOS 2.0 also the) read-only file attributes set. Under DR-DOS the file may be optionally password-protected as well. Under PC DOS, the system attribute is set in order to mark the file as non-movable, a restriction technically not necessary under DR-DOS. As IBMBIO.COM is a binary image containing executable code rather than a true COM-style program, the hidden attribute is set to keep the file from being accidentally invoked at the command prompt, which would lead to a crash. This is no longer necessary for DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, because under these systems the file is a fat binary also containing a tiny COM-style stub just displaying some version info and exiting gracefully when not being loaded by a boot sector. In the PC bootup sequence, the first sector of the boot volume contains a boot loader called the volume boot record (VBR) and is loaded into memory and executed. If this is a VBR of PC DOS before 3.3 it would load both system files into memory by itself. As the PC DOS VBR cannot mount the FAT file system, the system files have to be stored in the first directory entries on the disk and be located at fixed physical positions on the disk stored in consecutive sectors, conditions of which the SYS utility must take care of. If the loaded boot sector is a PC DOS 3.3 (or newer) VBR, the requirements are slightly relaxed. The system files still have to be stored in the first two root directory entries on the disk, but the VBR will use only the first entry to load the first three sectors of IBMBIO.COM into memory and transfer control to it. This part of IBMBIO.COM then contains a somewhat larger boot loader which: #Loads the rest of itself into memory. Before PC DOS 5.0 the system files still had to be stored at fixed physical positions on the disk and stored in consecutive sectors. With PC DOS 5.0 (and higher) this requirement was reduced down to the first three sectors of IBMBIO.COM only. #Loads the DOS kernel. The kernel is stored in IBMDOS.COM. #Initializes each default device driver in turn (console, disk, serial port, et cetera). At this point, the default devices are available. #Calls the DOS kernel's initialization routine. Under DR DOS 5.0 and higher, the first step is skipped, since a DR-DOS VBR is capable of mounting the FAT file system, locate the IBMBIO.COM (or DRBIOS.SYS) file anywhere in the root directory and load it into memory by itself. The filename of the IBMBIO.COM file to be loaded by the boot sector is stored in the boot sector rather than necessarily in the first root directory entry, likewise the filename of the IBMDOS.COM file to be loaded by IBMBIO.COM is stored in IBMBIO.COM itself rather than necessarily in the second directory entry on the disk. Also, similar to the IBMBIO.COM loader in the VBR, the IBMDOS.COM loader in IBMBIO.COM is capable of rudimentarily mounting the filesystem as well, therefore it is not necessary for the system files to be stored in the first two directory entries, to reside at fixed physical positions or be stored in consecutive sectors. Consequently, it is also no longer necessary to set the system attribute. Instead, the system files can be simply copied to the disk (without SYS), given a DR-DOS boot sector already resides on the disk. Microsoft sometimes calls this component the I/O system, but it is generally known as DOS BIOS (the DOS-related part of the Basic Input/Output System). The term BIOS was originally coined by Gary Kildall in 1975 for CP/M, but is also used to describe a similar component or layer in other operating systems by Digital Research, IBM, Microsoft and many others. In a more generic sense, some vendors refer to this portion as the RAM BIOS of operating systems such as DOS or CP/M in order to contrast it with the built- in ROM BIOS of a machine. ==See also== * List of DOS system files * Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) * RPLOADER ==Notes== ==References== Category:DOS files ","title":"IBMBIO.COM"},{"id":"1444072","text":"tubular Bridge The Conwy Suspension Bridge is a Grade I-listed structure and is one of the first road suspension bridges in the world. Located in the medieval town of Conwy in Conwy county borough, North Wales, it is now only passable on foot. The bridge is now in the care of the National Trust. It originally carried the A55(T) road from Chester to Bangor. Conwy suspension bridge ==History== Built by Thomas Telford, the suspension bridge spans the River Conwy next to Conwy Castle, a World Heritage Site. The bridge was built in 1822‚Äì26 at a cost of ¬£51,000 and replaced the ferry at the same point. It is in the same style as one of Telford's other bridges, the Menai Suspension Bridge crossing the Menai Strait. The original wooden deck was replaced by an iron roadway in the late nineteenth century and it was strengthened by adding wire cables above the original iron chains in 1903. The following year a walkway was added for pedestrian traffic. The bridge was superseded by a new road bridge built alongside and closed on 13/12/1958 Birmingham Post 15/12/58 when the Rt. Hon. Henry Brooke, MP performed the opening ceremony of the new bridge. Conwy Archive Service https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/57120372-07f8-3645-9ae4-0baf52779c15 The suspension bridge is now only used as a footbridge and has been owned by the National Trust since 1965 who make a small charge for entry. ==Description== Telford designed the bridge to match the adjacent Conwy Castle. The bridge deck is suspended by four tiers of two chains each (a fifth tier was added later) carried over castellated towers that have a central archway over the road with machicolation. The chains are anchored on the east side of the river by a freestone and concrete plinth while those on the western side are anchored to the eastern barbican of the castle and bedrock. Part of the castle had to be demolished during construction to anchor the suspension cables. ==See also== * Conwy Railway Bridge * List of bridges in Wales ==Notes== ==External links== * Conwy Suspension Bridge information at the National Trust Category:Bridges completed in 1826 Category:Bridges in Conwy County Borough Category:Buildings and structures in Conwy Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks Category:Suspension bridges in Wales Category:Bridges by Thomas Telford Category:National Trust properties in Wales Category:Tourist attractions in Conwy County Borough Category:Grade I listed bridges in Wales Category:Grade I listed buildings in Conwy County Borough Category:1826 establishments in Wales ","title":"Conwy Suspension Bridge"},{"id":"1444074","text":"Sean Brian Thomas Fitzpatrick (born 4 June 1963 in Auckland), is a former rugby union player who represented New Zealand, and is widely regarded as one of the finest players ever to come from that country.

As a primary school student he attended at Mt Carmel Primary (Auckland). ==Early rugby career== A product of the powerful Auckland provincial side, Fitzpatrick made his international debut as one of the \\"Baby Blacks\\" in the 1986 Test series in France. Although most of the regular starting fifteen for New Zealand had been suspended following the unauthorised \\"Cavaliers\\" tour of South Africa, the All Blacks won, and a number of new faces made their mark on the selectors. Despite this start, Fitzpatrick still went into the inaugural Rugby World Cup as second choice to captain Andy Dalton. However, Dalton had to withdraw from the early stages of the tournament due to injury, and although he recovered in time for the finals, Fitzpatrick kept his place in the team, leaving scrum-half David Kirk to skipper the side to victory against France in the final at Eden Park in Auckland. ==Captain of the All Blacks== In 1992 Fitzpatrick was awarded the captaincy of the All Blacks, a position he held until his retirement from test rugby. A first test match win against the Springboks since their return from isolation, plus series victories over a World XV and Ireland were dampened by the loss of the Bledisloe Cup in Australia. The biggest event of the rugby calendar in 1993 was the British Lions tour to New Zealand. The first test went narrowly to the All Blacks, with Grant Fox kicking a last minute 50-metre penalty to steal a win. This was avenged in the Second Test by the Lions with their highest-scoring Test win in New Zealand. In the third test, with Fitzpatrick faced the prospect of becoming only the second ever All Blacks captain to lead his team to a series defeat against the Lions. The side were 10‚Äì0 down at one point, but recovered to take the match convincingly and with it the series. Unwanted history could not be avoided on the end of season tour to Britain however, as England picked up a win over New Zealand at Twickenham. 1994 was another up and down season for the All Blacks. South Africa were defeated 2‚Äì0 with one game drawn. However, France caused a major upset by winning their series in New Zealand 2‚Äì0, the first and only European team so far to achieve this. By the time of the 1995 World Cup New Zealand had assembled a more formidable side. Ian Jones, Jeff Wilson, Andrew Mehrtens, Zinzan Brooke and Jonah Lomu had proved themselves as world-class players. New Zealand were most pundit's pre-tournament favourites. The All Blacks had convincingly defeated all opponents, the most remarkable being a semi-final against England, in which Lomu scored four tries. They met the hosts, South Africa in the final, who had stuttered through the early stages. South Africa won the tournament in extra time with a Joel Stransky drop goal. After storming through the first Tri Nations Series unbeaten, the All Blacks embarked upon a further three-match series in South Africa. The 1996 tour of South Africa was the first series win by a New Zealand side in South Africa. The 1996 All Blacks were one of the great teams in the history of the game, and the series win cemented their captain's place among the true greats. Continued success with Auckland in the NPC and the Auckland Blues in the new Super 12 continued in the following seasons, but it was clear that Fitzpatrick's days in the game were numbered. He was carrying an injury in the autumn of 1997, yet such was his status that coach John Hart thought it would be good for the other players to include him in the party. He made his 92nd and final test appearance on 29 November 1997 as a substitute in the 42‚Äì7 victory against Wales at Wembley. ==Legacy== Fitzpatrick was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby, in the 1997 New Year Honours. He remains an icon in New Zealand and is highly respected in South Africa. He was part of two of the finest frontrow combinations in rugby history, firstly with Steve McDowell and Richard Loe, and secondly with Craig Dowd and Olo Brown. == Honours == ;Auckland *National Provincial Championship 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 *Ranfurly Shield 1995, 1996 ;Blues *Super Rugby 1996, 1997 ;New Zealand *World Cup 1987 *Bledisloe Cup 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997 *Tri Nations 1996, 1997 *British and Irish Lions Series Victory 1993 * International record for most consecutive test matches (63 successive Tests between 1986 & 1996.)http://www.espn.co.uk/blogs/sport/story/305199.html#vuvoauQwGR5cEyIv.99 * International team record for most consecutive tests without defeat (23 test matches between 1987 and 1990)http://stats.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/records/team/most_consecutive_without_defeat.html?id=1;type=class ==References== ==External links== * Category:1963 births Category:New Zealand international rugby union players Category:Auckland rugby union players Category:Blues (Super Rugby) players Category:World Rugby Hall of Fame inductees Category:Living people Category:Officers of the New Zealand Order of Merit Category:New Zealand Roman Catholics Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:New Zealand people of Croatian descent Category:New Zealand people of Irish descent Category:Rugby union players from Auckland Category:Rugby union hookers Category:People educated at Sacred Heart College, Auckland ","title":"Sean Fitzpatrick"},{"id":"1444078","text":"The Presence is a fictional character in comic books published by DC Comics. The character debuted in More Fun Comics #52 (February 1940), and was created by Jerry Siegel and Bernard Baily. ==Publication history== The Presence first appears in More Fun Comics #52 as The Voice, the disembodied \\"Voice of the Presence\\" who empowers Jim Corrigan as the Spectre. It was created in this story by Jerry Siegel and Bernard Baily. ==Continuities== ===DC Comics / DC Universe=== The religious cosmology of the DC Universe is complex with many pantheons of deities co-existing alongside each other. It involves elements from multiple religions, mythologies, and modern created concepts such as the Endless. It is not always clear how the Abrahamic God fits into this‚Äîfor example, one particular Wonder Woman storyline by Eric Luke featured the Greek Titans fighting Abrahamic angels and Hindu gods. According to writer Greg Rucka in an interview about his Final Crisis: Revelations miniseries: \\"The sort of unspoken rule in the DCU is that God sits above all others\\". DC's superhero comics have always drawn upon Abrahamic religions for plot elements - the first appearance of \\"The Voice\\" was in the 1940 origin of the Spectre - but they have traditionally used surrogate concepts and names rather than refer to the Abrahamic deity directly. The comics are published under the Comics Code, a set of ethical guidelines drawn up in the 1950s in reaction to anti-comic book hysteria. The Code does not explicitly refer to God, but does say that \\"ridicule or attack on any religious or racial group is never permissible\\". Later revisions of the Code are phrased in terms of respecting religious beliefs and religious institutions, which may account for the comics' hesitancy when dealing with God. The lack of a central doctrine means that multiple \\"aspects\\" of God have been introduced by different writers. Significant examples of God surrogates include: The Voice The disembodied \\"Voice of the Presence\\" that spoke to and empowered Jim Corrigan as the Spectre in More Fun Comics #52. This is the most \\"active\\" version of God seen in the comic books. At one point, it even answers the Spectre's prayers by resurrecting the murdered Justice Society of America. When the Voice uttered the first word, it created \\"The Word\\", and it was already being tracked by Destiny in his book. The Hand An image of a hand appearing out of a nebula has been referenced numerous times in different DC Comics as a metaphor for the creator or the mystery that exists at the moment of universal creation, but the identity of the being whom the hand belongs to varied over time. It was first seen in Green Lantern vol. 2, #40. In Ganthet's Tale, it was revealed to be an illusion created by the Guardians to prevent investigation into the beginning of the universe.Green Lantern: Ganthet's Tale (March 1992) In Crisis on Infinite Earths #10, the Hand was turned into a predestination paradox as the hand of the villainous Anti-Monitor, who tried to rearrange all existence at its starting point, but failed.Crisis on Infinite Earths Volume 1 #10 (January 1986) The Hand was later seen reaching down from Heaven to embrace the invading Great Evil Beast, and stated to be the Hand of God by Etrigan.Swamp Thing Volume 2 #50 (1986) and Swamp Thing Volume 2 #76 (1988) This idea was visually called back to in DC Rebirth when a hand was seen reaching through time to change history.DC Universe: Rebirth #1 (May 2016) The true identity of the one manipulating this timeline was later revealed to be Doctor Manhattan. The Source The universal spirit from Jack Kirby's Fourth World cosmology. The Presence The unseen Abrahamic deity from Grant Morrison's fictional angel mythology. \\"Wally\\" A being claiming to be a manifestation of God who appears in the form of a young boy wearing a baseball hat. He first appears in Peter David's Linda Danvers/Supergirl series. A similar character later appears in the same author's Fallen Angel series. The Metaverse In Doomsday Clock #10, Doctor Manhattan deduced the DC Universe acts as \\"Metaverse\\" in constant change, and when Manhattan created the New 52 timeline, the Metaverse decided to fight back through Wally West. Whether this Metaverse is another form of the Presence himself remains to be confirmed. Other references Many references to similar beings appear to be obvious references to the Abrahamic supreme deity, but they are sometimes revealed to be other entities in the DC Universe. Some events from Abrahamic mythology are assumed to be a part of the fictional timeline of the DC Universe, but they often involve significant artistic license. For example, it was Eclipso (the original agent of God's wrath) who caused the mythological Great Flood, and it was his replacement, the Spectre, who unleashed the ten plagues on Egypt and later parted the Red Sea for Moses. The DC Universe is repeatedly shown to have been created via a variation of the Big Bang and human evolution through natural selection, yet paradoxically it also has a Garden of Eden and a version of Lilith, Adam's first wife (e.g., Peter David's Supergirl series). A hint to reconcile this occurs in a Sandman issue (reprinted in Fables and Reflections) in which Cain, Abel and Eve tell a story to Daniel Hall (grandson of Carter Hall) about their past and Abel says, \\"Oh, this whu-wasn't on Earth, thuh thu--\\" before being hushed. According to the series Lucifer, the Presence has vacated his creation, and his granddaughter Elaine Belloc has taken his place. However, the series does not address his relationship to the other aspects, and its events have largely been ignored by subsequent authors. In another story, the fallen archangel Asmodel invades the Silver City with an army of Bull-Host angels and Neron's demons to claim the Throne of God, only to be told by Zauriel that the Presence was not, in actuality, truly sitting upon a throne in the highest Heaven‚Äîhe was part of everything and everyone, part of Heaven and Earth and perhaps even Hell itself, and thus could never be dethroned by any rebel, be they mortal or angel. Asmodel is stripped of his angelic powers and condemned to Hell by the Presence to burn for eternity for his treachery. ===Vertigo Comics and DC Black Label=== In Hellblazer #64, it is said (but not confirmed) that Jesus was conceived from the archangel Gabriel's rape of a woman named Mary (\\"He'd committed rape behind a carpenter's in Nazareth, and a cycle of agony began that ended on a hill above Jerusalem...\\").Hellblazer #64 (April 1993) In Neil Gaiman's The Sandman mythos, the Presence's angelic servants are shown as residents of the Silver City, a place that is styled upon \\"Paradise\\" or \\"Heaven\\"; it was initially referred to as a separate place,Sandman #24 but has since been equated with Heaven. Within the city there are two towers. At the top of the tallest tower, the Tower of Unendingly High, is the Primum Mobile, the Throne of Light, where God resides. Angels can only approach the Throne if they are summoned there. The second, shorter tower contains an audience chamber where the voice of God, the Logos, can be heard. Sandman's God is, again, never explicitly referred to by name, and is in fact rarely mentioned at all, save an exchange between Anubis and an angel in Season of Mists: \\"On whose authority?\\"; \\"Whose do you think?\\" The Sandman series weaves an explanation for the many mythical deities apart from the Presence in the DC Universe. They are described as originating in Dream's realm, born out of people's wishes and fears. They take their power from prayers sent to them and die when they are no longer revered and ultimately forgotten. A significant character in the Sandman series is the fallen angel Lucifer Morningstar, who rules in Hell. In Season of Mists, he renounces his throne and leaves Hell. His story, and the quasi-Biblical references surrounding him, is expanded upon in Mike Carey's Lucifer series. God, the Presence, in that series is referred to by name as Yahweh. He is the father of Lucifer and Michael Demiurgos.Lucifer #26 (July 2002) The Lucifer series depicts gods from religions other than the three monotheistic Abrahamic religions, including formless gods dreamt up by the earliest humans before the advent of language, and even tiny, short-lived crustacean gods originating from the hopes and fears of shrimp. Since the end of the series, the Presence has vacated his creation, and his granddaughter Elaine Belloc has taken his place. How this affects other aspects of the Presence has yet to be seen. ==Powers and abilities== The Presence is the incarnation of the Abrahamic God in the DC Universe. The Presence has the ability to empower various angels, including the Spectre, Eclipso, and Michael Demiurgos. The Presence could resurrect the dead. When the fallen angel Asmodel invaded the Silver City in an attempt to destroy the Presence, it was stated that the Presence is everywhere and cannot be destroyed.JLA: Paradise Lost Although the Presence has stated in Lucifer that he is infinite and eternal, he also said that he was shaped by external forces.Lucifer vol. 1 #75 (Aug. 2006) In volume 2 of the Lucifer series, he was temporarily killed, or severely damaged, by one of his fallen archangels, wielding a sword of his own creation.Lucifer vol. 2 #1 (Feb. 2016)Lucifer vol. 2 #5 (June 2016)Lucifer vol. 2 #9 (Oct. 2016) However, due to the Lucifer series being set in the Vertigo Universe, which may or may not sit apart from the main DCU, this may only apply to the current Vertigo version of the Presence and not the Presence of the DCU itself, although this is no longer supportable since DC's The New 52 merged Vertigo, WildStorm and Milestone together. This is supported by the fact that the Presence is alive (and unchanged) in the main DCU.Swamp Thing vol. 6 #5 (May 2016) ==In other media== *The \\"Hand of the Creator\\", from the Green Lantern comics and the Crisis, made an appearance in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time Warped\\". It is seen toward the end of the episode when Batman and Green Lantern chase Chronos to the beginning of time. Chronos hoped that by traveling there, he could become God. *The \\"Hand of the Creator\\" also appears in the last episode of the second season of Green Lantern: The Animated Series, \\"Dark Matter\\". After obtaining the device used for time traveling from the Anti-Monitor's head, the corrupted A.I. Aya used it to travel to the beginning of time in order to manipulate the hand in an attempt to make it so that the universe would be created without organic life. After badly injuring Razer, Aya returned to her normal self and then manipulated the hand again so that the creation of the world would proceed as normal. ==See also== *The One Above All, who is depicted as the creator God and Supreme Being of the Multiverse in Marvel Comics. *The Man of Miracles, the Supreme Being of the Image Comics universe. *Dys, the Supreme Being of the First Comics multiverse. ==References== ==External links== *Presence at the DC Comics Database Category:Characters created by Jerry Siegel Category:Comics characters introduced in 1940 Category:DC Comics characters who can teleport Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:DC Comics cosmic entities Category:DC Comics deities Category:DC Comics telepaths Category:Fictional emperors and empresses Category:God in fiction ","title":"Presence (DC Comics)"},{"id":"1444080","text":"Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res (Jacques Champion, commonly referred to as Chambonni√®res) (c. 1601/2 ‚Äì 1672) was a French harpsichordist, dancer and composer. Born into a musical family, Chambonni√®res made an illustrious career as court harpsichordist in Paris and was considered by many of his contemporaries to be one of the greatest musicians in Europe. However, late in life Chambonni√®res gradually fell out of favor at the court and lost his position. He died in poverty, but at an advanced age, and not before publishing a number of his works. Today Chambonni√®res is considered one of the greatest representatives of the early French harpsichord school. ==Life== View of Paris in 1607, copperplate engraving by Leonard Gaultier. ===1601‚Äì1631: Early years=== Chambonni√®res was born in Paris, most probably in 1601 or 1602. Very little information survives concerning his childhood and early youth. The Champion family included many musicians, most notably Thomas Champion (also known as Mithou; not to be confused with his English namesake), Chambonni√®res's grandfather, whom Marin Mersenne described as \\"the greatest contrapuntist of his time.\\" Chambonni√®res's father, also named Jacques, was also a keyboard player and a composer. Although he was not as highly regarded as Thomas, Mersenne still praised his keyboard skills, and John Bull dedicated a work to him. The title Chambonni√®res originally belonged to Chambonni√®res's maternal grandfather: it was the name of a small manor in the commune of Le Plessis-Feu-Aussoux. Chambonni√®res must have received early music lessons from his father, but apart from that nothing is known about the young harpsichordist's education. What is known, however, is that Chambonni√®res was for a long time the only child of an aging father‚ÄîJacques Champion was around 50 when Chambonni√®res was born‚Äîand received much attention.Fuller, Grove. Already by 1611 Chambonni√®res must have been showing considerable musical talents, for in September of that year he received the reversion of his father's court position. Some ten years later, about 1621/22, Chambonni√®res married his first wife Marie Leclerc. He continued receiving generous financial support from his father until some time in the mid-1620s, when Jacques Champion's wife unexpectedly gave birth to two more children: a daughter (Louise) and another son (Nicolas, or Jehan-Nicolas). Jacques, apparently mindful of both the diminishing family fortune and his elder son's selfish character, sought to distribute the remaining money and resources in a fair manner. In 1631 he completed and signed a document that has since become one of the most important sources of biographical information on the Champion family: a d√©claration which detailed family circumstances and, among other things, ordered Chambonni√®res to pay 3000 livres to his mother, brother and sister as a repayment for the court position and other benefits provided to him by his father. ===1632‚Äì1657: Rise to fame and subsequent career=== With support from his father, Chambonni√®res was probably working at the court since his late teens. By 1632 he had the title of gentilhomme ordinaire de la Chambre du Roy. He rose to great fame in the early 1630s, first as harpsichordist and then, a little later, as a dancer. His first public performance was in the Ballet de la marine, on 25 February 1635, before the King himself. In 1637 Chambonni√®res's salary was the same as his father's, and soon after the latter's death in 1642 Chambonni√®res became the only harpsichordist. His activities were not limited to providing music for the court, however. In 1641 he organized a series of paying concerts‚Äîperhaps the very first of such kind in France‚Äîwhich probably continued well into the 1650s. The earliest relevant notarial act, from 17 October 1641, specifies that ten musicians were to perform every Wednesday and Saturday at noon for a year. Both vocal and instrumental works were performed, but no details survive on the nature of the music or the instruments used. Chambonni√®res augmented his income also by teaching, eventually becoming an important influence on the subsequent development of the French harpsichord school, as well as composers abroad, such as Johann Jakob Froberger. Among his pupils were Jacques Hardel and Jean-Henri d'Anglebert, but he was particularly important for his contribution to the establishment of the Couperin musical dynasty. About 1650/51 Louis Couperin and his brothers gave a small private concert at Chambonni√®res's Le Plessis-Feu-Aussoux manor, to celebrate the older composer's name day. Their playing and their music (which was composed by Louis) so impressed Chambonni√®res that he extended all kinds of support to the Couperins and the three soon had active careers in Paris. Chambonni√®res's only extant letter, to Christiaan Huygens. Dated 8 January 1656, it shows Chambonni√®res's continuing interest in making a journey to the north. Chambonni√®res's wife died in the early 1650s. He married his second wife Marguerite Ferret, daughter of a law court usher, on 16 December 1652. As the Fronde civil war went on, Chambonni√®res's career was still on the rise. He continued augmenting his income by giving concerts and teaching, and at one point considered going on a tour of Brabant. A series of concerts titled Assembl√©e des honnestes curieux was given in the mid-1650s; those given in autumn 1655 were attended by Christiaan Huygens. Chambonni√®res's dancing career continued, too: on 23 February 1653 he danced in the Ballet royal de la nuit, side by side with the young Louis XIV and Jean-Baptiste Lully, and on 14 April 1654 he participated in the ballet inserted into Carlo Caproli's opera Le nozze di Peleo e di Theti. Chambonni√®res's harpsichord works were appearing already in manuscript collections dating from the late 1650s, but he had not yet published any of his music. ===1657‚Äì1672: Dwindling fortunes=== Chambonni√®res's financial situation probably ceased to be stable already in the early 1650s, when the Fronde armies laid the Brie region to waste. The first serious losses, however, must have occurred in 1657, when a lawsuit was brought that resulted in the sale of Chambonni√®res's manor and land at Le Plessis-Feu-Aussoux, for a comparatively small sum. In the summer his wife Marguerite obtained a decree of separate maintenance and sold some of the composer's property. The first serious blow to Chambonni√®res's career was landed also in 1657, by the King, who engaged √âtienne Richard as the royal harpsichord teacher, thereby injuring Chambonni√®res's pride and making his position at the court less secure. Many decades later √âvrard Titon du Tillet described a plot that existed at the court to remove Chambonni√®res from his position and replace him with Louis Couperin. This failed, however, since Couperin refused to take up the post out of loyalty to his benefactor and friend. By the end of the year 1660 Chambonni√®res was calling himself a marquis, but he still experienced financial problems. He and his wife were still living together despite her earlier activities; his court position was constantly under threat from what he called, in a letter, a \\"low and evil clique\\", and his pension was cut off, apparently by the same people. On 23 October 1662 Chambonni√®res retired and sold the reversion of his post to d'Anglebert for 2000 livres. The latter was to assume all duties immediately, but would receive none of the emoluments. According to violist Jean Rousseau, Chambonni√®res's contemporary, the composer was obliged to resign since he could not execute basso continuo accompaniment. Many of Chambonni√®res's misfortunes were almost certainly brought on by the appointment of Jean- Baptiste Lully as Surintendant de la musique de la chambre: learning to perform basso continuo still would have diminished Chambonni√®res's status at the court, reducing him to a small part of Lully's orchestral force. After his retirement, Chambonni√®res must have continued to perform in order to make a living, but only a single record of a concert survives, that for 1 November 1665 at the Duchess of Orleans' salon. He published two volumes of harpsichord pieces in 1670 and died two years later, in difficult financial circumstances. The posthumous inventory of his property survives, listing furniture, tapestries, etc., in mediocre condition, as well as four keyboard instruments: two harpsichords (one probably a two-manual instrument), a spinet and a regal. ==Work== Les pi√®ces de clavessin [...] livre premier. Paris, 1670. (complete score) Due to lack of manuscript sources, little is known about French harpsichord music of the first half of the 17th century, and Chambonni√®res emerges as the sole major composer of the time with a large surviving oeuvre. Some 150 pieces are extant, almost all of them dances. Sixty were published by the composer himself in 1670 in two volumes of Les pi√®ces de clavessin, and the rest are known through some 20 manuscript sources, most of which were discovered only in the mid- and late 20th century. Two of these are of particular importance: the famous Bauyn manuscript and a manuscript in the collection of Guy Oldham in London. The Bauyn manuscript includes, among other pieces, alternative versions of almost all the published works. The Oldham manuscript contains 22 pieces by Chambonni√®res, 13 of which may be in Chambonni√®res's hand, and at least one (Allemande Le moutier) was apparently composed into the manuscript. Chambonni√®res's style formed under the influence of earlier and contemporary harpsichordists such as √âtienne Richard and Pierre de la Barre, and more importantly, lutenists such as Ren√© Mesangeau, Germain Pinel, Ennemond Gaultier, and Denis Gaultier. Since the exact course of evolution of the classic French harpsichord style remains a mystery, it is impossible to ascertain the role Chambonni√®res played in establishing said style. He was obviously influenced by the French lute school, adapting its style bris√© to the harpsichord, and he may have been among the first to do so. Another important influence was a thorough grounding in counterpoint, probably transmitted from his grandfather Thomas through his father. The vast majority of Chambonni√®res's pieces are allemandes, courantes, sarabandes, and gigues, standard dance types of the era. The courantes completely outnumber all other genres: there are more than 60 of them. Also extant are Chambonni√®res's forays into other dance types, the most important of which are four pavanes and three or four chaconnes. No preludes by Chambonni√®res exist, although the genre was very popular: indeed, he is the only major composer of the period who has none to his credit (although nine anonymous unmeasured preludes from the manuscript B-Bc 27220 may have been composed by him). Numerous pieces exist in several versions, which presents considerable problems for scholars and performers, since the versions may differ dramatically. The Bauyn manuscript versions of the published works, for instance, are almost completely unornamented, whereas the published versions abound in ornaments. One particularly striking example is the Pavane L'entretien des Dieux. It has a single trill in the Bauyn version, while in the published version that very trill is omitted‚Äîbut 62 other ornaments appear. Another example, Sarabande Jeunes z√©phirs, is found in 11 sources, and no two versions are identical. Finally, the grouping of the pieces is another problem for scholars. Chambonni√®res chose to publish his works as suites defined by key; frequently there are musical connections between the pieces of a single suite. However, such suites are absent from manuscript sources, where pieces appear grouped by key only and do not form suites. Described as \\"one of Chambonni√®res' most beautiful works and deservedly one of his most famous\\" by Willi Apel, the F major chaconne is seen here as preserved in the famous Bauyn manuscript. Mersenne justly praised Chambonni√®res for \\"lovely melodies and fine accompanying parts mingled together\\" and \\"beauty of rhythm\\", and indeed Chambonni√®res's strong sense of melodic line was one of the defining characteristics of his music. Broad, sweeping melodies frequently inform whole strains of his allemandes and courantes. However, beneath the pleasing melodic surface there frequently is a substantial degree of polyphonic complexity, and carefully concealed contrapuntal devices are quite common in Chambonni√®res's works even if most of the pieces are more homophonic rather than fully polyphonic. Such structural connections are not uncommon in Chambonni√®res's suites, and sometimes they define subgroups in manuscript collections: the three courantes of the third suite of the livre premier are a prime example, linked by a scale motif both in the published versions and in the Oldham manuscript, where they too appear together, in the same sequence. The same suite has more examples of imitative counterpoint worked into the dance texture, e.g., in the final gigue and in the thematic importance of the tenor voice in the three- and four-part textures of the first few pieces. ==Selected Discography== Since the advent of period performance practice in the 20th century, Chambonni√®res' works have been recorded by a number of harpsichordists.

Cosgrave unveiled the Colonel John McCrae Memorial, at Boezinge, Ypres, West Flanders, on October 5, 1963.Hell in Flanders Fields: Canadians at the Second Battle of Ypres Cosgrave wrote the book \\"Afterthoughts of Armageddon\\" ((Toronto: S.B. Gundy, 1919) about his experiences during World War I, dedicated to \\"the million dead\\". One article describes the book \\"as an account of the emotions Cosgrave and his comrades experienced in the years of grinding horror, poison gas and trench warfare\\". It was published by his wife Beryl (n√©e Hunter Jones). ==Subsequent services to Canada== Between the wars Cosgrave served with the Trade and Commerce Department. He was the Assistant Canadian Government Trade Commissioner in London from 1922 to 1924; Canadian Trade Commissioner at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park in 1924; at Shanghai from 1925 to 1935; at Melbourne from 1935 to 1937; and at Sydney from 1937 to 1942. The Japanese Instrument of Surrender During World War II Cosgrave was the Canadian Military Attache to Australia, for the South West Pacific Area. On September 2, 1945 he was the Canadian representative at the official surrender of Japan, and signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on behalf of Canada aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. When his turn to sign came, Cosgrave inadvertently placed his signature one line too low on the Japanese copy of the documents, signing on the line for the French Republic. This was attributed to his being blind in one eye, through an injury sustained in the First World War.The Man Who Signed on the Wrong Line The problem was easily corrected, by US General Richard Sutherland who crossed out \\"French Republic\\" and wrote in \\"Dominion of Canada\\" under Cosgrave's signature, then made similar corrections for the rest of the document.Ellwand, Geoff. \\"Making a mess of history,\\" CBC News. April 27, 2006. Air Vice-Marshal Leonard Monk Isitt, the Dominion of New Zealand representative, left without a blank to sign, had to have his name and country written in at the bottom margin of the document. The Japanese delegates accepted the corrected copy.COL. L. M. COSGRAVE, SIGNED PEACE PACT Cosgrave did not repeat this error on the American copy.The Man Who Signed on the Wrong Line Cosgrave knew Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, who signed the instrument of surrender on behalf of the Japanese Emperor and Government, from their diplomatic days in Shanghai. It is reported that their eyes met when Mamoru Shigemitsu boarded the Missouri, they both smiled with mutual recognition, before Shigemitsu once more became stern and serious. They met each other again a number of years later in London at the Coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953.(recited by Col. Lawrence Moore Cosgrave DSO, to his Grandson).The Surrender CeremonyPage 7-9 Colonel Lawrence Vincent Moore Cosgrave DSO and Bar ==After the war== Cosgrave retired from the military in 1946 and began working for the Commerce Department again. He held various consular posts in Asia; and in the 1950s, his diplomatic career continued in European consular posts. For instance, he was Charg√© d'Affaires in Portugal from 1952 through 1955.Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada Complete List of Posts On July 28, 1971, Cosgrave died at his home in Knowlton (Eastern Townships), province of Quebec where he had previously settled. Decades after Cosgrave's death, some members of the Canadian Military, the \\"Canadian Forces in US\\", posted a series of tweets in September 2020, emphasizing the importance of his military career. They included these two: \\"Who among us was awarded two Distinguished Service Orders for gallantry in action during WWI?\\" and \\"Who among us was awarded a Croix de Guerre?\\". ==Notes== ==References== * Preston, Adrian (RMC 4237). and Peter Dennis.

The lengthy work in six books takes its inspiration from Geoffrey of Monmouth, Wace, Orosius, Bede, the Lancelot-Grail, the Alexander Romance, Roman historians, medieval travellers, and oral tradition.Nigel Bryant (translator), Perceforest: The Prehistory of King Arthur's Britain, Cambridge and Rochester: D.S. Brewer (Arthurian studies, 77), 2011, xxiii. It appears to have originally been composed in French in the Low Countries between 1330 and 1345, although the most complete version of the four extant texts, Manuscript C, written by David Aubert around 1459‚Äì1460, is generally accepted as a revision made for Philippe le Bon, Duke of Burgundy. However, a 2013 analysis by Christine Ferlampin-Acher proposes an alternative hypothesis that Manuscript C is, in fact, the original.Laura J. Campbell, \\"‚ÄòPerceforest‚Äô et ‚ÄòZ√©phir‚Äô: propositions autour d'un r√©cit arthurien bourguignon,\\" French Studies, Volume 67, Issue 1, January 2013, Pages 86‚Äì87. In any case, Perceforest forms a late addition to the collection of narratives with loose connections both to the Arthurian cycle and the feats of Alexander the Great. ==Plot== An extract from Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain serves as a preface, in which refugees from Troy flee to the island of Britain, and establish a new kingdom. Unlike in Geoffrey's narrative, however, that dynasty eventually produces a series of weak rulers who usher their kingdom into decline. Alexander of Macedon and his Greek forces are on their way to the coronation of India's new king when they are blown off course in a storm. They arrive in Britain and discover the poor state of the country. Alexander takes charge and appoints the brothers Betis and Gadifer as kings of England and Scotland, respectively. He then leaves for Babylon. Betis renames himself \\"Perceforest,\\" as one who dares to \\"pierce\\" and \\"purge\\" the evil forest to root out Darnant the Enchanter and bring freedom and justice to the land. Perceforest and Gadifer take on Darnant's descendants, a group of magic-wielding knights, and drive them out. However, the successful leadership of the two brothers is fated not to last, and native English and Scottish knights are forced to step into the breach to quell rebellion and fend off invasion. Perceforest eventually regains his powers and, as king of Britain, creates a chivalric society. Specifically, he founds the Franc Palais of free equals with the best knights, paralleling the Round Table. \\"Thus the romance would trace back the model of ideal civilization that it proposes, a model also for the orders of chivalry created from the 14th century onwards, to a legendary origin where the glory of Alexander is united with the fame of Arthur.\\"Mihaela Voicu, Histoire de la litt√©rature fran√ßaise du moyen √¢ge, xii.1, Bucharest, 2003 e-text (in French), 2014 King Perceforest also abandons polytheism in favor of a monotheistic god and, under the influence of the hermit Dardanon, advances a new religion that will serve as a transition toward Arthurian Christianity. Meanwhile, Perceforest's knights, often with the help of a guardian spirit named Zephir, engage in heroic and romantic acts of derring-do in Britain as well as in the Low Countries. Tragedy comes to prevail as Perceforest's eldest son becomes infatuated with a Roman girl, whose treachery enables Julius Caesar to launch an invasion in which Perceforest and all his forces are annihilated and the kingdom is utterly destroyed.Nigel Bryant (translator), A Perceforest Reader: Selected Episodes from Perceforest: The Prehistory of Arthur's Britain, Cambridge: D.S.Brewer, 2012, in the section \\"The Story.\\" The third generation comes to restore the land. Ourseau, a grandson of Gadifer, secures the assassination of Julius Caesar. Another grandson, Gallafur, marries Alexander's granddaughter, the \\"Maiden of Dragons,\\" to give Britain a new royal house. Gallafur also embeds the sword in the stone that one of his descendants will draw out to become king. And it is Gallafur who casts out many of the enchantments that still plague Britain. Nonetheless, tragedy triumphs a final time in this work, as Britain is invaded by the Sicambrians, a group of Trojans. They destroy Alexander's Greek dynasty, leaving a void that only the coming of Arthur will fill. An elaborate frame story tells how the \\"Greek\\" manuscript was discovered by count William of Hainault in a cabinet at ‚ÄúBurtimer‚Äù Abbey; in the same cabinet was deposited a crown, which the count sent to king Edward. ==Printing history and translations== Perceforest was first printed in Paris in 1528, as La Tres Elegante Delicieux Melliflue et Tres Plaisante Hystoire du Tres Noble Roy Perceforest in four volumes. In 1531 it was printed in Italian. A Spanish translation is also known. An 800-page partial abridged English translation/precis appeared in 2011. ==Reception at various points in history== According to the Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales, \\"it was read in France, and in northern Germany was performed as a pre-Lenten Shrove Tuesday drama in the mid-1400s\\". Charles IX of France was especially fond of this romance: four volumes of Perceforest were added to the Royal library at Blois sometime between 1518 and 1544, and were shelved with the Arthurian romances. The romance was known and referred to in 14th-century England. Perceforest, like other late Gothic romances, was vaguely remembered but largely unread until the late 20th century. This was due not only to its time period but to its length. Each of its six books runs as many pages as a long novel, and the whole work is divided into about 530 chapters, totalling over a million words.Nigel Bryant (translator), Perceforest: The Prehistory of King Arthur's Britain, Cambridge and Rochester: D.S. Brewer (Arthurian studies, 77), 2011, xxiii. If completely translated into English the work would run about 7,000 pages. Therefore, it was earlier and High Medieval literature that took centre stage in modern medieval studies. Moreover, readers of the Age of Enlightenment were not always delighted with Perceforest when they came upon it. The hero of Matthew Lewis's The Monk (1796),Matthew Lewis, The Monk, Vol. II, Chapter 1. an early example of the Gothic novel, confesses that :\\"Donna Rodolpha's Library was principally composed of old Spanish Romances: these were her favourite studies, and once a day one of these unmerciful volumes was put regularly into my hands. I read the wearisome adventures of 'Perceforest,' 'Tirante the White,' 'Palmerin of England' and 'the Knight of the Sun' till the Book was on the point of falling from my hands through Ennui.\\" G√©rard de Nerval, in a fictional letter published as part of his Ang√©lique (1850), tells of an antiquary who fears for the safety of the valuable first printed edition of Perceforest at the hands of a rioting mob. ==References== *Myriam Yvonne Jehenson, \\"Quixotic Desires or Stark Reality?\\", the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" episode mentioned. *Dr Helen Nicholson, \\"What was a Medieval woman?\\", includes excerpts. *Gilles Roussineau, Le Roman de Perceforest, 2001, .

It was created by animator Zlatko Grgiƒá. The series revolves around benevolent genius Professor Balthazar. In each episode, someone in his surroundings has a problem, which he duly considers and invariably finds a solution to. He then activates a magical machine and produces an invention that will solve the problem. The characters of the series do not speak in any intelligible language, and the plot of the episodes is instead recounted by a narrator in voice-over. ==History== The series was created for television by the Croatian animator Zlatko Grgiƒá at the Zagreb Film studio. Fifty-nine episodes of the cartoon were made between 1967 and 1978. The cartoon has been shown in subsequent years in several countries besides the former Yugoslavia, including United Kingdom, West Germany (Westdeutscher Rundfunk), Denmark, Finland, France, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Spain, Iran, Greece, Canada and Zimbabwe. From 1971 to 1973, episodes were featured on the American ABC-TV children's program Curiosity Shop. The cartoon inventor was the basis for the show's puppet character, Baron Balthazar, and the cartoons were shown as animated sequences of the Baron's tales of his adventures and inventions back in \\"downtown Bosnia\\". The cartoon was also shown in the United States in the 1980s on Pinwheel as well as on ABC in Australia and on CCTV in China. The cartoon was also shown in Asia in the 1990s on STAR TV.

The list is organized by broad geographical sections within the city. While there is no official list of neighborhoods, districts, and places, this list was compiled from the sources listed in the References and External links sections, as well as from published information from secondary sources. Common usage for Philadelphia's neighborhood names does not respect \\"official\\" borders used by the city's police, planning commission or other entities. Therefore, some of the places listed here may overlap geographically, and residents do not always agree where one neighborhood ends and another begins. Philadelphia has 41 ZIP codes, which are often used for neighborhood analysis. Historically, many neighborhoods were defined by incorporated townships (Blockley, Roxborough), districts (Belmont, Kensington, Moyamensing, Richmond), or boroughs (Bridesburg, Frankford, Germantown, Manayunk) before being incorporated into the city with the Act of Consolidation of 1854.The Political and Community Service Boundaries of Philadelphia, Philadelphia City Planning Commission, June 2004. Adding further complication is the fact that in some parts of Philadelphia, especially the central areas of North, West, and South Philadelphia, residents have long been more likely to identify with the name of their section of the city than with any specific neighborhood name. Today, community development corporations, neighborhood watches, and other civic organizations are influential in shaping the use of neighborhood names and approximate boundaries. For planning purposes, the city is divided into 12 Planning Analysis Sections, which are Center City; South Philadelphia; Southwest Philadelphia; West Philadelphia; Lower North Philadelphia; Upper North Philadelphia; Bridesburg-Kensington-Port Richmond; Roxborough-Manayunk; Germantown-Chestnut Hill; Olney-Oak Lane; Near Northeast Philadelphia; and Far Northeast Philadelphia. ==Center City== The Philadelphia City Hall in Center City The Center City Planning Analysis Section extends from South Street on the south to Vine Street on the north, and from the Delaware River on the east to the Schuylkill River on the west. ==South Philadelphia== The South Philadelphia Planning Analysis Section is bounded by South Street on the north and the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers to their confluence. ==Southwest Philadelphia== Philadelphia International Airport is located in Southwest Philadelphia Southwest Philadelphia (formerly Kingsessing Township) is a section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that can be described as extending from the western side of the Schuylkill River to the city line, with the northern border defined by the Philadelphia City Planning Commission as east from the city line along Baltimore Avenue moving south along 51st Street to Springfield Ave. It follows the train tracks until 49th Street. From 49th and Kingsessing Ave the line moves east along Kingsessing Ave. The line then moves south along 46th St to Paschall Ave where it jogs to join Grays Ferry where the line runs to the Schuylkill River.Philadelphia City Planning Commission ==West Philadelphia== West Philadelphia, nicknamed West Philly, is a section of Philadelphia. Though there is no official definition of its boundaries, it is generally considered to reach from the western shore of the Schuylkill River, to City Line Avenue to the northwest, Cobbs Creek to the southwest, and the SEPTA Media/Elwyn Line to the south. Twin Homes,\\" 48th & Walton, Cedar Park ==Lower North Philadelphia== Lower North Philadelphia is a section of Philadelphia that is immediately north of Center City and below Upper North Philadelphia and can be described as a section of Philadelphia that was designated as a \\"Model City\\" target, in hopes of overcoming poverty and blight through a federal funding program since 1966. Bounded by Spring Garden Street to the south, Front Street to the east, York Street to the north, and Fairmount Park to the west. ==Upper North Philadelphia== Lillian Marrero Branch of the Philadelphia Free Library is located in Upper North Philadelphia's West Kensington The area is bounded by York Street to the south, Front Street to the east, Lincoln Highway/Roosevelt Expressway to the north, and Ridge Avenue/Fairmount Park to the west. Upper North Philadelphia, is a section of Philadelphia that is immediately north of Lower North Philadelphia, and can be described as an area that has a \\"...large and rapidly growing Puerto Rican population\\". The list of communities in this section is as follows: ==Bridesburg-Kensington-Port Richmond== The Bridesburg-Kensington- Port Richmond section of Philadelphia is the area north of Center City. This area \\"... consists of the neighborhoods including: Bridesburg, Fishtown, Olde Richmond, Juniata Park, New Kensington, North West Kensington, Port Richmond...\\" and \\"... was once predominantly industrial. However, most heavy industry has now left.\\" ==Roxborough-Manayunk== Manayunk skyline The Roxborough-Manyunk section of Philadelphia is an official planning district of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission, consisting of the namesake boroughs of Roxborough and Manayunk. Geographically, the area is northwest of Center City. ==Germantown-Chestnut Hill== The Germantown-Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia is about 7‚Äì8 miles northwest from the center of the city. The neighborhood of Germantown is rich in historic sites and buildings from the colonial era, a few of which are open to the public. Its namesake also comes from the village of Chestnut Hill was part of the German Township laid out by Francis Daniel Pastorius and came to include the settlements originally known as Sommerhausen and Crefeld, as well as part of Cresheim. The area generally served as a gateway between Philadelphia and the nearby farmlands. During the American Revolutionary War era (late 18th century), the area was one of many summer vacation spots due to its higher elevation, 400‚Äì500 feet (120 to 150 m) above sea level, and cooler temperatures than the historic Center City. Chestnut Hill is still stereotypically known as one of the more affluent sections of Philadelphia. ==Olney-Oak Lane== The Olney-Oak Lane Planning Analysis Section is an official section of Philadelphia. It is a section of Philadelphia that is immediately north of Upper North Philadelphia and south of Cheltenham. It is an area that consists of the now defunct township that was called \\"Bristol Township, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania\\". The section is often included as part of North Philadelphia by city government agencies, though locally it is often referred to as \\"Uptown,\\" along with the Germantown- Chestnut Hill section. The section includes neighborhoods in the center-north of the city: ==Near Northeast Philadelphia== Richmond Street, one of the area's main thoroughfares in Port Richmond (2005). Near Northeast Philadelphia, is a section of the city of Philadelphia. When combined with the Far Northeast, to be \\"Northeast Philadelphia\\", the 2000 Census shows that the combined area has a sizable percentage of the city's 1.547 million people ‚Äî a population of between 300,000 and 450,000, depending on how the area is defined. Beginning in the 1980s, many of the Northeast's middle class children graduated from college and settled in suburbs, especially nearby Bucks County. Whites were once predominant in northeastern Philadelphia. However, with the emigration of older populations and white flight a new influx of Hispanics have settled in the Northeast, while African Americans and Asian immigrants have purchased homes in northeast Philadelphia. The Northeast is now both racially and ethnically diverse and has a large immigrant population. ==Far Northeast Philadelphia== Far Northeast Philadelphia is an official planning section of Philadelphia that is north of the Near Northeast section of Philadelphia.

First established in May 1947 as a fitting resting place for Philippine military personnel from privates to generals who served during World War II, it eventually became designated as the official place of burial for deceased Philippine presidents, national heroes, patriots, National Artists and National Scientists. Among those buried in the cemetery are Filipino soldiers who died during the Philippine Campaign and the Liberation of the Philippines in World War II from 1941 to 1945. Among the Filipino leaders and dignitaries buried there are Presidents Elpidio Quirino, Carlos P. Garcia and Diosdado Macapagal; former Vice President Salvador H. Laurel; generals Artemio Ricarte and Carlos P. Romulo; Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes; and former Senate President and proclaimed Vice President Arturo Tolentino and Blas Ople. Former President Ferdinand Marcos is the most recent president to be buried there, after the Supreme Court of the Philippines dismissed petitions against his burial on 8 November 2016, though controversies continue to run rampant whether his real corpse was used for the burial or is still buried in his home province of Ilocos Norte. ==History== The Libingan ng mga Bayani The cemetery was first established in May 1947 as the Republic Memorial Cemetery. It was first established as a tribute and final resting place for the 33,520 to 58,780 Filipino soldiers who died during the Philippine Campaign (1941‚Äì42) and the Allied Liberation of the Philippines (1944‚Äì45) in World War II. It was established as the Filipino counterpart to the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial, which houses the remains of United States personnel who died during the same war. On 16 June 1948, Philippine President Elpidio Quirino signed into law the Republic Act 289, also known as An Act Providing for the Construction of a National Pantheon for Presidents of the Philippines, National Heroes, and Patriots of the Country. Section 1 of the Act cites the purpose of creating such pantheon: While such National Pantheon was never established during Quirino's lifetime, several decrees and laws passed under succeeding administrations led to the eventual use of the Republic Memorial Cemetery as a national pantheon described in Republic Act 289. On 27 October 1954, President Ramon Magsaysay renamed the Republic Memorial Cemetery as the Libingan ng mga Bayani. On 28 May 1967, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Proclamation No. 208 ordering the reservation of 142 hectares of land within Fort Bonifacio in consideration for the Libingan to serve not only as a cemetery for military personnel but also as a national shrine for fallen heroes. He ordered it placed under the administration of the Military Shrines Services of the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office, an agency under the Department of National Defense. On 9 April 1986, Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Fidel Ramos and President Corazon Aquino issued Armed Forces Regulations G 161-373, also known as \\"The allocation of Cemetery Plots at the LNMB\\". This military-issued regulation established the internment policy that would become the basis for the burial of personalities at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. Moreover, by virtue of Executive Order No. 131 issued by former President Fidel Ramos on 26 October 1993, National Artists and National Scientists of the Philippines were also made eligible for interment at the cemetery. In 2007, due to overcrowding at the Fort Bonifacio site, the cemetery's administration started exploring sites for Libingan ng mga Bayani annexes in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Only one has been completed so far, the ‚Ç±24-million, five-hectare extension at Camp Hernandez in Dingle, Iloilo. On 18 November 2016, former president Ferdinand Marcos was buried in a private ceremony with military honors, amid much controversy resulting in a handful of protests in various parts of the Philippines. ==Administration== The cemetery is administered and maintained by the Grave Service Unit (GSU), a unit of the Philippine Army Support Command of the AFP. Its mission is to provide burial and niche services to deceased military personnel and other personalities interred at the cemetery. Aside from maintaining the cemetery and the military grave site at Manila North Cemetery, the unit is also capable of providing mortuary and memorial services to authorized personnel. ==Interment policy== According to Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Regulation G 161-373, the following persons are entitled to interment at the Libingan ng mga Bayani: * Medal of Valor awardees * Presidents or Commanders-in-Chief, AFP * The secretaries of National Defense * AFP Chiefs of Staff * General/Flag Officers * Active and retired military personnel of the AFP * Former AFP members who laterally entered/joined the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) * Veterans of the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the First and Second World Wars, as well as recognized guerrillas * Government dignitaries, statesmen, national artists and other deceased persons whose interment has been approved by the commander-in-chief, Congress or the Secretary of National Defense, and * Former Presidents, Secretaries of National Defense, widows of former Presidents and Chiefs of Staff * National Artists and National Scientists of the Philippines However, the same regulation also prohibits \\"personnel who were dishonorably separated/ reverted/ discharged from the service and personnel who were convicted by final judgment of an offense involving moral turpitude\\" from interment at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. ==Features== Tombstones of fallen Filipino soldiers at the Libingan ng mga Bayani The first structure that visitors will see upon entering the grounds of the cemetery complex is the Heroes Memorial Gate, a large concrete tripod with a stairway leading to an upper view deck with a metal sculpture at the center. Erected on opposite sides of the main entrance road near the Heroes Memorial Gate are two 12-foot high black stone walls which bear the words that General Douglas MacArthur uttered during a journey to the Philippines in 1961: \\"I do not know the dignity of his birth, but I do know the glory of his death.\\" The main structure, located at the center of the cemetery, is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where wreath laying ceremonies are held when Philippine government officials and foreign dignitaries visit the cemetery. Inscribed on the tomb are the words: \\"Here lies a Filipino soldier whose name is known only to God.\\" Behind the tomb are three marble pillars representing the three main island groups in the Philippines: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. There are several pylons as well commemorating the gallantry of Filipino soldiers who died in various wars in world history. These include the Korean Memorial Pylon, which honors 112 Filipino officers and men who were members of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea (PEFTOK) who perished during the Korean War; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Pylon, which was dedicated to the members of the Philippine contingent and Philippine civic action groups (PHILCON-V and PHILCAG-V) that were sent to Vietnam during the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1971; and the Philippine World War II Guerrillas Pylon, which was erected by the Veterans Federation of the Philippines as a testimony to the indomitable spirit and bravery of the Filipino guerrillas of World War II. == Notable burials == * Elpidio Quirino (1890‚Äì1956), 6th President * Carlos P.

His ancestral name was Ji (Âß¨), given name Wusheng (ÂØ§Áîü), which means \\"difficult birth\\" with breech presentation. In 743 BC, he became the duke of Zheng, and later defeated his younger brother Gongshu Duan, who had led a rebellion against him. Duke Zhuang led military campaigns in the name of the Zhou king against the Rong people and other Zhou states. He was considered by later scholars to have a Machiavellian attitude towards governance. ==Early life and rise to power== Born as the first of two sons and groomed for the throne, Zheng's mother nevertheless preferred her second son, the reason being that she suffered through an extraordinarily painful time when giving birth to Zheng. When Duke Zheng ascended to the dukedom over the violent objections of his mother, she began plotting to get Gongshu Duan into power. First she asked Zheng to give Gongshu Duan the city of Duan as a fiefdom. Duan, at that time, was the second largest city in Zheng, and was a very important fortress indeed. Zheng was extremely reluctant to give away that piece of land, and indeed his courtiers begged him to reject the proposal, but out of courtesy for his mother he agreed. Seeing that her plan was going well, Zheng's mother urged Duan to build walls, stockpile arms and recruit mercenaries to the rebel cause. Soon news of all this began to reach the capital, and it was clear to everybody what was going to happen. Zheng's ministers urgently reported the news to Zheng, urging him to retake Duan from Gongshu before it was too late. However, Zheng dismissed these proposals, stating that he found no fault in Gongshu Duan, and besides, it could not be proved that he was plotting a coup, instead of just merely reinforcing the border. Besides, he said that Gongshu Duan was his brother, and he could not take up arms against him. Soon King Zheng had left the dukedom to Luoyang for some diplomatic matters; his mother soon wrote a letter to Duan, ordering him to revolt now and she would open the gates of the capital for him. So Gongshu Duan revolted against Duke Zheng, and not long after he was under the capital walls. It seemed as if Zheng was finished. Duke Zhuang defeated Gongshu Duan at Yan (north of present-day Yanling County) during the summer in the fifth month of 722 BC. On the 23rd day of the fifth month, Gongshu Duan fled to Gong. ==Rule== However word then came that Duan had fallen to the forces of Zheng, much to everyone's surprise. Duke Zheng already knew that a revolt was imminent, so he set up a trap; which both his mother and brother fell into. Seeing his demoralized forces melt away and with nowhere to run, Gongshu Duan committed suicide. Upon hearing this, Zheng rushed to see his brother's corpse; weeping greatly, he said to him, \\"Gongshu Duan, you knew that your older brother would always forgive you; why has it come to this?\\" Of course, in real life Zheng was nowhere near as compassionate: he only did it for show. The next act he did after pacifying the rebellion was putting his mother under strict confinement, telling her that \\"We will meet again under the ground!\\". But when public opinion began to turn against him as a result of this, he soon dug a tunnel linking his and his mother's palaces, and there they met, burying the hatchet altogether. He was appointed Left Advisor by King Ping of Zhou. After King Ping's death, the following king, King Huan, removed him from office. In return for this slight, Duke Zhuang refused to go to the capital to meet with King Huan. King Huan then led a coalition in 707 BC against Duke Zhuang, which culminated in a Zheng victory at the Battle of Xuge. Duke Zhuang's army humiliated the king, defeating the king's army and inflicting an arrow wound on King Huan's shoulder, and further diminishing the prestige of the Zhou royal house. After his death, his two sons fought a protracted civil war over the leadership of Zheng. ==Succession== He had 11 sons, among whom the most famous ones were Hu, Tu, Men and Yi. Hu was the heir and was created Duke Zhao of Zheng initially, but soon Duke Zhuang of Song interfered in the succession of Zheng and the minister of Zheng, Ji Zu, was forced to exile Duke Zhao and created Tu as Duke Li of Zheng. Men and Yi also escaped. Duke Li was also forced into exile after a failed plot against Ji Zu out of his hatred of feeling controlled by the latter, and Duke Zhao was restored. However, 3 years later, the vice minister, Gao Qumi, who had befriended Men and disliked Duke Zhao, committed an assassination and murdered Duke Zhao while Ji Zu was away, and created Men ruler instead, but the position of Ji Zu never changed. No more than 1 year later, Duke Xiang of Qi, who wanted fame, pretended to invite Men and Gao Qumi to Shouzhi and had them killed. Ji Zu created Yi as the duke and promised to be affiliated to Chu, while the exiled Duke Li also planned a restoration for himself. 17 years later, Duke Li with Qi troops defeated Yi, killed his two sons and managed to restore himself to power. The later dukes of Zheng were all descendants of Duke Li. ==Quotes== * (du≈ç x√≠ng b√πy√¨ b√¨ z√¨b√¨; 'If he repeatedly commits undutiful acts, he surely will bring himself down.'; referring to his younger brother; similar to 'the wages of sin is death') * (gu√≥ b√πkƒÅn √®r; 'a nation cannot have two leaders' advice given to Duke Zhuang by his minister Gongzi L√º) ==References== ==Further reading== * Zuo zhuan Category:701 BC deaths Category:Zhou dynasty nobility Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Zheng (state) Category:8th-century BC Chinese monarchs Category:8th-century BC births ","title":"Duke Zhuang of Zheng"},{"id":"1444165","text":"The MECE principle, pronounced \\"ME-see\\",Kivestu, Kenton \\"What is the MECE Principle?\\" _YouTube, Rocketblocks channel_ Cavano, Katharina \\"3 Steps to a Faster Moving Sales Pipeline\\" is a grouping principle for separating a set of items into subsets that are mutually exclusive (ME) and collectively exhaustive (CE). It was developed in the late 1960s by Barbara Minto at McKinsey & Company and underlies her Minto Pyramid Principle, and is based on ideas going back as far as Aristotle. The MECE principle is useful in the business mapping process wherein the optimum arrangement of information is exhaustive and does not double count at any level of the hierarchy. Examples of MECE arrangements include categorizing people by year of birth (assuming all years are known). A non-MECE example would be categorization by nationality, because nationalities are neither mutually exclusive (some people have dual nationality) nor collectively exhaustive (some people have none). == Common uses == Strategy consultants use MECE problem structuring to break down client problems into logical, clean buckets of analysis that they can then hand out as work streams to consulting staff on the project. Given their extensive use of MECE in breaking down client problems, they also expect to see interview candidates demonstrate strong MECE problem structuring during case interviews. Similar, MECE can be used in technical problem solving and communication. In some technical project like Six Sigma projects the most effect method of communication is not the same as the problem solving process. In Six Sigma the DMAIC process is used but executive audiences looking for summary or overviews may not be interested in the details. By reorganizing the information using MECE and the related SCQA story telling framework the point of the topic can addressed quickly and supported with appropriate detail. The result is far more effective communication. == Criticisms == The MECE concept has been criticized for not being exhaustive, as it doesn't exclude superfluous/extraneous items. Also, MECE thinking can be too limiting as mutual exclusiveness is not necessarily desirable. For instance, while it may be desirable to classify the answers to a question in a MECE framework so as to consider all of them exactly once, forcing the answers themselves to be MECE can be unnecessarily limiting. Another attribute of MECE thinking is that, by definition, it precludes redundancies. However, there are cases where redundancies are desirable or even necessary. == See also == *Proof by cases (case analysis) *Partition of a set for a mathematical treatment *Work breakdown structure for application in project management == References == Category:Management Category:Grouping ","title":"MECE principle"},{"id":"1444166","text":"Major Dad is an American sitcom television series created by Richard C. Okie and John G. Stephens, developed by Earl Pomerantz, that originally ran from September 17, 1989, to May 17, 1993 on CBS, starring Gerald McRaney as Major John D. MacGillis and Shanna Reed as his wife Polly. The cast also includes Beverly Archer, Matt Mulhern, Jon Cypher, Marisa Ryan, Nicole Dubuc, and Chelsea Hertford. ==Synopsis== The first season is set at the fictional Camp Singleton (meant to represent Camp Pendleton), where hard-charging United States Marine Corps Major John D. \\"Mac\\" MacGillis is commander of the infantry training school's acquisition division. MacGillis's life is changed when he falls in love with a liberal journalist, Polly Cooper. The show follows Mac in his work life, where he deals with Lt. Eugene Holowachuk (Matt Mulhern), Sgt. Byron James (Marlon Archey), and Merilee Gunderson (Whitney Kershaw), as well as his home life, as he learns to live with Polly's three daughters, Elizabeth, Robin, and Casey. At the beginning of the second season, the MacGillis family moves to Camp Hollister (based on Marine Corps Base Quantico), where Mac must adapt to the role of staff secretary (or, \\"staff weenie\\") and the crazy antics of Commanding (Brigadier) General Marcus C. Craig, Aide-de-Camp 1st Lt. Eugene Holowachuk (who transferred with Major MacGillis from Camp Singleton), and Gunnery Sgt. Alva \\"Gunny\\" Bricker, the General's secretary, a no-nonsense Marine, who despite her brusque nature and unprepossessing physical appearance, is the target of many enthusiastic (and unseen) suitors. Character development increased during the second season, such as the revelation that MacGillis is a former member of the United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon. ==Cast== ==Episode guide== ==Awards and nominations== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#B0C4DE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"background-color: #BCBCBC\\"Year ! style=\\"background-color: #BCBCBC\\"Award ! style=\\"background-color: #BCBCBC\\"Result ! style=\\"background- color: #BCBCBC\\"Category ! style=\\"background-color: #BCBCBC\\"Recipient - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA;\\"  1992  BMI Film & TV Award  Won  BMI TV Music Award  Steve Dorff -  1992  Emmy Award  Nominated  Outstanding Individual Achievement in Main Title Theme Music  Steve Dorff -  rowspan=21990  rowspan=8Young Artist Awards  Nominated  Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series  Chelsea Hertford -style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA;\\"  Won  Best New Television Series  - -  rowspan=41991  rowspan=4Nominated  Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series  Marisa Ryan -  Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series  Chelsea Hertford -  Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series  Nicole Dubuc -  Best Young Actor Supporting or Re- Occurring Role for a TV Series  Chance Michael Corbitt -  1992  Nominated  Best Young Actress Starring in a Television Series  Marisa Ryan -  1993  Nominated  Outstanding Actress Under Ten in a Television Series  Chelsea Hertford } ==References* *Major Dad introduction (video clip) Category:1989 American television series debuts Category:1993 American television series endings Category:1980s American sitcoms Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:CBS original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Military comedy television series Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television shows set in California Category:Television shows set in Virginia Category:Television shows about the United States Marine Corps Category:Television series about families ","title":"Major Dad"},{"id":"1444175","text":"IRI or I.R.I. usually refers to the Islamic Republic of Iran, the official name of Iran since 1979.

It was defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 2005 in RFC 3987. While URIs are limited to a subset of the ASCII character set, IRIs may additionally contain most characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646), including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Cyrillic characters. == Syntax == IRIs extend URIs by using the Universal Character Set, where URIs were limited to ASCII, with far fewer characters. IRIs may be represented by a sequence of octets but by definition are defined as a sequence of characters, because IRIs may be spoken or written by hand. == Compatibility == IRIs are mapped to URIs to retain backwards-compatibility with systems that do not support the new format. For applications and protocols that do not allow direct consumption of IRIs, the IRI should first be converted to Unicode using canonical composition normalization (NFC), if not already in Unicode format. All non-ASCII code points in the IRI should next be encoded as UTF-8, and the resulting bytes percent-encoded, to produce a valid URI. Example: The IRI https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/·ø¨œåŒ¥ŒøœÇ becomes the URI https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BF%AC%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%82 ASCII code points that are invalid URI characters may be encoded the same way, depending on implementation. This conversion is easily reversible; by definition, converting an IRI to an URI and back again will yield an IRI that is semantically equivalent to the original IRI, even though it may differ in exact representation. Some protocols may impose further transformations; e.g. Punycode for DNS labels. == Advantages == There are reasons to see URIs displayed in different languages; mostly, it makes it easier for users who are unfamiliar with the Latin (A‚ÄìZ) alphabet. Assuming that it isn't too difficult for anyone to replicate arbitrary Unicode on their keyboards, this can make the URI system more accessible. == Disadvantages == Mixing IRIs and ASCII URIs can make it much easier to execute phishing attacks that trick someone into believing they are on a different site that they really are. For example, one can replace an ASCII \\"a\\" in \`www.myfictionalbank.com\` with the Unicode look- alike \\"Œ±\\" to give \`www.myfictionŒ±lbank.com\` and point that IRI to a malicious site. This is known as an IDN homograph attack. While a URI does not provide people with a way to specify Web resources using their own alphabets, an IRI does not make clear how Web resources can be accessed with keyboards that are not capable of generating the requisite internationalized characters. This does mean that IRIs are now handled in a way very similar to many other software which might require the use of a non-keyboard input method when dealing with texts in various languages. == See also == * IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) * Semantic Web * Punycode * XRI (Extensible Resource Identifier) == References == == External links == * W3C Internationalization Activity * RFC 3987 : Proposed Standard of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) * IANA List of Registered URI Schemes Category:Application layer protocols Category:Emerging technologies Category:Internet protocols Category:Internet Standards Category:URL Category:Web services ","title":"Internationalized Resource Identifier"},{"id":"1444184","text":"Alina Mar√≠a Hern√°ndez (born Alberto, November 12, 1970 ‚Äì October 8, 2016), better known in the entertainment world as Cachita, was a Cuban transgender television actress. == Life and work == Cachita debuted on television as a participant in a singing contest at Don Francisco's S√°bado Gigante (\\"Gigantic Saturday\\") show, on Univision. After winning the contest, she used the 500 US dollars she earned to buy a car. She was still a struggling actor when she found work at Univision's El Gordo y la Flaca show, in 1998. There, she became friends with co-hosts Ra√∫l De Molina, Lili Estefan and Marta Rodriguez. Guest entertainers often told her that she looked much like Estefan. Cachita admitted, in an Internet interview, that she had sex change surgery, becoming female. She told her fans that she had always felt she had a female mind and was trapped in a male body. She also admitted wearing a blond wig; her normal hair color was dark. The last medical step towards her becoming a female came in late November 2005, when TVNotas, a magazine she worked for, paid for her sex-change surgery. Before her sex-change operation, Cachita was a restaurant worker. Her boss told her that she would be allowed to come to work dressed as a woman, and her co-workers were advised to refer to her as \\"Alina\\". Cachita returned to Cuba for a family visit soon after the first of her series of sex- change surgeries. She had a difficult time there with her family, as her aunt and grandmother in particular did not accept her change. Her aunt in particular insisted on calling her \\"Alberto\\", and her mother, who supported her decision, reacted angrily at Cachita's aunt, telling her that Alberto had become a woman and her name was \\"Alina\\". == Later work == Cachita was famous among Univision TV viewers for her entrances to the El Gordo y la Flaca show: She always fell to the floor when she entered the studio. Since the show consists mainly of gossiping, Cachita was often brought in to talk about scandals; such was the case when she intervened on the show the Monday after Janet Jackson's \\"wardrobe malfunction\\" at the 2004 Super Bowl. Being a regular on El Gordo y La Flaca allowed Cachita to expand her career: she also worked as a reporter at some award shows, like Premios Lo Nuestro and others.

He is a current non-official member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong. He co-founded the Civic Party and was a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, representing the New Territories East constituency from 2004 until he quit the party and resigned from the legislature on 22 June 2015, following the historic vote on Hong Kong electoral reform a few days earlier, having switched his political alignment from pro-democracy to pro-Beijing Hong Kong political group Path of Democracy, of which he is currently the convener. ==Education and legal career== Tong was born in Hong Kong in 1950. His ancestral hometown is Xinhui, Guangdong province. He attended Queen's College, Hong Kong and studied Law at the University of Hong Kong, where he graduated top of his class and with first- class honours. He then further received his Bachelor of Civil Law degree from St Edmund Hall, Oxford. He was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple and achieved top marks in the Bar Exams.Legco website He took silk in 1990 and was the chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association from 1999 to 2001. He continues to practice from Temple Chambers, where he served as Head of Chambers from 2001 to 2006. Eight days after his election as Bar chairman on 21 January 1999, the Court of Final Appeal ruled that mainland Chinese children born before their parents became Hong Kong permanent residents were entitled to right of abode in the city. In June 1999, the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) made an interpretation of the Basic Law that effectively overruled the city's top court in the case. Tong opposed the NPCSC's interpretation, warning that a \\"Damocles sword\\" was hanging over the head of the Court of Final Appeal as a result of the government's refusal to rule out requesting Beijing to interpret the law in future cases. He said the failure to make a public promise not to seek further interpretations of the Basic Law from Beijing had damaged public confidence in the rule of law. \\"Confidence in our legal system and the independence of our judiciary are bound to suffer,\\" he said in his annual report to barristers. Tong also targeted then Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie's handling of the Sally Aw Sian case, in which the publishing tycoon was not prosecuted for a fraud plot involving her company although she was named as a conspirator in the charges. Tong sat as a Deputy High Court Judge in 2002.\\"G.N. 1989\\", Hong Kong Government Gazette (No. 14, Vol. 6, 4 April 2002) ==Early political career== He ran in the 2002 Election Committee Subsector by-elections in the Legal sub- sector, which was responsible for electing the Chief Executive of Hong Kong in the 2002 election. In 2002, he co-founded the Article 23 Concern Group with former Bar Association chairmen Audrey Eu Yuet-mee and Alan Leong Kah-kit, to oppose the government's attempt to implement Article 23 of the Basic Law, which they believed posed a threat to civil liberties and basic freedoms. He entered the spotlight as a legal expert when half a million Hong Kong people took to the streets in 2003 to protest against the proposed Article 23 anti- subversion bill that was later shelved. After 1 July protest, the group transformed into the Article 45 Concern Group to call for universal suffrage in 2007 and 2008, as required under Article 45 of the Basic Law . ==Legislative Councillor== In the 2004 Legislative Council election, he and fellow barristers from the group Audrey Eu Yuet-mee and Alan Leong Kah-kit ran for the geographical constituency direct elections. Tong combined with the other pro-democrats with a joint list in the New Territories East, where he was placed behind the Democratic Party's Andrew Cheng Kar-foo and The Frontier's Emily Lau Wai-hing. The list received more than 160,000 votes which Cheng, Lau and Tong were elected. In March 2006, he and members of the Article 45 Concern Group co-founded the Civic Party and he became a member of the party's executive committee. In the 2008 and 2012 Legislative Council elections, he was re-elected to represent New Territories East. In the 2011 District Council election, he ran in the City One hoping for entering the new District Council (Second) constituency race created under the 2012 constitutional reform package but was defeated by pro-Beijing independent Wong Ka-wing. ===2010 electoral reform=== As a moderate pan-democrat, Tong opposed the party's decision in January 2010 to join the \\"Five Constituencies Referendum\\", in which five democratic legislators, representative of the bloc, resigned and re-stood in their constituencies as a de facto referendum over the 2012 constitutional reform package, an action that was heavily criticised by Beijing. Tong intended to vote for the modified reform package, but was required to vote with the rest of Civic Party to oppose it. ===2015 electoral reform=== During the debate over the electoral reform over the 2017 Chief Executive election, Tong publicly criticised as unreasonable the pan- democrats' support of party or public nomination for chief executive candidates. He put forward a more moderate proposal in October 2013. The proposal suggested increasing the membership of the nominating committee from the 1,200-member Election Committee to 1,514, while maintaining the nomination threshold of 150 votes. Tong recommended the instant runoff voting system, which is used in Ireland, Australia, Sri Lanka; in mayoral elections in London, San Francisco; and in elections for some state governors in the United States, to elect a CE who could be acceptable to all sectors. Tong also advocated repealing an existing law which disallows the Chief Executive belonging to a political party membership. On 31 August 2014, when Beijing announced its decision constraining Hong Kong's political reform, which would spark the 2014 Hong Kong protests, Tong was immediately critical, vowing to vote against it, which cast severe doubt on the government's ability to win the two-thirds majority a reform package needed in the Legislative Council. He cried as he reacted on a live Cable TV programme. \\"It is the darkest day in the road for democracy,\\" he said. \\"I am disheartened ‚Ä¶ I don't see a future for moderates in Hong Kong politics.\\" A moderate reform plan he drew up ‚Äì under which the public would not be allowed to nominate chief executive candidates ‚Äì received a cool response from his allies. The barrister said he would think carefully about the next step in his political career after a decision from Beijing that was \\"more undemocratic than I could imagine\\". \\"I thought there would be [some] chance for future dialogue,\\" he said, referring to when pan-democrats were invited for talks with Beijing officials the previous month. \\"But now, I don't see any chance.\\" He eventually voted against the unmodified proposal with other pan-democrat legislators. On 8 June 2015, before the vote, he set up a think tank Path of Democracy, composed of moderate democrats. ===Resignation from party and Legco=== On 6 December 2014, Tong stepped down from the executive of the Civic Party that he co- founded.Ronny Tong, co-founder of pan-democrat Civic Party leaves executive, SCMP, 7 Dec 2014 On 22 June 2015, a few days after the legislative vote, he announced that he would quit as a member of the party, saying that since the end of 2009, the Civic Party's line had deviated from its founding values. He would also resign from the Legislative Council saying it was inappropriate for him to continue having stood and been elected representing the Civic Party. ===2020 Defence of new security law=== He appeared on the BBC show \\"Hard Talk\\" where he defended the new security law. He said, \\"I am still fighting for democracy for Hong Kong, but is [sic] no way to fight democracy by trying to call for independence is there? Is there any real chance for anybody in Hong Kong or elsewhere, seriously think that by calling for independence to Hong Kong would succeed in getting full democracy established in Hong Kong?\\" ==Executive Councillor== He was seen as a supporter of Carrie Lam in the 2017 Chief Executive election.

It was regarded as \\"the most brilliant and successful of the English wartime research establishments\\" under \\"Rowe, who saw more of the English scientific choices between 1935 and 1945 than any single man.\\" The name was changed to Radar Research Establishment in 1953, and again to the Royal Radar Establishment in 1957. This article covers the precursor organizations and the Telecommunications Research Establishment up to the time of the name change. The later work at the site is described in the separate article about RRE. ==History== TRE is best known for work on defensive and offensive radar. TRE also made substantial contributions to radio-navigation and to jamming enemy radio- navigation. Radar dominates the history. The organization was originally at Bawdsey, later moving to Dundee and then Worth Matravers ('Swanage'), where it was renamed TRE. It subsequently moved to Malvern and then amalgamated with other establishments to become the Royal Radar Establishment. ===Bawdsey=== The development of radar in the United Kingdom was started by Sir Henry Tizard's Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence in 1935. Experimental work was begun under the direction of Robert Watson-Watt at Orfordness near Ipswich. Looking for a suitable permanent location, one of the team members recalled an empty manor house a short distance south of Orfordness and the location became Bawdsey Research Station (BRS) in 1936. At that time the team became known as the Air Ministry Experimental Station (AMES). ===Dundee=== Bawdsey was only a short E-boat dash across the English Channel from France, a fact that was not lost on the Air Ministry. Watson-Watt planned to move the teams to a safer location in the event of war, and approached the rector of his alma mater, University College at Dundee. It is not clear whose fault it was, but when the war opened in 1939 the AMES teams rushed to Dundee they found the rector was only dimly aware of the earlier conversation and nothing had been prepared. By this time the students had returned for the autumn term and consequently there was little room for the researchers. In addition to lacking room at the University, the teams working on Airborne Interception radar (AI) were sent to RAF Scone, a small, formerly civilian airfield near Perth that was entirely unsuited to the scale of their work. Complaints by one of the AI team members worked their way up to higher levels of the Ministry, which led to a search for a more suitable location. Late in the year, the AI team was moved to RAF St Athan in Wales, but ultimately found the location to be only marginally better than Perth. The \\"Army Cell\\" that had formed to take advantage of the AMES research initially followed their moves. In 1941 they moved to join their colleagues of the Air Defence Experimental Establishment who had recently moved from RAF Biggin Hill to Christchurch, Dorset on the south coast of England. The merged group became the Air Defence Research and Development Establishment (ADRDE). ===Worth Matravers=== By the early part of 1940 it was clear that the location in Dundee was not going to work in the long term. A new location was ultimately selected west of Worth Matravers on the south coast of England, a short distance from the ADRDE teams. The location had a number of advantages, including good views over the English Channel not unlike the ones they had at Bawdsey. However, there was also no infrastructure at the site, which had to be hurriedly prepared. As there was no real village at the site, the location is often referred to as Swanage, a small town a short distance to the east. The move took place in late May 1940, and further annoyance was created when the careful planning for the move was upset with the AI team arrived first. On arrival, what was AMES was renamed again as the Ministry of Aircraft Production Research Establishment (MAPRE). It was established as the central research group for RAF applications of radar. The name was once again changed to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in November 1940. ===Malvern=== In parallel with these technical developments, the Ministry of Home Security developed a plan, early in 1939, \\"to evacuate the critical functions of government out of London\\" if a threat of air raids developed. A site was purchased in Malvern for the Ministry itself. Although it was not developed, the location had become well known to defence officials.\\"Former DERA site, Great Malvern. Cotswold Archaeology\\" The Air Ministry acquired jurisdiction, and used the site for a Signals Training Establishment, housed in prefabricated one storey buildings. In May 1942, the Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE) was set up on the site, to develop truck mounted early warning radars. In the second week of February 1942, the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau escaped from Brest in the Channel Dash. They were undetected until well into the English Channel because German ground forces had gradually increased the jamming of British radar over a period of weeks. The British command had not realized this was happening. In the aftermath, Lord Mountbatten and Winston Churchill approved plans for a raid on the German radar station at Bruneval, near Le Havre. The landing party included D. H. Priest, of TRE. The Bruneval raid (also called the Biting raid) captured a German Wurzburg radar system and a radar operator. These were taken to TRE. During the weeks that followed, the British authorities became concerned that the Germans would retaliate in kind. When intelligence reported the arrival of a German paratroop battalion across the Channel in May, the staff of TRE pulled out of the Swanage site in a period of hours. The former Telecommunications Research Establishment moved to Malvern, taking up residence in the buildings of Malvern College, an independent boys' boarding school. The move, which was carried out in great urgency, is described in detail by Reginald Jones in his book Most Secret War: British Scientific Intelligence 1939-1945. At the end of the war TRE moved from Malvern College, to HMS Duke, a Royal Navy training school, about a mile away in St. Andrews Road adjacent to the area of Barnards Green. ==Research and development== ===Radio navigation=== Radio navigation (navigational beam) systems are based on the transmission of pulsed radio beams that are detected by aircraft. R. J. Dippy devised the GEE (also called AMES Type 7000) radio navigation system at TRE, where it was developed into a powerful instrument for increasing the accuracy of bombing raids. ===Radio jamming=== The counter measure to radio navigation was jamming. R. V. Jones was the MI6 science advisor and TRE staff worked closely with him, in countering the Luftwaffe's navigational beam technology to hamper the enemy's ability to do pinpoint night bombing raids in what has become known as the \\"battle of the beams\\". Robert Cockburn of the TRE was responsible for the development of the Jostle IV radio jammer - the most powerful jammer device used over Europe. At 2 kW output it could block all VHF transmissions over 32-48 MHz. However, enclosed in its own pressurised container, (to prevent arcing of the high voltages inside), it was large and at 600 lb took up the entirety of the bomb bay of the Boeing Fortresses used by No. 100 Group RAF. Due to the high transmitter power, test flights had to be carried out in the vicinity of Iceland, otherwise the jamming would have blanked out all frequencies in the specified range, over a large area, as well as giving the Germans warning of the impending arrival of a jamming system. ===Radar=== The development of radar for defensive and offensive operations was of paramount concern during the war. Early work was on Airborne Interception radar (AI) able to be carried in night fighters and used for locating enemy aircraft in the dark, as Britain was soon facing The Blitz. The first tests had been carried out as early as 1936-7 using a Handley Page Heyford and later an Avro Anson at the initial suggestion of Henry Tizard then Chairman of the Aeronautical Research Committee. Initial aircraft used operationally were Bristol Blenheims converted to fighters with belly gun packs, followed by a brief usage of the AI-equipped Turbinlite Douglas Havoc paired with Hawker Hurricanes, but later the Bristol Beaufighter was chosen, followed by the de Havilland Mosquito which later became the standard RAF night fighter for the remainder of the war. Initial versions of AI were metric-wavelength, the antennas being arrow-shaped or dipoles, later centimetric versions used a rotating paraboloid aerial carried under a streamlined nose radome. Airborne Interception radar progressed from the initial AI Mk I version to the AI Mk 24 Foxhunter used in the Panavia Tornado. Parallel work was carried out on Air-to-Surface-Vessel radar (ASV) for use by Coastal Command aircraft for hunting U-boats at sea, initially using the Lockheed Hudson equipped with an early version of ASV. Success with the new equipment led to mounting the equipment onto Vickers Wellingtons and Sunderland flying boats, the early metric-wavelength ASV-equipped types carrying an array of transmitting and receiving \\"Stickleback\\" aerials on the rear fuselage top and sides and under the wings. Later a version of the centimetric-wavelength H2S was used. ASV-equipped aircraft such as the Wellington, Sunderland, Catalina and Liberator, made a substantial contribution to winning the Battle of the Atlantic for the Allies. ASV- equipped Fairey Swordfish and Fairey Barracudas were carried on board aircraft carriers, the Swordfish being flown from the smaller escort carriers where they formed a valuable anti-submarine presence when used over the numerous North Atlantic convoys. The Oboe blind bombing system was designed and developed by Frank Jones at TRE in collaboration with Alec Reeves at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Oboe transponders were fitted to Mosquitoes of 109 Squadron, which developed the use of the device as part of the Pathfinder Force. The Mosquito was chosen because the transponder device mounted in the airplane was not large, and its use required the aircraft to fly for 10 minutes on a straight and level course. That being the case speed was essential to avoid being intercepted. In addition, the Mosquito could reach 30,000 feet altitude, and this improved the range across the continent that the device could be used over. The H2S radar used the newly developed cavity magnetron. It was carried by RAF bombers to identify ground targets for night and all-weather bombing. Initial trials were with a Handley Page Halifax and despite setbacks the equipment later became a standard fitting on Halifaxes, Short Stirlings and Avro Lancasters. It was also fitted to the post-war Vickers Valiant, Avro Vulcan, Handley Page Victor, and bomber versions of the English Electric Canberra. H2S in its final form of H2S Mk 9 was still being used on Vulcans as late as the 1982 Falklands War. C. E. Wynn-Williams worked on these navigational radars, but was transferred to cryptographic work at Bletchley Park. The Automatic Gun-Laying Turret (AGLT) was an airborne radar used in bombers by the gunners against attack by fighter planes. It was designed by Philip Dee and developed by Alan Hodgkin. The device allowed a turret gunner to fire at and hit a target without ever needing to see it. Known by the codename 'Village Inn', the AGLT was installed in a number of Lancasters and Halifaxes and used operationally during the war, and was also fitted on some post-war Avro Lincolns. Radar trainers were designed and developed by Geoffrey Dummer. The priority that Winston Churchill placed on the development and deployment of radar is described by Sir Bernard Lovell:Bernard Lovell, Any news, any problems, New Scientist, 25 November 1982; Every day Sir Robert Renwick would phone Lovell or Dee, asking \\"any news, any problems\\" [and these would be] dealt with by Renwick's immediate access to Churchill. ===Other work=== Radar jamming was developed by Robert Cockburn. The resulting devices, such as Mandrel, Carpet, Piperack, and Jostle, were carried or used by aircraft of No. 100 Group RAF for radio countermeasures and ECM purposes to combat the increasing German night fighter force then opposing the RAF night attacks on Germany. Cathode ray tubes, for radar display, and a variety of electronic components were developed under direction of Geoffrey Dummer. Flight simulators were developed by A.M. Uttley.http://noosanakainisis.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/ratio-club.html Electronic computer systems were developed by Philip Woodward. In 1942 the staffing level was about 2000 people; by 1945 increased electronics production had increased this number to around 3500 staff. ==Successor organisations== TRE was combined with the Radar Research and Development Establishment in 1953 to form the Radar Research Establishment. This was renamed the Royal Radar Establishment in 1957. It became the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment in 1976 when the Army Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRDE) moved to Malvern. It was made part of the Defence Research Agency (DRA) in April 1991. This was renamed Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) in April 1995. In July 2000 it was split into two entities comprising the private sector company QinetiQ, and the wholly government owned Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). ==Staff and their contributions== Staff were affectionately known as boffins.

The concerto has three movements: #Allegro maestoso; in common time. The tempo marking is in Mozart's catalog of his own works, but not in the autograph manuscript.Neue Mozart-Ausgabe #Andante in F major. In both the autograph score and in his personal catalog, Mozart notated the meter as alla breve. #Allegro vivace assai The opening movement begins quietly with a march figure, but quickly moves to a more lyrical melody interspersed with a fanfare in the winds. The music grows abruptly in volume, with the violins taking up the principal melody over the march theme, which is now played by the brass. This uplifting theme transitions to a brief, quieter interlude distinguished by a sighing motif in the brass. The march returns, eventually transitioning to the entrance of the soloist. The soloist plays a brief Eingang (a type of abbreviated cadenza) before resolving to a trill on the dominant G while the strings play the march in C major. The piano then introduces new material in C major and begins transitioning to the dominant key of G major. Immediately after an orchestral cadence finally announces the arrival of the dominant, the music abruptly shifts to G minor in a passage that is reminiscent of the main theme of the Symphony No. 40 in that key. A series of rising and falling chromatic scales then transition the music to the true second theme of the piece, an ebullient G major theme, which can also be heard in Mozart's Third Horn Concerto. The usual development and recapitulation follow. There is a cadenza at the end of the movement, although Mozart's original has been lost. The famous Andante, in the subdominant key of F major, is in three parts. The opening section is for orchestra only and features muted strings. The first violins play with a dreamlike melody over an accompaniment consisting of second violins and violas playing repeated-note triplets and the cellos and bass playing pizzicato arpeggios. All of the main melodic material of the movement is contained in this orchestral introduction, in either F major or F minor. The second section introduces the solo piano and starts off in F major. It is not a literal repeat, though, as after the first few phrases, new material is interjected which ventures off into different keys. When familiar material returns, the music is now in the dominant keys of C minor and C major. Then it modulates to G minor, then B-flat major, then F minor, which transitions to the third section of the movement. The third section begins with the dreamlike melody again, but this time in the relative key of F major's parallel key, A-flat major. Over the course of this final section, the music makes its way back to the tonic keys of F minor and then F major and a short coda concludes the movement. The final rondo movement begins with the full orchestra espousing a joyous \\"jumping\\" theme. After a short cadenza, the piano joins in and further elaborates. A \\"call and response\\" style is apparent, with the piano and ensemble exchanging parts fluidly. The soloist gets scale and arpeggio figurations that enhance the themes, as well as a short cadenza that leads right back to the main theme. The main theme appears one final time, leading to an upward rush of scales that ends on a triumphant note. ==Cultural references== The opening of the second movement in Mozart's handwriting. The second movement was featured in the 1967 Swedish film Elvira Madigan. As a result, the piece has become widely known as the Elvira Madigan concerto. Neil Diamond's 1972 song \\"Song Sung Blue\\" was based on a theme from the andante movement of the concerto. == References == == External links == * * 21 Category:Compositions in C major Category:1785 compositions ","title":"Piano Concerto No. 21 (Mozart)"},{"id":"1444239","text":"Dale Head is a fell in the north-western sector of the Lake District, in northern England. It is 753 metres or 2,470 feet above sea level and stands immediately north of Honister Pass, the road between Borrowdale and Buttermere. ==Topography== The North-Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. Dale Head is the highest fell in the southern sector. Dale Head is the apex of two hill ridges. The principal ridge descends from Dale Head to the north-east and forms several other fells, each given a chapter by Alfred Wainwright in his Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells. These are High Spy, Maiden Moor and Catbells (alternative spelling, Cat Bells). This ridge forms the western side of Borrowdale and overlooks Derwent Water. The other ridge descends to the north-west and includes the fells of Hindscarth and Robinson; it overlooks Gatescarthdale and Buttermere. Dale Head is named for its position at the head of the Newlands Valley. This stretches away due north for three and a half miles before debouching into the floodplain of the Derwent between Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite Lake. The eastern wall of the valley is formed by the High Spy to Catbells ridge, separating it from Borrowdale. Entering on the western side are a series of side valleys which drain the main mass of the North Western Fells. The source of Newlands Beck does not however flow from the apex of Dale Head as might be supposed from the name. Instead it has its birth at the col between the main summit and the eastern top, High Scawdel (1,815 ft). The northern face of the fell forming the dalehead is ringed with crags. The main faces are Dalehead Crags and Great Gable, not to be confused with the fell of that name. The southern flank of the fell running down to the summit of the Honister Pass road (1,180 ft) has much gentler slopes, although there is outcropping rock on either side. Buckstone Hows and Yew Crag overshadow the road. From the top of the pass Gatesgarthdale Beck runs north west to Buttermere while Hause Gill flows east to Seatoller and Borrowdale. Across the road is Grey Knotts in the Western Fells. The ridge to Hindscarth departs north west from the summit of Dale Head, soon narrowing into the fine and airy Hindscarth Edge. Both slopes are rocky, that to the south being known as Molds. Far Tongue Gill descends from the north of the ridge, a tributary of Newlands Beck. Although High Scawdel stands east of the main summit, the high ground takes a great loop to the south around the head of Newlands Beck. It then drives north to the depression at Wilson's Bield (1,655 ft) before climbing to the summit of High Spy. The rest of the North Western Fells bear no tarns worthy of the name, but Dale Head has two. On the northern slope near the source of Newlands Beck is Dalehead Tarn, while the smaller Launchy Tarn lies near the top of High Scawdel. Dalehead Tarn is a shallow pool providing a popular stopping place for walkers. Its varied flora include water horsetail, sedge and bogbean. Launchy Tarn is smaller and may have been formed by overgrazing and erosion of the underlying peat.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): ==Geology== Dale Head stands at the junction of the two main Lakeland geological systems, the Skiddaw slates to the north and the Borrowdale Volcanics to the south. On the northern flanks are outcrops of the Buttermere Formation, olistostrome of disrupted sheared mudstone, siltstone and sandstone. Southward march the Borrowdale series beginning with the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation, visible near the summit.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) The fell has seen extensive mining history. Dale Head Mine was driven below the northern crags for copper, several levels still being visible. Long Work was another copper mine a little further down the valley, worked for malachite and pyrite from Elizabethan times. On the southern flank of the fell, centred on the head of the pass, are the Honister Quarries. These are an extensive system of underground quarries, worked for Green Slate. The earliest extant records date from 1728 and since then huge caverns have been carved out on either side of the pass. The Yew Crag workings on the Dale Head side were operated until 1966, operations on the slopes of Grey Knotts continuing. In 1887 work began to drive a tunnel right under Dale Head into Newlands Valley, connecting with a proposed tramway to join the railway at Keswick. The scheme was abandoned after opposition from landowners. The main workers accommodation at the mine is now the Honister Hause Youth Hostel.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) ==Summit== The view of the rightThe summit is marked by a cairn standing on the brink of the northern face. There is a fine end-on view of the Newlands Valley to the north, backed by Skiddaw. All around are rank upon rank of fells, of the major Lakeland ranges only the High Street group not being fully visible.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6, The North Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1964): Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): ==Ascents== One of the most popular ascent routes of Dale Head begins from the summit of Honister Pass, where there is a car park and a youth hostel. The route ascends directly alongside a fence for approximately 2 kilometres and would take the average walker some 45 or 50 minutes. Longer routes begin at Little Town in the Newlands Valley, climbing either via Dalehead Tarn or the old access track to Dale Head Mine. From Borrowdale a start can be made at either Seatoller or Longthwaite, ascending first to Launchy Tarn and High Scawdel. ==References== Category:Marilyns of England Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls Category:Allerdale ","title":"Dale Head"},{"id":"1444248","text":"Robinson seen from the Ard Crags ridge, with Hindscarth to the left sketch map of Robinson Robinson is a fell in the English Lake District, its southern slopes descending to Buttermere, while its northern side is set in the Newlands Valley. Paths lead to the summit from the village of Buttermere, from the nearby summit Dale Head and from various locations in the valleys to the north. ==Name== According to influential guidebook author Alfred Wainwright,Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6, The North Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1964): the name Robinson comes from a Richard Robinson who purchased estates in the Buttermere area many centuries ago. These included this unnamed hill which was then called \\"Robinson's Fell\\", later shortened to Robinson. ==Topography== The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north‚Äìsouth axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. Robinson stands in the southern sector. The principal ridge in this group of fells runs east from Buttermere, climbing over Robinson, Hindscarth and Dale Head. It then turns north, descending gradually toward Derwentwater, the main tops being High Spy, Maiden Moor and Catbells. Robinson appears bland from Buttermere, smooth rounded slopes curving up from the valley floor. Viewed from Keswick or Newlands to the north, its character is altogether different. From here the wall of Robinson Crags drops from the summit of the fell, a great chunk of the hillside seemingly missing. The western flanks of the fell fall to Buttermere, the village itself standing on Robinson's territory. The top and bottom sections are quite steep but the slope levels out at 1,500 ft to accommodate Buttermere Moss, in Wainwright's words ‚Äú a wide marshy depression from which water cannot escape except by being carried away in the boots of pedestrians.‚Äù At the head of the lower slope is the subsidiary top of High Snockrigg (1,725 ft), a fine viewpoint for the Buttermere valley. On the south western rim of the Moss is Goat Crag, overlooking Buttermere lake. To the south of Robinson are Gatesgarthdale Beck and the road up Honister Pass. This side of the fell presents a long and mainly featureless slope, although near the summit are the Hackney Holes, curious rocky depressions of uncertain origin (but see Geology section). Running south east from the summit is Littledale Edge, an airy escarpment which connects to the neighbouring fell of Hindscarth. To the north of the Edge is a steady descent into the head of Little Dale, part of the Newlands catchment. This valley runs north east, flanked by parallel ridges descending from Robinson and Hindscarth, its stream being named Scope Beck. Robinson's north east ridge is rough and craggy towards the top before levelling out onto the grassy spur of High Snab Bank. This finally runs down to Newlands Church and the hamlet of Little Town. Beneath the nose of the ridge is the confluence of Scope Beck and Keskadale Beck. Keskadale forms the north western boundary of Robinson and is also the route of Newlands Pass, crossing the North Western Fells from Braithwaite to Buttermere. Its summit at Newlands Hause (1,092 ft) lies beneath the northern edge of Buttermere Moss, from which the waterfall of Moss Force drops within easy reach of the road. ==Geology== Robinson's summit area is composed of rocks of the Buttermere Formation. This is an olistostrome of disrupted, sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and sandstone. West and north east of the summit are outcroppings of the Robinson Member. This comprises large olistoliths of greywacke sandstone, with interbedded mudstone and siltstone. The southern flanks are a large area of landslip.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) There has been considerable mining activity in the vicinity, particularly at the Goldscope Mine, but this has all taken place beneath the slopes of neighbouring Hindscarth. The remains of a small reservoir can still be seen in Little Dale. Robinson itself has a pair of short levels driven for lead, near to the south east corner of Buttermere lake. They appear not to have progressed beyond trials.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Looking north-west from the summit to the Coledale Fells. The mysterious Hackney Holes are now interpreted as the source of the largest 'rock slope failure' in the Lake District (1.3 sq. km.), where most of the Buttermere-Gatesgarthdale trough wall has deformed and bulged downslope, leaving open trenches (the Holes) or, across the Little Dale col, a chevron pattern of short steep scarps; midslope, there are bold antiscarps (uphill-facing scarplets), a classic indicator.Wilson PW and Jarman D (2015b): The Robinson rock slope failure. In McDougall DA and Evans DJA (eds), The Quaternary of the Lake District - Field Guide. Quaternary Research Association, London, 201-211 Littledale Edge marks the beheading of the original dale by the more vigorous Buttermere valley, fed by ice escaping through Honister Pass from Borrowdale. This geologically recent deep incision has destabilised the slope. ==Summit== The top is rounded and mainly of grass, but there are two low outcrops of rock with loose stones between. The more westerly of these is the summit and bears a cairn. There is another prominent cairn at the top of the north east ridge. From below this appears to be the summit, but disappointment awaits anyone so deceived by the convex slope. Fair paths run to Buttermere, Littledale Edge and the north east ridge, once the grass is reached. The view is robbed of foreground by the broad plateau of the summit, but serried ranks of fells appear in all directions. All of the principal groups with the exception of the Far Eastern Fells are in sight. ==Ascents== High Snockrigg seen from near the foot of Buttermere Buttermere Village provides a popular starting point, a good path leading up via High Snockrigg. Conditions deteriorate at the crossing of Buttermere Moss, followed by a stiff climb to the summit. Another route from Buttermere begins further south at Hassness, working around Goat Crag to join the main path above the moss. Access can also be gained from the Honister Pass road, from a point near the first bridge over the beck at about 500 ft. From here a direct line northward will bring the walker to Littledale Edge. The north east ridge provides an excellent walk from the Newlands valley, rising up successive steps. Finally a great deal of height can be gained by car, if the fell is climbed from Newlands Hause. The route ascends to the right of Moss Force, before the path is lost for a while in the Moss itself. A rough climb to the summit then follows. By passing the Moss to the west, Newlands Hause provides speedy access to High Snockrigg for fine views and perhaps a picnic.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): ==References== Category:Marilyns of England Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls Category:Allerdale ","title":"Robinson (Lake District)"},{"id":"1444250","text":"Supernatural fiction or supernaturalist fiction is a genre of speculative fiction that exploits or is centered on supernatural themes, often violating naturalist assumptions of the real world. == Description == In its broadest definition, supernatural fiction overlaps with examples of weird fiction, horror fiction, vampire literature, ghost story, and fantasy. Elements of supernatural fiction can be found in writing from the genre of science fiction. Amongst academics, readers and collectors, however, supernatural fiction is often classed as a discrete genre defined by the elimination of \\"horror\\", \\"fantasy\\", and elements important to other genres. The one genre supernatural fiction appears to embrace in its entirety is the traditional ghost story. The fantasy and supernatural fiction genres would often overlap and may be confused each for each other, though there exists some crucial differences between the two genres. Fantasy usually takes place in another world, where strange creatures or magic are normal. A fantasy story is most often about the characters who live among the magic rather than the magical aspects of the world. Whereas supernatural fiction specifically highlights supernatural creatures or happenings within the real world, and is usually set in present day, but may be a realistic historical setting. In a supernatural setting, magic and monsters are not the norm, and the mystery of such things is usually closely intertwined in the plot. Moreover, supernatural fiction also tends to focus on suspense and mystery, and less on action and adventure. Occult detective fiction combines the tropes of supernatural fiction with those of detective fiction. Supernatural fiction and drama has supernatural elements blended into a story about the characters internal conflict and/or a dramatic conflict between the protagonist, human and/or supernatural world, society and between groups. ==Origin== The author of The Rise of Supernatural Fiction, 1762‚Äì1800 states that the origins of supernatural fiction come from Britain in the second half of the eighteenth century. Accounts of a ghost appearing on Cock Lane were featured in the newspapers in 1762, and an interest in Spiritualism was also currently prevalent. There was a need for people to see real ghosts and experience them vicariously through the writings of fiction. S. L. Varnado argues in Haunted Presence: The Numinous in Gothic Fiction that the beginning of an interest in the supernatural comes from humanity's craving for the experience of the divine, so that even the old mythological tales of the knights of King Arthur give the reader a sense of the presence of \\"holy\\" things. The author does then go on to trace this influence further into the future with the Gothic literature movement. The famous horror writer H. P. Lovecraft cites man's fear of the unknown as the origin of supernatural fiction in his excellent essay \\"Supernatural Horror in Literature\\". He also goes on to describe the literary genre's roots in Gothic literature. The description in Wuthering Heights of the natural surroundings in which the novel takes place and the eerie mood it evokes, is cited as one of the first instances of supernatural horror's being evoked in literature. In the twentieth century, supernatural fiction became associated with psychological fiction. The result is that the supernatural is only one possible explanation for what has been described. A classic example of this would be The Turn of the Screw by Henry James, which offers both a supernatural and a psychological interpretation of the events described. The ambiguity is considered to add to the effect. A similar example is Charlotte Perkins Gilman's story \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\". ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * \\"Supernatural Fiction\\", entry in John Clute and John Grant, eds., The Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1997) Category:Speculative fiction ","title":"Supernatural fiction"},{"id":"1444260","text":"The Japur√° River or Caquet√° River is a river about long in the Amazon basin. It rises in Colombia and flows eastward through Brazil to join the Amazon River. ==Course== The river rises as the Caquet√° River in the Andes in southwest Colombia. The Caquet√° River rises near the sources of the Magdalena River, and augments its volume from many branches as it courses through Colombia. It flows southeast into Brazil, where it is called the Japur√°. The Japur√° enters the Amazon River through a network of channels. It is navigable by small boats in Brazil. West of the Rio Negro, the Solim√µes River (as the Amazon's upper Brazilian course is called) receives three more imposing streams from the northwest‚Äîthe Japur√°, the I√ß√° (referred to as the Putumayo before it crosses over into Brazil), and the Napo. ==Environment== For much of its length the river flows through the Purus v√°rzea ecoregion. The river is home to a wide variety of fish and reptiles, including enormous catfish weighing up to and measuring up to in length, electric eels, piranhas, turtles, and caimans. Much of the jungle through which the eastern Caquet√° originally flowed has been cleared for pasture, crops of rice, corn, manioc, and sugar cane, and in the past two decades, particularly coca crops. ==Navigation== The 19th-century Brazilian historian and geographer Jos√© Coelho da Gama e Abreu, the Baron of Maraj√≥, attributed of navigable stretches to it. Jules Crevaux, who descended it, described it as full of obstacles to navigation, the current very strong and the stream frequently interrupted by rapids and cataracts. It was initially supposed to have eight mouths, but colonial administrator Francisco Xavier Ribeiro Sampaio, in the historic report of his voyage of 1774, determined that there was but one real mouth, and that the supposed others are all furos or canos, as the diverting secondary channels of the Amazonian rivers are known. In 1864‚Äì1868, the Brazilian government made a somewhat careful examination of the Brazilian part of the river, as far up as the rapid of Cupati. Several very easy and almost complete water routes exist between the Japur√° and Negro across the low, flat intervening country. The Baron of Maraj√≥ wrote that there were six of them, and one which connects the upper Japur√° with the Vaup√©s branch of the Negro; thus the indigenous tribes of the respective valleys have easy contact with each other. The river serves as a principal means of transportation, being plied by tiny dugout canoes, larger ones, motorboats, and riverboats known locally as lanchas. The boats carry a multitude of cargoes, sometimes being chartered, sometimes even being traveling general stores. In the Colombian section, the presence of guerrillas and soldiers used to limit river traffic. ==See also== *Caquet√° Department ==References== ==External links== *Environmental information of Colombian Amazon region Category:Rivers of Amazonas (Brazilian state) Category:Rivers of Colombia Category:Tributaries of the Amazon River Category:International rivers of South America ","title":"Japur√° River"},{"id":"1444274","text":"Balkan music is a type of music found in the Balkan region of Southeastern Europe. The music is characterised by complex rhythm. Famous bands in Balkan music were Taraf de Ha√Ødouks, Fanfare Ciocarlia, and No Smoking Orchestra. == Historical musical influences == ===Byzantine medieval music=== Byzantine music (Greek: ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩŒÆ ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ∫ŒÆ) is associated with the medieval sacred chant of Christian Churches following the Constantinopolitan rite. Its modal system is based on the ancient Greek models. The development of large scale hymnographic forms begins in the fifth century with the rise of the kontakion, a long and elaborate metrical sermon, which finds its acme in the work of Romanos the Melodist (sixth century). Heirmoi in syllabic style are gathered in the Irmologion, a bulky volume which first appeared in the middle of the tenth century and contains over a thousand model troparia arranged into an octoechos (the eight-mode musical system) and the whole system of Byzantine music which is closely related to the music of ancient Greece. ===Greek music=== Greek folk music includes Demotika, Cretan and Nisiotika, Pontian, Laiko and Rebetiko. Greek music developed around the Balkans as a synthesis of elements of the music of the various areas of the Greek mainland and the Greek islands, with Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical chant, and a reference to music of Crete and Byzantine music. The music of the Aegean Islands, are known for Nisi√≥tika songs; Greek characteristics vary widely. Crete has a well known folk dance tradition; it includes swift dances like pentozalis. Most of the Greek folk songs are accompanied by Greek musical instruments like: lira, clarinet, guitar, violin and sometimes mandolin. Greek folk dances include Kalamatianos, Syrtos and Sousta. ===Ottoman music=== Dimitrie Cantemir was a composer of Ottoman music. Many musical instruments were introduced to the Balkans during the time of Ottoman control, but many Ottoman instruments were borrowed by the locals. \\"Balkan\\" is a Turkish word which means sharp mountains. As this the influence of Mehter and Turkish rhythms and melodies can be seen in Balkan Music. In the 19th century in imitation of the Turkish military bands which replaced the Mehterhane formations of Janissary Turks beginning in 1828. Apparently, as in Turkey, they dethroned the ancient traditional oboe (zurna, zurla, or mizmar) and double-membraned drum ensembles. == Pre-modern Balkan music == ===Traditional Bulgarian music=== Traditional folk instruments in Bulgarian music include various kinds of bagpipes (gaida and kaba gaida); drums (tapan); tarambuka; bells; daire; clapper; zilmasha; praportsi. Woodwind diple: zurla; kaval; duduk; dvoyanka; ocarina; accordion. String instruments: gadulka; tambura; fiddle; mandolin; guitar and gusle. ===Traditional Serbian music=== During the Nemanjic dynasty, musicians played an important role in the royal court, and were known as sviralnici, glumci and praskavnici. Other rulers known for the musical patronage included Stefan Du≈°an, Stefan Lazareviƒá, and ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. Medieval musical instruments included horns, trumpets, lutes, psalteries and cymbals. == Derivatives and world music == ===Romanian brass band=== Fanfare CiocƒÉrlia got many fans in Europe with their powerful brass sound appealing to rock and rave fans as well as the world music audience. In 1997 Ernst and Neumann took Fanfare CiocƒÉrlia into Bucharest's Studio Electrecord to record their debut album. The album, Radio Pascani, was released on the Berlin record label Piranha Musik in 1998 and proved an instant success. Another popular band in Romania was Taraf de Ha√Ødouks.http://www.nonesuch.com/artists/taraf- de-haidouks ===Progressive Balkan folk=== Progressive Balkan folk has seen rise in many western countries, particularly the United States. It has had its greatest success with progressive communities across the country. Younger American generations are discovering the possibilities of this genre and are bringing it to small clubs and festivals across the US. The upbeat, dramatic tone of the music has also attracted a following in the Tribal Fusion bellydance community. Tribal Fusion does not claim to emulate traditional dances, costume or music styles strictly, but it does draw inspiration from Balkan traditions. ===Balkan soul and funk=== Bay Area, CA band Inspector Gadje plays mainly traditional and contemporary balkan dance tunes, but because of the varied background of its musicians, elements of jazz and experimental music can be heard. Brooklyn-based Slavic Soul Party! is a virtuoso ensemble of brass musicians that infuse traditional balkan rhythms and beats with jazz, soul, funk and the energy of dance pop. British based band Sam and the Womp have rooted their music in the Balkan funk style to create a modern feel along with catchy and energetic rhythm. American based artist Balkan Bump mixes Balkan Brass traditions with Electronic Music and Hip Hop. ===Flamenco Balkan crossover=== Another popular exploration has been between Balkan music and other styles around the Mediterran like Flamenco, Jazz and Middle-Eastern music. Vancouver based act Ivan Tucakov and Tambura Rasa explores this style and beyond. === Balkan beats === Traditional Balkan music mixed with modern, electronic beats: this genre first appeared in the Berlin underground scene in the mid-1990s. The term was coined by Berlin DJ Robert Soko, whose BalkanBeats monthly parties still continue nowadays. It then spread to the European and world scene, to become an established genre nowadays. ==Music per country== *Music of Albania *Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina *Music of Bulgaria *Music of Cyprus

Nc3 Nf6 :3. Bc4 Nxe4 or it can be reached by transposition from the Bishop's Opening: :2. Bc4 Nf6 :3. Nc3 Nxe4 The opening involves many complications; however, with accurate play the opening is viable for both sides. The variation was given its name by Tim Harding in his 1976 book on the Vienna Game, in which he said that the bloodthirstiness of the character of play was such that \\"a game between Dracula and the Frankenstein Monster would not seem out of place.\\" The line is rarely seen in top-level play. Ivanchuk used the opening against Viswanathan Anand in Roquebrune in 1992 in a game that ended in a draw. Alexei Shirov also played it as Black in a simultaneous exhibition in Canada 2011. In 2019, Hikaru Nakamura played the opening in a rapid game in St. Louis against Jan-Krzysztof Duda. ==Annotated moves== 1\\\\. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 :Another common way of reaching the same position is 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 (Bishop's Opening) Nf6 3.Nc3. 3... Nxe4 :This move defines the Frankenstein‚ÄìDracula Variation. White cannot win immediately, since 4.Nxe4 brings 4...d5. 4\\\\. Qh5 :4.Nxe4 d5 is considered to give Black no problems. 4.Bxf7+ Kxf7 5.Nxe4 is considered good for Black as long as he avoids 5...Nc6 (5...d5) 6.Qf3+ Kg8 7.Ng5! and White wins (7...Qxg5 8.Qd5). 4.Qh5 threatens Qxf7#, a threat that White continues to renew in this line. 4... Nd6 :This move is the only good response to White's dual threats against f7 and e5; 4...Ng5 would be met by 5.d4 Ne6 6.dxe5 with some advantage. Also possible is 6.d5, when 6...g6 loses to 7.dxe6, as in B√∂√∂k‚ÄìHeidenheimo 1925. Instead, 6.d5 Nd4 led to very complicated play in Kis‚ÄìCsato, Hungarian Team Championship 1993. 5\\\\. Bb3 :Swedish grandmaster Ulf Andersson recommended 5.Qxe5+ Qe7 6.Qxe7+ Bxe7 7.Be2, claiming that White has some advantage. (See Harding's 1998 column cited below.) 5... Nc6 :5...Be7 (returning the pawn) is a alternative, for example 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Nxe5 0-0 8.0-0 Nxe5 9.Qxe5 Bf6 10.Qf4 Ne8 11.d4 c6 12.d5; however, White has a better game (Larsen; Nielsen‚ÄìMuir, corr. 1971). 6\\\\. Nb5 g6 7. Qf3 f5 :David Bronstein once won a game with 7...f6 8.Nxc7+ Qxc7 9.Qxf6 b6 10.Qxh8 Bb7 11.Qxh7 0-0-0, but he has not found followers. If Black tries 7...Nf5 then White continues 8.g4 (also strong is 8.Qd5 Nh6 9.d4 d6 10.Bxh6 Be6 11.Qf3 Bxh6 12.d5 Hughes‚ÄìFogarty, Pittsburgh 2013) 8...a6 9.gxf5 axb5 10.fxg6 Qe7 11.gxf7+ Kd8 12.Ne2 (preventing ...Nd4) e4 13.Qg3+/‚àí. 8\\\\. Qd5 Qe7 :8...Qf6 has also been tried and leads to notably different games. For instance, after 9 Nxc7+ Kd8 10 Nxa8 b6 11. d3 Bb7 12.h4 as in the ...Qe7 line, Black has the strong 12...Ne7! that he cannot play when the queen is on e7, and now White has a very poor game. If white wants to avoid black's attack, the line 11.d4 Nxd4 12.Nxb6 axb6 13.Nf3 Bb7 14.Qxd4 (this would be a terrible move with the black queen on e7) followed by 14...exd4 15.Bg5 Qxg5 16.Nxg5 calm down with almost equal game. White can choose other more promising lines involving several queen moves. 9\\\\. Nxc7+ Kd8 10. Nxa8 :Black is at the moment a rook down, but will eventually regain the knight, leaving him down the exchange. In return, Black will play for an . 10... b6 (see diagram) :Black almost always continues with this move, preparing ...Bb7 to pick up the trapped knight. In return for his material, Black has a good and his bishops will be well placed on the . He will try to justify his sacrifice by avoiding a queen exchange and attempting to checkmate White. White will secure his king (usually by castling ) and his queen (which for the moment is somewhat short of squares), hold onto his extra material and eventually may go on the offensive and attack the black king stuck in the centre of the board. Whether Black has sufficient compensation is a matter of opinion. One possible continuation is 11.d3 Bb7 12.h4 (threatening to win Black's queen with Bg5) 12...f4 13.Qf3 Nd4 (13...Bh6 14.Bd2 is also possible) 14.Qg4 (a 1969 recommendation by Anthony Santasiere, threatening to trade queens with Qg5), when Black has choices 14...Bh6, 14...Bg7, and 14...Bxa8.

He is best remembered as the most prominent volleyball official in the United States, arising from his frequent service as a volleyball referee officiating the nation's most important matches. He is a holder of U.S.A. Volleyball's 1996 Wilbur H. Peck Referee ‚Äì Emeritus Award. Davenport grew up in Binghamton, New York. He was awarded a scholarship to play basketball at Wesleyan, where he had a distinguished college career. United Press International named him first-team small college all-New England. He was captain of the basketball team his senior year. He left Wesleyan holding the school record for most points scored in a game (44) and for career scoring average (19.6). In addition to basketball, Davenport lettered twice as a member of the Wesleyan golf team. In the late 1950s Davenport became active playing AAU volleyball at a YMCA in his hometown of Binghamton, New York. In 1966 he moved to Santa Monica, California, where he joined the Santa Monica Volleyball club team. The team was one of the top amateur teams in the nation, and competed at the USVBA Open Nationals. Following the tournament Davenport was selected for the US National Men's Volleyball Team. He competed at the 1967 Pan American Games, where the team won the gold medal. In 1968 he played on the National Team when it competed at the Summer Olympics in Mexico City. The following year, he was again selected to play on the National team at the 1969 World Cup. In 1971 Davenport captained Santa Monica's USVBA club team, which won the USVBA National Championship in the Men's Open Division. He earned All-America honors at the tournament. Davenport remained a member of the US National team through 1971. Davenport retired from playing competitively at the end of 1971 due to chronic knee problems. However his involvement in the game continued as an official. In this capacity he made his largest contribution to the sport. Davenport earned his national certification in 1971, and soon was considered one of the nation's top officials. He officiated at the USA Cup, the World Junior Championships, the World Championships, the World Cup and the Olympics. Davenport officiated at 11 NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Championships and six NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Championships from 1980 through 1990. He also officiated at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Davenport served as a Board member of the U.S. Volleyball Association from 1971 through 1977, and served as vice president of the USVBA from 1973 through 1976. He was the secretary of the international referees committee of F√©d√©ration Internationale de Volleyball from 1992 through 1996. Davenport retired as an active official in 1995, and has continued on in emeritus status since 1996. Davenport was referee delegate to the Olympic games held in Atlanta in 1996. Davenport is married and has three children. He met his wife, Ann, on the volleyball courts in Southern California. She became president of the Southern California Volleyball Association. His oldest two daughters, Leiann and Shannon, both went to college on volleyball scholarships, Leiann at UC Irvine and Shannon at St. Mary's College. Davenport's youngest daughter, Lindsay, became a tennis player, winning the 1996 Olympic gold medal and three Grand Slam singles titles: the US Open (1998), Wimbledon (1999), and the Australian Open (2000). In 1996 Davenport was selected for U.S.A. Volleyball's Wilbur H. Peck Referee ‚Äì Emeritus Award. He was inducted into the Wesleyan Hall of Fame in 2009. ==References== ==External links== *Retired and Emeritus National Referees, USA Volleyball Category:Wesleyan Cardinals men's basketball players Category:American men's volleyball players Category:Olympic volleyball players of the United States Category:Volleyball players at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Sportspeople from Binghamton, New York Category:Volleyball players at the 1967 Pan American Games Category:American referees and umpires Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:1942 births Category:University of Santa Monica alumni Category:Pan American Games medalists in volleyball Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Wink Davenport"},{"id":"1444294","text":"Fastnet Rock, or simply Fastnet (possibly ; called Carraig Aonair, meaning \\"lonely rock\\", in Irish) is a small islet in the Atlantic Ocean and the most southerly point of Ireland. It lies southwest of Cape Clear Island and from County Cork on the Irish mainland. Fastnet is known as \\"Ireland's Teardrop\\", because it was the last part of Ireland that 19th-century Irish emigrants saw as they sailed to North America. Fastnet Rock is a small clay-slate islet with quartz veins. It rises to about above low water mark and is separated from the much smaller southern Little Fastnet by a wide channel. Fastnet also gives its name to the sea area used by the Shipping Forecasts on BBC Radio 4. The current lighthouse is the second to be built on the rock and is the tallest in Ireland. Fastnet Rock is used as the midpoint of one of the world's classic offshore yachting races, the Fastnet Race, a round trip from Cowes on the Isle of Wight, round the rock and back to Plymouth. It is also sometimes used as a mark for yacht races from local sailing centres such as Schull, Baltimore, and Crookhaven. ==First lighthouse== Construction of the first lighthouse began in 1853, and it first produced a light on 1 January 1854. The lighthouse replaced an early one built on Cape Clear Island in 1818, partly motivated by the loss of an American sailing packet, Stephen Whitney, in thick fog during November 1847 on nearby West Calf Island causing the death of 92 of her 110 passengers and crew. The new lighthouse was constructed of cast iron with an inner lining of brick and was designed by George Halpin. Costing ¬£17,390, the tower was tall with a high lantern structure on top, giving a total height of around . It had an oil burning lamp of 38 kilocandelas; in contrast modern lighthouses typically produce 1,300 kilocandelas. In 1883 an explosive fog signal was installed, which electrically detonated a small charge of guncotton every five minutes. The tower proved to be too weak, since gales shook it to the point that crockery was sometimes thrown off tables, and a 60 imperial gallon (273 L) cask of water lashed to the gallery above high water was washed away. Various steps were taken to strengthen the tower, including fitting a casing around the bottom section up to the second floor and filling it with stone, and the surrounding rock smoothed over. In 1865 the lower floors were filled in with solid material. ==Second lighthouse== Fastnet Rock Lighthouse, c. 1900 The second lighthouse on Fastnet Rock. The lower portion of the first lighthouse is also visible at right. In 1891 the Commissioners of Irish Lights had resolved that the light was not sufficiently powerful, particularly for the first landfall for many ships crossing the Atlantic. The replacement was constructed of stone, cast iron now being considered unsatisfactory ‚Äì the whole of the nearby Calf tower above its strengthening casing had been carried away during a gale on 27 November 1881, although without loss of life. On the same day, the sea had broken the glass of the Fastnet Rock lantern. The new lighthouse was designed by William Douglass and built under the supervision of James Kavanagh.\\"James Kavanagh and the Fastnet Lighthouse\\" Construction started in 1897 with the levelling of the site, and the first of 2,047 Cornish granite dovetailed blocks was laid in June 1899. As well as these blocks, weighing 4,300 tons in total and with a volume of , a further of granite was used to fill the inside of the tower up to the level of the entrance floor above high-water mark. A small steamship, the Ierne, was specially constructed for carrying the blocks out to the island, and Kavanagh personally set every stone, which weighed between 1¬æ and 3 tons. The new lighthouse entered service on 27 June 1904 having cost nearly ¬£90,000. The masonry tower is high, but the focal point of the light is above high-water mark. The base of the lighthouse is in diameter with the first course of stone below high-water mark, and the first ten of the 89 courses built into the rock. The first floor of the original tower remains, on the highest part of the rock, having been left when it was demolished and converted into an oil store. The fog signal was changed to one report every three minutes in 1934 and from 1965 accompanied by a brilliant flash when operated during darkness. The original vaporised paraffin light was replaced with an electric one on 10 May 1969. At the end of March 1989 the lighthouse was converted to automatic operation. It is monitored and controlled using a UHF telemetry link to Mizen Head Lighthouse and onwards by landline to the control centre at D√∫n Laoghaire. It produces a 0.14 second white flash every five seconds, with a nominal range of and power of 2,500 kilocandelas. Since April 1978 in addition to being operated during darkness, the light is also used during poor visibility. In 1974 the explosive fog signal was replaced with an electric fog horn producing four blasts every minute at 300 hertz with a nominal range of . Following a review of navigational aids, the fog signal was permanently shut down on 11 January 2011. The Racon‚Äîradar transponder beacon‚Äîhas been a morse G on the radar display since its installation in 1994. In 1985, the lighthouse was struck by a rogue wave about high.\\"The Story of the Fastnet\\" ‚Äì The Economist Magazine 18 December 2008 On 16 October 2017, a wind gust of was recorded at the lighthouse, during a tropical storm, the recently downgraded Hurricane Ophelia. This is an Irish record, based on measurements going back to the 1860s.

The event usually takes place on the August bank holiday weekend. ==History== ===Background=== InFest was born in early 1998 through the efforts of three students of the University of Bradford - Gareth 'Gadge' Harvey, Chris 'Crusty' Molyneux, and Max 'Maxi Slag' - and the Students' Union Entertainments Manager, Floyd Peltier. The concept of the festival was originally envisioned as a one-day event for local goth bands in West Yorkshire, but the crew were able to also onboard much bigger acts, such as gothic/deathrock band Alien Sex Fiend. The student organisers were already fans of the Whitby Gothic Weekend and took the idea for Infest to the Whitby festival-goers and traders to gauge how popular the show might be. The response was positive and the first Infest festival was confirmed as 14 and 15 August 1998. The following year (1999), the festival paid more attention towards the electronic side of the goth and industrial scene by booking Apoptygma Berzerk for their first UK show. ===Reinvention=== By 2000, the University of Bradford's Students' Union felt that they couldn't carry the costs of the festival any longer. However, an independent goth/industrial promoter and DJ named Mark 'Gus' Guy (former drummer with the Indie band Kerosene), who had been advising Molyneux during the show's early years, stepped in to fill the void. As a result of the heavy involvement with Guy and his Terminal Productions company, Infest took the form it is recognised as today: the festival's theme has moved from goth/industrial crossover to alternative electronic, with a greater emphasis on power noise, futurepop, synthpop and electronic body music. However, occasionally more darkwave-style goth bands do still appear on the line-up. The stylisation of the name had changed in 2003 to be \\"Infest\\", and from this time has grown significant international recognition. The show continues to provide a market for traders, which helps to bring the music and the lifestyle of the show's fans together. There is also a full festival program where nightclubs, DJs, bands and businesses can make their voices heard. Infest has been supported by a number of electronic record labels, notably Ant-Zen, Hands Productions, now-defunct online music store Music Non Stop, Storming the Base (part of the record label Artoffact Records). Support outside the scene has also come from software publisher Ableton, and drink manufacturers J√§germeister and Barr. In July 2013, the festival organisers announced that \\"it is highly unlikely that there will be an Infest in 2014\\"; but following \\"an avalanche of messages of support\\" the organisers have decided to \\"throw caution to the wind and go ahead with Infest in 2014 (The reason for announcing that infest 2014 was highly unlikely was due to AltFest being proposed to occur a couple of weeks before Infest in 2014. In the end Altfest was canceled due to lack of ticket sales and financial insecurity for the viability of a new big festival that had no history on the alternative music scene).\\" ===Today=== Today, Guy has a small team of people at his side, including Molyneux (the remaining member of the founding team), graphic designer Richard King, Ticket Office Manager Lee Thornton and a crew of volunteers and live production professionals. The festival celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2018, adding an extra day that year for the occasion. ==Infest Performers== ===1998=== * Alien Sex Fiend, Dust to Dust, Horatii, Leechwoman,

north) and Greek (in the south) languages in the Roman Empire from Antiquity until the 4th century. A possible rough outline of it goes from near the city of La√ßi in modern Albania to Serdica (now Sofia, in Bulgaria) and then follows the Balkan Mountains to Odessus (Varna) on the Black Sea or continuing along the coastline northwards to the Danube Delta. The placement of the line is based on archaeological findings as most of the inscriptions found to the north of it are written in Latin, and most of the inscriptions found to the south of it are in Greek. The proposed line, in its various forms, is a theoretical tool and already in antiquity there were significant exceptions: there were Hellenized groups north of the line (e.g. the Greek colonies along the western coastline of the Black Sea) and Latinized groups may have lived south of the line. Even so, it is a useful ‚Äî although approximate ‚Äî instrument for determining which influence a certain area was predominantly exposed to. This line is important in establishing the area where the Romanian, Vlach and Albanian people formed (see Origin of the Romanians and Origin of the Albanians). It was originally used by Czech historian Konstantin Jireƒçek in 1911 in a history of the Slavic people. More recent scholars have revised it somewhat: Kaimio (1979) places Dalmatia and Moesia Superior in the Latin area and Moesia Inferior in the Greek sphere. MacLeod (1982) suggests that there may not have been \\"an official language policy for each and every aspect of life\\" but that \\"individual Roman officials [made] common sense ad hoc decisions\\". He also points out that while the area was under pre-Byzantine Roman rule, \\"even in Greek areas... Latin was the dominant language in inscriptions recording public works, on milestones, and in the army\\". == See also == * Greek East and Latin West * Daco-Roman * Thraco-Roman * History of Romanian * Romanian language * Albanian-Romanian linguistic relationship ==References== * Jireƒçek, Konstantin, Geschichte der Serben ' The history of the Serbs ', Gotha, 1911. * Kaimio, Jorma, The Romans and the Greek Language, Commentationes Humanarum Litterarum 64.

He famously endured a long period of exile from his realm before finally being restored to power (r.636‚Äì628BC) and rapidly leading Jin to hegemony over the other Chinese states of his time. He is a figure in numerous Chinese legends, including those about his loyal courtier Jie Zhitui, whose death is said to have inspired China's Cold Food and Qingming Festivals. ==Names== \\"Duke Wen of Jin\\" is a posthumous name bestowed on him as part of his family's ancestral veneration. It literally means the \\"Cultured Duke of Jin\\". Duke Wen's given name was Chong'er. His clan name was Ji. ==Life== ===Early life=== Prince Chong'er was born to Duke Xian of Jin in 697 BC. The Zuo Zhuan notes that \\"his ribs were all grown together,\\" a sign of strength and leadership. Chong'er's half-brothers included Shensheng and Xiqi. While Shensheng was the original crown prince, in his later years Duke Xian favoured the concubine Li Ji, who desired her son Xiqi to be heir instead. As such, she plotted to discredit Shensheng before his father, eventually leading to Shensheng's suicide in 656 BC. ===Wandering=== This event led to a civil war in Jin, known as the Li Ji Unrest, where Duke Xian led several campaigns against his own sons, forcing them to flee Jin. With a retinue of capable men, including Zhao Cui, Hu Yan, Wei Chou (È≠èÁä®), Jia Tuo (Ë≥à‰Ωó), Xian Zhen (ÂÖàËª´), and Jie Zhitui, Chong'er fled to the north. In 651 BC, after the death of Duke Xian led to a succession crisis, Chong'er was invited to return to Jin and assume the duchy, but declined; the throne passed instead to his half-brother Yiwu, who became Duke Hui of Jin. In 644 BC, after failed assassination attempts by Duke Hui, Chong'er moved to the State of Qi, his mother's homeland. He remained there until yet another succession crisis in Qi in 639 BC, whereupon he fled first to the State of Cao, then the states of Song, Zheng, Chu and finally the State of Qin. Over this 19-year period of exile, Chong'er gained both prestige and talented followers; a lady of a foreign court once commented that \\"When I look at the followers of the prince of Jin, every one of them is fit to be a premier of a state\\". In 636 BC, after the death of Duke Hui, Duke Mu of Qin escorted Chong'er back to Jin with an army, and Chong'er was installed as the Duke of Jin. ===Duke of Jin=== Duke Wen undertook several major reforms of the state's military and civil institutions, partly in order to fill the gaps that had been caused by the slaughter of the ducal house previously. These included the formation of a three-army system, with an upper, middle and lower army each commanded by a General and a Lieutenant-General. The state was further invigorated by the many capable leaders Duke Wen had gathered from his wanderings, who were given senior military and governmental posts. With this army, as well as his considerable prestige, Duke Wen was able to absorb many of the states around Jin, greatly increasing its extent, while also subjecting others as vassals; its vassal states included Cao, which he attacked in reprisal for the rude treatment afforded him during his exile. At the same time, he took the political stance of supporting the Eastern Zhou court and King Xiang of Zhou. When in 635 BC King Xiang was deposed and driven out by his brother, Duke Wen led a coalition of states which re-installed him as King. At the same time, the northward expansion of the State of Chu was also resisted by Duke Wen; the two states' conflict was mostly played out among the smaller states which lay between their territories and formed alliances with one state or another. In 633 BC, Chu invaded the State of Song, which was an ally of Jin; Duke Wen led his coalition, including troops from Qin, Qi and Song, and won a decisive victory over Chu forces at the Battle of Chengpu in 632 BC. This battle checked Chu's northern expansion for decades, while cementing Duke Wen's position; the next year, he convened a large coalition of rulers at Jiantu, and was confirmed as hegemon over the other states, becoming one of the Five Hegemons. Duke Jin died in 628 BC, and was succeeded by his son Duke Xiang of Jin; his son also inherited the hegemony, which would stay with Jin for nearly a century. ==Legends== ===Ordering the Army to Retreat Three She=== When Chong'er stayed at the court of Chu, its king set banquets for him and afforded him good treatment. At one meal, he asked Chong'er how he intended to repay this debt. Chong'er replied that, should Jin and Chu meet on the battlefield in the future, he would order his own troops to retreat three she () or about . After Chong'er was restored to his throne by the duke of Qin, he did meet Chu in battle. Remembering his promise, he ordered his men to retreat three she. He used the occasion, however, to lure the Chu commander Ziyu into an ambush at Chengpu and won the battle there. ===Cold Food Festival=== MtMian near Jiexiu, Shanxi, the supposed site of Chong'er's immolation of Jie Zhitui & his mother. Accounts of Chong'er and his retainer and musician Jie Zhitui or Zitui circulated by at least the 4th century BC. Sima Qian relates that Jie was among those who followed the prince through all his years of exile but, crediting Heaven with Qin's willingness to install Chong'er in place of Duke Yu, he declined to present himself at court for reward and insulted those who did so. He and his mother left to become hermits in the forests around MtMian and were never seen again. Chong'er was distracted during this time by the chaos of his installation, as Yu's partisans started riots and even burnt down the ducal palace. He was eventually reminded of Jie by a poem about a dragon and some snakes that was posted on his new palace's main gate; unable to find or reward him, he set aside the fields of Mianshang to endow sacrifices in his honor.. . This later developed into a temple, and Jie became regarded as a Taoist immortal with power over the weather by the early Han.. Later legends embellished this story: after the retinue of exiles were robbed by bandits while traveling through the Chinese countryside, they ran so low on food that Chong'er was at risk of starvation. Jie prepared him a hearty soup of meat and wild herbs that revitalized him and, under questioning, revealed that he had used flesh from his own thigh to prepare it. Upon the prince's restoration in Jin, he proclaimed that \\"awards may be divided into three grades: the first- grade award goes to those [who] followed me into exile; the second-grade award goes to those who donated money; and the third grade goes to those who welcomed the return of my dukedom\\" and that even \\"those who have supported me in other ways but not yet been rewarded may report their names for awards\\". Jie, however, was overlooked and felt so sad that he retired to the countryside, carrying his mother on his back. Recalling his loyal follower months or years later, Chong'er personally wandered the forests and ridges looking for them. His new advisors suggested using a forest fire to drive Jie out, since his duty to his mother would overwhelm any other concerns. The fire was started on one or three sides, and men waited on the open end to welcome the official back into public service. Instead, the fire raged for three days and nights and the mother and son were found burnt to death beneath a willow. In his sorrow and guilt, Chong'er renamed the mountain after Jie. (The surrounding territory would also later take the name \\"Jiexiu\\" or \\"[Place of] Jie's [Final] Rest\\".) He also ordered a period of prohibition against fire in Jie's honor, forcing the people to eat cold food during three days around the Qingming solar term. In fact, the Cold Food Festival is not attested before the Han and began as a month-long popular observance to placate Jie's spirit in the depths of winter. The hardship this caused‚Äîincluding death among infants and the elderly‚Äîcaused it to be repeatedly banned over a period of centuries. The regulations succeeded in moving the festival to the end of spring (by Chinese reckoning), but it never died out in Shanxi and spread through the rest of China under the Sui and Tang. Aspects of ancestral veneration added to it from the old Double Third Festival eventually overshadowed the stories of Chong'er and Jie Zhitui, however, causing it to develop into the modern Tomb-Sweeping Festival instead. ==Offspring== Huan ÔºàÈ©©Ôºâ. Born by Bi Ji (ÈÄºÂßû). He succeeded his father and was known as Duke Xiang of Jin. He was regarded as a good successor as he defeated Qin and Di, but died too early in 621 BC. His son became Duke Ling of Jin, and Duke Dao of Jin was the grandson of his another son named Jie. Bo Ji (‰ºØÂß¨). Also born by Bi Ji (ÈÄºÂßû). She was married to Zhao Cui (Ë∂ôË°∞), and was praised highly for returning the wifehood to the first wife Shu Wei (ÂèîÈöó), thereby making herself a concubine. She bore three sons named Zhao Yingqi (Ë∂ôÂ¨∞ÈΩä), Zhao Tong (Ë∂ôÂêå) and Zhao Kuo (Ë∂ôÊã¨). Also known as Zhao Ji (Ë∂ôÂß¨) and Junjishi. Yong (Èõç). Born by Du Qi ÔºàÊùúÁ•ÅÔºâ. He was initially sent to the State of Qin to be a minister in Qin to avoid the probable conflict among his brothers. When Duke Xiang of Jin died, Zhao Dun decided to let Yong succeed the throne, since he was elder and had a good reputation. Therefore, Yong was returning to Qin guarded by Qin troops. However, when Yong and the Qin troops were at border, Dun changed his mind and created Yigao (Â§∑Áöã) as Duke Ling of Jin and attacked the Qin troops. Yong was killed in the attack from the State of Jin. Le (Yue?) (Ê®Ç). Born by Chen Ying ÔºàËæ∞Â¨¥Ôºâ from the State of Qin. He was initially sent to the State of Chento avoid the probable conflict among his brothers. When Duke Xiang died, another noble minister, Hu Shegu (ÁãêÂ∞ÑÂßë), wanted to make Le the duke and secretly fetched him from Chen. However, he was ambushed and killed on the way by fellows led by Gongsun Chujiu, one of the men of Zhao Dun. Heitun (ÈªëËáÄ). Born by Zhou N√º (Âë®Â•≥). He was initially sent to Zhou. When Duke Ling was murdered, he succeeded the throne and became Duke Cheng of Jin. He died in 600 BC. ==Family== * Father: Duke Xian of Jin * Stepmother: Li Ji * Brother: Shensheng, Hereditary Duke of Jin / Xiqi, Duke of Jin / Duke Hui of Jin * Nephew: Duke Huai of Jin ==Legacy== Duke Wen's military and civil reforms created a framework of government which helped ensure the stability and preeminence of the Jin for subsequent decades. At the same time, though, it laid the framework for the political situation in the later years of Jin, when several houses of nobles came to dominate the ducal court. The houses of Wei and Zhao, for example, were consolidated by their military appointments in Duke Wen's court, setting the ground for their eventual domination and the partition of Jin two and a half centuries later. Hong Kong's TVB made a television drama series about Duke Wen in the early 1990s called The Legend of Duke Wen (), starring Leon Lai. The series was semi-fictional, with many episodes featuring wuxia (\\"kung fu\\") scenes. Other dramatizations of his life include the 2011 Chinese series Song of Spring and Autumn, with the duke played by Gallen Lo. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * . * . * * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * , reprinted by Penguin Classics, 1985. * . * . * . ==External links== * A simplified Chinese website depicting Duke Wen life and story * A Traditional Chinese website about Jie Zhitui and the origin of Qingming Festival Category:Monarchs of Jin (Chinese state) Category:7th-century BC Chinese monarchs Category:697 BC births Category:628 BC deaths ","title":"Duke Wen of Jin"},{"id":"1444317","text":"is one of the 16 wards of Nagoya, Japan.

This colourless solid is a lactam (a cyclic amide) of caproic acid. Global demand for this compound is approximately five million tons per year, and the vast majority is used to make Nylon 6 filament, fiber, and plastics. ==Synthesis and production== Caprolactam was first described in the late 1800s when it was prepared by the cyclization of Œµ-aminocaproic acid, the product of the hydrolysis of caprolactam. World demand for caprolactam was estimated to reach five million tons per year for 2015. 90% of caprolactam produced is used to make filament and fiber, 10% for plastics, and a small amount is used as a chemical intermediate. Due to its commercial significance, many methods have been developed for the production of caprolactam. It was estimated that 90% of all caprolactam is synthesised from cyclohexanone (1), which is first converted to its oxime (2). Treatment of this oxime with acid induces the Beckmann rearrangement to give caprolactam (3): : The Beckmann Rearrangement The immediate product of the acid-induced rearrangement is the bisulfate salt of caprolactam. This salt is neutralized with ammonia to release the free lactam and cogenerate ammonium sulfate. In optimizing the industrial practices, much attention is directed toward minimizing the production of ammonium salts. The other major industrial route involves formation of the oxime from cyclohexane using nitrosyl chloride, and this method accounts for 10% of world production. The advantage of this method is that cyclohexane is less expensive than cyclohexanone. Other paths to caprolactam include the depolymerization of waste Nylon 6, and the reaction of caprolactone with ammonia. At bench scale, the reaction between cyclohexanone with hydrazoic acid to give caprolactam in the Schmidt reaction has been reported. :500px ==Uses== Almost all caprolactam produced goes into the manufacture of Nylon 6. The conversion entails a ring-opening polymerization: :500px Nylon 6 is widely used in fibers and plastics. In situ anionic polymerization is employed for cast nylon production where conversion from Œµ-caprolactam to Nylon 6 takes place inside a mold. In conjunction with endless fiber processing the term thermoplastic resin transfer molding (T-RTM) is often used. Caprolactam is also used in the synthesis of several pharmaceutical drugs including pentylenetetrazol, meptazinol, and laurocapram. ==Safety== Caprolactam is an irritant and is mildly toxic, with an of 1.1 g/kg (rat, oral). In 1991, it was included on the list of hazardous air pollutants by the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1990. It was subsequently removed from the list in 1996 at the request of the manufacturers.EPA - Modifications To The 112(b)1 Hazardous Air Pollutants In water, caprolactam hydrolyzes to aminocaproic acid, which is used medicinally. Currently, there is no official permissible exposure limit set for workers handling caprolactam in the United States. The recommended exposure limit is set at 1 mg/m3 over an eight-hour work shift for caprolactam dusts and vapors. The short-term exposure limit is set at 3 mg/m3 for caprolactam dusts and vapors. ==References== Category:Azepanes Category:Lactams Category:Monomers Category:Commodity chemicals ","title":"Caprolactam"},{"id":"1444325","text":"The Oslo Philharmonic (Oslo-Filharmonien) is a Norwegian symphony orchestra based in Oslo, Norway. The orchestra was founded in 1919, and has since 1977 had its home in the Oslo Concert Hall. The orchestra consists of 69 musicians in the string section, 16 in the woodwinds, 15 in brass, 5 in percussionists, 1 harpist, and 1 pianist. The orchestra gives an average of sixty to seventy symphonic concerts annually, the majority of which are broadcast nationally on the radio. The orchestra also performs chamber concerts frequently throughout the year. ==History== The Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra's roots go back to 1879, when Edvard Grieg and Johan Svendsen founded the Christiania Musikerforening (Christiania Musical Association), as a successor of The Philharmonic Society (Det Philharmoniske Selskab, 1847). The orchestra was later conducted by Ole Olsen, Johan Selmer, Iver Holter and Otto Winter-Hjelm. Under Holter, the orchestra was merged with the Christiania Theatre Orchestra, which was on the verge of reductions. Holter suggested the founding of a city orchestra which could play at municipal festivities, concerts and in the theatre, and as a result of this, the orchestra gained municipal support from 1889. In 1899, the Nationaltheatret, which was to present both theatre and opera, was opened. Here the orchestra expanded to 44 musicians, and it was conducted by Johan Halvorsen. The orchestra served the Nationaltheatret in two roles: providing music for the new theatre, and symphony concerts for the Music Society. During the First World War, the desire for symphonic music grew, along with inflation, leading to a dispute between the orchestra and the Nationaltheatret and a temporary collapse of the Musikerforening's concerts. Thus, in 1919, the orchestra was reformed as the Filharmonisk Selskaps Orkester (Orchestra of the Philharmonic Company) by private shareholders and initiative. The first season was shared by three conductors; Johan Halvorsen, Georg Schn√©evoigt and Ignaz Neumark. Filharmonisk Selskaps Orkester's first concert took place in Logen (Store Sal) on 27 September 1919, with 59 musicians on stage and with Georg Schn√©evoigt as conductor. On the repertoire was Rikard Nordraak's Ja, vi elsker dette landet, Johan Svendsen's Fest polonaise, Christian Sinding's Symphony No. 1, Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor, and finally Landkjenning, with the singer Erik Ole Bye as baritone soloist. Among the guest musicians of this first season were the conductor Arthur Nikisch, the pianists Eugen d'Albert, Edwin Fischer, Wilhelm Kempff, Ignaz Friedman and Artur Schnabel, and the violinists Bronis≈Çaw Huberman and Carl Flesch. Between September 1919 and May 1920, the orchestra gave 135 public concerts, most of them sold out. The next decades featured various economic problems, which led to the resignation of 15 musicians in one season. In spite of this, the orchestra continued to attract notable musicians and conductors, such as Richard Burgin, who later became concertmaster for Serge Koussevitzky in Boston; Max Rostal; Ernst Glaser; Robert Soetens, for whom Sergei Prokofiev's 2nd Violin Concerto was written; and others who were driven out of Germany by the Nazi regime - Igor Stravinsky, Fritz Busch, Erich Kleiber, and Bruno Walter. The first Norwegian radio broadcast started in April 1923, and shortly after, the first radio concert with the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. From 1925, there was a contract between the orchestra and the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), ensuring weekly live broadcast concerts. This contract with NRK saved the orchestra from bankruptcy in the 1930s. Issay Dobrowen joined the orchestra in 1927; when he left in 1931, the position of chief conductor was divided between two Norwegians: Odd Gr√ºner Hegge and Olav Kielland. After 1933, Kielland became sole chief conductor until 1945. In 1953 Oslo hosted the ISCM Festival, which brought further international contacts in the awareness of new repertoire, which many of the Scandinavian countries had been deprived of during the years of World War I and World War II. The first performance of the Oslo Philharmonic outside Scandinavia took place in 1962. Since then, the orchestra has much international acclaim. Oslo Concert Hall In 1979, the orchestra formally changed its name to Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1996, an act of the Norwegian parliament made the orchestra an independent foundation. Although the orchestra has maintained high standards of quality since its inception and under various renowned musical directors, many consider that it saw its largest leap forward during the tenure of Mariss Jansons from 1979 to 2002. During this time the orchestra recorded readings of Tchaikovsky's symphonies, and went on international tours. The Oslo Philharmonic won international acclaim with its Tchaikovsky cycle and a very successful series of recordings for EMI. In 2000 the orchestra completed a cycle of Bart√≥k for Simax. Other awards won by the Oslo Philharmonic include Grand Prix du Disque, Diapason d‚ÄôOr, and the German Classical Music Award. Subsequent music directors have been Andr√© Previn (2002-2006) and Jukka-Pekka Saraste (2006‚Äì2013). Saraste now has the title of √¶resdirigent (conductor laureate) with the orchestra. In February 2011, the orchestra announced the appointment of Petrenko as its next chief conductor, as of the 2013‚Äì2014 season, with an initial contract of 4 years. In November 2015, the orchestra announced the extension of Petrenko's contract through 2020. Petrenko concluded his chief conductorship of the orchestra at the close of the 2019‚Äì2020 season, with the season truncated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2018, Klaus M√§kel√§ first guest-conducted the orchestra. On the basis of this appearance, in October 2018, the orchestra announced the appointment of M√§kel√§ as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2020‚Äì2021 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons. In May 2020, the orchestra announced an extension of M√§kel√§'s initial contract with the orchestra for an additional 4 seasons, unusual in its timing before the official start of his tenure as chief conductor of the orchestra. ==Music directors== * Johan Halvorsen (1919‚Äì1920) * Ignaz Neumark (1919‚Äì1921) * Georg Schn√©evoigt (1919‚Äì1921) * Jos√© Eibensch√ºtz (1921‚Äì1927) * Issay Dobrowen (1927‚Äì1931) * Odd Gr√ºner-Hegge (1931‚Äì1933) * Olav Kielland (1931‚Äì1945) * Odd Gr√ºner-Hegge (1945‚Äì1962) * Herbert Blomstedt (1962‚Äì1968) * √òivin Fjeldstad (1962‚Äì1969) * Miltiades Caridis (1969‚Äì1975) * Okko Kamu (1975‚Äì1979) * Mariss Jansons (1979‚Äì2002) * Andr√© Previn (2002‚Äì2006) * Jukka-Pekka Saraste (2006‚Äì2013) * Vasily Petrenko (2013‚Äì2020) * Klaus M√§kel√§ (designate, effective September 2020) == References == ==External links== * Official website of the Oslo Philharmonic Category:Norwegian orchestras Category:Symphony orchestras Category:Musical groups established in 1919 Category:1919 establishments in Norway Category:Musical groups from Oslo ","title":"Oslo Philharmonic"},{"id":"1444330","text":"Hyacinthoides hispanica (syn.

Remnants of a metalled ford across the stream were found further south at Hermitage Bridge on the River Graveney which forms part of the boundary between Norbury and Streatham, before flowing on to the River Wandle, then the River Thames. ===Norbury Manor=== By the early thirteenth century, Norbury was a sub-manor within the chief manor of Croydon. The first recorded mention of Norbury Manor was in 1229 when Peter de Bendings conveyed the Manor to John de Kemsing and his wife Idonea and is referred to as the \\"lands stretching out either side of the London Road\\".Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 In 1269 the Manor comprised 91 acres of arable land in Pollards Hill, 30 acres in Grandon, 55 acres of pasture, 36 acres of heathland, 2 acres of woodland and 17 acres of meadow land.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 In 1337, Norbury Manor was granted to Nicolas de Carew, who also held neighbouring Beddington Manor. The Carew family remained Lords of the Manor of Norbury until 1859 except for a brief interlude during the reign of Henry VIII. Norbury remained rural and agricultural throughout this period. By 1800 most of the land in Norbury was owned by a handful of people; approximately half was owned by the Carew family, and the remaining large landowners were Peter du Cane, Croydon Hospital and Pembroke College.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 ===Victorian period=== At the start of the Victorian period, the population consisted of fifty six people and three main dwellings; the Hermitage, Norbury Manor Farm House and Norbury Hall.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 The Hermitage was situated alongside Green Lane and backed onto Hermitage Sports Ground (now Norbury Park). The last resident of The Hermitage was Jenny Hill, a famous music hall performer in the 1890s.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 In 1894 the North Surrey Golf Club built a 90-acre golf club on Hermitage Sports Ground and in 1896 purchased The Hermitage to use as their club house. The following year it was destroyed by fire.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 Norbury Manor Farm House was situated on the corner where Norbury Avenue meets Kensington Avenue and was the Norbury Manor House until Norbury Hall was built in 1802.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 The Farm House was demolished in 1914. Only Norbury Hall remains, now used as a retirement home and protected as a Grade II listed building.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 In 1859, the first Victorian villa, known as Norbury Villa, was built on the London Road. A second villa followed in 1878, and thereafter followed the construction of clusters of large villas along both sides of the London Road. In 1867, the Committee of Croydon Steeple Chase and Hurdle Races leased approximately 100 acres at Lonesome Farm. The following year, the first Streatham Horse Race meeting was held and a temporary grandstand was built on Northborough Road. The two day meets, held four or five times a year, proved successful and attracted large crowds from London.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 To cater for the crowds, Norbury railway station opened in 1878, built on a railway line which had run through Norbury since 1862. The increased crowds however led to an increase in anti-social behaviour, and local residents lobbied politicians to enact a new law in 1879 banning horse racing within ten miles of Westminster, effectively ending the Streatham Races.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 ===Urbanisation=== By 1900, Norbury was an affluent semi-rural suburb boasting two golf courses and cricket, football, tennis and bowls clubs.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 The first shopping parades on the London Road were constructed in 1900 and side roads behind the parades began to be laid out.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 Electric trams were introduced in 1901 connecting the town to Purley, however as Croydon trams and London trams used different systems and could not use the same tracks, when going to London passengers had to change in Norbury. During the next thirty years most of the housing in Norbury was constructed, with the houses and roads in different areas forming part of several residential estates. The most notable estate was the Norbury Cottage Garden Estate built in 1901 in thirty acres of land between Northborough Road and Semley Road, and which was the first cottage estate built by the London County Council.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 The population of Norbury had risen from 475 people in 1901 to 15,538 by 1931.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 During the second half of the twentieth century, many of the large Victorian villas were demolished and office blocks were built on their sites. Later many of the office blocks were themselves converted into residential apartments. In 1970 Norbury Fire Station was built to replace nearby Streatham Fire Station.Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013 Today, Norbury is a built-up residential area housing a diverse and multi-cultural community. ==Demography== The 2011 census showed that White British was the largest ethnic group at 24% of the population, followed by 13% Black Caribbean, 12% Indian and 12% Other White.http://www.ukcensusdata.com/norbury-e05000158 55% of people living in Norbury were born in England, followed by 5% in India, 4% Pakistan, 4% Jamaica and 2% Kenya.http://norbury.localstats.co.uk/census- demographics/england/london/croydon/norbury The most spoken language apart from English is Polish.http://norbury.localstats.co.uk/census- demographics/england/london/croydon/norbury A majority of the population, namely 52%, identified as Christian followed by 18% as Muslim and 12% of no religion.http://norbury.localstats.co.uk/census- demographics/england/london/croydon/norbury ==Politics== Norbury is part of the Croydon North constituency and the current MP is Steve Reed. The constituency replaced the Croydon North East constituency in 1997 and has returned Labour Party MP's since it was re-instated. Norbury includes two of the twenty-eight wards which make up Croydon London Borough Council. These two wards, both created in 2018, are Norbury and Pollards Hill and Norbury Park.https://www.croydon.gov.uk/aboutus ===Norbury and Pollards Hill=== ===Norbury Park=== ==Nearest places== * Brixton * Streatham * Streatham Common * West Norwood * Crystal Palace / Upper Norwood * Mitcham * Pollards Hill * Thornton Heath * Croydon ==Notable people and residents== * Kingsley Amis (1922‚Äì1995), novelist * Barloc of Norbury, Middle Ages Catholic saint * Correlli Barnett (1927‚Äì), military historian * Edwy Searles Brooks (1889‚Äì1965), novelist * Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875‚Äì1912), composer * John Creasey (1908‚Äì1973), detective-story writer * Janet Francis (1947‚Äì), actress * Deryck Guyler (1914‚Äì1999), actor * Wee Willie Harris (1933‚Äì), singer * Will Hay (1888‚Äì1949), comedian and actor * Libera, boys' choir * Michael Moorcock (1939‚Äì), writer and musician * Osh (1995‚Äì), singer * Robert Prizeman (1952‚Äì), composer * Ralph Reader (1903‚Äì1982), actor * Stormzy (1993‚Äì), rapper * Roxanne Tataei (1988‚Äì), singer ==Nearest railway stations== *Norbury railway station *Mitcham Eastfields railway station *Streatham Common railway station *Streatham railway station *Mitcham Junction railway station *Thornton Heath railway station ==In fiction== Norbury is portrayed in a Sherlock Holmes short story, \\"The Adventure of the Yellow Face\\", as one of the few places in which the detective turned out to be wrong regarding his theories (as referenced in the episode \\"The Six Thatchers\\" of the BBC-Series \\"Sherlock\\") Norbury is mentioned in Penelope Fitzgerald's The Beginning of Spring (1988).

He was a senator for the Federal District from 2003 to 2019. ==Biography== Buarque graduated in mechanical engineering from the Federal University of Pernambuco in 1966. At that time he engaged in student politics becoming a militant of the A√ß√£o Popular, a group of the Leftist Progressive Church. After the 1964 coup, he was persecuted and exiled to France, where he earned a PhD in economics from the Pantheon-Sorbonne University, Paris, in 1973. He worked at Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in Ecuador, Honduras, and the United States from 1973‚Äì79. He was the first elected rector, by direct vote, of the University of Brasilia in the wake of the military regime; governor of the Federal District; Minister of Education; and current senator, who was elected by a landslide vote. He worked as a consultant for several national and international bodies under the United Nations (UN) and presided over the University for Peace Council and participated in the Food Presidential Commission, which was formerly directed by late sociologist Herbert \\"Betinho\\" de Souza. Buarque is a member of Institute of Education of UNESCO and of the Council of the United Nations University. He created the NGO Mission Child, which sponsors an income transfer program for thousands of families and is funded by private enterprises. He was awarded the Jabuti prize of Literature in 1995. He is a staunch defender of the ‚Äúrevolution‚Ä¶ through education‚Äù, a line of thought touted by Brazilian intellectuals like An√≠sio Teixeira, Darcy Ribeiro, and Paulo Freire. Buarque proposes an alternative class analysis of modern capitalist societies. According to him, in modern capitalism, the increasing substitution of human labor for automated machines tends to make employed workers a privileged caste, while a new layer of ‚Äúexcluded‚Äù people ‚Äì those who have no jobs, insurance, or health care ‚Äì is formed, whose members are the real victims of social inequality. As this new underclass does not have the ability to effectively counter its exploitation by capitalism, Buarque's thought constantly tends towards some kind of substitutionism, in which political action by wide masses is replaced by government or institutional action on their behalf. ==Federal District Governor (1995‚Äì98)== His term as Governor of the Federal District was marked by strong tensions with the Workers‚Äô Party (PT), particularly with its unionist base, as he strove continuously not only to maintain his independence from party directives but also to influence intra-party political struggle through State power. He managed to persuade the party to support his policies in return for demobilizing most of the PT activists. The project Bolsa Escola, implemented in the Federal District during his term, started in Brazil and other countries. Albeit a 58% approval rate in a research made by the Datafolha institute, Buarque lost to Joaquim Roriz (PMDB) by a small margin of votes. Buarque attributed his defeat to his opponent's promise to grant a large wage increase for the public servants of the Federal District. The promise was not fulfilled by Roriz.. ==Entering PDT== In 2005, after the allegations of corruption involving the Worker's Party (PT), he left the party. He said:. After considering staying in the Senate independently, he decided to enter the Democratic Labour Party (PDT) in 1989, with which he had longstanding connections. His proposal to transform education into a national priority is a continuation of the ideas of Darcy Ribeiro. ==See also== *List of Governors of the Federal District ==References== ==External links== * . * * Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Candidates for President of Brazil Category:Governors of the Federal District (Brazil) Category:Members of the Federal Senate Category:Brazilian male writers Category:Brazilian economists Category:Brazilian mechanical engineers Category:Brazilian educators Category:People associated with Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Category:Sustainability advocates Category:Education Ministers of Brazil Category:Cidadania politicians Category:Democratic Labour Party (Brazil) politicians Category:Workers' Party (Brazil) politicians Category:Cavalcanti family Category:Club of Rome members Category:Recipients of the Great Cross of the National Order of Scientific Merit (Brazil) Category:Federal University of Pernambuco alumni ","title":"Cristovam Buarque"},{"id":"1444351","text":"Jerry O'Sullivan is a contemporary Irish-American musician.

Its signature products include the Equa chair, Aeron chair, Noguchi table, Marshmallow sofa, and the Eames Lounge Chair. Herman Miller is credited with the invention of the office cubicle (originally known as the \\"Action Office\\") in 1968 under then-director of research Robert Propst. ==History== A typical distribution depot, in Chippenham, Wiltshire. Herman Miller was founded in 1905 as the Star Furniture Co. in Zeeland, Michigan. Initially the company produced high quality furniture, especially bedroom suites, in historic revival styles. In 1909, Dirk Jan De Pree began working for the company as a clerk, and became its president by 1919, when it was renamed the Michigan Star Furniture Co. De Pree and his father-in-law, Herman Miller, purchased 51% of the company stock in 1923 and renamed it the Herman Miller Furniture Company. The company reformed as Herman Miller, Inc. in 1960. Until 1930, the company produced only traditional wood furniture. With the coming of the Great Depression the company was forced to explore new products to survive in a shrinking market and reluctantly hired Gilbert Rohde, a designer who specialized in modernist designs. Rohde turned the company in a totally new direction and in 1933, Herman Miller debuted a line of modern furniture at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago, Illinois. In 1941, the company opened a showroom in the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and another in New York City. Under Rohde's supervision Herman Miller entered the contract (office) furniture market in 1942, with the introduction of the \\"Modular Executive Office\\" Group (EOG), the first in a long line of office furnishings to be produced by the company. Rohde died in 1944 and was replaced by architect George Nelson, who joined the firm as director of design in 1945. Over the next four decades Nelson was to have an enormous influence upon Herman Miller, not only for his personal design contributions, but also for the talented designers he recruited to its ranks, including; Isamu Noguchi, Charles and Ray Eames, Robert Propst, and textile designer Alexander Girard. Beginning in the late 1940s, the period under Nelson's guidance saw Herman Miller produce some of the world's most iconic pieces of modern furniture, including the Noguchi table, Eames Lounge Chair, Marshmallow sofa, Ball clock (actually produced by Howard Miller Clock Company), and the Sling sofa. Dirk Jan De Pree continued to serve as Herman Miller CEO until 1961, when he was forced by illness to step down. He was succeeded by his son, Hugh De Pree. Hugh served as company CEO until the mid-1980s, when he was succeeded by his brother Max De Pree, who held the position until 1990. In 1961, Herman Miller set up the Herman Miller Research Division, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This division developed the \\"Action Office\\" line in 1964 under the supervision of Robert Propst and with the design assistance of George Nelson's New York design studio. Though the initial line, known as \\"Action Office I\\", was not a success, it led Propst to develop the \\"Action Office II\\" line, which introduced the \\"Office cubicle\\". The impact of Action Office II on the workplace revolutionized the office environment. In 1978, Action Office II was renamed simply \\"Action Office\\". Herman Miller's line of Action Office products generated sales of over $5 billion . George Nelson's influence at Herman Miller gradually declined during the 1970s as new designers joined the company, including Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf, who co-designed the Equa chair (still widely marketed) and in the 1990s developed the highly-successful Aeron chair. In 1981, Herman Miller started to work with the Italian designer Clino T. Castelli on the process of designing physical environments: a so-called Design PrimarioVictor Margolin, Design Discourse: History, Theory, Criticism, Chicago, Illinois, University of Chicago Press, 1989 including CMF Design and Ethospace design concept.Sam Hall Kaplan, West Week Spotlights Furniture, April 07, 1985, Los Angeles Times Designer Tom Newhouse introduced the \\"Newhouse Group\\" of free-standing furniture in 1987, and assisted with the \\"Ethospace\\" wall panel system for the Action Office line. Ray Wilkes designed the \\"Modular Seating Group\\", popularly known as the Chicklet Chairs. Artist Stephen Frykholm is also noted for his contributions to Herman Miller. From 1970 to 1989, Frykholm produced a series of promotional posters for Herman Miller's annual summer picnics, some of which are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, and remain highly sought-after art prints. ==Workplace== According to CNN Money, , Herman Miller was ranked as the second most admired company in the Home Equipment, Furnishing division. They also scored first in Innovation, People Management, Use of Corporate Assets, Social Responsibility, and Quality of Products/Services. In Quality of Management they scored second place, third in Long Term Investments, fourth in Financial Soundness, and ninth in Global Competitiveness. In March 2008, they settled an antitrust lawsuit with the states of New York, Michigan, and Illinois for $750,000. The lawsuit focused on Herman Miller's use of a suggested retail pricing policy, which was found to be within the bounds of the law. Today, many companies employ such policies to avoid price erosion in the internet channel. ==Sustainability== Herman Miller has engaged in a number of initiatives to promote sustainability, and many of them have had cost-saving implications for the company. The company has developed a technique of mixing sawdust with chicken manure to produce topsoil. The company also uses a database to track every chemical in each product used by the company, in order to eliminate harmful chemicals from their products. Management of the company has expressed concerns about global warming, and the company was using 27% renewable energy . The company also issues a sustainability report.Tim Zaun, \\"Herman Miller, the BHAG, and Internalizing Sustainability\\", GreenerDesign, Greenbiz.com, Jun. 22, 2007. Herman Miller calls its driving sustainability initiative \\"Perfect Vision\\" and it put the strategy in place in 2004. This is a broad initiative that sets significant targets for the year 2020. These targets include zero landfill disposal, zero hazardous waste generation, zero air emissions (VOCs), zero process water discharge, 100% green electrical energy use, company buildings constructed to a minimum LEED Silver certification, and 100% of sales from DfE-approved products.Our Vision - Herman Miller Many of Herman Miller's products are designed to be ecologically sound, and many are good examples of ecodesign techniques for achieving sustainability include saving materials, energy efficient manufacturing, recycled content, and recyclable content, including design for disassembly. The design process also utilizes life cycle assessment. Herman Miller helped fund the start of the United States Green Building Council, and hired architect William McDonough + Partners to design a factory incorporating green design principles. The building is known as the \\"Greenhouse\\", and is an example of green building.

He was a performer, manufacturer and teacher of the uilleann pipes throughout his life. Samuel Rowsome, Leo‚Äôs grandfather sent his sons, John, Thomas and William to a German teacher of music who lived in Ferns, near their home in County Wexford to learn the theory of music and how to play various instruments. This knowledge was passed on through William to his son, Leo who made good use of it in his teaching, writing music for his many pupils. Leo was born in Harold's Cross, Dublin in 1903. His father, William realised that his son had the ability to become a talented musician and craftsman. Constantly watching his father making and repairing instruments, Leo learned the art of pipe making and instrument repair. So rapid was his progress at piping that in 1919 at the age of sixteen he was appointed teacher of the uilleann pipes at Dublin‚Äôs Municipal School of Music (now Dublin Institute of Technology Conservatory of Music and Drama) for 50 years. In 1925, Leo‚Äôs father died at the age of fifty-five. Leo successfully carried on the family business, after completing his own set of pipes in 1926. He also taught at Dublin‚Äôs Pipers Club of which he was president, having revived it as Cumann na P√≠obair√≠ in 1936 after an 11-year hiatus. Leo was the first uilleann piper to perform on Irish National Radio in the early 1920s when he played solo and later in duets with Frank O‚ÄôHiggins (fiddle), Micheal O Duinn (fiddle) and Leo‚Äôs brother John (fiddle). Leo‚Äôs \\"All Ireland Trio\\" comprised Neilus Cronin, (flute), Seamus O‚ÄòMahony (fiddle) and Leo on pipes. He formed his Pipes Quartet in the mid-1930s and broadcast regularly throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Leo was the first Irish artist to perform on BBC TV (1933). He made many recordings for Decca, Columbia and HMV. His last commercial recording, CC1 ‚ÄúRi na bPiobairi‚Äù (King of the Pipers) was made for Claddagh Records in 1966. In 1934 Leo married Helena Williams, from Taghmon, Co. Wexford. They had two sons, Leon Rowsome (1936-1994), Liam Rowsome (1939-1997) and twin daughters, Helena and Olivia. All four showed musical talent on a variety of instruments. Leo's eldest son Leon carried on the tradition of uilleann pipe making in the Rowsome family, toured internationally as a solo piper, and recorded two solo albums on the uilleann pipes. Leon and his wife Noreen (O'Flaherty) Rowsome from Corca Dhuibhne, had five children (Kevin, Mary, Anne, Nuala and Caitr√≠ona) and ten grandchildren (Leo's great-grandchildren), five of whom (Tierna, Naoise, Mark √ìg, Luke and Alastair) are sixth-generation uilleann pipers. Leon's son (Leo‚Äôs grandson) Kevin Rowsome is an accomplished and world-renowned fifth-generation uilleann piper. https://comhaltas.ie/music/detail/comhaltaslive_400_8_tierna_rowsome_mark_lysaght/ Leo Rowsome died suddenly whilst adjudicating ‚ÄòThe Fiddler of Dooney Competition‚Äô in Riverstown, County Sligo on 20 September 1970.

He took his doctorate in 1835 with a thesis on the structure of the retina. After a visit to France and England, he returned to G√∂ttingen as Privatdozent, and in 1842 became Professor of Surgery and Director of the Friedrichs Hospital at Kiel. Six years later he succeeded Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1794‚Äì1847) as Director of the Clinical Institute for Surgery and Ophthalmology at the Charit√© in Berlin, and remained there till 1882, when failing health forced him to retire. Langenbeck was a bold and skillful surgeon, but preferred not to operate while other means afforded a prospect of success. He specialised in military surgery and became an authority on the treatment of gunshot wounds. He served as general field- surgeon of the army in the First Schleswig War in 1848 and saw active service in the Second Schleswig War in 1864, being ennobled for his services. He also served in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71. He was in Orl√©ans at the end of 1870 after the city had been taken by the Prussians and in his capacity as surgeon or as consultant tended to the wounded men with whom every public building was packed. He also utilized the opportunities for instruction that thus arose, and the Milit√§r-√§rztliche Gesellschaft, which met twice a week for some months, and in the discussions of which every surgeon in the city, irrespective of nationality, was invited to take part, was mainly formed by his energy and enthusiasm. He died at Wiesbaden in September 1887. von Langenbeck is perhaps best known today as the \\"father of the surgical residency\\". Under his tutelage at the Charite in Berlin, he conceived and developed a system whereby new medical graduates would live at the hospital as they gradually assumed a greater role in the day-to-day care and supervision of surgical patients. Among his most well- known \\"house staff\\" were such illustrious surgeons as Billroth and Emil Theodor Kocher. The great achievement of his house-staff model was acknowledged by no less than Sir William Osler and William Halsted, who quickly co-opted his concept into the teaching system of the Departments of Medicine and Surgery, respectively, at the Johns Hopkins University Hospital in the late 19th century. ==ReferencesCategory:1810 births Category:1887 deaths Category:People from Cuxhaven (district) Category:German surgeons Category:German military personnel of the Franco- Prussian War Category:Prussian people of the Austro-Prussian War Category:German military doctors Category:People from the Kingdom of Hanover Category:University of G√∂ttingen alumni Category:University of Kiel faculty Category:Humboldt University of Berlin faculty Category:Prussian generals Category:Physicians of the Charit√© ","title":"Bernhard von Langenbeck"},{"id":"1444362","text":"Maria Alexandrovna (), born Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine (8 August 1824 ‚Äì 3 June 1880) was Empress of Russia as the first wife and political adviser of Tsar Alexander II. She was one of the founders of the Russian Red Cross. The legal daughter of Grand Duke Ludwig II of Hesse and Princess Wilhelmine of Baden, Wilhelmine Marie was raised in austerity but was well educated by her mother, who died when her daughter was very young. She was only 14 years old when the Tsarevich Alexander Nikolaevich (later Tsar Alexander II of Russia) fell in love with her while he was traveling to Western Europe. She arrived in Russia in September 1840, converted to the Orthodox Church, changed the name Wilhelmine Marie for Maria Alexandrovna, and took the title of Grand Duchess. For fourteen years (1840‚Äì1855), she was Tsarevna, the wife of the heir of the Russian throne. Although she didn't enjoy court life because of her withdrawn nature, she identified with her adopted country. After the death of Nicholas I, Maria Alexandrovna became the Russian Empress consort and was known for her intellect. She organized and expanded the funds of the Russian Red Cross, established Russia's first all- female schools, and helped Alexander II to end the serfdom. However, she suffered from tuberculosis since 1863 and spent long stays in southern Europe to avoid harsh winters, which worsened after the death of her eldest son Nicholas Alexandrovich. Although she and her husband were unofficially separated shortly afterwards, Maria was treated with respect and love by her surviving family. The Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg and Mariyinsky Palace were built with her help and named after her. ==Childhood== Ludwig I.

Maximiliane Wilhelmine Auguste Sophie Marie was born on in Darmstadt, Hesse, Germany.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p.49Gilbert, Alexander II and Tsarkoe Selo, p. 40 She was the youngest child among the seven children of Prince Hereditary Ludwig of Hesse and Princess Wilhelmine of Baden, sister of Russian Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna. Although her parents were first cousins, they were a mismatched couple:Zeepvat, Heiligenberg, p. 2 Ludwig was dull, shy and withdrawn, while Wilhelmine, eleven years his junior, was pretty and charming. After the birth of three sons, the couple grew apart during the turbulent years of the Napoleonic Wars while Ludwig was in the battlefields. After a gap of eleven years, Princess Wilhelmine went on to have four more children, but court rumors attributed the biological paternity of the second set of children to Baron August von Senarclens de Grancy, Grand Master of the stables of the Grand Duke of Hesse.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 13 Of those four children, Marie and her brother Alexander, who was a year older, lived to adulthood. While Prince Ludwig officially recognized the children as his, he and his wife became estranged by 1827. In 1828, Princess Wilhelmine moved with her two younger children and their household to Heiligenberg, a mountainside estate nestled on a hill overlooking the village of Jugenheim that she purchased that same yearZeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p.50 Wilhelmine Marie was 4 years old when she moved with 5-years-old Alexander and their mother to Heiligenberg, where the siblings spent most of their childhood. The castle had been previously a nunnery and was located some 20 kilometers from Darmstadt. In 1829, however, their parents celebrated their silver wedding anniversary in apparent harmony.Zeepvat, Heiligenberg, p. 3 In 1830, their paternal grandfather, Ludwig I of Hesse, died and their father became the new reigning Grand Duke. The ducal gradually reconciled and used Heiligenberg in the summer months. Wilhelmine Marie grew up under the care of her mother, who was responsible for her high education and had preference for French culture. This was evident in her lessons, which had special emphasis on finances, history, and literature. After her mother died of tuberculosis, her lady-in-waiting and possible paternal aunt, Marianne von Senarclens de Grancy, successfully took over the responsibility of 11-years-old Marie's education. After their mother's death, Marie and Alexander moved permanently to their father's court in Darmstadt. The siblings would remain very close throughout their lives. She became close to her two elder brothers Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse, and Prince Karl of Hesse. However, the cloud over the birth's legitimacy continued to be cast upon Marie and Alexander since Ludwig II was cold and distant towards the children. ==Engagement== Alexander II and Maria Alexandrovna. Engraving. In 1839, Tsarevich Alexander Nikolaevich, son of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, traveled to western Europe to complete his education and search for a wife.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p.11 His parents had preselected Princess Alexandrine of Baden, but he was unmoved.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p.31 On 13 March, after visiting the courts of Prussia, W√ºrttemberg and Baden, Alexander's entourage made an unplanned stop at the court of Hesse. Although the Grand Duke's only surviving daughter wasn't on the list of possible brides,Radinsky, Alexander II, p. 66 they stopped for one day in Darmstadt because it was on their way and they needed some rest. Invited to a performance of Gaspare Spontini's La vestale by the Grand Duke, Alexander was introduced to 14-years-old Marie, who was slender and tall for her age, but still wore her hair loose. She was eating cherries and had to spit the pits into her hands when she was pushed forward to be introduced to the Tsarevich.Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 41 Alexander's tutor, Vasily Zhukovsky, who was traveling with him, described the Princess as: \\"modest, charming and even intelligent.\\"Radinsky, Alexander II, p. 67 Alexander was smittenVan der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p.12 and stayed to dine with the boring Ludwig II to see Marie again. Before he left Darmstadt, she gave him a locket containing a piece of her hair. That night Alexander wrote to his father: \\"I liked her terribly at first sight. If you permit it father, I will come back to Darmstadt after England.\\"Radinsky, Alexander II, p. 67 As his son had carefully planned, Nicholas I received the letter nine days later on the day of the annunciation and saw the timing as a good omen. He gave his approval despite the gossip surrounding her birth: if Ludwig II recognized her as his daughter, that was good enough.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p.32 In early June, Alexander returned to Darmstadt to ask marriage to Marie, who accepted. As she wasn't yet fifteen, a long engagement period was necessary before the actual marriage would take place. Towards the closing weeks of 1839, he returned to Darmstadt to visit her again. A Russian Orthodox priest came to Darmstadt to give her instruction in the Russian Orthodox religion.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 13 The engagement between the Princess of Hesse and the Russian Tsarevich was officially announced in April 1840. Two generations earlier, another princess of Hesse-Darmstadt had married a Tsarevich: Marie's paternal great-aunt, Natalia Alexeievna, the first wife of Tsar Paul I, Alexander's grandfather. In addition, Marie's maternal aunt Louise of Baden (Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna) had married Tsar Alexander I, though she died when Marie was only two years old. However, Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia) objected to her son's choice of a wife. The Empress wasn't only disturbed by the rumors surrounding Marie's paternity, but ill-disposed towards the Hesse family and concerned that Marie might have inherited her mother's consumption. In a letter to his mother, Alexander wrote: \\"I love her, and I would rather give up the throne, than not marry her. I will marry only her, that's my decision!\\" After being persuaded by her husband, Empress Alexandra went to Frankfurt, where she met Marie in June. By then, Marie had quickly learned the Russian language. The Empress liked what she saw and gave her permission for the marriage. ==Tsesarevna== ===Wedding=== Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia) with her daughter Maria Nikolaevna and her daughters-in-law: Grand Duchesses Maria Alexandrovna and Alexandra Iosifovna, 1853. A few weeks after her sixteenth birthday in August 1840, Marie's party set out for Russia. She was escorted by her brother Alexander and her governess, Mlle. von Grancy, who remained in Russia. Marie arrived in September and shared her impressions of Saint Petersburg in a letter to her family: \\"St. Petersburg is much more beautiful than I thought. The Neva River contributes to this. I think it is difficult to find a greater city. The view from the Winter Palace on the Neva is wonderful!\\" Her arrival in Russia was greeted with great ceremony with a continuous round of amusements. French plays, operas and new ballets were performed in the Chinese theater, and each Sunday her future mother-in-law gave a banquet in the Alexander Palace. However, Marie had a hard time adapting to her new surroundings. Years later, her-lady-in waiting Anna Tiutcheva was to write about this period in the life of her mistress: \\"Having been raised in seclusion even, one might say, in austerity, in the little castle of Jugenheim, where she saw her father only rarely, she was more frightened than bedazzled when she was suddenly brought to the most opulent and brilliant court of all European nations. She told me that many times. After constant battles of overcoming her awkwardness, later on, under cover of darkness and the stillness of her room, she would give freedom to her muffled cries\\".Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 16 Having been raised in the Lutheran religion, Marie was received into the Russian Orthodox Church on and became Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna. On the next day, the official betrothal was held in the presence of the Imperial Family, the whole court, the Russian nobility, many notable foreign guests, and representatives of foreign states.Gilbert, Alexander II and Tsarkoe Selo, p. 41 The wedding took place on in the Cathedral Church of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, on the eve of Alexander's twenty-third birthday.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p.33 Maria wore a white dress richly embroidered with silver, a crimson robe with white satin and fine ermine fastened on her shoulders, and diamond jewelry (tiara, earrings, a necklace, and bracelets). Her future mother-in-law decorated her hair with orange blossoms sticking them between the diamonds in her tiara and pinned a small branch on her chest. The wedding was attended by members of the Russian Imperial family, the court and numerous guests and it was followed by a festive dinner ball. ===First years=== After the wedding, the young couple settled in a suite of rooms in the south-west block of the Winter Palace. During the summer, they resided in Tsarskoye Selo. Their apartments were located in the Zubov wing of the Catherine Palace.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 17 Maria Alexandrovna struggled to assimilate herself with the court and make friends. Endless balls and court reception bored her, but etiquette obliged her to fulfill the duties of representation as the wife of the Tsarevich. She preferred country life in Tsarskoye Selo, where she enjoyed a more private life.Gilbert, Alexander II and Tsarkoe Selo, p. 42 Like her late mother, she took great interest in horticulture and imported flowers from her native Germany, such as lilies of the valley and cowslips. In the mornings, she took long walks with her ladies- in-waiting through the parks at the Catherine and Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo. In this early period of her life in Russia, Maria was guided by her husband's aunt, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna. Although seventeen years apart in age, the two women became close friends and frequently ran their salons as a joint venture.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 171 Maria and Alexander made a happy couple, full of tender care for one another. He ordered that banquets of fresh strawberries should be placed on his wife's dining table and enjoyed her company spending his mornings sitting on her bed. There were regular informal gatherings at the young couple's household of loud readings, music, and card playing. Alongside her husband, Maria read Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time, Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls, Feodor Dostoevsky's Poor Folk, and later, Ivan Turgenev's A Sportsman's Sketches, sharing Alexander's sympathies for the plight of the serfs and becoming an ardent abolitionist. The Tsarevich and the Tsarevna charmed their guests with their manners. She gave useful advice to her husband, who in turn gave her confidence to guide herself into society. Sixteen months after her wedding, Maria Alexandrovna gave birth to her first child, Alexandra, born in August 1842, two years after her arrival in Russia. In September 1843, she gave birth to a son and heir presumptive to the throne, Nicholas. Two more sons, Alexander and Vladimir, were born in 1845 and 1847. Shortly after having her third son, her health began to fail and she had to go to Bad Kissingen in Bavaria to recuperate. To mark each birth, Alexander and Maria planted oak trees in their private garden at Tsarskoye Selo, where skittles, swings and slides were provided for the children. Indoors, she played the piano and created tapestries with her family. In July 1849, both parents were devastated when their daughter Alexandra died from infant meningitis at the age of six and a half. Grief-stricken by her loss, Maria had to go to the sea town of Revel in Estonia to recuperate.Nelipa, Alexander III His Life and Reign, p. 10 Even many years later, she would still cry over the death of her eldest child.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p.52 In January 1850, she gave birth to a fourth son, Grand Duke Alexei. During her first decade in Russia, Maria Alexandrovna enjoyed the company and support of her brother Alexander, who had accompanied her to Russia to follow a military career there. In 1851, he contracted a morganatic marriage with Julia von Hauke, one of his sister's ladies-in-waiting. As a consequence, he fell from grace and had to resign his Russian commission. He left the country, returning to Heiligenberg, the siblings' childhood home. In October 1853, Maria had a much- awaited second daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna.Nelipa, Alexander III His Life and Reign, p. 22 ==Empress== On 18 February 1855, Nicholas I died of pneumonia and was succeded by Alexander to the Russian throne as Tsar.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 179 It was a turbulent period as Russian troops were being defeated by an international coalition in the Crimean War.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 178 After a siege lasting eleven months, Sevastopol fell in September 1855. With a prospect of invasion from the west if the war continued, Russia sued for peace in March 1856 in Paris.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 181 The humiliation of defeat was left behind by the coronation festivities that were held with Byzantine splendor from 14 to 26 August 1856. The coronation ceremony lasted five hours took place at the Assumption Cathedral of Moscow Kremlin on . When four court ladies tried to fix the crown to the 30-years-old Empress's head it nearly clattered to the ground, saved only by the fold of her cloak, a bad omen by the time.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 182 Nine months after the coronation, Maria Alexandrovna gave birth to a fifth son, Sergei, in April 1857.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p.53 Suffering from depression, she was sent to Kissingen to recuperate.Nelipa, Alexander III His Life and Reign, p. 37 On 3 October [O.S. 21 September] 1860, she gave birth to Paul, her eighth and final child,Nelipa, Alexander III His Life and Reign, p. 48 but was so weakened that she was forced to spend several months resting on a couch in her boudoir in the Winter Palace.King, Livadia in the Reign of Alexander II, p. 147 A month later, her mother-in-law died. ===Charity Institutions=== Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems, the symbols from which the movement derives its name. Since Russian tradition gave precedence to the Empress Mother over the reigning tsar's consort, it was only then that Maria Alexandrovna took a more decisive role in charitable activities. It was with her that the Red Cross was established in Russia, which quickly turned into the largest and wealthiest public structure. Under her organization, the institution accumulated in its accounts huge sums of money transferred by benefactors from all over the Empire.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 185 The women's committees recollected twice the average funds recollected by provincial committees.https://core.ac.uk/reader/210604252106 Maria Alexandrovna was the supreme patroness of the Red Cross: In total, she patronized 5 hospitals, 12 alms-houses, 30 shelters, 2 institutes, 38 gymnasiums, 156 lower schools, and 5 private charitable societies. Empress Maria expanded charitable activities during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78. The beginning of a new era in women's education in Russia was marked by her establishment of open all-union women's educational institutions in 1872. The students received lessons of physics, chemistry, and medicine. ===Emancipation Manifesto=== A 1907 painting by Boris Kustodiev depicting Russian serfs listening to the proclamation of the Emancipation Manifesto in 1861. Tsar Alexander II relied on Maria Alexandrovna's judgment and serious nature to support his government, opening official documents and discussing states of affairs with her. She supported Alexander's ideals of introducing reforms. Two opposite philosophical currents divided Russian politics of their time: Westernizers and Slavophiles. The Westernizers, led by Alexander Herzen, Vissarion Belinsky, Ivan Turgenev and Mikhail Bakunin, wanted Russia aligned to Western science and values such as free thought, rationalism and individual liberty.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 172 By contrast, the Slavophiles, led by Aleksey Khomyakov, the two Aksakov brothers, Konstantine and Ivan, and Ivan Kireyevsky and his brother Pyotr Kireevsky advocated three principles: Autocracy, Orthodoxy and Nationalism.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 173 Although she embraced Slavism with fervor, Maria Alexandrovna encouraged freedom and capitalism. She played an important role in the liberation of the peasants that came into fruition with the Emancipation Manifesto on , ending the serfdom in Russia.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 185 ===Court life=== Empress Maria Alexandrovna alongside her husband, Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The Russian court began its season early December and lasted until Lent.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 189 While subzero temperatures and icy winds kept the streets empty, balls and banquets were held indoors in overheated palaces, where their gracious host, Alexander II, gave intimate parties known as Les Bals des Palmi√®res for which hundreds of palm trees were brought to the Winter Palace in horse-drawn boxes.Cowles, The Romanovs, p. 190 However, Maria Alexandrovna didn't share her husband's enthusiasm since she still disliked court events and considered Russian nobility frivolous.King, Livadia in the Reign of Alexander II, p. 146 Society complained that she seemed cold, distant, and had no taste in dress. Behind her back, she was called la petite bourgeoise allemande. Instead of letting the gossips affect her, Empress Maria paid great attention to the upbringing and education of her children, carefully choosing experienced teachers and ensuring their environment was strict. Her efforts centered on her eldest son, Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich, her favorite child who resembled her most.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p.36 ==Declining health== Empress Maria Alexandrovna wearing a mourning dress. Kyiv residence. As Empress consort, Maria Alexandrovna had to attend many state functions, but from the 1860s her health declined. The doctors advised her to spend the winters in a warm climate and stop intercourse with her husband in an effort to prolong her life. Preferring to remain in Russia, she agreed to the suggestion of recuperating in Crimea. Alexander II then bought for his wife the Livadia villa,King, Livadia in the Reign of Alexander II, p. 148 a two-story wooden villa from the heirs of Polish Count Lev Potocki.King, Livadia in the Reign of Alexander II, p. 145 At the end of August 1861, Maria, her husband, and their children Alexei, Sergei and Paul visited Crimea for the first time.King, Livadia in the Reign of Alexander II, p. 148 She was charmed by the southern flora, the mild climate, the beautiful house, and the surrounding park.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 29 The modest villa was expanded with the additions of a large palace, a small palace, and a church. Construction took place between 1862 and 1866 under the direction of Ippolito Monighetti, a Russian architect who had redecorated her apartments in the Catherine Palace in the 1850s.King, Livadia in the Reign of Alexander II, p. 153 Feeling better, Maria Alexandrovna financed the Mariinsky Theatre in St Peterburg in 1859-1860, built according to the plans of architect Albert Cavos as an opera and ballet house. The theatre opened on 2 October 1860, with a performance of Mikhail Glinka's opera A Life for the Tsar. The new theatre was named Mariinsky after its imperial patroness.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 25 (The name was changed during the Soviet period, but the original name was restored in 1992, and at present there is a bust of the Empress in the main entrance foyer.) The humid summers in Saint Petersburg began to take a toll on Maria's frail constitution, to the point she was absent from Russia's capital for long periods of time. In June 1864, she left Russia, accompanied by her husband and their three youngest children, to take the waters in the Bavarian spa of Bad Kissingen. King Ludwig II of Bavaria came to meet his distant aunt and became infatuated with her. In late July, Alexander II returned to Russia, but Maria traveled to Bad Schwalbach, where she celebrated her birthday with Ludwig II. In late August, the whole family was reunited in Darmstadt. As she was still sick, Maria Alexandrovna spent the winter in Nice, where she received the announcement of the Tsarevich's engagement to Princess Dagmar of Denmark. Nicholas was nevertheless in frail health and joined his mother in Nice in early 1865, but was seriously ill with meningitis of the spine by then. Attended by her brother Alexander and her sister-in-law, the Empress didn't leave her son's side during his illness. Nicholas was initially misdiagnosed with simple rheumatism and deteriorated rapidly. The whole family gathered around his deathbed on . Princess Dagmar, who was with the Romanovs during her fianc√©'s final days, was quickly engaged to his brother, the future Emperor Alexander III, whom she would marry the following year. Both Alexander II and Maria were devastated by the death of their eldest son on whom their hopes for the future lay. The Tsarina spent the following year grieving and found some solace with her family in Hesse, since her brother Karl had recently lost his only daughter Anna. In 1866, Alexander II and Maria Alexandrovna celebrated their silver wedding anniversary. With the passing of the years, they still respected each other but grew apart romantically, particularly after the deterioration of her health and the death of their eldest children. Alexander had many affairs, but they didn't threaten their marriage. From the mid-1850s until 1862, he had a relationship with Alexandra Sergeevna Dolgoruki, one of Russia's most illustrious noblewomen and the Tsarina's ladies-in-waiting. This affair ended in 1862 when Alexandra married General Pyotr Pavlovich Albedinsky (1826-1883). In 1865, Alexander II fell deeply in love with 18-year-old Catherine Dolgoruki, a distant cousin of his former mistress. Catherine resisted his advances for over a year, but they became lovers in July 1866. Empress Maria inevitably heard about the affair, but she initially didn't attach great importance to it. In order to have comfortable accommodations and rest in their route from St Petersburg to Crimea, Alexander II ordered the reconstruction of the Imperial Palace in Kiev.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 22 It was in total disrepair and abandoned for almost half a century after the palace burned down in a series of fires in the early 19th century. The commission was assigned in 1867 to the architect Konstantin Mayevsky, using old drawings and watercolors as guide. Work took place from 1868 to 1870 and the Kievan palace was then renamed Mariyinsky Palace after the Empress Maria Alexandrovna.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 24 By her wish, a large park was established off the southern side of the palace. The palace was used as a residence for visiting members of the imperial family until 1917. Currently it is the official ceremonial residence of the President of Ukraine.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine ==Last years== Empress Maria Alexandrovna with two of her children: Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna and Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich. From the early 1860s through the 1870s, Maria Alexandrovna began to pay extended visits to her homeland. Usually accompanied by her husband, children and their Russian entourage, she stayed at Schloss Heiligenberg, the small castle of her brother Alexander, who lived with his morganatic wife and their children at Jugenheim outside Darmstadt. There she met Princess Alice, second daughter of Queen Victoria and wife of her nephew Louis of Hesse. She resisted Alice's suggestion that her brother, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, marry her only daughter Maria, but the couple would wed anyway in 1874. In December 1875, Empress Maria visited England to meet her first British grandchild. Queen Victoria wrote in her diary: \\"I thought her very ladylike, kind and amiable. We were at ease at once, but she has a sad expression and looks so delicate. I think we should get on very well together, poor thing. I pity her much.\\" After Princess Alice died in 1878, it was Maria Alexandrovna's turn to pity the British royal family. She invited her motherless relatives to visit during the holidays she spent with brother Alexander at Heiligenberg. It was during these visits that her second youngest son Sergei met his future wife, Alice's second daughter, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine. It was also here that Maria met Elisabeth's youngest surviving sister, Princess Alix, who would eventually become the devoted and ill-fated wife of Maria's eldest grandson, Emperor Nicholas II. A legend alleges that on a visit to Darmstadt, upon meeting Alix, Empress Maria turned to her ladies-in-waiting with the words, \\"Kiss her hand. That is your empress to be.\\"King, Greg The Last Empress: the Life and Times of Alexandra Feodorovna, Tsarina of Russia (Birch Lane Press, 1994) pg. 13 Tsar Alexander had three children with Princess Dolgoruki, whom he moved into the Imperial Palace during Maria's final illness out of fear that she might become the target of assassins. The affair, in the face of the Tsarina's declining health, served to alienate the rest of his adult children, save their son Alexei and their daughter.Van Der Kiste, p. 67 When the Grand Duchess Marie made a visit to her mother in May 1880, she was horrified to learn of the imperial mistress' living arrangements and confronted her father.Van Der Kiste, p. 97 Courtiers spread stories that the dying Empress was forced to hear the noise of Catherine's children moving about overhead, but their rooms were actually far away from each other.Radzinsky (2005), p. 300 After Maria Alexandrovna asked to meet her husband's children with Catherine, he brought their two older children, George and Olga, to her deathbed, where she kissed and blessed both children. Both rulers were in tears during the meeting.Tarsaidze (1970) With her blessing, the couple entered into a morganatic marriage on .–¢–æ–ª–º–∞—á–µ–≤ –ï. –ü. –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä III –∏ –µ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è. –ú.: –¢–µ—Ä—Ä–∞, 2007. ‚Äî (in Russian) Empress Maria Alexandrovna died on 3 June 1880, aged 55.

The inscription inside the Ding documents that Prince Wu worshipped his ancestors and prayed for his offspring. Wu was a son of King Zhuang. King Zhuang of Chu (, reigned 613-591 BC) was a monarch of the Zhou dynasty State of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period in ancient China. His personal name was Xiong L√º (), his ancestral name was Mi (), and his posthumous title was King Zhuang. He was one of the five rulers dubbed the Five Hegemons by Xunzi and attempted to wrest control of China from King Ding of Zhou. The son of King Mu of Chu, Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC. According to a legend in the Records of the Grand Historian, for the first three years of his reign Zhuang wasted time in pleasure seeking, but, when challenged by two courtiers, reformed his ways. The king made Sunshu Ao his chancellor. Sunshu Ao began a series of major dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir in modern-day northern Anhui province. After some military successes, King Zhuang attempted to usurp King Ding of Zhou. According to a well known story, probably an invention of the Warring States period, he asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China, but was rebuffed. This incident gave rise to the chengyu \\"to enquire about ding in the central plains\\", i.e. to have great ambitions ( - see the entry at wiktionary.) In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the State of Jin. His progress from lazy regent to hegemon gave rise to the Chinese chengyu \\"amaze [others] with one cry\\" ( - see the entry at wiktionary).

He was a Vice-President and an influential member of the Northumbrian Pipers Society from 1930 until his death. ==Life and music== He was born at Dilston Park, near Corbridge, Northumberland, in January 1902 and died in November 1968.Billy Pigg, the Border Minstrel. Leader Sound, 1971: LEA 4006 He learned the instrument from several pipers including Tom and Henry Clough as well as Richard Mowat, but, according to Tommy Breckons, Batey of Stannington was his main teacher. Tommy later quoted Billy's reminiscences of the informal sessions at the Cloughs' and others: When he lived at Blagdon, he used to bike down to Clough's. There were fourteen or fifteen pipers all living in that area, and they took turns to play at each other's houses, including Billy's. Billy told him that when he first went to one of these sessions there were fourteen pipers in the house, ..., and everyone was better than me! By God..., there were some good pipers. But all I had to dee was practice and get up alongside them.Some Memories, Tommy Breckons, Northumbrian Pipers' Society Magazine, v.18, 1997 He learned by ear at this stage, and when he won a learners' competition in 1923, it was noted that he played the Barrington Hornpipe, but not quite as it is written. An early photograph of him from 1924, with a new set of pipes, is at; he had won a Learners' Competition organised by William Cocks in this year, when he had been playing for three and a half years. The pipes in the photograph are the set made by Cocks, and offered as a trophy in the Competition. Billy went on to win these pipes outright in 1927. After he won the Spencer Cup at Bellingham Show in 1928, Cocks recorded that he was debarred from most contests, 'to give other pipers a chance'. At this time he must certainly have been playing in the traditional staccato style characteristic of the instrument, though in later years his style was much freer. In 1930 he moved with his parents to a farm in Coquetdale, in the north of the county. He subsequently began playing with other musicians in this area, particularly John Armstrong and Annie Snaith, and later Archie Dagg ‚Äì together the band were known as the Border Minstrels. In the 1950s he was noted for playing not only Northumbrian, but also Scottish and Irish tunes on the smallpipes. He also wrote many fine tunes for the instrument. A. D. Schofield and Julia Say produced a biography and tune book, The Border Minstrel, published by the Northumbrian Pipers' Society in 1997. This includes all his known compositions. These include the slow airs The Gypsy's Lullaby and Border Spirit, marches in 6/8 and 4/4 such as Bonny Woodside and The Old Drove Road, many hornpipes, including The Carrick Hornpipe and The Biddlestone Hornpipe, jigs such as Coffee Bridge and reels such as Cote Walls and Anne of Hindhope. One of his most spectacular pieces is Bill Charlton's Fancy, a 6/8 variation set. His version of the traditional tune, The Wild Hills of Wannies with his own variations, was entirely distinctive, and a good example of his Highland-influenced style. During the 1950s Forster Charlton recorded his playing on many occasions; some of these can be heard on Radio FARNE. In 1958 Royce Wilson, an American working in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, acquired a tape recorder and made some recordings of him. Other recordings were made by the BBC and by the School of Scottish Studies. An album of selected recordings made by Forster Charlton was issued as Billy Pigg, the Border Minstrel on the Leader label in 1971, and re-released on CD in 2004. Through these recordings of Pigg's own compositions and his repertoire of traditional tunes, Pigg became influential throughout the world of bagpiping. Most players of the instrument will have several of Pigg's compositions in their repertoire. Recently the Northumbrian Pipers' Society issued an expanded second editionBilly Pigg, The Border Minstrel, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2nd edition, 2 vols., C. Ross and J. Say, , . of his music, the two volumes respectively covering his own compositions and his distinctive versions of other tunes. They also include a description of his playing style as well as transcriptions, some in great detail, of most of the surviving recordings. ===Playing style=== The distinguishing characteristic of Pigg's playing style is the use of complex open-fingered ornaments, in imitation of Irish and Highland piping. His father was a Highland piper, while Billy himself had great interest in Irish music. By contrast, most respected pipers before him would have stuck with an almost wholly staccato style. Tom Clough considered that any departure from this, a style where the chanter was closed and silent between any two notes, would be \\"a grievous error in smallpipe playing\\". It is possible to compare his style with that of Tom Clough. The popular variation set for Northumbrian pipes Holey Ha'penny which is based on a simpler tune known elsewhere in the UK and Ireland as The Chorus Jig, was recorded by Pigg, and Tom Clough in the 1920s. The contrast between the two styles can easily be heard between these recordings. The more open-fingered style was very successful for Pigg's music, allowing him a greater range of expression than a more traditional style. His tempi were very fast - he played for listening, not as a dance musician. Unfortunately, he was suffering badly from worsening ill-health throughout the 1950s and 1960s, when all the recordings were made, and it is certain his playing must have suffered. However, the best of his recordings have a wildness and passion which is both inspiring and wholly distinctive. He has been hugely influential, and many pipers have sought to emulate his style, notably Adrian Schofield. ==Discography== * 1971 Billy Pigg, The Border Minstrel Leader * 1974 Wild Hills O'Wannie, The Small Pipes of Northumbria Topic compilation with five tracks by Billy now available as a download In 2009, \\"Skye Crofter's / The Swallow Tail\\" from Wild Hills O'Wannie, The Small Pipes of Northumbria, was included in Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten as track one on the seventh CD. ==References== ==External links== *Radio FARNE Recordings may be heard on the FARNE website.

As a child he sang in the choir and played piano. In 1959 he joined the Hammersmith Morris Men, in the second week of their existence, beginning a career-long love of folk music. In 1970 he became a regular at a folk club in the Roebuck pub in Tottenham Court Road and led the resident group, Dingle's Chillybom Band. The club hosted a film show of Morris dancing and Ashley Hutchings turned up. It was the beginning of a long musical relationship. In 1972 John recorded his first solo album Jump at the Sun which included Richard Thompson on acoustic guitar. ==In Shropshire == In 1973 Kirkpatrick moved to Shropshire and married Sue Harris. After seeing a dance team called Gloucestershire Old Spot Morris Dancers, he formed Shropshire Bedlams to perform local dances in the Border Morris style. In the early weeks some girls turned up and rather than have a mixed morris team, Harris took the girls aside to form Martha Rhoden's Tuppenny Dish; both teams are still flourishing and celebrated their fortieth anniversary in 2015. By this time Kirkpatrick was an expert player of melodeon, Anglo concertina, and button accordion. Ashley Hutchings' project Battle of the Field floundered when the Albion Country Band broke up. They had recorded not quite enough material for an album. Kirkpatrick had appeared on several of the tracks with Martin Carthy and offered to record two extra tracks with his wife in 1973. It was not released until 1976 but is highly regarded. Harris sang and played oboe and hammered dulcimer, an unusual combination. In 1974 Kirkpatrick and Hutchings produced a themed album The Compleat Dancing Master, a history of English country dancing. In 1976 he teamed up with Carthy for Plain Capers, a collection of morris dance tunes. == Steeleye Span == In 1977 Steeleye Span recruited both Kirkpatrick and Carthy, partly to replace fiddler Peter Knight, Kirkpatrick appearing on the albums Storm Force Ten and Live at Last; in concert with them, he would perform solo morris dances. In the same period, John released two albums as a duo with Sue Harris. John became part of Richard Thompson's backing band in 1978. This brought him such publicity that he was in heavy demand as a session musician. He recorded with Pere Ubu, Viv Stanshall, Jack the Lad, Gerry Rafferty, Maddy Prior and others. In 1980 he released his only single, Jogging Along with My Reindeer. Two more albums with Sue Harris appeared in 1981, but the constant touring, as a duo and as part of other groups, was putting a strain on the marriage. They had four sons together, but parted in the mid eighties. In 1988 he and Sue published Opus Pocus, a collection of many of their own compositions from the previous 20 years, and a selection of some of the (then) more obscure traditional English tunes which had influenced them. == Brass Monkey == In 1979 Kirkpatrick had appeared in the National Theatre Company's stage show Lark Rise to Candleford together with Carthy and trumpeter Howard Evans. Prior to this the use of brass instruments in English folk music was a rare event, but all three had found it thrilling and a couple of years later formed Brass Monkey with Martin Brinsford from the Old Swan Band. The group is an occasional gathering rather than a fixed company. Roy Bailey, like Leon Rosselson has frequently recorded songs of social commentary, frequently on an anti-war theme. John has made several records with Roy Bailey, as well as in a group called Band of Hope. He recorded with Frankie Armstrong in 1996 and 1997. They share a love of early English ballads. == John Kirkpatrick Band== In 1997 John decided to front his own \\"rock-folk\\" band, and put together a line-up consisting of Graeme Taylor (guitar, electric guitar, banjo, mandolin ‚Äì ex Gryphon, The Albion Band and Home Service), Mike Gregory (drums, percussion ‚Äì ex Albion Band, Home Service), Dave Berry (electric bass, double bass, tuba) and Paul Burgess (fiddle, recorders ‚Äì from the Old Swan Band). They made two albums: a live album \\"Force of Habit\\" containing many of John's arrangements of Morris tunes, plus other material from his back catalogue, plus a studio album \\"Welcome To Hell\\" featuring new material. == As soloist == Since 1993 John has recorded seven solo albums. He often unearths obscure English tunes and songs from folk ceremonies. Recently he has started to explore Balkan and Hungarian dance tunes. He has produced one of the only teaching videos for English (D/G) melodeon, also on DVD. A further teaching resource is his 2003 book of traditional tunes, English Choice, and two accompanying CDs. He has recently started to perform with accordion wizard Chris Parkinson as the Sultans of Squeeze, and the pair have released one album. He is remarried. One of his sons, Benji Kirkpatrick, is a member of Faustus, a former member of Bellowhead and Magpie Lane, and has recorded as a solo guitarist. He has succeeded his father as a member of Steeleye Span. All four of John's sons do morris dancing. As a composer, choreographer and musical director John has contributed to over 60 plays in the theatre and on radio. == Discography == ;Solo albums *Jump at the Sun (1972) *Going Spare (1978) *Three in a Row (1983) *Blue Balloon (1987) *Sheepskins (1988) *Earthling (1994) *One Man and His Box (1999) *Mazurka Berzerker (2001) *The Duck Race (2004) *A Short History of John Kirkpatrick (anthology) (1994) *Make No Bones (2 CDs) (2007) *Dance of the Demon Daffodils (2009) *God Speed the Plough (2011) *Coat Tails Flying (2017) ;John Kirkpatrick and Sue Harris *The Rose of Britain's Isle (1974) *Among The Many Attractions at the Show will be a Really High Class Band (1976) *Shreds and Patches (1977) *Facing the Music (1980) *Ballad of the Black Country (1981) *Stolen Ground (1989) ;Ashley Hutchings with John Kirkpatrick *Morris On (1972)with other artists *The Compleat Dancing Master (1974) ;John Kirkpatrick and Martin Carthy *Plain Capers (1976) ;With the Albion Band *Battle of the Field (1976) *Lark Rise To Candleford (1980) *The BBC Sessions (1998) (tracks 1 ‚Äì 4, recorded 1973) ;With John Raven and Sue Harris *The English Canals (1975) [reissued in 1999 as The Bold Navigators ‚Äì The Story of England's Canals in Song] ;With Steeleye Span *Storm Force Ten (1977) *Live at Last!

He belonged to Qadiri Sufi order, and founded the mystic tradition known as Sarwari Qadiri. Little is known about Bahu's life, other than what is written in a hagiography called Manaqib-i Sultani, which was written by one of Bahu's descendants seven generations after Bahu's own time. Sultan Bahu's father was Bayazid Muhammad, who was an Army Officer in the Mughal Army. Sultan Bahu was born in Shorekot, Jhang, in the current Punjab Province of Pakistan. He belonged to Awan Tribe. More than forty books on Sufism are attributed to him (mostly written in Persian), largely dealing with specialised aspects of Islam and Islamic mysticism. He lived during the reigns of Mughal emperors Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb in the 17th century. However, it was his Punjabi poetry which had popular appeal and earned him lasting fame. His verses are sung in many genres of Sufi music, including qawwali and kafi, and tradition has established a unique style of singing his couplets. ==Education== Sultan Bahu's first teacher was his mother, Mai Rasti. She pushed him to seek spiritual guidance from Shah Habib Gilani. Around 1668, Sultan Bahu moved to Delhi for further training under the guidance of Syed Abdul Rehman Jilani Dehlvi, a notable Sufi saint of the Qadiriyya order, and thereafter returned to Punjab where he spent the rest of his life. ==Literary works== The exact number of books written by Sultan Bahu is not known, but it is assumed to be at least one hundred. Forty of them are on Sufism and Islamic mysticism. Most of his writings are in the Persian language except Abyat-e- Bahoo which is written in Punjabi verse.Sultan Hamid Ali,\\"Manaqib-i Sultani\\" Malik Chanan Din Publishers (Regd) Lahore Pakistan 1956 Only the following books written by Sultan Bahu can be found today: * Abyat e Bahu (1967) * Risala e Ruhi * Sultan ul Waham * Nur ul Huda * Aql e Baidar * Mahq ul Faqr * Aurang e Shahi * Jami ul Israr * Taufiq e Hidiyat * Kalid Tauheed * Ain ul Faqr * Israr e Qadri (1908)Sultan Bahu books on Rekhta.org website Retrieved 18 May 2020 * Kaleed e Jannat * Muhqam ul Faqr * Majalis un Nabi * Muftah ul Arifeen * Hujjat ul Israr * Kashf ul Israar * Mahabat ul Israr * Ganj ul Israr * Fazl ul Liqa * Dewaan e Bahu == Spiritual lineage == In his writings, Sultan Bahu refers to Abdul Qadir Jilani as his spiritual master, even though Jilani died long before the birth of Sultan Bahu. However, most Sufis maintain that Abdul Qadir Jilani plays a special role in the mystic world and that all orders and saints are forever indebted to him in some way either directly or indirectly. While acknowledging that he is a follower of Jilani's Qadiriyya tradition, Sultan Bahu initiated an offshoot of his own which he named Sarwari Qadiri. The Awan tribe of Pakistan claim he belonged to the Alvi Awan tribe.Encyclopaedia of Untouchables Ancient, Medieval and Modern - Raj Kumar - Google BooksUrs of Sultan Bahu begins The News International (newspaper), Published 2 September 2019, Retrieved 18 May 2020 Bahu's Sarwari Qadiri tradition (or Sufi order) is similar in its overall philosophy to the Qadiri order. Unlike many other Sufi orders, the Sarwari Qadiri tradition does not prescribe a specific dress code, ascetic practices, breathing exercises, etc. Instead, it focuses on practicing mental exercises, an important one, being the visualisation of the word ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá (Allah, God) as written on one's own heart. According to tradition, the lineage reaches Sultan Bahu as follows: # Muhammad # Ali ibn Abi Talib # Hasan al Basri # Habib al Ajami # Dawud Tai # Maruf Karkhi # Sirri Saqti # Junaid Baghdadi # Abu Bakr Shibli # Abdul Aziz bin Hars bin Asad Yemeni Tamimi # Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi # Mohammad Yousaf Abu al-Farah Tartusi # Abu-al-Hassan Ali Bin Mohammad Qureshi Hankari # Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi # Abdul Qadir Jilani # Abdul Razzaq Jilani # Abdul Jabbar Jilani # Syed Mohammad Sadiq Yahya # Najm-ud-Din Burhan Puri # Abdul Fattah # Abdul Sattar # Abdul Baqqa # Abdul Jaleel #Syed Abdul Rehman Jilani Dehlvi # Sultan Bahu The Sultan Bahu tradition is still practiced to this day by Sultan Bahu's successors. ==Shrine== Shrine of Sultan Bahu near Jhang, Pakistan The shrine of Sultan Bahu is located in Garh Maharaja, Punjab. It was originally built on Bahu's gravesite until the Chenab River changed its course causing the need to relocate twice and as witnessed by those present at the time of relocation, claimed that his body was, in fact, still intact at the time. It is a popular Sufi shrine, and the annual Urs festival commemorating his death is celebrated there with great fervor on the first Thursday of Jumada al-Thani month. People come from far-off places to join the celebrations.Book Name: Tareekh-e-Jhang, Author: Iqbal Zuberi, Publisher: Jhang Adibi Academy, Jhang Sadar, Pakistan, First Edition, Date: 2002 Sultan Bahu also used to hold an annual Urs to commemorate the martyrs of Karbala from the 1st to the 10th day of the month of Muharram. This tradition continues to this day and every year, thousands of pilgrims visit the shrine during the first 10 days of Muharram. ==See also== *List of famous Sufis *Sufism in Pakistan ==References== Category:Indian Sufi saints Category:Sufi poets Category:1630 births Category:1691 deaths Category:Persian-language poets Category:Punjabi-language poets Category:Punjabi Sufi saints Category:17th-century Indian poets Category:17th-century Islamic religious leaders Category:17th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Sufi shrines in Pakistan Category:Mystic poets ","title":"Sultan Bahu"},{"id":"1444395","text":"Johannes Bureus on a painting from 1627, signed \\"J.

Langiewicz was educated at Posen, Breslau and Prague, and was compelled to earn his daily bread by giving lectures. He subsequently entered the Prussian Landwehr and served for a year in the royal guard. In 1860 he migrated to Paris and was for a time professor in the high school founded there by Ludwik Adam Mieroslawski. The same year he took part in Giuseppe Garibaldi's Neapolitan campaign, and was then a professor in the military school at Cuneo till the establishment was closed. In 1862 he entered into communication with the central Polish committee at Warsaw, and on the outbreak of the insurrection, 22 January 1863, he took the command of the armed bands. He defeated the Russians at WƒÖchock and S≈Çupia (February), capturing 1000 muskets and 8 cannon. This victory drew hundreds of young recruits to his standard, till at last he had 12,000 men at his disposal. On 23 February he again defeated the Russians, at Ma≈Çogoszcz, and captured 500 muskets and 2 cannons. On 10 March he proclaimed himself Dictator and attempted to form a regular government; but either he had insufficient organizing talent, or had not time enough to carry out his plans, and after a fresh series of engagements at the battle of Chrobrze on 17 March and battle of Grochowiska on 18 March he took refuge in Austrian territory and was interned at Tarn√≥w. He was subsequently transferred to the fortress of Josephstadt, from which he was released in 1865. He then lived at Solothurn as a citizen of the Swiss Republic, and subsequently entered the Turkish service as Langie Bey. He died in Istanbul on 10 May 1887 and is buried at the Haidar Pasha Cemetery with his English wife Suzanne (2 February 1837 - 24 November 1906). ==Sources and references== * * See Boleslaw Limanowski, The National Insurrection of 1863-64 (Pol.)

His personal name was Zifu (Â≠êËå≤Áî´) and he took his throne in 650 BC. After the death of the Hegemon of China, Duke Huan of Qi, in 643 BC, Duke Xiang intervened in the War of Qi's succession on the behalf of his ally Prince Zhao. Forming an alliance with Cao, Wey, and Zou, Duke Xiang and his troops invaded Qi and eventually defeated Prince Zhao's rival brothers, crowning him as \\"Duke Xiao of Qi\\". With his influence on the rise, Duke Xiang saw a chance to become the next hegemon of China and made war with Chu. In 638 BC he attacked the state of Zheng and met the troops from Chu, who were running to save Zheng. Instead of giving the enemy a surprise attack, he waited for the enemy to go across the river in order to display his benevolence or Ren (‰ªÅ) as a Junzi.

July 11, 1941 - d. November 18, 2019), nicknamed \\"Giant Gene\\" by his fans at record hops and dances, was a radio and television personality from Philadelphia. == Early career == Arnold began his musical career in the 1950s, appearing on American Bandstand as a singing teenager in 1956, where Dick Clark gave him the stage name 'Rick Roman' when he was asked for a suggestion. As Rick Roman, he recorded, wrote songs, and performed in rock n roll shows. He also wrote or contributed lyric lines or ideas to many of the top hits of the 60's and early 70's. He later wrote many jingles for top companies, and while doing one for Listening Booth stores at Tanner Studios in Memphis Tennessee, got the chance to meet Elvis, (who used the companies roof- top running track). His Doctor Nick invited him for barbecue and a tour. As the world turns, a song was written in Philly that became a big hit for Elvis.. Arnold married Terry Hunter, herself a singer and entertainer, on June 24, 1962. They were part of \\"The Sounds Of Philly\\" scene for years. Arnold wrote and produced records under the Rick Roman name.. ( The Tridels, The Good Guys, The Stylettes, on SanDee and Worldwide Limited Records, and is an ASCAP Composer.) In 1966, Arnold began his radio career on WEEZ AM and then WIFI-FM with Ron Josephs. Josephs and Arnold played \\"oldies\\" and had record hops and dances as well. One evening, Gene did not bring his record case and found a group of albums on the station floor. He had to play something on the air, so he discovered sounds he had never heard before. The audience loved them and the phones rang off their hooks. His love for progressive rock began at that moment, causing a rift between Josephs and Arnold about that \\"awful\\" music by groups like The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, and 13th Floor Conspiracy. Arnold has been written about in many books, including a new one from T. Morgan, longtime Philadelphia Album Rock DJ, who credits Arnold with the beginning of the album rock format in the book. Arnold later continued at WCAM with his very popular \\"AM Underground\\" and \\"heavy 13\\" format. Philadelphia Disc Jockey Jerry Blavat included a story of his dislike for Arnold's music in his new book, and went onto detail at a recent meeting of the Philadelphia Broadcast Pioneers, (of which both are members), He then was hired to bring a youthful format tolongtime CBS giant WCAU (with his \\"Gene Arnold's American Scene\\" talk show), and at WIBG (with \\"Giant Gene's Electric Scene\\"). He was also a regular on many TV shows and hosted the Jerry Lewis telethon (among others) in Philadelphia for several years in the 1970s. Arnold was also in the movie Fighting Back, which was filmed in Philadelphia, and recently appeared in a Tim and Eric episode, in the film \\"The Nail\\", and in episodes of \\"Law and Order\\", \\"Mercy\\", and \\"Lights Out\\".He is now featured in an award-winning film, \\"Wages Of Spin 2\\", which is now in the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame archives. == Associations with Philadelphia progressive-rock groups == Arnold and his wife Terry helped pioneer many of the early Philadelphia progressive-rock groups such as The Nazz, American Dream, Stone Dawn, Woody's Truck Stop, Mandrake Memorial, Elizabeth, and The Legions, Stone Dawn, Almond Joy, The Driftwoods, by hosting the first \\"Be-IN\\" at Belmont Plateau in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. He was involved heavily in promoting and serving as master of ceremonies (MC) for the first Earth Day concert, to which he drove his propane-powered car. He also acted as Master of Ceremonies for many of the top concerts at the Electric Factory and The Spectrum, including concerts by Jimi Hendrix and The Doors, as well as Steppenwolf, Chicago, Janis Joplin and The Who. Arnold was also a favorite MC of The Allman Brothers. He also introduced acts at the famed Main Point in Bryn Mawr PA, including Cat Stevens and Stevie Wonder. == Advertising business == After working in radio and TV for years, he formed American Agency with his cousin, and later Arnold started his own business, Gene Arnold & Company, to produce advertising and marketing for new and popular companies like Merry Go Round, Deb Shops, Barbara Moss, and Jean Nicole. Arnold, also was chosen to appear in thousands of radio and TV spots and infomercials as \\"himself\\" acting as the spokesman or voice. Included are well-remembered spots for Philadelphia's famed Melrose Diner, for LifeCall (famous for the line, \\"I've fallen and I can't get up!\\"), for Beta Vision Productions, Craftmatic adjustable beds, and Brazil Contempo Leather, featuring Terry Arnold wearing black gloves and sensuously stroking leather furniture. Arnold also rode elephants on TV spots for Allstate Transmissions (\\"No Matter What You Drive\\", and climbed to the top of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge to direct and appear in a commercial bringing the new Buicks to South Jersey. A real flying hawk led the way, flying through the bridge cables. The hawk was Buick's symbol for years. He was also a \\"tired mummer\\" in an ad for Lazy Boy Chairs, and built his agency into a nationwide Teen Fashion marketing giant. == 1988 to present == Arnold was injured in a car accident in 1988, and was forced to retire from his ad agency creative work. In 2001, after encouragement from his son Jody, and with the assistance of Rich Levin and Bob Davis of Soul-Patrol.net and web hosts Netcetra.com, much of his original broadcasts have been updated and made publicly available. In an interview, Arnold said of this re-release: :\\"It's great therapy to hear from listeners and viewers you pleased a long time ago who've now found you on the web...I can't do \\"live\\" radio now due to an accident that took my spontaneous creative thinking process, but still enjoy communicating with the help of editing, re- takes, and of course, my wife, who keeps it all together for us. That way, nobody hears the mistakes or mispronounced words that occasionally pop out, but he states it's still lots of fun to do the updates for our original broadcasts.\\" On August 24, 2004, Gene MC'ed at the Brotherly Love All-Star Tour, which included performances by his long-time friendsCharlie Gracie, The Soul Survivors, Essra Mohawk, Stewkey's NAZZ, American Dream, and The Orlons, who were all friends with Arnold during their careers. On July 23, 2011, Arnold was presented the \\"Lifetime Achievement Award In Soul Music\\" and \\"Black Legends Of Music\\" award, has been entered into the \\"Disco DJ Hall Of Fame\\" (now part of The Library Of Congress), and the \\"Philly TV and Radio Hall Of Fame.\\" He was also recently voted 25th on DJ's Portal's \\"All Time Top Disco DJ\\" list compiled by Europe's popular DJ Yahu, He is also a member of The Broadcast Pioneers. Arnold's latest projects include narrating for the documentary films \\"Dummy Hoy, A Deaf Baseball Hero\\", and \\"Survivors Stories, WW2.\\" Terry Arnold, under the stage name 'Terryl', recently appeared in films \\"eBay Disco Ball\\" and a spoof on \\"The Price Is Right\\" as \\"Goldie Goforit\\" an enthusiastic contestant. New movie star Brooklyn Decker played the model, with long-time Hollywood actor Jack English as Bob Barker. Both Terry and Gene are featured in a television documentary on Jimi Hendrix. Recently, an ASCAP composition co-written by Terry with Russ Edwards, a long-time Philly folk- rock-country personality, \\"I Won't Quit Now\\"..was released on his CD \\"They Call Them Cowboys.\\" Both Arnold and Edwards have suffered long-term cognitive damage from auto accidents, and the song is an encouragement to \\"never quit\\"..even if you don't make sense to your own self sometimes. Terry Arnold has a new CD called \\"Here With You\\", a love song benefiting the USO and Wounded Warriors, and is available on cdbaby.com, iTunes.com, and amazon.com. ==Death== Gene Arnold died on November 18, 2019, after a long battle with cancer. ==References== ==External links== * Giant Gene's website, featuring \\"The History Of The Sounds Of Philly\\" * Soul-Patrol.net * Terryl's website * http://phillymemories.tripod.com/id18.htm Category:Radio personalities from Philadelphia Category:1941 births Category:2019 deaths ","title":"Gene Arnold"},{"id":"1444440","text":"Thiviers () is a commune in the Dordogne department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France. ==Population== ==Personalities== It is notable as being the town in which Jean-Paul Sartre lived as a child.

Cossa is best known for his frescoes. One of the first records we have of him is in 1456 when he was an assistant to his father, Cristofano del Cossa, at that time employed in painting the carvings and statues on the high altar in the chapel of the bishop's palace at Ferrara. One of his followers was Leonardo Scaletti of Faenza.Collection of Mediaeval and Renaissance Paintings, Volume 1, by Fogg Art Museum, page 193. ==Allegorical frescoes in the Palazzo Schifanoia== In conjunction with Cosimo Tura, Cossa is now known for fresco decoration of the summer pleasure villa/palazzo known as the Palazzo Schifanoia, located just outside the city gates. Together, they painted a series of the elaborate allegories around the themes of zodiacal signs and months of the year. These were only partially restored in the 20th century, and there are three that are reasonably assigned to Cossa. Of these, one of the most remarkable images is the horde of naked toddlers in the Allegory of May ‚Äì Triumph of Apollo. Apparently a sign of springtime's prolific blossoming, the crowded rows of babies mass like a phalanx of infantile Rockettes. The Allegory of April has a depiction of the trio of Graces, one of the earliest Post-classical representations of the naked intertwined dancers in painting.Artecultura.fe.it Sandro Botticelli's version in Primavera dates from 1482. See the 1501 version of the Three Graces (now at Chantilly). Assuming the date of death of Cossa is correct, this one must have been completed prior to the others. ==Cossa in Bologna== Saint Lucy Unhappy that he had been paid by the square foot for his work for Duke Borso and complaining he was being paid the same as the \\"worst dauber in Ferrara\\", Cossa left Ferrara for Bologna in 1470. Saint Florian In Bologna he obtained many commissions under the patronage of the Bentivoglio family. Here he painted his two masterpieces: the Virgin and Child with two saints and a portrait of Alberto de' Catanei (1474) and fresco of the Madonna del Baracano, representing the Virgin and Child with portraits of Giovanni Bentivoglio and Maria Vinziguerra (1472). He executed stained glass windows in Bologna, the best of which is a circular window, in the church of San Giovanni in Monte, representing St. John in Patmos. This bears his signature. In the National Gallery of London there is a picture by him representing St. Vincent Ferrer. There is a fine profile portrait at Locko Park near Derby, said to represent Duke Ercole I of Ferrara. In the Dresden collection there is also an Annunciation. Del Cossa features as one of the two protagonists in Ali Smith's novel How to Be Both, short-listed for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.Ali Smith 2014, How to be both. . ==Anthology of works== *Annunciation and Nativity (1470‚Äì1472 Dresden Gem√§ldegallerie alte Meister) *:St Claire (1470-1472, Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, on deposit at the Museo Nacional de Arte de Catalu√±a) *:St Catherine (1470-1472, Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, on deposit at the Museo Nacional de Arte de Catalu√±a) *Griffoni Polyptych *:St Vincent Ferrer (1473, National Gallery, London) *:St Peter (1473, Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan) *:St John the Baptist (1473, Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan) *:St Florian 1473,National Gallery of Art, Washington) *:St Lucy (1473, National Gallery of Art, Washington) *:The Crucifixion (1473, National Gallery of Art, Washington) *:St Petronius (1473, Palazzo dei Diamanti, Ferrara) *:11 other small pictures from altarpiece (1473, ?, ?) *Madonna with the Child and Saints (1474, Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna) *Virgin and Child with an Angel (1460, Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona) *Frescoes for Hall of Months, Palazzo Schifanoia, Ferrara (before 1470?) *:Allegory of April: Triumph of VenusEuroweb.hu Artecultura.fe.it *:Allegory of May: Triumph of ApolloEuroweb.hu *:Allegory of March: Triumph of Minervawga.hu *Polyhymnia, the Muse of Many Songs *Portrait of a Man with a ring (1472-1477, Thyssen- Bornemisza Museum, Madrid) ==In contemporary culture== The stained glass window was revealed to be the final answer of the Great Google Earth Treasure Hunt.

At the University of Kiel he repudiated the prevailing rationalism and under the influence of Schleiermacher became a fervent Evangelical preacher, first at Lunden (1806), and then at Kiel (1816). Harms's trenchant style made him very popular, and he did great service for his cause especially in 1817, when, on the 300th anniversary of the Reformation, he published side by side with Luther's theses, ninety-five of his own, attacking reason as \\"the pope of our time\\" who \\"dismisses Christ from the altar and throws God's word from the pulpit.\\" As a musician, Harms sought to restore Lutheran hymns back to their original state. To this end, he researched the original texts from people such as Luther, Gerhardt, and others, hoping to find the original texts for the hymns his people were singing. In this he was mostly successful - the textual reforms he made still remain in hymnals today. He was unsuccessful, though, in restoring the tunes to their original states. The Renaissance-style tunes employed by the early Reformers had largely been smoothed out, such that the lively syncopations common to music of that era had been replaced by simple, plodding meters. His attempts met with early resistance, and he abandoned the project. Besides volumes of sermons Harms published a good book on Pastoraltheologie (1830). He resigned his pastorate on account of blindness in 1849, and died on 1 February 1855. ==Quotations== ==References== ;Attribution ; Endnotes: *See Autobiography (2nd ed., Kiel, 1852) *Michael Baumgarten, Ein Denkmal f√ºr C.

It is especially known for using traditional rhythms employed by the Ursari section of the Roma minority with contemporary electronic sampling. They generally mix various sounds produced by tapping spoons or other domestic objects with those produced on analog synthesizers. The concept that led to the success of the group belongs to Paul »öanicui, Romanian film director who discovered the ursari musicians Tamango, Napoleon and Classic that he would later name ‚ÄúShukar‚Äù. Short time after, Romanian musicians Dj Vasile, Dan Handrabur (aka Dreamdoktor), Cristi Stanciu (aka Matze) and Vlaicu Golcea came with the compositions of the first Shukar Collective album, \\"Taves Bahtalo!\\"/ \\"Urban Gypsy\\". Recently, they have been collaborating with Romanian multimedia artist Mircea Florian. In 2010, the group was the subject of an HBO documentary.

Members of this gens first appear in history at the time of the Second Punic War, but the first of the Scribonii to obtain the consulship was Gaius Scribonius Curio in 76 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 758 (\\"Scribonia Gens\\"). ==Origin== The nomen Scribonius belongs to a large class of gentilicia derived from cognomina ending in -o, most of which were of plebeian origin. The root of the name is scribo, a writer.Chase, p. 119. ==Praenomina== The only praenomina known to have been used by the main families of the Scribonii are Lucius, used by the Scribonii Libones, and Gaius, used by the Curiones. Other praenomina are practically non-existent among the Scribonii appearing in history; the only exception is Marcus, found among one or two of the later Libones, who seem to have adopted it from the Livii. ==Branches and cognomina== The two main families of the Scribonii under the Republic bore the cognomina Libo and Curio. Other surnames are found under the Empire. Libo, the only surname of the Scribonii to occur on coins, is apparently derived from libere, to sprinkle or pour, and was probably given to an ancestor of the family who poured libations.Chase, p. 111. The Scribonii Libones were long associated with a sacred structure in the forum known as the Pueal Scribonianum or Puteal Libonis, frequently depicted on their coins. So called because it resembled a puteal, or wellhead, the structure enclosed a \\"bidental\\", a place that had been struck by lightning, or in one tradition the spot where the whetstone of the augur Attius Navius had stood, in the time of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. The Puteal Scribonianum was dedicated by one of the Scribonii Libones, probably either the praetor of 204 BC, or the tribune of the plebs in 149. It was renovated by Lucius Scribonius Libo, either the praetor of 80 BC, or his son, the consul of 34.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 779, 780 (\\"Scribonius Libo\\", No. 4). Curio became hereditary in one branch of the Scribonii after the first of the family was chosen Curio Maximus in 174 BC.Livy, xli. 26.Broughton, vol.

They have, along the midrib, a narrow zone containing chlorophyll. The silky-hairy, fusiform achenes form a crown with a double pappus in two series, the inner one with long, barbellate bristles, the outer one with short bristles or minute scales. The small flower heads grow solitary or sometimes in a cluster at the end of the stems. The 10-24 fertile ray florets are nearly white, blue to pink, lavender, purple or blue violet.

This Heat were active in the ascendancy of British punk rock and post-punk, but stood apart from those scenes due to an experimental, confrontational, and politically charged approach. This Heat's commercial success was limited, and their discography consisted of only two albums and an EP, but in later years the band have been widely considered a link between early 1970s music styles such as krautrock and later experimental genres such as industrial music and post-rock. Williams died of cancer in 2001. From 2016 until 2019, Bullen and Hayward reunited, playing under the name This Is Not This Heat. ==History== This Heat first came together in 1976 by Charles Hayward and Charles Bullen. Hayward was a member of the progressive rock band Quiet Sun, fronted by guitarist Phil Manzanera of Roxy Music. In 1975, Quiet Sun had signed a deal with Island Records to record an album entitled Mainstream. Whilst touring to support the record, Manzanera stepped down as his commitments with Roxy Music were taking up his time, so Bullen stepped in as a replacement. Quiet Sun dissolved shortly afterwards, but Bullen and Hayward, who had bonded over their similar tastes in music, decided to continue working together. After toying with the names Dolphin Logic and Friendly Rifles, they were joined by visual artist Gareth Williams, brought on due to his lack of musical training, and the trio settled upon This Heat in reference to the 1976 British Isles heat wave, regarded at the time as the hottest summer on record. This Heat's first radio airplay came in early 1977 from legendary DJ John Peel, to whom they sent a demo tape recorded in the top room at Hayward's parents' house in Camberwell, prior to moving into their 'Cold Storage' studio ‚Äî a disused cold storage room converted into a studio, which was part of an \\"Acme Studios\\" artists studios complex in Brixton. During this time, they also recorded a session with Ghanaian percussionist Mario Boyer Diekuuroh, parts of which later appeared on a 1982 split cassette with Albert Marcoeur, released by the French experimental rock magazine Tago Mago. Their self-titled debut album was recorded between February 1976 and September 1978 in various studios and venues, and was released in August 1979. It was characterised by heavy use of tape manipulation and looping (especially on the track \\"24 Track Loop\\" which was a loop actually on the 2\\" master tape), combined with more traditional performance (including quite a lot of live stereo microphone in the room recordings) to create dense, eerie, electronic soundscapes. Shortly thereafter, This Heat released the Health and Efficiency EP, which foreshadowed the more rock-oriented sound of their subsequent album. This Heat then signed a record deal with Rough Trade Records, who released Deceit, the band's second and final album, in 1981. Whilst maintaining their experimental approach, Deceit found the band incorporating more coherent song structures, and consolidating the dub and world music influences in their work. The album was produced with help from noted reggae mixer Martin Frederick. Although at the time, like all of This Heat's releases, it sold poorly, Deceit is now seen as a classic of the post-punk era. By that time Deceit was released, Williams had since exited from the band. This Heat split up in 1982 after completing their final European tour with bassist-vocalist Trefor Goronwy and keyboardist Ian Hill joining Bullen and Hayward, as Williams had departed for India. Hayward went on to form Camberwell Now with Goronwy and Stephen Rickard, and remains musically active. Bullen had a solo venture called Lifetones, and released one record, For a Reason, in 1983 on his Tone of Life imprint and in 1998 released the album Internal Clock under the name Circadian Rhythms. Williams later formed Flaming Tunes with Mary Currie and released a cassette of material, which was later released on CD. In 1993 a new album of previously unreleased This Heat recordings was unearthed. Repeat featured three long tracks, including the title track, a 20-minute remix of \\"24 Track Loop\\". Out of Cold Storage, a box set of all the band's official recordings, was released in June 2006 on This is!, a new Recommended Records sub-label set up by Hayward and Bullen to re-release This Heat's back catalogue. The set comprises This Heat, Deceit, Health and Efficiency, Made Available and Repeat, plus Live 80/81, a CD of concert recordings. In December 2001 This Heat tentatively rehearsed (with Williams); however, nothing came to fruition as Williams died later that month of cancer. In 2016, Bullen and Hayward reunited under the name This Is Not This Heat to perform a number of critically acclaimed gigs in London. The concerts featured several guests such as Thurston Moore, Alexis Taylor and Daniel O'Sullivan. The reunion continued across the following three years, concluding with a small series of shows in London, New York, and Los Angeles in 2019. In August 2020, This Heat released part of its catalogue digitally on streaming services, including Bandcamp. ==Legacy== ===Influence=== Bands and artists that have called This Heat either an influence or a favourite include David Bowie, Alexis Taylor, Dan Snaith, Avey Tare, Amen Dunes, Women, Preoccupations, Nurse With Wound, Palm, Squid, Mark Stewart, The Dead C, Daniel O'Sullivan, Disco Inferno, Elias R√∏nnenfelt, Marc Hollander, Family Fodder, Matt Johnson, 23 Skidoo, David Grubbs, Volcano the Bear, Dazzling Killmen, Nisennenmondai, Korekyojinn, Steven Wilson, The Sound of Animals Fighting, Yoshida Tatsuya, 75 Dollar Bill, Horse Lords, Mika Taanila, FRIGS, Warm Ghost, Justin Pearson, Bo Ningen, Pinkish Black, Young Knives, AIDS Wolf, Controlled Bleeding, These New Puritans, Eyeless in Gaza, Six Finger Satellite, Trans Am, Dave Kerman, Guapo, Chrome Hoof, Ut, Heiner Goebbels, and many others.

Prolific in the media and continually in the \\"public eye\\", in the 1937 The Mysterious Pilot movie serial, Hawks was billed as the \\"fastest airman in the world.\\"Harmon and Glut 1973, p. 109. A popular saying from the time was, \\"Don't send it by mail ... send it by Hawks.\\" Phillips 1994, p. 73. After retiring from a career as an air racer, he died in 1938, flying an experimental aircraft. ==Early years== Born in Marshalltown, Iowa on March 28, 1897, Hawks attended grammar school before his parents who were actors, joined a stock company and toured Minnesota. Hawks took on juvenile parts during his parent's engagements but when the family settled in California, Hawks resumed his formal schooling and graduated in 1916 from a high school in Long Beach. An early exposure to the thrill of flying came when Hawks convinced local Long Beach air field owners, the Christofferson brothers, to give him a free flight in exchange for a newspaper article. He had convinced the owners that a high school student's impressions would result in increased interest in flying and more business for the air field. It worked and Hawks was able to parlay a series of pleasure flights. After enrolling at the University of California where he played halfback on the freshman football team, Hawks enlisted in 1917 when war was declared.Fraser 1979, p. 208. ==World War I== Hawks joined the U.S. Army with the aspiration to become a pilot in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps. After he received his Junior Military Aviator rating and a second lieutenant's commission in the Signal Officer's Reserve Corps, Hawks became a flying instructor at Dallas Love Field, Texas, receiving a promotion to first lieutenant and a short time later was made the assistant officer in charge of flying at U.S. Army Air Service's Brooks Field at San Antonio, Texas.Daniels 1969, p. 44. One incident that nearly proved fatal occurred when Hawks and Lieutenant Wendell Brookley collided in midair over the San Antonio football stadium. Both pilots were carrying out an exuberant aerial exhibition to support the United War Work campaign when the aircraft tangled but they managed to land their damaged aircraft, only to receive a reprimand for dangerous flying. Both flyers served a week in confinement.Fraser 1979, pp. 210‚Äì211. Leaving active duty in 1919, Hawks was promoted to a captain in the United States Army Air Service Reserve. During the immediate postwar years, he did a stint of aerial barnstorming in the United States and Mexico. Besides his barnstorming feats, Hawks became known for his appearances at aerial exhibitions and on December 28, 1920 he took a 23-year-old Amelia Earhart on her first flight at a state fair in Los Angeles, California. Earhart's father arranged for the flight and paid the fee of $10 for a 10-minute \\"hop\\". ==Achieving fame as a pilot== Hawks began to be in public eye when he joined the Gates Flying Circus and was involved in a demonstration of the first in- flight refueling in 1921.Dwiggins 1966, p. 116. Earl Daugherty in his JN4D Jenny had been touted as being able to stay in the air for 24 hours. Hawks flew his Standard J-1 World War I trainer carrying wing-walker Wesley May aloft to join up with Daugherty, circling over Long Beach, California. May, carrying a five-gallon can of gasoline, stepped over to Earl's ship and poured the gas in the Jenny's tank.Forden 1973, p. 175. On May 7, 1922, Hawks landed his small Standard biplane within the grounds at the Stadium Jalape√±o at Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico, as part of the inaugural ceremonies. In 1924 Hawks was hired by Compa√±√≠a Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n as a pilot flying special charter service routes, piloting his Standard J-1 two-place modified for five-place passenger service. While in Mexico, Hawks managed a large ranch and estate near Tampico, using his aircraft to fly to Mexico City and back, to run errands such as carrying payrolls to the oil field companies operating around Tampico.Fraser 1979, p. 212. By 1927, Hawks continued to eke out a living as a pilot but with money from his wife, Hawks purchased a Mahoney Ryan B-1 Brougham (NC3009) he named the \\"Spirit of San Diego.\\" In the aftermath of Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight, he flew to Washington with his wife on board, to greet the triumphant Lindbergh, and in the ensuing glare of publicity, Hawks was hired by the Ryan Aircraft company to be its official representative. In the Ford National Reliability Air Tour, Hawks placed sixth and earned $1,000.00 in prize money. With the public idolizing Lindbergh, Hawks toured the country, selling rides in the aircraft \\"like Lindy flew.\\"Daniels 1969, p. 45. ===Record breaking flights=== The notoriety that Hawks gained by his self-promotion led to a contract with Maxwell House Coffee and with their sponsorship, he entered the 1927 National Air Races in Spokane, Washington where the now renamed \\"Miss Maxwell House\\" came in first for speed in the Detroit news Air Transport Speed and Efficiency Trophy Race. Also on December 5, 1927, the Texas Company (Texaco) hired Hawks to head up its own Aviation Division as a Superintendent to market aviation products. The \\"Texaco One\\", a custom-built Ford Trimotor (NC3443) was delivered in January 1928 and Hawks was dispatched to advertise the company across the United States and abroad beginning with flying a Texas delegation from Houston to Mexico City and back. It was the first goodwill trade extension air tour from the U.S. to Mexico and received wide coverage in American and Mexican newspapers.Musciano, Walter A. \\"The story of the legendary speed flying king.\\" historynet.com., November 2005. Retrieved: September 26, 2010. Later in the same year, Hawks embarked on a nationwide goodwill tour, visiting more than 150 cities and covering approximately . It was estimated that 500,000 people saw the \\"Texaco One\\". He described the tour in his autobiography Speed: \\"In the course [of the tour]. I visited 175 cities, carried 7,200 passengers, and did 56,000 miles of cross-country flying. All of this without a mishap to plane and passengers.\\" \\"Texaco Five\\" In December 1928, the Trimotor was destroyed in a crash at Floresville, Florida. In early 1929, Hawks was approached by Lockheed to ferry their new Air Express (NR7955) to New York in time for an air show. On February 4, 1929, flying with Oscar Grubb, superintendent of final assembly at the Lockheed factory, who had volunteered to serve as flight engineer to pump fuel from auxiliary fuselage tanks, Hawks set a transcontinental speed record.Allen 1964, p. 53. He flew from the Lockheed factory in Burbank, California to New York in 18 hours and 21 minutes. Hawks shortly after convinced Texaco to purchase the record-breaking Lockheed Air Express, named \\"Texaco Five\\" as a replacement for \\"Texaco One\\". Four months later, Hawks shattered the record again by 43 minutes in \\"Texaco Five\\".Daniels 1969, p. 47. The aircraft accumulated some before being lost in a January 1930 accident when Hawks attempted a takeoff from a soggy field in West Palm Beach, Florida, destroying the \\"Texaco Five\\" in a spectacular crash that catapulted it into a row of three parked aircraft. Hawks walked away from the carnage with no injuries.Allen 1964, p. 36. Frank Hawks in the Texaco Eaglet, postcard, c. 1930 ===Gliding=== In 1930, Hawks convinced Texaco to back a proving flight that would demonstrate the effectiveness of gliders. As a reserve officer in what was by then known as the United States Army Air Corps, Hawks foresaw the military usefulness of gliders, and despite a lack of government support and critical reaction from seasoned glider pilots, Hawks mapped out a transcontinental flight. The appropriately named Texaco Eaglet was a custom- made wingspan glider built by R.E. and Wallace Franklin. Designed to achieve a maximum speed of 125 miles per hour, it was fitted with a two-way radio and telephone connection with the tow plane, the \\"Texaco 7\\", a Waco ASO biplane, flown by J. D. \\"Duke\\" Jernigan, Jr., a member of Texaco's domestic sales division. The flight left San Diego on March 30, 1930, with Hawks being attached by a towline, taking eight days elapsed time and 44 hours, 10 minutes of actual flying time. Hawks also spent 10 hours in soaring exhibitions at scores of towns and cities along the route. Surmounting all the predicted obstacles, even the Rocky Mountains which German glider pilots had feared would jeopardize the flight, only occasional turbulence was encountered. Hawks arrived in New York on April 6, 1930, effectively proving the feasibility of long-distance glider-towing.\\"Glider is towed by plane across the nation.\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1930. Frank Hawks in the Texaco Eaglet c. 1930 ===Texaco 13=== \\"Texaco 13\\" at the Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago), c. 2007 is a testament to the 1930s \\"Golden era\\" of air racing and Frank Hawks. In 1930, Hawks proposed that Texaco replace the lost \\"Texaco Five\\" with a revolutionary new racing aircraft, the Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship that had been debuted at the 1929 National Air Races where its turn-of-speed saw it best the latest U.S. Army and U.S. Navy fighters.Hull 1979, pp. 22‚Äì23. While overseeing the construction of \\"Texaco 13\\" (NR1313), Hawks was involved in an accident on a test flight when the engine failed. Hawks tried to coax \\"Texaco 13\\" back but impacted telephone lines at the edge of the factory field; the aircraft crashed nose-first and flipped onto its back. Repairs were carried out by the summer of 1930, when Hawks embarked on a series of exhibition flights and record-breaking flights across the United States including a new transcontinental west-to-east record on August 13, 1930 of 12 hours, 25 minutes, three seconds, the fastest crossing made up to that time.Pahl 2005, p. 80. Texaco 13 The Travel Air Type R Hawks flew, was the fourth of a series of five racers and was configured for long-distance racing with longer wings and a full set of instrumentation, features that differentiated the aircraft from the rest of the series. Hawks raced \\"Texaco 13\\" as \\"race No. 28\\" in the 1930 Thompson Trophy Race at the National Air Races on September 1, 1930, using a set of \\"racing wings\\", a pair of shorter wingspan wings fitted out at the factory.Kinert 1969, pp. 77‚Äì80. Hawks pulled out of the race on the third lap when the engine began to falter at full throttle. It was revealed later that a piece of masking tape placed over the gas cap (for streamlining) caused a loss of pressure. Hawks used the media attention that was garnered by his record flights to promote aviation, especially demonstrating that fast courier air service was feasible. On October 7, 1930, with the completion of the final World Series game at Philadelphia, Hawks flew to North Beach, Queens, delivering the game photographs exactly 20 minutes later, faster than wire service at the time. Each of his highly publicized flights served to illustrate the speed and safety of modern air travel. His autobiography Speed was also published in 1930 documenting his life and aviation career. The book was well written and became a highly popular title (still sought-after to this day). During his goodwill tour of Europe in 1931, Hawks established 55 intercity records in 12 countries and after returning from Europe in late 1931, continuing to set over 130 U.S. point-to-point records in the \\"Texaco 13\\" until April 16, 1932, when the aircraft was heavily damaged in a crash.Daniels 1969, p. 51. ===Crash=== Time magazine on April 18, 1932 wrote: > Stocky, grinning Capt.

Following its repair, the aircraft was subsequently acquired in 1938 by the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois, where it remains on display. ===More records=== In June 1932, Hawks left the U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve, exchanging his commission for that of a United States Naval Reserve lieutenant commander. Texaco purchased the first Northrop Gamma 2A as the replacement for the \\"Texaco 13\\". The new aircraft was the first of the Gamma series and was specially designed for Hawks, fitted with then-new Sperry automatic pilot. This sleek, all metal high-speed mail and cargo aircraft was powered by a , 14-cylinder Wright Whirlwind twin-row, air-cooled radial engine and was first called \\"Texaco 11\\".\\"Fourteen cylinder motor in Hawk's new plane\\". Popular Science, February 1933, (rare photos). The name was later changed to \\"Sky Chief\\" when Hawks had been honored by the Sioux Indian nation as a chief. \\"Texaco Sky Chief\\" became linked to all Northrop Gammas and was adopted as the name for Texaco's premium gasoline. Hawks continued to set records in his new aircraft, and on June 2, 1933, he set the west-to-east transcontinental airspeed record in \\"Texaco Sky Chief\\", flying from Los Angeles to Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn, New York in 13 hours, 26 minutes, and 15 seconds at an average speed of .O'Hare 1970, p. 24.\\"Robot at Controls on Coast-to-Coast Flight.\\" Popular Mechanics, August 1933. After setting a bevy of new intercity marks, Hawks resigned from Texaco in 1935, but remained active as an aviation consultant and a test and demonstration pilot. Northrop hired him to fly the Gamma 2E attack bomber, a conversion of the original Gamma 2A. He demonstrated the aircraft to the Argentine Navy and effectively demonstrating the long-distance capabilities of the new type by flying from Buenos Aires to Los Angeles in three days. Taking off on May 3, 1935, with Gage H. Irving, Northrop's chief test pilot in the gunner's seat, Hawks broke 10 intercity speed records on the way to Los Angeles, with the resultant publicity ultimately responsible for orders of 51 Gamma 2E attack aircraft. Frank Hawks and \\"Time Flies\\" ===Designing his own aircraft=== In 1936, Hawks approached Howell W. \\"Pete\\" Miller, chief engineer for the Granville Brothers and their famous Gee Bee racers, to create a racing aircraft to his own design. Hawks obtained sponsorship from the Gruen Watch Company and named the aircraft \\"Time Flies\\". The Hawks Miller HM-1 design featured streamlined lines including the unusual feature of \\"burying\\" the cockpit with a curved windshield contoured to fit the fuselage top extended in takeoff and landing but retracted in flight, with the pilot's seat lowered and the windshield flush with the fuselage. After its first flight on October 18, 1936, Hawks flew \\"Time Flies\\" on April 13, 1937, from Hartford, Connecticut to Miami, Florida, 4 hours and 55 minutes later. He then flew to Newark Airport, New Jersey, in 4 hours and 21 minutes but bounced on landing at Newark, and on the third bounce, a wooden spar had broken in the right wing, and others were also damaged.Matthews 2001, p. 98. Short of funds, Hawks decided not to rebuild the aircraft which was sold to Tri-American Aviation where Miller rebuilt the aircraft as a two-seater, renamed the Miller HM-2, then the MAC-1 and Military Aircraft HM-1, to become a fast attack/observation aircraft. The aircraft was not successful in its new configuration, and after the sole example was destroyed in a crash, the project was abandoned.Boyne 1978, pp. 12, 16. ==Popular culture== Throughout his aviation career, Hawks was continually in the news, and was often linked with other famous aviators, including Jimmy Doolittle, Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh and Eddie Rickenbacker, all of whom were personal friends. More than any other contemporary aviation figure, with the possible exception of Alexander P. de Seversky, Hawks exploited his image as an \\"ace\\" pilot with countless promotional ventures. Besides numerous advertisements that spotlighted the Hawks image (commonly billed above the title as \\"Captain Frank Hawks\\" but sometimes oddly called \\"Meteor Man\\"), he was a prominent spokesman for Post Cereals, featured in newspaper comic strips and children's adventure books. Through his \\"Air Hawks\\" and \\"Sky Patrol\\" fan clubs, Hawks was a favorite with young children. Hawks was also active in many causes; he flew noted humorist Will Rogers in a fund-raising campaign for the Red Cross to assist Oklahoma drought victims in 1931.\\"Rogers raises $187,027 for aid.\\" Prescott Evening Courier, February 9, 1931. Retrieved: July 5, 2009. During his odyssey with Rogers, they became friends and when the humorist realized that Hawks had natural acting ability, enlisted the pilot into his folksy act.Fraser 1979, p. 223. Hawks gradually became more active in entertainment ventures with his long-running radio serial (\\"Hawk's Trail\\"), a starring role in Klondike (1932), and becoming the leading actor in a film serial, The Mysterious Pilot (1937). A prolific writer, he wrote a second book, Once to Every Pilot in 1936, along with numerous articles for publication, always promoting aviation. Frank Hawks with Gwinn Aircar ==Death== Hawks announced his retirement from air racing in 1937 and joined the Gwinn Aircar Company, taking on the title of vice president in charge of sales. He toured the United States, giving flying demonstrations in the new \\"safety\\" aircraft, the Gwinn Aircar. By 1938, Hawks was listed as Gwinn Aircar Company Vice-President and Production Manager. Hawks, who told friends years before, \\"I expect to die in an airplane,\\" died in 1938 flying a Gwinn Aircar which crashed in East Aurora, New York.\\"Frank Hawks and the Gwinn Aircar.\\" Check-Six.com. Retrieved: October 3, 2012. Time magazine reported on September 5, 1938: > Last week, Frank Hawks shuttled to East Aurora, N. Y. to show off his > polliwog to a prospect, Sportsman J.

Municipal elections were held in 2005 and were planned for 2009. After two years' delay, they were held in 2011. In September 2011 King Abdullah granted women the right to vote and stand in the 2015 municipal elections. ==History== The first municipal elections in Saudi Arabia took place in the mid-1920s in the Hijaz cities of Mecca, Medina, Jeddah, Yanbu and Taif, as King Abdulaziz ibn Saud established local governments to replace Ottoman and Hashemite rule. Elections for other municipalities were held between 1954 and 1962 during the reign of King Saud, an experiment that ended under the centralization of King Faisal. In 2005, elections for half of the municipal councilors were held, with men voting for male candidates. In February 2009 it was announced that municipal elections scheduled for 2009 would be postponed indefinitely \\"for evaluation\\".Brian Whitaker, The Guardian, 24 February 2009, Hello, democracy ‚Äì and goodbye A government spokesperson said that they were postponed to consider suffrage for women in the next elections. The municipal elections were eventually scheduled for and took place in 2011, but universal suffrage was delayed until the scheduled 2015 vote. Saudi Arabia's Consultative Assembly (Majlis ash-Shura), with 150 appointed members, can propose laws but the proposals do not have the status of primary legislation due to the government's status as an absolute monarchy. No political parties are allowed in Saudi Arabia. ===Women's participation=== When Saudi Arabia held municipal elections in the 50s and 60s, women were not allowed to vote or stand for office. No further elections were held until 2005. Despite some expectation that women would be allowed to participate on that occasion, Saudi officials decided that they would not. It was argued that not enough women would be available to staff female polling stations (gender segregation is normal in the country) and that only a small number of women held ID cards, which would be required in order for them to vote. The same rules applied when elections were held in 2011. In September 2011, King Abdullah announced that women would be granted the right to both vote and stand for election from 2012, meaning that they will be entitled to participate in the scheduled 2015 municipal elections. He also stated that women would become eligible to take part in the unelected shura.Saudi king: Women can vote in local elections Amnesty International described the decision as \\"a welcome, albeit limited, step along the long road towards gender equality in Saudi Arabia, and a testament to the long struggle of women's rights activists there\\". As with many issues related to women's rights, women's suffrage has been a matter of public discussion in Saudi Arabia in recent years, with strongly held views on both sides. It is the last country in the world to retain a gender-specific ban on political suffrage. Women are allowed to hold positions on boards of chambers of commerce. In 2008, two women were elected to the board of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There are no women on the High Court or the Supreme Judicial Council. There is one woman in a cabinet-level position, as deputy minister for women's education. ==See also== *Arab Spring *Electoral calendar *Electoral system ==References== ","title":"Elections in Saudi Arabia"},{"id":"1444554","text":"Senegal elects on national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature.

Jakob Kaiser was born in Hammelburg, Lower Franconia, Kingdom of Bavaria. Following in his father‚Äôs footsteps, Kaiser began a career as a bookbinder. It was during this time that he became politically active as a member of a Catholic trade union, through which he became a leader of the Christian labour movement during the Weimar Republic.Mayer, Tilman (2004). \\"Jakob Kaiser.\\" Christliche Demokraten gegen Hitler: Aus Verfolgung und Widerstand zur Union. Ed. Buchstab, G√ºnter; Kaff, Brigitte; Kleinmann, Hans-Otto. Freiburg, Germany: Herder, 2004. p. 324. Print. Kaiser increased his participation in politics by becoming a member of the Centre Party, where he began serving in the role of representative chairman of Rhineland in 1919. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1933.Mayer, p. 325 == Resistance == After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Hitler abolished all unions, replacing them with the Nazi controlled German Labour Front. Kaiser opposed National Socialism and he joined the resistance in 1934. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1938 under suspicion of treason, but released shortly thereafter.Mayer, p. 326 Through his participation in the Cologne-resistance circle, Kaiser became a close associated of the former Mayor of Leipzig, Carl Goerdeler.Mayer, p. 325 His relationship with Goerdeler allowed him to come into contact with Claus von Stauffenberg. Although he was not directly informed of the 20 July Plot, his knowledge of Stauffenberg‚Äôs intention to assassinate Hitler as well as his close ties to the resistance group forced him to go into hiding for the remainder of World War II.Mayer, p. 326 == Leader of the East German CDU == Kaiser at the East German CDU convention, 1947 After the war, Kaiser returned to politics and worked with Andreas Hermes to found the East Berlin division of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He was elected president of the Berlin CDU (both the Western and Eastern sections of the party). Kaiser belonged to a group within the CDU called the Christian Socialists. They called for the nationalisation of some major industries. In 1946 Kaiser helped found the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB). In the same year he was elected co-chairman of the East German CDU (together with Ernst Lemmer). Although his political views were progressive, he was critical of the Communist Party of Germany and its Soviet- supported leaders. His belief that the German Congress was controlled by the Soviets resulted in his refusal to join. In 1947 during the Ahlen conference ‚Äì a joint conference of West and East German CDU leaders ‚Äì Kaiser's plan of nationalisation of key industries and other moderate leftwing ideas were adopted by the party. In 1947 the Soviets forced him to resign as party chairman. However, he remained a member of the party's Executive Committee. In 1948 Kaiser was forced to leave East Berlin and he went to West Berlin where he joined the West German Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Within the CDU he became a major rival of Konrad Adenauer, the party leader. Kaiser disagreed with Adenauer's social market economy and called for the nationalisation of key industries. Kaiser strongly believed in a neutral, united Germany, and hoped that Germany would be a bridge between the West and the East. In 1950 Kaiser was elected chairman of the West German CDU. From 1949 until 1957 he was Minister of All-German Affairs in Adenauer's cabinet.Mayer, p. 327 Kaiser's grave in the Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf Kaiser died on 7 May 1961 in Berlin.Mayer, p. 328 He is buried in the Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf, in the Steglitz-Zehlendorf borough of Berlin.Wernicke, Ingolf (2010).

Some of the members of both chambers are elected, while the rest are appointed by the King of Eswatini. Election is by secret ballot in a first-past-the-post system of voting. Members of both chambers serve for five-year terms. All candidates run on a non-partisan basis, as political parties are banned. ==Selection process== The Assembly has 66 members, of which 55 are elected from single- member constituencies corresponding to the tinkhundlas (tribal communities). 14 tinkhundlas are located in Hhohho District, 11 in Lubombo District, 16 in Manzini District, and 14 in Shiselweni District. Candidates are first nominated at the tinkhundla level. The top three finishers then proceed to a general election, where the candidate who receives the most votes is elected.

The People's Council (Majlis al-Sha'ab) has 250 members elected for a four-year term in 15 multi-seat constituencies. According to the previous Syrian constitution of 1973, Syria was a form of one-party state in which only one political party, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was legally allowed to hold effective power. Although minor parties were allowed, they were legally required to accept the leadership of the dominant party. The presidential candidate was appointed by the parliament, on suggestion of the Baath Party, and needed to be confirmed for a seven-year term in a national single-candidate referendum. The most recent presidential referendum took place in 2007. The new Syrian constitution of 2012, approved in popular referendum, introduced a multi-party system without guaranteed leadership of any political party. In a new article 88, it introduced presidential elections and limited the term of office for the president to seven years with a maximum of one re-election. During the French Mandate and after the independence, the parliamentary elections in Syria have been held under a system similar to the Lebanese one, with fixed representation for every religious community, including Druzes, Alawis and Christians. In 1949 the system was modified, giving women the right to vote.\\"The Arab-American handbook: a guide to the Arab, Arab-American & Muslim worlds\\", Nawar Shora.

The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic claims the Western Sahara, a territory largely administered by Morocco since Spain abandoned it in 1975. The sovereignty over Western Sahara is unresolved: the territory is contested by Morocco and Polisario Front (Popular Front for the Liberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro), which in February 1976 formally proclaimed a government-in-exile of the SADR. The United Nations, which considers Western Sahara a non-decolonized territory, is attempting to hold a referendum on the issue through the mission Minurso. The UN-administered cease-fire has been in effect since September 1991. The SADR elects a legislature, the Sahrawi National Council (SNC), on a national level. The SNC, which is also referred to as the republic's parliament, has 51 members, elected after the General Popular Congress (GPC) of the Polisario Front. The 2012 election for the Sahrawi National Council took place between 19 February and 21 February 2012, with Khatri Addouh being reelected Speaker of the Council on 28 February. Elections take place within the framework of the Polisario Front, candidates are elected individually and no political parties are allowed. The 13th GPC was held in Tifariti in the so-called Free Zone between 15 December and 22 December 2011. The GPC also elects the National Secretariat, an executive organ of the Polisario, and its Secretary-General, who then becomes President of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Present Secretary-General is Brahim Gali. Local and regional officials, and delegates to the GPC, are elected at biannual Popular Congresses (or Popular Base Congresses) in the refugee camps in Tindouf Province, Algeria. The constitution of the SADR, proclaimed in 1976 and last amended in 1996, stipulates that the above-described system is an emergency mechanism that will be in place only for as long as Western Sahara is non-sovereign. After the creation of an independent Western Saharan state, a transformational period defined in the constitution will begin, ending with the installment of a multi-party system on European lines. The Polisario will then be dissolved or transformed into an ordinary political party. ==See also== *Politics of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ==References== Category:Politics of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ","title":"Elections in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic"},{"id":"1444692","text":"Anna Maria may refer to: ==People== * Anna Maria (given name), including a list of people and characters with the name ==Places== * Anna Maria, Florida * Anna Maria Island, Florida ==Institutions== * Anna Maria College, in Paxton, Massachusetts ==See also== * Annamaria * Anamaria * Maria Anna (disambiguation) ","title":"Anna Maria"},{"id":"1444700","text":"This is a comprehensive list of all the men's doubles finals with the resulting champions for the Australian Open tennis tournament. ==Champions== { class=\\"sortable \\" - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\"  Year  width=200Champions  width=200Runners-up  width=200 class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -  1905  Randolph Lycett Tom Tachell  Edgar T.

Many of the for-profit hospitals are located in Europe and North America, with many of them established particularly in the United States during the late twentieth century. In contrast to the traditional and more common non-profit hospitals, they attempt to garner a profit for their shareholders. The highest charging hospitals in the US are for profit, according to a study published in the journal Health Affairs in 2015.Jenny Gold (June 9, 2015). Highest-Charging U.S. Hospitals Are For-Profit And Concentrated In Florida. NPR. Retrieved June 20, 2015. ==United States== In the United States, the three largest such firms are Hospital Corporation of America, Tenet (formerly NME), and HealthSouth. HealthSouth, as the third-largest U.S. national chain, is also the leading provider of rehabilitation services. For profit Psychiatric Solutions is the largest provider of psychiatric services in the nation. A conceptually related institution is the for-profit HMO, which now comprises the predominant means of delivering medical services in the United States. Advocates of such institutions claim they are able to provide better care at lower cost due to higher efficiency. It is also said that, in the free market, hospitals have an incentive to do better due to competition. Detractors, however, claim that the relative success of for-profit medical providers arises from their positioning themselves in the medical marketplace in such a manner as to offer mainly profitable care services for a largely affluent and insured clientele whilst avoiding unprofitable care areas. Critics thus claim, for example, that for- profit hospitals specialize in such highly lucrative fields as medical rehabilitation, elective/plastic surgery, and cardiology while avoiding provision of loss-making services such as emergency medicine which in turn caters mainly to the indigent. Analogously, critics of for-profit HMOs argue that such firms disproportionately insure healthy people, while simultaneously eschewing chronically ill patients, who must then by default be cared for disproportionately by public insurance schemes and non-profit providers‚Äîthus a so-called \\"dumping\\" of undesirable patients. ==Canada== They have also been criticised by elements of the Canadian medical establishment as providing inferior care at higher cost. See this commentary in the Canadian Medical Association Journal and this editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine. ==India== For-profit hospitals in India have recently come under increasing media scrutiny. In an article by the Huffington Post, they spoke about the problems with \\"corporate hospitals\\" and senior surgeons being told to sell surgeries to their patients even if they weren't needed. In one instance, a doctor was told he would be sacked if he didn't have enough patients to operate on. ==See also== *Non-profit hospital ==References== * Adapted from the Wikinfo article: http://www.internet-encyclopedia.org/wiki.php?title=For- profit_hospital Category:Private hospitals ","title":"For-profit hospital"},{"id":"1444782","text":"Beta phase may refer to: * the second phase in a software release life cycle: see Software release life cycle#Beta * the second phase of pharmacokinetics: see Pharmacokinetics#Stages of Pharmacokinetic Processes ","title":"Beta phase"},{"id":"1444797","text":"First edition title page with hand written dedication from the author Peter Simple is an 1834 novel written by Frederick Marryat about a young British midshipman during the Napoleonic wars. It was originally published in serialized form in 1833. ==Plot summary== The novel describes the naval career of a young gentleman during the period of British Mastery of the seas in the early 19th century. The hero of the title is introduced as 'the fool of the family', son of a parson and heir presumptive to the influential Lord Privilege. This forms a subplot among several others that run alongside the main narrative which mainly concerns the young man's journey from adolescent to adulthood amidst a backdrop of war at sea. One of the key components of the tale is Peter's relationship with the various shipmates he meets, mainly an older officer who takes young Simple under his wing and proves invaluable in his sea education, and also a post captain who suffers from M√ºnchausen syndrome, among others. ==Adaptation== In 1957 it was adapted into a BBC television series The Adventures of Peter Simple starring Timothy Bateson. ==External links== *Project Gutenberg version of the text Category:Novels by Frederick Marryat Category:1834 British novels Category:1830s children's books Category:Novels set during the Napoleonic Wars Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:British children's books Category:British children's novels ","title":"Peter Simple (novel)"},{"id":"1444813","text":"Peter Simple was the third racehorse in history to win the Grand National steeplechase twice, emulating The Duke and Abd-El-Kader.

Both the President and the National Assembly are directly elected by voters. The country is a one party dominant state with the Union for the Republic in power. ==Electoral history== Following World War II, the territory began to elect members to the French National Assembly. The first of these elections took place on 21 October 1945, with French Togoland and neighbouring Dahomey combined into a single constituency. Two MPs were elected using separate electoral colleges for French citizens and Africans. A by-election was held in February 1946 after the MP elected by the First College (French citizens) died in December 1945, with a second full election for the combined constituency held in June 1946. By the November 1946 elections, Togo had become a single- member seat, and Martin Aku of the Committee of Togolese Unity (CUT) was elected. A Representative Council was established in the same period and was first elected in December 1946.D√©mocratie coloniale et mascarades √©lectorales au Togo Centre d'Etude d'Afrique Noire - Institut d‚Äô√©tudes politiques de Bordeaux The CUT emerged as the largest party, winning 14 of the 24 seats in the Second College. French National Assembly elections were held again in 1951, with the result being a reversal of the November 1946 elections, Nicolas Grunitzky of the Togolese Party of Progress (PTP) defeating Aku. Representative Assembly elections were held later in the year and saw the CUT reduced to a single seat, with the Union of Chiefs and Peoples of the North (UPCN) and its sister party the PTP winning 23 of the 24 Seconcd College seats. Due to political restructuring of the territory, a Territorial Assembly was created shortly afterwards and elections held in March 1952; the UPCN won half of the 30 seats, with the CUT‚ÄìJuvento alliance winning nine and the PTP six. In the 1955 elections the UPCN and PTP won 15 of the 30 seats each, with the CUT boycotting the vote.Harris M Lentz (2014) Heads of States and Governments Since 1945, Routledge, p753 The following year Grunitzky ran unopposed for the French National Assembly seat. Parliamentary elections in 1958 led to a victory for the CUT, which won 29 of the 46 seats. General elections were held in 1961, the first time the country's president had been directly elected. Sylvanus Olympio of the Party of Togolese Unity (PUT, the renamed CUT) was the only candidate, whilst the PUT was the only party to put forward candidates in the National Assembly election, winning all 52 seats. Following a coup in 1963 that ousted Olympio, early general elections were held, with Grunitzky as the sole presidential candidate. Four parties (the PUT, Juvento, the Democratic Union of the Togolese People and the Togolese People's Movement) ran unopposed on a combined list for the National Assembly elections, each taking 14 of the 56 seats. Following another coup by Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma in 1967, elections were not held again until 1979 and the country became a one-party state under the Rally of the Togolese People (RPT); General elections that year saw Eyad√©ma re-elected unopposed as President and the RPT win all the National Assembly seats. Parliamentary elections were held under this system in 1985 and 1990, with Eyad√©ma re-elected as President in 1986. Mulit-party democracy was reintroduced in 1992 and presidential elections held in 1993. A boycott by the two main opposition parties saw Eyad√©me re-elected with 96.5% of the vote. Although parliamentary elections the following year saw the RPT defeated by the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR), Eyad√©ma refused to appoint CAR leader Yawovi Agboyibo as Prime Minister, instead giving the post to Edem Kodjo, leader of the CAR's junior ally, the Togolese Union for Democracy; this caused a split in the coalition, and the RPT joined the government in their place. Eyad√©ma was re-elected again in 1998 with 52% of the vote and the RPT won 79 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly in parliamentary elections the following year amidst a boycott by eight opposition parties. The party retained its majority in the 2002 elections, which were boycotted by nine parties, and Eyad√©ma was re- elected for a fifth time in the 2003 presidential elections with 58% of the vote. Following Eyad√©ma's death in 2005, early presidential elections were held in the same year, and were won by his son Faure Gnassingb√©, who received 60% of the vote. The RPT subsequently won 50 of the 81 seats in the 2007 parliamentary elections. Gnassingb√© was re-elected in 2010 with 61% of the vote. In 2012 he dissolved the RPT, replacing it with the Union for the Republic (UNIR). UNIR went on to win 62 of the 91 seats in the 2013 parliamentary elections. Gnassibng√© was re-elected again in 2015 with 59% of the vote. ==Electoral system== ===President=== The President of Togo is elected by plurality voting.Togolese Republic IFES ===National Assembly=== The 91 members of the National Assembly are elected by closed list proportional representation in 30 multi-member constituencies of between two and ten seats; seats are allocated using the highest averages method and there is no electoral threshold.Electoral system IPU Parties must submit lists with double the number of candidates for the number of seats being contested in order to provide replacements. ==Referendums== During the colonial era, voters participated in French constitutional referendums in 1945, May 1946, October 1946 and 1958. Unlike in other French territories, voting in the 1958 referendum was restricted to French citizens only. A referendum on remaining a United Nations Trust Territory or becoming an autonomous region within the French Union was held in 1956 and resulted in a large majority in favour of the French option. However, the results were rejected by the United Nations General Assembly as the referendum had not included the option of independence and opted to continue with the trusteeship. A 1961 referendum approved constitutional amendments allowing for direct elections for the president and the creation of a presidential republic. Further constitutional amendments were approved in a 1963 referendum following the coup. In 1972 a referendum was held on whether 1967 coup leader Eyad√©ma should remain in power, and was approved by 99.9% of voters. Constitutional amendments approved in a 1979 referendum made the country a one-party state. This was reversed by changes approved in a 1992 referendum. ==References== ==External links== *African Elections Database *Adam Carr's Election Archive ","title":"Elections in Togo"},{"id":"1444833","text":"Caravans, a novel by James A.

The game is the sequel to Jak II, and the third game in the series. The game picks up after the events of the previous games and the player takes on the dual role of recurring protagonists Jak and Daxter. It adds new weapons, devices and playable areas. The game was followed by Jak X: Combat Racing. == Gameplay == Gameplay screenshot of Jak 3. The player uses Dark Jak, returning from Jak II, to fight enemies. Like its predecessor, the gameplay of Jak 3 is a blend of platforming, driving, and gun combat. The player is led through the story as they complete missions, assigned by the various characters in the game. Missions can consist of anything from defeating particular enemies, reaching a specific location, or completing a puzzle. With the exception of timed or otherwise linear missions, the player is free to explore the game world as they see fit. Cheats, made available as the player progresses, can upgrade weapons, flip the game world around into a mirror image of itself, or grant the player invincibility. After the game has been completed, the Hero Mode option is made accessible, which, when purchased, allows the player to replay the game at a higher difficulty level, but with all previously unlocked cheats and extras still available. As the Precursor Orb count is not reset, and the orbs are regenerated at their original locations, the player is able to regather orbs that he or she had already collected the previous time they played through the game. Collecting all 600 Precursor Orbs has some cosmetic effects on Jak's appearance, but has no effects other than this. In Hero Mode, Jak also keeps all twelve of his weapons but loses his light flight along with two of his dark powers until they are collected in their respective parts of the game. There are some differences between Jak 3 and Jak II. Most notably are the changes undergone by the Haven City environments. Spargus City, the Wasteland, and Haven City function as the main hubs in Jak 3, where leaper lizards, buggies, and zoomers are respectively the main transportation source. While Jak II provided the player with only four different types of guns, Jak 3 expands on the concept with two additional modifications for each type, ending with a total of twelve weapons. Also, the 'Dark Jak' form, introduced in Jak II, which allowed the player to transform into a more powerful offensive version of Jak, is countered by a 'Light Jak' formJak 3 (ps2: 2004): Reviews that mainly focuses on defensive abilities. The jet-board makes a return appearance from Jak II to this game, with some additional upgrades as well. == Plot == === Setting === Like its predecessors, Jak 3 takes place in an unnamed fictional universe created by Naughty Dog specially for the games. The game is set one year after the events of Jak II. Jak 3 largely focuses on the Wasteland, a large desert only briefly referred to in the previous entry in the series as being completely uninhabited and inhospitable. Spargus City, a large settlement within the Wasteland bordering the ocean, is where the game begins, and serves as a hub for the player, where new weapons and upgrades can be earned, and most missions are given out. Later on, the plot shifts focus to Haven City, a sprawling metropolis which was the central locale in Jak II, though the area is only one-fifth the size of the Wasteland. Some levels from the previous game are radically altered (Haven Forest, Metropolitan area) or removed entirely (like the Bazaar in Haven City), while others are added (New Haven City), branching off from Spargus and the Wasteland and Haven. === Characters === As in the games before it, Jak 3's two main protagonists are Jak and his best friend Daxter the 'ottsel', which is a fictional cross between an otter and a weasel. Jak is revealed to have the birth name of Mar in this game, named after his ancestor and the original founder of Haven City, Mar. Jak's mechanic friend (and potential love interest) Keira returns in this game. There is also Ashelin, the Governor of Haven City, who was previously involved with Torn, the now-commander of the Freedom League. Daxter's love interest Tess returns as a weapons designer; and Jak's mentor, Samos, also makes appearances through the game. A new character, Damas, is first introduced here. It is revealed that not only did Damas lose his son, but was the leader of Haven City before being betrayed by Baron Praxis and being banished to the desert. More minor but returning characters include Sig, a spy for Damas back in Haven City who later becomes the new king of Spargus after Damas is killed, Jinx, a former member of the Underground, Vin, whose brain now resides inside a computer and Pecker, Onin's translator from Jak II becomes an adviser to Damas in the early parts of the game. Few of the original antagonists from Jak II reappear in this game. A new secondary villain is Count Veger, a self- absorbed Haven City aristocrat who banishes Jak to the wasteland at the beginning of the game. The player later finds that Veger attacked the Palace himself, wishing to journey to the core of the planet and gain the power of the Precursors. Even as he attempts this, a species known as the Dark Makers begin to invade the planet, seeking to destroy it. The Dark Makers are Precursors who have been corrupted by Dark Eco, similar to the antagonists of The Precursor Legacy. The main antagonist is the former Krimzon Guard commander Erol, first introduced in Jak II, renamed Cyber-Errol. He is a cybernetic version of himself, as he was badly wounded in Jak II when he crashed into a supply of Eco barrels in an attempt to kill Jak. Sometime before the start of this game, he restarts the manufacturing of Krimzon Guard Deathbots, whose original factory was shut down during the events of the previous game. Errol launches a war against Haven City in tandem with the remaining Metal Head monsters, and later forges an alliance with the Dark Makers. He obtains a massive Dark Maker terraforming robot at the end of the game, with which he attempts to destroy the planet. The Terraformer is destroyed by Jak as it advances through the Wasteland towards Spargus City. === Story === The game begins with Jak and Daxter being banished into the Wasteland by the tyrannical Count Veger for supposed crimes against Haven City. Ashelin, who opposes the banishment, gives Jak a beacon before she leaves and tells him to \\"stay alive\\". As they travel through the desert, flashbacks reveal that Haven City is at war between the Freedom League and the surviving Metal Heads and their allies, the KG Death Bots. The Palace is then destroyed by an unknown force. As Jak, Daxter, and Pecker lose consciousness, they are rescued by a group of desert-dwellers, who take them back to Spargus City. Jak (left) speaking to King Damas of Spargus CityWaking up in Spargus, the King, Damas, says that Jak must earn his place in the civilization by proving himself as a warrior in both the Arena challenges and by serving the city, who his \\"life now belongs to\\" for being rescued. His missions involve recovering artifacts after sandstorms, racing for both buggies and Leaper lizards for upgrades, Eco crystals and buggies, catching Kanga rats upon a Leaper lizard, and several other odd jobs in the oasis city. Most important among these events is that Jak is bestowed Light Eco abilities to balance the darkness within, granted to him at the Precursor temple by an oracle who believes that Jak is the last hope for the civilization. These powers include time-slowing abilities, healing powers, shield abilities, and even flight. Along the way, Jak befriends the Precursor Monk, Seem, and a buggy garage owner, Kliever ‚Äì who initially dislike him until he gains their trust over time. During one of Damas' missions into the desert, Jak is found by Ashelin, who reveals that she knew Damas would find him since she knew he would check his old beacons. She refuses to tell him how she knows Damas and then begs Jak to come back to Haven City to defend it from the Metal Heads and the new Krimzon Guard Deathbots. Still embittered about being exiled, he refuses to return. Ashelin leaves him, but later, after finding out what the evil Count Veger has in store for his friends, Jak changes his mind and makes the journey via transport to Haven City. Jak and Daxter help reunite the resistance in Haven, who is divided due to barriers put up by enemies, and give them hope that they can beat back the Metal Heads and Deathbots. Partway through the game, Jak and Daxter start to encounter strange creatures. A Precursor telescope in the outskirts of Haven City reveals that the beings are Dark Makers, who were once Precursors, but exposure to Dark Eco transformed them into twisted beings. Jak finds that a purple star in the sky is actually a Dark Maker space ship, and it is nearing the planet. The only way to stop the ship is to activate the planetary defense system situated at the core of the planet, and after defeating the Metal Heads and Deathbots in Haven City, Jak and Daxter begin their trek to the Planet Core. Damas joins them as they burst through a destroyed section of the city searching for a way to the core. In the battle, Damas is crushed underneath a buggy and fatally injured. In his last moments, he asks Jak to find his long-lost son, Mar, and gives him an amulet bearing the seal of Mar to identify him. Remembering his younger self from the events of Jak II, Jak realizes that Damas is his father, but Damas dies before Jak can tell him. Veger arrives and tells Jak that it's true, and he took Jak when he was a small boy away from Damas for his eco powers before Praxis banished Damas and seized control of Haven. Veger then rushes off to the core and Jak follows him, hungry for revenge. Once there, they seem to have beaten Veger, and the Precursor entity tells Jak that he has earned the right to evolve into one of them. Veger, however, emerges from the shadows and takes the power for himself. However, it is soon revealed that Precursors are actually ottsels who are simply fluffing up the myth to match their appearance with their abilities. A baffled Veger is transformed into an ottsel, effectively as punishment for his actions. The Precursors send Jak and Daxter to the Dark Maker ship to slow it down while the planetary defense system charges. The mission is a success, but as the ship is breaking apart, a gigantic, spider-legged Dark Maker terraformer commanded by the Deathbot leader, Errol, escapes from the ship and descends to the planet. Jak follows, and after a battle, Errol and the Robot are destroyed. Back in Spargus, Sig is put on the throne and Jak departs with the Precursors to see the universe. However, after the ship takes off, he emerges from the shadows and says that there was no way he could leave Daxter behind, not with \\"all their adventures ahead\\".Jak 3: Jak (to Daxter): With all our adventures ahead, you wouldn't last a second without me. == Development and release == Jak 3 was developed by Naughty Dog for the PlayStation 2. Jak 3 was first revealed to be in the works by one of Superplay's writers on January 8, 2004. While browsing the Naughty Dog offices, he saw early work being done with desert environments. It was first announced by Sony Computer Entertainment on February 24, 2004. On April 19, 2004, information was revealed about the plot and gameplay. It was released in North America on November 9, 2004, and in Europe on November 26, 2004. ==Soundtrack== Jak 3: Official Soundtrack, composed by Josh Mancell and Larry Hopkins, was released on CD by Sony Computer Entertainment as an exclusive product for the Limited Run Games collector's edition of Jak 3 on April 26, 2019. == Reception == Jak 3 received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay, as well as the immense story. The game currently holds an 85.33% approval rating on GameRankings based on 61 reviews. GameSpot gave it a score of 8.6/10, \\"Jak 3 is a game with exceptional production values and some of the nicest visuals on the PlayStation 2\\" and went on to praise the \\"Solid platforming action with even more weapons and abilities, tons of varied gameplay types, engrossing and well-told storyline, the trademark humor and plenty of unlockable secrets.\\" Other praises have been given to the game for being reasonably easier in difficulty compared to its predecessor ‚Äì which received minor criticism for its insufficient number of checkpoints. IGN said: \\"If you're looking for art and technical achievement, Jak has it...Jak is it. Characters animate so smoothly it actually makes playing other games painful. Painful, I say! And it never stutters, never glitches, never hitches, and never, ever lets up\\" and gave it a score of 9.6/10. On August 4, 2005 the game was added to the Greatest Hits collection. == References == === Notes === === Footnotes === == External links == * * Category:2004 video games Category:Alien invasions in video games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:Dystopian video games Category:Jak and Daxter games Category:Naughty Dog games Category:Open world video games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games scored by Josh Mancell ","title":"Jak 3"},{"id":"1444841","text":"Following the 2011 Tunisian revolution, elections in Tunisia for the president and the unicameral Assembly of the Representatives of the People are scheduled to be held every five years. The assembly can be dissolved before finishing a full term. Prior to the revolution, elections were held every five to six years, and elected both the president and members of both legislative branches. Following the revolution, elections were held for a Constituent Assembly to decide on a new constitution for Tunisia. From 1956 to 2011, the government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally‚Äîoriginally known as the Neo Destour (1934-1964) and the Socialist Destourian Party (1964-1988)--were effectively one. Although Tunisia was only formally a one-party state from 1963 to 1981, the opposition was usually barely tolerated. With the revolution, several parties have emerged. While there are two numerically major parties--Nidaa Tounes and the Ennahda Movement‚Äîno one party has a realistic chance of governing alone. ==Presidential elections== The president of Tunisia is directly elected by universal suffrage for a 5-year term. The president is elected by majority, with a second round with the top-two finishers if no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote in the first round. The first direct presidential election after the revolution was held in 2014. A person can not serve more than two terms as president, whether consecutive or not. ===Pre-revolution=== Prior to the revolution, the President was elected for five years. He appointed a prime minister and cabinet, who play a strong role in the execution of policy. Regional governors and local administrators are appointed by the central government. Mayors and municipal councils, which fill a local consultative role, are elected. This system was established by a provision of the country's Code of Personal Status, introduced by the former President Habib Bourguiba in 1956. Until 1999, prospective candidates were required to get the endorsements of at least 30 political figures. From 1956 to 1975, the president could run for reelection any number of times. In 1975‚Äîa year after winning his fourth term‚ÄîBourguiba was declared president for life. With Bourguiba's ouster in 1987, his successor, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, pushed through amendments limiting a president to three five-year terms, with no more than two in a row. The maximum age for presidential candidates was set at 70. However, in 2002, a referendum abolished term limits for the presidency, and raised the maximum age to 75. ==Parliamentary elections== Tunisia's legislative branch consists of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People, which consists of 217 seats. The first elections for the Assembly of the Representative of the People occurred on 26 October 2014. ===Electoral System=== The assembly is directly elected by the people using party-list proportional representation, with the individual seats distributed between lists in a constituency using largest remainder method. The lists are closed, a voter can only choose between lists, and not individual candidates. The lists are required to alternate between men and women. The assembly is elected for a 5-year term, but can be dissolved earlier by the president following a failure to form a government, or a failed confidence vote. ===Distribution of seats=== Constituencies are based on the governorates of Tunisia. Each governorate is allocated one seat for every 60000 inhabitants, with one more seat if the remaining number of inhabitants exceed 30000. Additionally, governorates with less than 270000 inhabitants are granted two extra seats, while governorates with between 270000 and 500000 inhabitants granted one extra seat. A constituency can have a maximum of 10 seats, if a governorate is entitled to more than 10 seats, it will be divided into two or more constituencies. Additionally, there are a number of constituencies representing Tunisians abroad. For the 2011 and 2014 elections there were a total of 33 constituencies. There were 27 multi-member constituencies in Tunisia varying in size from four to ten seats and electing a total of 199. There are also six overseas constituencies electing a total of 18 seats: two constituencies in France electing five seats each, one three-seat constituency in Italy, a single-member constituency in Germany, a two-member constituency covering the rest of Europe and the Americas, and a two-member constituency covering the Arab world and the rest of the world. ===Pre-revolution=== The Chamber of Deputies of Tunisia (Majlis al-Nuwaab) was Tunisia‚Äôs lower Chamber. It had 189 seats and members were elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms. 20% of the seats were reserved for the opposition. The Chamber played a role in debate on national policy but never originated legislation. Elections were held in the last 30 days of each five-year term. To be eligible for office, one had to be a voter with a Tunisian mother or father and be at least 23 years. Tunisia's upper chamber, the Chamber of Advisors, was created in July 2002 by Parliament. Its membership was restricted to two-thirds of the number of members in the Chamber of Deputies. Members were elected or appointed. One or two members (determined by size of population) were elected from each governance. These members were selected by local authorities. A third of the members were elected by a group of employers, farmers and workers. These seats were divided equally among the three groups. The remaining seats (41) were filled by qualified presidential appointees. All members sat for six-year terms and half of the membership was renewed every three years. To be eligible for office, a candidate had to be a voter with a Tunisian mother or father and at least 40 years old. Post-revolution: The electoral and transition process did not progress without concessions and compromise. The full breadth of post- revolutionary political costs are discussed in The Great Tunisian Compromise. ==Latest elections== ===Presidential=== ===Parliamentary=== ==Past elections== ===Presidential=== ===Parliamentary=== ===2011 Constituent Assembly election=== ==See also== *Electoral calendar *Electoral system ==References== ==External links== *Interview with Neila C.

In deciding upon her design configuration the Board of Admiralty took what history shows was a retrograde step by requesting the reversion from barbettes to turrets for her main armament. She was completed slightly later than her sister-ship and was hence the last British battleship ever to be equipped with her main armament mounted in a single turret. The choice of calibre, while influenced by the desire to mount as heavy guns as possible, was also influenced by the slow rate of production in the Woolwich yards of the calibre guns mounted in most of the preceding Admiral class. , of that class, mounted the heavier calibre guns for the same reason. Following on from this decision, and given that a turret is heavier than a barbette, it was not possible to mount the two guns separately in fore and aft positions and at the same time keep the ship within the displacement stipulated by the Board. Hence both were mounted in a single turret, placed forward of the superstructure. To provide a nominal fire to stern, a gun was mounted aft of the superstructure, behind a light armour shield. This weapon fired a shell weighing 500 pounds with a muzzle velocity of , and could in theory penetrate an iron plate of thickness of at a range of . The Elswick yards also experienced delays in producing the gun of calibre, so in fact the times between laying down and completion of the Admirals and of Sans Pareil were closely comparable.

Sans Pareil viewed from the stern, ready for launching at the Thames Ironworks She was commissioned at Chatham on 8 July 1891 to take part in manoeuvres, and then went into reserve. She was posted to the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1892, serving on this station until April 1895 when she paid off and was named as port guard ship at Sheerness. She was refitted from April 1899, and resumed duty as Sheerness guardship on 19 January 1900, serving until January 1904. On 1 October 1901 Rear-Admiral Sir Baldwin Walker hoisted his flag as second in command of the Reserve squadron. In June 1902 she was docked in the Medway, during a trial of the New Bermuda Floating dock. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and the following month went to Chatham Dockyard for a short refit, resuming duty after a couple of weeks. She was sold for scrap in 1907 as part of the fleet modernisation programme instigated by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Fisher. The ship was sold for scrap, and dismantled at the dock on the River Ribble, Preston, Lancashire. A model of the ship was removed from her at that time and is thought to be either the builder's model or constructed by the ship's crew. Whilst requiring some restoration, this fine model (about 3m long) is on display in 'The Story of Preston' at Preston's Harris Museum and Library. ==Captains== * Captain H. C.

The Parliament of Tuvalu (Palamene o Tuvalu) has 15 members, elected for a four-year term in 7 double- and 1 single-seat constituencies. Tuvalu is a de facto non-partisan democracy since it does not have political parties. Throughout the history of the parliament three women have been elected: Naama Maheu Latasi, from 1989 to 1997; Pelenike Isaia, from 2011 to 2015; and Dr Puakena Boreham who was elected in the 2015 Tuvaluan general election. == Parliament of Tuvalu (Palamene o Tuvalu)== During the time Tuvalu was a British dependency the parliament was called the House of the Assembly. Following independence in October 1978 the House of the Assembly was renamed the Parliament of Tuvalu (Palamene o Tuvalu). The Constitution of Tuvalu states that it \\"is the supreme law of Tuvalu\\" and that \\"all other laws shall be interpreted and applied subject to this Constitution\\"; it sets out the Principles of the Bill of Rights and the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. In 1986 the Constitution adopted upon independence was amended in order to give attention to Tuvaluan custom and tradition as well as the aspirations and values of the Tuvaluan people. The changes placed greater emphasis on Tuvaluan community values rather than Western concepts of individual entitlement. The constituency of the parliament is based upon the islands of Tuvalu. The larger islands elect two members, while Nukulaelae elects one member. The smallest island, Niulakita, is represented in the parliament by the members of the constituency of Niutao. A candidate for parliament must be a citizen of Tuvalu of a minimum age of 21 years. Voting in Tuvalu is not compulsory. At 18 years of age, Tuvaluans are eligible to be added to the electoral rolls. At the date of independence there were 12 members of the parliament. The Electoral Act was amended in December 1999 to increase the membership of parliament from 12 to 15 MPs. In August 2007 the Constitution was changed to increase the number of ministers from 5 to 7. Those members selected the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the parliament by secret ballot. The Ministers that form the Cabinet are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister. The Attorney-General sits in parliament, but does not vote, as the parliamentary role of the Attorney-General is purely advisory. ==Parties== Due to the small population size and scale of the 16 seat parliament, Tuvalu has no political parties, meaning that the political system in Tuvalu exhibits the traits of a Non-partisan democracy. ==1977 elections to the House of Assembly== During the time Tuvalu was a British dependency the parliament was called the House of the Assembly or Fale i Fono. Following independence in October 1978 the House of the Assembly was renamed the Parliament of Tuvalu or Palamene o Tuvalu. As a consequence of the 1974 Ellice Islands self- determination referendum, separation occurred in two stages. The Tuvaluan Order 1975, which took effect on 1 October 1975, recognised Tuvalu as a separate British dependency with its own government. The second stage occurred on 1 January 1976 when separate administrations were created out of the civil service of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. Elections to the House of Assembly of the British Colony of Tuvalu were held on 27 August 1977; with Toaripi Lauti being appointed as prime minister on 1 October 1977. The parliament was dissolved in July 1978 with the government of Toaripi Lauti continuing as a caretaker government until the 1981 elections were held. ==1981 elections to the Parliament of Tuvalu== The first elections after independence will not held until 8 September 1981. 26 candidates contested the 12 seats. Dr. Tomasi Puapua, was elected as prime minister with a 7:5 majority over the group a members of parliament headed by former prime minister Toaripi Lauti. ==1985 elections to the Parliament of Tuvalu== The general election was held on 12 September 1985, with nine members re-elected including prime minister Tomasi Puapua and finance minister Henry Naisali.

Many candidates focused on climate change issues including Enele Sopoaga, a former Tuvaluan ambassador to the United Nations and Tuvalu's representative at the UN Climate Change Conference held in Copenhagen in 2009.\\"Tuvalu completes voting in national elections\\", Radio Australia, 16 September 2010\\"Elections √† Tuvalu\\" , Australian Broadcasting Corporation (French), 17 September 2010. Ten of the 15 members of parliament retained their seats including the speaker Kamuta Latasi, while the deputy prime minister Tavau Teii lost his seat.

The 2013 Nukufetau by- election was held on 28 June. The Nukufetau by-election was won by the opposition candidate Elisala Pita. A constitutional crisis developed when prime minister Telavi responded that, under the Constitution of Tuvalu, he was only required to convene parliament once a year, and was thus under no obligation to summon it until December 2013. Tuvalu's opposition then requested the governor-general Iakoba Italeli to intervene against the prime minister's decision. On 3 July, Italeli exercised his reserve powers in ordering parliament to convene, against the prime minister's wishes, on 30 July. When the parliament met on 30 July, the speaker (Kamuta Latasi) refused to allow a debate on a no-confidence motion in the government of Willy Telavi. Taom Tanukale, the health minister, resigned from the parliament (and thus also from the government). This resignation appeared to be political manoeuvre as Willy Telavi responded by insisting that parliament should be suspended until a by-election was held and declined to call the by-election. In Tuvalu a by-election can only be called when requested by the prime Mmnister. The governor-general Iakoba Italeli then proceeded to exercise his reserve powers to order Mr Telavi's removal and the appointment of Enele Sopoaga as interim prime minister. The governor-general also ordered that parliament sit on Friday 2 August to allow a vote of no-confidence in Mr Telavi and his government. Telavi then proceeding to write to Queen Elizabeth II (as the head of state of Tuvalu) informing her that he was dismissing Mr Italeli from his position as governor-general. ===Sopoaga ministry=== On Sunday 4 August the parliament elected Enele Sopoaga as prime minister. Vete Sakaio was subsequently appointed deputy prime minister and minister for public utilities, Maatia Toafa was appointed the minister of finance and economic development and Taukelina Finikaso was appointed the foreign minister. As a consequence of the resignation of Taom Tanukale, the Nui by-election was held on 10 September 2013. Leneuoti Maatusi was declared the winner, polling 297 of the 778 registered voters. Maatusi has been a civil servant and served as the secretary of the Nui Falekaupule. He beat Palemene Anelu, a recent graduate of the University of the South Pacific, who received 206 votes and Taom Tanukale, the sitting member, whose resignation from parliament caused the by-election, who received 160 votes. The government of Enele Sopoaga had a majority of two going into the by-election. After the by-election Leneuoti Maatusi committed to support prime minister Enele Sopoaga. In December 2013 a vacancy for the constituency of Nanumaga was declared by the governor-general in accordance with Section 99 (2) of the Tuvalu Constitution following an assessment of Falesa Pitoi's health. The 2014 Nanumaga by-election occurred on 14 January. The candidates were Halo Tuavai, Otinielu Tauteleimalae Tausi and Pai Teatu. Otinielu Tausi was the successful candidate.

The voting occurred on 19 September 2014. Mr Satini Tulaga Manuella was the successful candidate.

On Niutao Vete Sakaio, the deputy-prime minister, was not elected and was succeeded by Samuelu Teo, who is a former MP. The election was a good result for the government of Enele Sopoaga. Enele Sopoaga was sworn in as prime minister and appointed the ministers to the cabinet on 10 April. Apisai Ielemia was elected to represent Vaitupu at the general election. On 5 October 2016 Chief Justice Sweeney of the High Court of Tuvalu declared that Ielemia's parliamentary seat was vacant as he was not qualified to be a member of parliament, as the consequence of the short time the opposition MP served time in jail following his conviction on 6 May 2016 in the Magistrate's Court of charges of abuse of office during the final year of his term as Prime Minister (August 2006 to September 2010).

Non-profit hospitals are the most common type, but for-profit and government hospitals also play substantial roles. A non-profit hospital, or not-for- profit hospital, is a hospital which is organized as a non-profit corporation. Non-profit hospitals are mostly funded by charity, religion or research/educational funds. Nonprofit hospitals do not pay federal income or state and local property taxes, and in return they benefit the community. The various exemptions given to non-profit hospitals get scrutinized by policymakers, with the argument being whether they provide community benefits that justify forgone government tax revenues. In 2003, of the roughly 3,900 nonfederal, short-term, acute care general hospitals in the United States, the majority‚Äîabout 62 percent‚Äîwere nonprofit.

Based on their charitable purpose and most often affiliated with a religious denomination they are a traditional means of delivering medical care in the United States. Non-profit hospitals are distinct from government owned public hospitals and privately owned for-profit hospitals. There are some exceptions, in California for example, professional medical corporations, University of California hospitals, county hospitals, narcotic treatment programs, some nonprofit organizations such as community clinics, and Knox-Keene-licensed HMOs are allowed to employ physicians directly. California Health & Safety Code section 1206(I) exempts from licensure clinics operated by a nonprofit corporation (such as a medical foundation) if they meet certain requirements, including conducting medical research and health education, and providing medical care through a group of 40 or more independent contractor physicians and surgeons. The foundation's board must consist of physician, hospital and local community representatives, with affiliated physicians making up no more than 20 percent of the board's members. It is for these reasons that organizations such as the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center restructured in 1994 to become the Cedars-Sinai Health System, comprising the Cedars-Sinai Medical Care Foundation, Physician- Hospital Organization and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\\"\\"Historical Perspective\\" ==See also== *For-profit hospital ==References== Category:Hospitals ","title":"Non-profit hospital"},{"id":"1444853","text":"Uruguay elects on national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature. == Presidential elections == The president and the vice-president are elected on one ballot for a five-year term by the people.

Due to political instability, elections have not been held regularly since the early 2000s. ==Electoral history== ===North Yemen=== Following the North Yemen Civil War and the establishment of the Yemen Arab Republic, a new constitution came into force in 1970 and the first parliamentary elections were held in 1971.Robert D. Burrowes (2009) Historical Dictionary of Yemen, Scarecrow Press, p197 However, as political parties were banned, all candidates ran as independents. Political instability meant that the next elections did not take place until 1988. The 1988 elections were also held on a non-party basis, although around 30 candidates sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood were elected.Yemen Inter-Parliamentary Union ===South Yemen=== During the British colonial era, elections were held for a Legislative Council in the Colony of Aden. The first took place in 1955, although only four of the 18 seats were suffrage was restricted.Sheila Carapico (2007) Civil Society in Yemen: The Political Economy of Activism in Modern Arabia Cambridge University Press, p86 The next elections in 1959 saw 12 of the 23 seats elected, although continued restrictions on suffrage led to only 21,500 people being registered to vote from a population of 180,000. The final elections of the British era were held in 1964, having been postponed from 1962. After independence and the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in 1967, the first parliamentary elections took place in 1978, by which time the country was a one-party state. The Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) won all 111 seats. The next elections were scheduled for 1983, but postponed until 1986. The YSP remained the sole legal party, but independents were allowed to run, winning 40 of the 111 seats. ===Unified Yemen=== Following unification in 1990, a 301-seat House of Representatives was established. Parliamentary elections were held in 1993, which saw the General People's Congress (GPC) based in the north win 123 of the 301 seats, whilst al-Islah won 62 and the YSP 56. The YSP subsequently boycotted the 1997 parliamentary elections, in which the GPC won a majority of seats. The first direct presidential elections were held in 1999. Candidates could only advance to the public vote if they received over 30 votes in the House of Representatives. With only the GPC and al-Islah holding enough seats to nominate a candidate, and al-Islah backing incumbent President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the only other candidate to receive enough votes was the GPC's Najeeb Qahtan Al-Sha'abi. Saleh subsequently won the public ballot with 96.2% of the vote. The next parliamentary elections in 2003 saw the YSP return to electoral contests. However, they won only eight seats as the GPC increased their parliamentary majority, winning 226 of the 301 seats. The 2006 presidential elections saw Saleh re-elected with 77% of the vote, defeating Faisal Bin Shamlan, the candidate of the Joint Meeting Parties, an alliance of the five main opposition parties. The parliamentary elections scheduled for 2009 were repeatedly postponed. However, following the Yemeni revolution, Saleh stood down and presidential elections were held in 2012. Saleh's Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi was the only candidate to run, and was elected unopposed. ==Electoral system== The president is elected for a seven-year term in a two- stage process, with the House of Representatives required to endorse at least two candidates, who are then put to a public vote.Country profile: Yemen Library of Congress The 301 members of the House of Representatives are elected for a six-year term in single-member constituencies using the first- past-the-post system.Electoral system Inter-Parliamentary Union The voting age is 18, whilst candidates for the House of Representatives must be at least 25. ==Referendums== Following unification in 1990, a referendum was held on a new constitution in 1991, which was approved by 98.5% of voters.

The President and National Assembly are simultaneously elected for five-year terms. ==Electoral history== ===Pre- independence=== Elections for five members of the Advisory Council were held for the first time in 1918, at which time suffrage was limited to British subjects over the age of 21 who had lived in the territory for at least six months and owned at least ¬£150 of property.Michael Gelfand (1961) Northern Rhodesia in the days of the charter: medical and social study, 1878-1924, Basil Blackwell, p138 Elections under the same system were held in 1920 and 1922. In 1924 a Legislative Council with five elected member was created, with the first elections held in 1926. Prior to the 1929 elections the number of elected members was increased to seven. Subsequent elections were held in 1932, 1935 and 1938. The 1941 elections saw eight members elected, with the new Northern Rhodesian Labour Party winning five seats. However, after its defeat in the 1944 elections, the party was disbanded. Prior to the 1948 elections the number of elected members was increased to ten, with two Africans appointed to the Council. In 1953 the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was formed, with all territories electing members to the federal Legislative Assembly. The first federal elections were held in the same year. Northern Rhodesia had eight ordinary seats, and three members representing African interests, two of which were Africans chosen by an electoral college and one European appointed by the governor. Only three Africans qualified to vote. The Federal Party won seven of the eight ordinary seats. Constitutional reforms saw the number of elected seats in the Northern Rhodesian Legislative Council increase to twelve in 1954, with four African members selected by the Northern Rhodesian African Representative Council. The 1954 elections resulted in a victory for the Federal Party, which won ten seats. The next federal elections in 1958 saw a landslide victory for the United Federal Party (UFP), the successor the Federal Party, which won 46 of the 59 seats. The promulgation of the \\"Lennox-Boyd constitution\\" led to the expansion of the Legislative Council to 22 elected members for the 1959 elections. It provided for 12 \\"ordinary\\" seats with mostly Europeans, six \\"special\\" seats mainly reserved for Africans, two reserved for Africans and two reserved for Europeans. The UFP retained their majority, winning 13 seats. Further constitutional reforms led to another electoral system being implemented for the 1962 elections, with 15 members elected by an upper roll, 15 elected by a lower roll and 15 by both rolls together. Although the UFP won the most seats, the United National Independence Party (UNIP) and the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress (NRANC) were able to form a coalition government. The next elections in 1964 were held under another new system, with 65 seats elected by an African \\"main roll\\" and ten seats by a \\"reserved roll\\" primarily for Europeans. The result was a victory for UNIP, which won 55 of the 75 seats, allowing Kenneth Kaunda to become Prime Minister, and subsequently President when Zambia became independent on 24 October 1964. ===Post- independence=== General elections in 1968 included the first vote for president, with Kaunda defeating Zambian African National Congress (a renamed NRANC) leader Harry Nkumbula with 82% of the vote. The ten reserved seats in the National Assembly were abolished and the number of elected seats increased to 105, with an additional five members appointed by the President. UNIP won 81 of the elected seats. In 1973 the country became a one-party state; general elections in the same year saw Kaunda run unopposed for the presidency, with voters voting yes or no to his candidacy (89% voted in favour). The National Assembly now had 125 elected seats, ten presidential appointees and a Speaker elected from outside the chamber. Although UNIP was the only legal party, up to three UNIP candidates could contest each seat. The same system was used for elections in 1978, 1983 and 1988, with Kaunda re-elected each time. Multi- party democracy was restored in 1991, with general elections held in October that year. Kaunda was defeated by Frederick Chiluba of the Movement for Multi- Party Democracy (MMD) in the presidential elections, with Chiluba receiving 76% of the vote. The MMD won 125 of the 150 elected seats in an expanded National Assembly, whilst the number of presidential appointees was reduced to eight. Chiluba was re-elected in the 1996 elections, with the MMD winning 131 seats and UNIP losing all 25 seats it had won in 1991. In 2001 MMD candidate Levy Mwanawasa won the presidential elections with just 29% of the vote in a field of eleven candidates. The MMD was reduced to 69 seats in the National Assembly, with opposition parties gaining a majority. Mwanawasa was re-elected in 2006 with 43% of the vote, although the MMD again failed to win a majority of seats in the National Assembly. After Mwanawasa's death in 2008, presidential elections were held for a candidate to serve the remainder of his five year term. The elections were won by the MMD's Rupiah Banda. The 2011 general elections saw the Patriotic Front (PF) candidate Michael Sata elected president with 42% of the vote, whilst the PF became the largest party in the National Assembly, winning 60 seats. After Sata's death in 2014, another presidential by-election was held in 2015 and won by the PF's Edgar Lungu, who received 48% of the vote. ==Electoral system== The voting age in Zambia is 18. ===President=== Since 1991 the President had been elected in a single round of voting by the first-past-the-post system.

In 1849 he took the degree of doctor of letters with two theses, one of which, Wala et Louis le D√©bonnaire (published in Paris in 1849), placed him in the front rank of French scholars in the province of Carolingian history. Soon, however, Himly turned his attention to the study of geography. In 1858 he obtained an appointment at the Sorbonne as a teacher of geography, henceforth devoting himself to that subject. It was not until 1876 that he published, in two volumes, his remarkable Histoire de la formation territoriale des √âtats de l'Europe centrale, in which he showed with a firm touch the reciprocal influence exerted by geography and history. While the work gives evidence throughout of wide and well-directed research, he preferred to write it in the form of a student's manual, but it was a manual so original that it gained him admission to the Institute in 1881. In that year he was appointed dean of the faculty of letters, and for ten years he directed the intellectual life of that great educational centre during its development into a great scientific body. ==References== Category:1823 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Members of the Acad√©mie des sciences morales et politiques Category:French historians Category:University of Paris faculty Category:French male non-fiction writers Category:√âcole Nationale des Chartes alumni ","title":"Auguste Himly"},{"id":"1444864","text":"Jan Frederik Helmers. Jan Frederik Helmers (March 7, 1767 ‚Äì February 26, 1813), was a Dutch poet born in Amsterdam. ==Works== His early poems, Night (1788) and Socrates (1790), were tame and sentimental, but after 1805 he determined, in company with his brother-in-law, Cornelis Loots (1765‚Äì1834), to rouse national feeling by a burst of patriotic poetry. His Poems (2 vols, 1809‚Äì1810), but especially his great work The Dutch Nation, a poem in six cantos (1812), created great enthusiasm and enjoyed immense success. Even the published censored version was contentious enough that only his premature death prevented an arrest by the French occupation.G.J. van Bork en P.J. Verkruijsse Helmers, Jan Frederik, in De Nederlandse en Vlaamse auteurs van middeleeuwen tot heden met inbegrip van de Friese auteurs., De Haan, Weesp, 1985 He owed his success mainly to the integrity of his patriotism and the opportune moment at which he sounded his counter-blast to the French oppression. His posthumous poems were collected in 1815. A neighbourhood in Amsterdam is named Helmersbuurt in his honour, built 1891-1902, with not less than three streets called after Helmers: the Eerste, Tweede and Derde Helmersstraat (which would be First, Second and Third Helmers Street in English). ==References== * ==External links== *Jan Frederik Helmers at the Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren website Category:1767 births Category:1813 deaths Category:Dutch male poets Category:Writers from Amsterdam ","title":"Jan Frederik Helmers"},{"id":"1444866","text":"Trine University is a private university in Angola, Indiana. It was founded in 1884 and offers degrees in the arts and sciences, business, education, and engineering. Trine University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). ==History== Trine was founded in 1884 as Tri-State Normal College and retained the reference to the \\"tri-state\\" area for more than 120 years because of its location in Indiana and proximity to Michigan and Ohio. In 1906, the school was renamed Tri-State College, and in 1975 Tri-State University. In 2008, the school's name was changed to the Trine University, in honor of alumnus Dr. Ralph Trine and his wife Sheri. The dropping of the \\"tri-state\\" identifier reflected a desire to brand the school as a nationally competitive private university, not to be mistaken for state-funded or associated with businesses or organizations nationwide also using the term \\"tri-state\\". During the 1990s, the university opened several satellite campuses throughout northern and central Indiana. ==Campus== Trine's main campus covers 450 acres (1.8 km¬≤) in Angola, Indiana. Graduate programs for the Rinker-Ross School of Health Sciences are housed at Trine's Health Sciences Education Center in Fort Wayne.

Goldie (born Genyusha Zelkovicz; April 19, 1940) is an American rock singer and producer. She was lead singer of The Escorts, Goldie and the Gingerbreads, and Ten Wheel Drive. ==Life and career== === Childhood === Ravan was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland in 1940 and immigrated to the United States in 1947, accompanied by her parents and one sister. They were her only family members who had survived the Nazi Holocaust in Europe; she also had two brothers, who both died. The family did not speak any English when they arrived. Genya was named 'Goldie' by her mother, who claimed Genyusha was not American enough. === Music career ===  Early success and Goldie and The Gingerbreads  Goldie's career started in 1962 in a Brooklyn club called The Lollipop Lounge, which is also the title of her autobiography published by Billboard Books. On a dare, she jumped up to sing, which she states was the first time she had heard her voice. She was asked to join the band The Escorts, which featured Richard Perry as one of the members. After signing to Decca's subsidiary Coral Records and being produced by Henry Jerome, she found success with a cover of \\"Somewhere\\" from West Side Story, which went to number one in parts of the Midwest. In 1963, she formed Goldie and The Gingerbreads after meeting drummer Ginger Bianco in a Greenwich Village bar. After seeing the band at a party for the Rolling Stones, Atlantic Records Chairman Ahmet Erteg√ºn signed them to Atlantic subsidiary Atco Records. Goldie and The Gingerbreads were the first all-girl rock band in history to be signed to a major label and climb the charts. While playing at New York City's hot spot The Wagon Wheel on 45th Street in Times Square, Mike Jeffries, Eric Burdon, Hilton Valentine, and Chas Chandler spotted them and wanted them to come to England. Goldie and The Gingerbreads toured with the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, the Kinks, and Manfred Mann. They released their hit song \\"Can't You Hear My Heart Beat\\" in 1965, which reached number 25 on the UK Singles Chart. The band stayed in London for two years.  Ten Wheel Drive and solo career  Billed as \\"Goldie\\", she released the original version of the Carole King-Gerry Goffin composition \\"Goin' Back\\" in the spring of 1966. However, this single was withdrawn within a week by producer Andrew Loog Oldham due to disagreements with Goffin and King over altered lyrics. The song would be covered by Dusty Springfield three months later, making the UK top 10 singles chart. In 1969, Ravan and partners Aram Schefrin and Mike Zager formed Ten Wheel Drive, which lasted three years. They recorded three albums for Polydor Records: Construction number 1, Brief Replies, Peculiar Friends Are Better Than No Friends. They had many fans, but the group did not take off. Ravan left the band in 1971. She was signed to Columbia Records by Clive Davis where she made one album in 1972 titled Genya Ravan. She made four more solo albums through the 1970s. Ravan performed at the Atlanta Pop Festival, twice at Carnegie Hall and twice at Madison Square Garden, along with various clubs in Boston, and Philadelphia, and New York City, including the famous CBGB. She appeared on television shows including The Mike Douglas Show, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Della, and The Dick Cavett Show.  2000s  Many Ten Wheel Drive tracks have been sampled by hip hop artists, including \\"Ain't Gonna Happen\\", which Jay-Z used in his song \\"1-900-Hustler\\" on the 2000 album The Dynasty. He also sampled Ravan's version of \\"Whipping Post\\" from her album Goldie Zelkowitz for his song \\"Oh My God\\" on the 2006 album Kingdom Come. In 2011, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum included Goldie and The Gingerbreads in their \\"Women in Music\\" exhibit, which traveled from state to state. Genya Ravan toured in 2013, selling out New York City's Iridium. In 2013, Ravan appeared at the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, alongside legends like Wanda Jackson, Martha Reeves, Maria Muldaur and Tracy Nelson as part of the museum's \\"Women Who Rock\\" exhibit. She and Reeves discovered professional connections in that both worked with Richard Perry and were signed by Clive Davis. Further, one of the first songs Ravan learned when she came to the US was \\"What Did I Do to Be So Black and Blue\\", made famous by Fats Waller; Reeves had performed the song while starring in the road show of Ain't Misbehavin'. The two planned on working on a future project together. A retrospective of her career is the subject of the Off Broadway musical Rock and Roll Refugee, which was profiled on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition Sunday on February 14, 2016. ==Producer== Ravan has worked as a producer for multiple record labels. Among others, she was responsible for the debut album Young Loud and Snotty by the punk rock band Dead Boys (1977) and the comeback album Siren by Ronnie Spector (1982). She also contributed vocals to the latter album. In 2001 Ravan discovered Tripod at CBGB and produced their demo CD, adding backup vocals to one track. == Radio host == In 2006, Steven Van Zandt recruited Ravan to host two monthly radio shows: Chicks and Broads, playing women from the '50s to the present day, and Goldies Garage, which featured unsigned bands. Genya Ravan said, \\"So much talent out there and not enough places for them to be heard anymore\\" on Van Zandt's Underground Garage radio channel, aired on Sirius Satellite Radio in North America and on Sirius Internet Radio worldwide.

The islands are an internally self-governing overseas territory of the United Kingdom. The United Nations Committee on Decolonization includes the Turks and Caicos Islands on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Legislative Council. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Military defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom. The capital of the Turks and Caicos Islands is Cockburn Town on Grand Turk. The islands were under Jamaican jurisdiction until 1962, when they assumed the status of a crown colony. The governor of the Bahamas oversaw affairs from 1965 to 1973. With Bahamian independence, the islands received a separate governor in 1973. Although independence was agreed upon for 1982, the policy was reversed and the islands are presently a British overseas territory. The islands adopted a constitution on August 30, 1976, which is Constitution Day, the national holiday. The constitution was suspended in 1986, but restored and revised March 5, 1988. A new Constitution was instituted in 2006, but was suspended in 2009 after the discovery of massive corruption and financial misfeasance by ministers. The territorial government was restored under a new Constitution after a general election in November 2012. The territory's legal system is based on English common law, with a small number of laws adopted from Jamaica and the Bahamas. Suffrage is universal for those over 18 years of age. English is the official language. ==Executive branch== Since the islands are a British territory, Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign and head of state; the British Crown is represented by a governor.

On March 24, 2009, Premier Michael Misick resigned as Britain prepared to take direct administrative control of the territory. Misick, who had been at the centre of the corruption probe into the ruling elite, said in a statement he was resigning to give way to a unified government. In August 2009, the United Kingdom suspended the Turks and Caicos' self-government after allegations of ministerial corruption.

In 1929 she enrolled in the √âcole du Louvre. In 1936, she married Auguste Nemours. In 1941 Nemours attended to the Andre Lhote Academy. In 1945, she began writing poetry. While for the first time at the Salon of Sacred Art she exhibited in 1946 until 1979. Nemours established her style in 1949 she then used her form of media to conduct research on the interplay of lines and their relationship to colored surfaces, angles, the point of geometric shapes, horizontal and vertical. From 1949 through 1992 Nemours participated in the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles. In 1950, Midi la lune, her collection of poems was published. In the late 1950s Nemours traveled to Haiti. Nemours exhibited at a variety of venues culminating in a retrospective at the Centre Georges Pompidou in 2004. Nemours died 27 January 2005 in Paris. ==Artistic style== Before any development, she made measurements, studies, sketches and drawings. Then she went into the essential, black and white or color; for her, the color is \\"pure energy.\\" Following an apprenticeship, she developed her vision at various studios and most notably Fernand L√©ger‚Äôs. Inspired by L√©ger, Nemour softens her edges of shapes and lines, imbuing her canvases with sensuality of the act of painting itself. She worked in black and white and bold colors, and honed her visual vocabulary to horizontal and vertical planes, right angles, lines, rectangles, and ultimately, the square, her ideal representation of universal harmony. She works in series thus from 1965- 1970: the square becomes the key size of her work. Although she stopped painting in 2002, she is honored now and in the future by the artists who have worked consistently and innovatively in the field of thought asserting their own vision.

The house is located on a corner lot at 407 Wilbrod Street in the Sandy Hill neighbourhood of Ottawa, near to a number of other embassies and official residences. The house was built in 1910 by William Davis, and is believed to have been designed by John W.H. Watts. Davis died under inauspicious circumstances in 1916 and it lay vacant for several years before being purchased by Colonel Cameron Macpherson Edwards, who had earlier lived at 24 Sussex Drive. The Edwards left in 1937 and rented the house to Germany to house the Consul General Dr. Erich Windels, who was friendly with Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, who lived nearby. Windels was expelled from Canada upon the declaration of war in September 1939. In part because of the war, the Australian delegation in Ottawa was looking for more spacious accommodations, and the newly vacant building met these needs. In 1940 it became the residence of the High Commissioner and they bought the building from the Edwards soon after. It has housed every High Commissioner since, as well as visiting Australian dignitaries, including any Australian Prime Ministers who visit Ottawa. From 1947 until 1953 the building was home to ex- Prime Minister Frank Forde during his term as Australian High Commissioner. Since November 2017, Her Excellency Natasha Smith is the latest High Commissioner to reside at Australia House.

The stop is located between Belgrave Walk and Mitcham Junction. It was formerly Mitcham railway station, which closed in 1997. The tram stop consists of twin platforms accessible by ramps at either end. == Infrastructure == Due to limited track space in the cutting northwest of the station towards Belgrave Walk tram stop, the tracks are interlaced for a short distance with one rail of the southeast bound track between the two rails of the northwest bound track. East of the station there used to be single track to Mitcham Junction Station. === Double line track === In late June 2012 a double line track was opened from Mitcham to Mitcham Junction, save for a short stretch of single track immediately to the west of Mitcham Junction due to the limited clearance under the road bridge. The track layout allows two trams to travel between the stations at the same time. Work started in Spring 2012 at the site laying the new track and installing the new OHLE (over head line) cables. The job took about three months to complete and 18 test tram runs passed successfully before opening. ==Connections== London Buses routes 118 and 280; and night routes N44 and N133 serve the tram stop. ==Gallery== File:Mitcham Railway Station.jpgFormer Mitcham Station File:Mitcham_tramstop_interlaced_track_west.JPGGauntlet track just northwest of the tram stop File:Mitcham layout.giftrack layout ==References== Category:Tramlink stops in the London Borough of Merton Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 2000 ","title":"Mitcham tram stop"},{"id":"1444901","text":"The iDog was a robot dog toy designed and manufactured by Sega Toys. An iDog figure receives input from an external music source, such as an MP3 player, and will light up and \\"dance\\" to the music's rhythm. It is marketed as the eDog in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. ==Basic iDog== The iDog reacts to music from an external source, such as an external speaker or through a direct connection to a music source such as an MP3 player. It features seven flashing LED lights on its face and has the ability to 'dance' to the beat of the music by intermittently wiggling its ears and shaking its head. It also has a number of switches on its nose, head and tail which allow it to react to user input. It has various emotions (which change based on user interaction) that provide different color patterns on its LED lights. The iDog began shipping worldwide between March and April 2005. The iDog comes in several colors including white, black, pink, red, lime green, blue, a tiger print, and a dalmatian print. Decorative clothing for the iDog has been released, including feet- warmers, ear-warmers and scarves. ===Variations=== Green McDonald's toy version of the iDog, purchased in Romania, July 2007 iDog Clip (left), iDog Dance (middle) and the original iDog (right) In 2005, Sega partnered with Atmos Tokyo to produce sports-themed iDogs as part of a new line, titled \\"iDog x Atmos\\". In 2007, Tiger Electronics released the iDog Amp'd, an upgraded version of the iDog with stereo speakers that nod its head and tap its foot in time with the music being played. The iDog Pup, a puppy version of the iDog with poseable ears and a moving head, was released in 2007 and was a localized version of the iDog Mini released in Japan in 2005. Also in 2007, two variants called \\"SpiDogs\\" were released to promote the film Spider-Man 3. They resemble the standard Spider-Man costume and the Black Suit respectively. In 2008, three new versions of the iDog were released. The iDog Clip is a fully functional mini-sized iDog which can be clipped onto a backpack,The iDog Dance is a larger version of the iDog that stands up and dances in time to the music, it also features 7 touch sensors (like the iCat), and the iDog Soft Speaker, a plush version of the iDog Amp'd that remixes some songs on it and has a pocket where the battery compartment is so you can store things in it. In 2009, as one of the last iDogs released, Hasbro released the iDog Plush Puppy. This smaller plush iDog came in pink and purple and was one of the first iDogs that didn't need batteries. It came with a cord attached to it, like the iDog Clip. But it had the light patterns stitched onto it. As part of a promotion with McDonald's, sets of iDog-based toys were included in Happy Meals in 2007. ===Personalities=== White variant of iFish Different kinds of music cause iDog to develop different personalities, as displayed through the color of LED lights that flash and blink on its face. ==iCat== Black variant of iCat The iCat is a feline version of the iDog. Similar to the iDog, it reacts to music from an external source, such as an MP3 player. It features seven flashing LED lights on its face and has the ability to \\"dance\\" to the beat of the music. It also has switches on its tail, head (nose), and 7 touch sensors which allow it to react to user input. Like the iDog, its LED light color patterns display various \\"emotions\\" based on user interaction and the music played. ==iFish== A piscine version of the iDog, the iFish plays music and moves in a swimming-like motion. The iFish also has an internal selection of music. The iFish comes with a blue or orange tail fin, with a 3.5 mm audio cable for audio input. Like the iDog, it is touch-sensitive. ==iCy== The iCy, marketed as the iPenguin in select countries, is a penguin version of the iDog. In addition to playing music, it dances and the LED lights on its stomach flash in time to the music. Unlike its predecessors, it has only two touch sensors for user interaction: its tail, which is designed to annoy it rather than reward it, and its beak, which is used to pet it. It has various \\"emotions\\" which change based on user interaction and music played. ==iTurtle== The iTurtle is a turtle version of the iDog. It also comes with a plug cable (3.5 mm) with 2 touch sensors on its tail and head. It moves its shell up and down, shakes its head side to side, and taps its foot. Has the same things as others except his moods are modified. ==Viral marketing== In 2006, UK musician Jesta was inspired to write a song focusing on the product, titled \\"Me, My Music & My iDog.\\" That same year, as part of the Daily Source Code podcast, host Adam Curry spoke about the iDog. ==See also== * Aibo * Poo- Chi == References == Category:Sega Category:Hasbro products Category:2005 robots Category:Robotic dogs Category:Entertainment robots Category:Robots of the United States Category:Toy animals ","title":"IDog"},{"id":"1444902","text":"Plate 55, \\"The Elevation of a Chinese Gazebo\\", from Rural Architecture in the Chinese Taste, 1755, in which the word \\"gazebo\\" is first recorded in English The Coopers' Hall, Bristol, one of the largest and most certain attributions to Halfpenny The recreated Chinese Bridge at Croome Court, to Halfpenny's design Black Castle, Bristol, perhaps by Halfpenny William Halfpenny (active 1723‚Äì1755) was an English architect and builder in the first half of the 18th century, and prolific author of builder's pattern books. In some of his publications he described himself as \\"architect and carpenter\\", and his books concentrate on the practical information a builder would need, as well as addressing \\"gentleman draughtsmen\\" designing their own houses. They were a popular alternative to the very expensive architectural treatises by British authors such as Colen Campbell and James Gibbs, or foreigners such as Serlio or Palladio (Halfpenny published a short work \\"correcting\\" some of the latter's mistakes).Reiff, Daniel D., Houses from Books: Treatises, Pattern Books, and Catalogs in American Architecture, 1738-1950: A History and Guide, 2010, Penn State Press, , 9780271044194, google books He also wrote under the name of Michael Hoare. Little is known for certain of his life, but he seems to have been based in Richmond, then in Surrey, and nearby London, perhaps also spending a period based in Bristol. He also worked in Ireland. Few buildings can certainly be ascribed to him, and no major ones; then and now his main importance lies in his books, which were often reprinted, and copied by other authors. They reached British North America and were also influential there. He wrote and probably built in collaboration with his son John Halfpenny in the later years of his career. Several of his later books are on architecture in the \\"Gothick\\" and \\"Chinese taste\\", as are several of the buildings attributed to him. ==Life and architectural work== Little is known of his life. In 1723, he was paid for a design for Holy Trinity Church, Leeds which was never executed, and his book Practical Architecture (1724) was dedicated to Yorkshire landowner and Member of Parliament Sir Thomas Frankland. The Art of Sound Building (1725) was dedicated to the Parliamentary official Sir Andrew Fountaine, and in 1726 he submitted a design for a bridge across the River Thames at Fulham. Batty Langley mentions him in his book Ancient Masonry (1736) as \\"Mr William Halfpenny, alias Hoare, lately of Richmond in Surrey, carpenter.\\" Halfpenny worked for a time in Ireland, in 1732 designing a horse barracks in Hillsborough, County Down, for Lord Hillsborough, and in 1737 Garrahunden House, later demolished, near Bagenalstown, County Carlow, for Sir Richard Butler. In 1739 he made designs for buildings in Waterford and Cork. Most of Halfpenny's buildings, including several that may have been designed by him or his contemporaries, are or were located in and around Bristol, where he was probably based from about 1730 (his Perspective Made Easy, published in 1731, contains various views of the city). The Coopers' Hall, King Street, built from his designs in 1743‚Äì4, is the most notable and the only surviving building in the area which can positively be identified as his work. The coopers relinquished it in 1785, and it was later used as assembly rooms, warehouses and a Baptist chapel. Since 1972, the ground floor has formed the main entrance to the Bristol Old Vic theatre, and the upper floors house various theatre facilities. Only one other work which can be positively identified as Halfpenny's and of which traces survive is a \\"Chinese\\" bridge built for Lord Deerhurst (later the sixth Earl of Coventry) at Croome Park, Worcestershire in 1747‚Äì48.Worcestershire by Alan Brooks and Nikolaus Pevsner, 2007, p.246 Archaeology students at the University of Worcester uncovered the substantial stone foundations of the bridge in summer 2009, and the National Trust built a replica of the bridge, using Halfpenny's drawing, as part of a plan to recreate Capability Brown's original landscape.University of Worcester ISE update, summer 2009, p.6nationaltrust.org.uk/croome/features/whats-new He died in debt in 1755. ==Buildings tentatively attributed to Halfpenny on stylistic grounds== *King House, Boyle, County Roscommon, (1720‚Äì1730) *The Ivy, Bath Road, Chippenham, Wiltshire (built for John Norris M.P.

His most important publications from the point of view of their effect upon taste, all of them published in London and many reprinted during Halfpenny's lifetime, were:(Center for Palladian Studies in America) \\"Palladio and architectural pattern books in colonial America\\" * Practical Architecture, or a sure guide to the true working according to the rules of that science (ca 1724) * (As 'Michael Hoare') The Builder's Pocket Companion (1728, 1731 etc.) * The Art of Sound Building, demonstrated in Geometrical Problems (1732, 2nd ed. 1736, etc.) * A New And Complete System of Architecture Delineated; (1749, 1759 etc.) * (with John Halfpenny) New Designs for Chinese Temples, in four parts (1750‚Äì52) * Rural Architecture in the Chinese Taste (1750).

New Designs for Chinese Temples was a volume of some significance in the history of furniture, since, having been published some years before the books of Thomas Chippendale and Sir William Chambers, it disproved the statement so often made that those designers introduced the Chinese taste into Britain.

It is run by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== Belmarsh Prison was built on part of the East site of the former Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, and became operational on 2 April 1991. Belmarsh is adjacent to and adjoins Woolwich Crown Court: it is used in high-profile cases, particularly those concerning national security. Between 2001 and 2002, Belmarsh Prison was used to detain a number of people indefinitely without charge or trial under the provisions of the Part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, leading it to be called the \\"British version of Guantanamo Bay\\". The law lords later ruled in A v Secretary of State for the Home Dept that such imprisonment was discriminatory and against the Human Rights Act. It is often used for the detention of prisoners for terrorist related offences. In September 2006 the number of such prisoners was 51. In May 2007, there was a violent disturbance in the prison, Sky News reported. At least four prison officers were injured.Staff hurt in jail disturbance  Metro News In 2009, an archaeological dig on site led to the discovery of a 6,000-year-old trackway in the prison, the second oldest known wooden trackway in Northern Europe after the Sweet Track near Glastonbury. In November 2009, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised the \\"extremely high\\" amount of force used to control inmates at the prison. The report also stated that an unusually high number of prisoners had reported being intimidated or victimised by staff at Belmarsh. In 2010, HMP Isis Young Offenders Institution was opened within the perimeter wall of Belmarsh Prison. ==The prison today== Car park and main entrance Belmarsh is a Category A Prison holding prisoners from all over the United Kingdom. In addition Belmarsh is a local prison, accepting different categories of prisoners from primarily the Central Criminal Court and Magistrates' Courts in South East London. In addition the establishment serves Crown and Magistrates' Courts in South West Essex. Accommodation at the prison is a mixture of approximately 60% multi-occupancy cells and 40% single cells, distributed mainly across 4 residential units. Inmates at Belmarsh are offered access to education, workshops, two gyms, one focusing on Physical Education courses and one recreational, with use of a sports hall and a fitness room. The gym staff also have a partnership with Charlton Athletic F.C. to deliver FA accredited coaching courses for prisoners. A listener scheme for prisoners at risk from suicide or self-harm is in operation at Belmarsh. There is also a support group for foreign national prisoners, providing advice on immigration law. == Notable inmates == *Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale *Abu Hamza al- Masri\\"Abu Hamza: from Soho bouncer to hook-handed cleric of hate.\\" The Daily Telegraph. 10 April 2012.

His London-born father was Robert Hall (1753 ‚Äì 10 January 1836), an army officer and, while in Ireland, engaged in working copper mines which ruined him. His mother supported the family of 12 children with her own business in Cork. He married Ann Kent (b. 1765, Ottery St. Mary, Devonshire) at Topsham, 6 April 1790. Hall was the fourth son. In 1821, he left Ireland and went to London. He entered law studies at the Inner Temple in 1824, but never practised, though he was finally called to the bar in 1841. Instead, he became a reporter and editor, including: * Reporter, Parliamentary (1823) * Editor, 'Literary Observer' * Art reviews/criticism, the British Press (same period) * Reporter, Representative (1826) * Reporter, New Times (1826) * Founder/editor, The Amulet, a Christian and Literary Remembrancer, (annually, 1826‚Äì1837) * Editor, Spirit and Manners of the Age (1826) * Editor, Morning Journal (1829‚Äì30) * Sub-editor/Editor New Monthly Magazine (1830‚Äì1836)'s Juvenile Library * Author, \\"History of France\\", Colburn * Writer, Watchman, Wesleyan Methodist newspaper, (1835) * Start-up, The Town, conservative whig journal, (1836) * Sub-editor, John Bull (1837) * General manager, Britannia (1839) ==Art magazine years== S. C. Hall photographed in 1874 In 1839, Hodgson & Graves, print publishers, employed Hall to edit their new publication, Art Union Monthly Journal. Not long after, Hall purchased a chief share of the periodical. By 1843, he started giving an expensive, unprofitable novelty, sculpture engravings. In 1848, with Hall still unable to turn a profit, the London publisher George Virtue purchased into the Art Union Monthly Journal, retaining Hall as editor. Virtue renamed the periodical The Art Journal in 1849. In 1851, Hall engraved 150 pictures from the private collection of the Queen and Prince Albert, and the engravings were featured in the journal's Great Exhibition edition. Though this edition was quite popular, the journal remained unprofitable, forcing Hall to sell his share of The Art Journal to Virtue, but staying on as editor. As editor, Hall exposed the profits that custom-houses were earning by importing Old Masters, and showed how paintings are manufactured in England. While The Art Journal became notable for its honest portrayal of fine arts, the consequence of Hall's actions was the almost unsaleability of old masters such as a Raphael or a Titian. His intention was to support modern British art by promoting young artists and attacking the market for unreliable old masters. The early issues of the Journal strongly supported the artists of The Clique and attacked the Pre- Raphaelites. Hall remained deeply unsympathetic to Pre-Raphaeliism, publishing several attacks upon the movement. Hall resigned the editorship in 1880, and was granted a Civil List pension for his long and valuable services to literature and art. ==Personal life== Anna Maria Hall & Samuel Carter Hall His wife, Anna Maria Fielding (1800‚Äì1881), became well known (publishing as \\"Mrs S.C. Hall\\"), for her numerous articles, novels, sketches of Irish life, and plays. Two of the last, The Groves of Blarney and The French Refugee, were produced in London with success. She also wrote a number of children's books, and was practically interested in various London charities, several of which she helped to found. Hall's notoriously sanctimonious personality was often satirised, and he is regularly cited as the model for the character of Pecksniff in Charles Dickens's novel Martin Chuzzlewit. As Julian Hawthorne wrote, > Hall was a genuine comedy figure. Such oily and voluble sanctimoniousness > needed no modification to be fitted to appear before the footlights in > satirical drama. He might be called an ingenuous hypocrite, an artless > humbug, a veracious liar, so obviously were the traits indicated innate and > organic in him rather than acquired. Dickens, after all, missed some of the > finer shades of the character; there can be little doubt that Hall was in > his own private contemplation as shining an object of moral perfection as he > portrayed himself before others. His perversity was of the spirit, not of > the letter, and thus escaped his own recognition. His indecency and > falsehood were in his soul, but not in his consciousness; so that he paraded > them at the very moment that he was claiming for himself all that was their > opposite. Hall was a convinced spiritualist.Morris, Hazel. (2002). Hand, Head and Heart: Samuel Carter Hall and The Art Journal. Michael Russell Publishing. pp. 129-130.

The countryside of Abad√≠n is dominated by a fertile valley, crossed by the rivers Ouro, Labrada, Abad√≠n, Pontiga, Santandrea, Pedrido, Anllo, Arnela, and Fraga Vella, and surrounded by mountains. They are the important sierras of Cordal de Neda, Toxoso, Tremoal, Couto da Cal, and A Fraga das Vigas, and the nearby mountains of Costa do Sol and O Picouto. ===Climate=== The mean annual temperature is about 10 ¬∞C. The rainfalls are high, 1799 mm./year. The winters are cold and rainy, and the summers are dry. Historically Abad√≠n has been linked to the Ancient Mondonedo Province (Ancient Galicia Kingdom) and the monastic sites of Meira or Lourenza Abbey. These religious and political centres have been related to the arrival by sea in the 5th-6th centuries of Britons from the British Isles (see Bishop Maeloc and Britonia) ===Orography=== The landscape of the municipality of Abad√≠n is configured inside a fertile valley crossed by several rivers and streams and surrounded by mountains. Morphologically there are two units: the first consists of a series of mountain ridges which include the Sierra de Carba in the west with the Pena da Agua (832 m), Sierra del Gistral in the northwest and the Sierra de Toxiza in the northeast with the Coto Cal (804 m). These elevations make up the northern edge of the Lugo plateau. The second unit constitutes the gently undulating, horizontal and morphological area of erosion which surfaces between 400 and 600 meters with the only elevation at Neda's Peak (796 meters) in the Cordal de Neda. The highest point is Lombo Peque√±o with an elevation of 1,027 meters in the Sierra del Gistral. == Demography == Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.7) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.7,0.9) ImageSize = width:580 height:300 PlotArea = left: 60 bottom: 30 top: 20 right: 20 DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:7000 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = late ScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:1000 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:500 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar: 1860 text: 1860 bar: 1877 text: 1877 bar: 1887 text: 1887 bar: 1900 text: 1900 bar: 1910 text: 1910 bar: 1920 text: 1920 bar: 1930 text: 1930 bar: 1940 text: 1940 bar: 1950 text: 1950 bar: 1960 text: 1960 bar: 1970 text: 1970 bar: 1980 text: 1980 bar: 1990 text: 1990 bar: 2000 text: 2000 bar: 2010 text: 2010 PlotData= color:barra width:20 align:center bar: 1860 from:5307 till: 0 bar: 1877 from:4201 till: 0 bar: 1887 from:4537 till: 0 bar: 1900 from:5005 till: 0 bar: 1910 from:5363 till: 0 bar: 1920 from:5413 till: 0 bar: 1930 from:5690 till: 0 bar: 1940 from:6049 till: 0 bar: 1950 from:6352 till: 0 bar: 1960 from:6129 till: 0 bar: 1970 from:5247 till: 0 bar: 1980 from:4881 till: 0 bar: 1990 from:3942 till: 0 bar: 2000 from:3432 till: 0 bar: 2010 from:2811 till: 0 PlotData= bar: 1860 at: 5307 fontsize:S text: 5.307 shift:(0,5) bar: 1877 at: 4201 fontsize:S text: 4.201 shift:(0,5) bar: 1887 at: 4537 fontsize:S text: 4.537 shift:(0,5) bar: 1900 at: 5005 fontsize:S text: 5.005 shift:(0,5) bar: 1910 at: 5363 fontsize:S text: 5.363 shift:(0,5) bar: 1920 at: 5413 fontsize:S text: 5.413 shift:(0,5) bar: 1930 at: 5690 fontsize:S text: 5.690 shift:(0,5) bar: 1940 at: 6049 fontsize:S text: 6.049 shift:(0,5) bar: 1950 at: 6352 fontsize:S text: 6.352 shift:(0,5) bar: 1960 at: 6129 fontsize:S text: 6.129 shift:(0,5) bar: 1970 at: 5247 fontsize:S text: 5.247 shift:(0,5) bar: 1980 at: 4881 fontsize:S text: 4.881 shift:(0,5) bar: 1990 at: 3942 fontsize:S text: 3.942 shift:(0,5) bar: 2000 at: 3432 fontsize:S text: 3.432 shift:(0,5) bar: 2010 at: 2811 fontsize:S text: 2.811 shift:(0,5) Found: INE Archiv ===Mountains=== *Porto das Egoas (631 m.), Arg√°n (585 m.), in the parish of Vilarente; *Fonte da Mesa (900 m.), Costa de Curr√°s (782 m.), in the parish of Montouto; *Arg√°n (585 m.), in the parish of Moncelos; *Lombopequeno (1.015 m.), R√≠o Pedrido (1.005 m.), Ladeiras do Seixobranco (962 m.), Airavella (961 m.), Salgueiri√±o (935 m.), Redondi√±o (916 m.), Pena da Cruz (831 m.), Mari√±as do Rial (821 m.), Coto da Cal (807 m.), Chao da Fonce (788 m.), Pena do Montrol (779 m.), Curro do Bispo (707 m.), Porto da Calzada Vella (670 m.), A Santa (600 m.), in the parish of Labrada; *Roza do Pleito (443 m.), Marco do Forneiro (440 m.), in the parish of Gra√±a; *Abelleira (617 m.), Go√°s (604 m.), Meix√≥n (474 m.), in the parish of Go√°s; *Rego de Bidueira (700 m.), Alto do Seixal (678 m.), Pena Grande (664 m.), in the parish of Galgao; *Pena da Auga (831 m.), Pena Labrada (803 m.) in the parish of Fanoi; *Sabugueiras (682 m.) e Arg√°n (585 m.) in the parish of Corvite. == References == :gl:Abad√≠n == External links == * The Mindoniensis-Ferrolensis Province in the 21st Century (Alternatives: The Britonia Province) (Archived 2009-10-24) auto Category:Municipalities in the Province of Lugo ","title":"Abad√≠n"},{"id":"1444960","text":"Lt Col Anderson Gray McKendrick DSc FRSE (8 September 1876 ‚Äì 30 May 1943) was a Scottish military physician and epidemiologist who pioneered the use of mathematical methods in epidemiology. Irwin (see below) commented on the quality of his work, \\"Although an amateur, he was a brilliant mathematician, with a far greater insight than many professionals.\\" ==Life== McKendrick was born at 2 Chester StreetEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1876-77 in Edinburgh the fifth and last child of John Gray McKendrick FRS, a distinguished physiologist, and his wife, Mary Souttar. His older brother was John Souttar McKendrick FRSE (1874-1946). He was educated at Kelvinside Academy then trained as a doctor at the University of Glasgow qualifying MB ChB in 1900. He then was commissioned in the British Army and joined the Indian Medical Service. At the rank of Lt Colonel he led an expedition into Somaliland in 1903/4 as part of what was then known as the Dervish Wars. He later worked with Ronald Ross and eventually would continue his work on mathematical epidemiology. His primary interest was in research and he was director of the Pasteur Institute at Kasauli in the Punjab 1914‚Äì1920. He was invalided home to Britain in 1920 and settled in Edinburgh where he became Superintendent of the Laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He held this post for the rest of his life. McKendrick's career as a mathematical epidemiologist began in India. In 1911, McKendrick rediscovered the logistic equation and fit it to bacterial growth data. In 1912 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Oliver, Diarmid Noel Paton, Ralph Stockman and Cargill Gilston Knott. He served as the Society's Vice President 1933-36. In 1914 he published a paper in which he gave equations for the pure birth process and a particular birth- death process. In 1924 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. After his return to Scotland he published more. His 1926 paper, 'Applications of mathematics to medical problems' was particularly impressive, including the widely used McKendrick‚ÄìVon Foerster partial differential equation : \\\\frac{\\\\partial n}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial n}{\\\\partial a} = - \\\\mu(t,a) n. Some of this paper's other results for stochastic models of epidemics and population growth were rediscovered by William Feller in 1939. Feller remarks in his Introduction to the Theory of Probability and Its Applications (3rd edition p. 450), \\"It is unfortunate that this remarkable paper passed practically unnoticed.\\" In 1927 McKendrick began a collaboration with William Ogilvy Kermack (1898‚Äì1970) which produced a notable series of papers on the Kermack‚ÄìMcKendrick theory, a general theory of infectious disease transmission. W. M. Hirsch gives this picture of the man: \\"McKendrick was a truly Christian gentleman, a tall and handsome man, brilliant in mind, kind and modest in person, a skilful counsellor and administrator who gave of himself and knew how to enable others.\\" ==Selected works== * A.

As a global missions agency, TEAM partners with the global church in sending disciples who make disciples and establish missional churches to the glory of God, going where the most people have the most need and proclaiming the gospel in both word and action. Founded more than 130 years ago, TEAM partners with churches to send missionaries to work in evangelism, church planting, community development, healthcare, education, social justice, business as mission and many other areas of global missions. ==History== TEAM was founded on October 14, 1890, by Rev. Fredrik Franson (as the Scandinavian Alliance Mission, or S.A.M.). Early missionaries pioneered in China, Japan, South Africa, Mongolia, India and South America. Following Franson‚Äôs death in 1908, the mission continued to expand into Latin America and thrive in Africa and Asia. Following World War II, the ministry grew rapidly as wartime experiences fueled passions to serve overseas and provided new missionaries with the skills to do it. In 1949, the Scandinavian Alliance Mission changed its name to become The Evangelical Alliance Mission, or TEAM, a better reflection of its broad scope of ministries and missionaries. In the decades following, TEAM opened major initiatives in the Arab world, and developed specialized ministries such as hospitals, Bible institutes, orphanages, publications, linguistic work, and children‚Äôs education to support its overall mission of church planting. TEAM grew both organically and through mergers with other missions, and by the beginning of the 21st Century had also renewed its focus on ‚Äúpost-Christian‚Äù regions of Europe and Central America. TEAM workers celebrated as the mission‚Äôs vision came full-circle when they began working for the first time in Sweden, homeland of founder Fredrik Franson. Today, in a rapidly changing missions context both in the United States and abroad, TEAM and its network of over 2,000 churches continues to explore new fields for missionary work and innovative new ways to serve. Today, more than 575 TEAM missionaries and staff serve in more than 40 countries. ==Purpose== TEAM's mission is to partner with the Global Church in sending disciples who make disciples and establish missional churches to the glory of God. TEAM is an evangelical mission agency which, in alliance with churches around the world, has planted and established Bible-believing congregations on every continent. TEAM personnel contribute to this goal as they live out their faith through many avenues, including education, media and literature, relief and development and health-care. ==External links== Official site of The Evangelical Alliance Mission Official site for The TEAM Blog TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance Mission) TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance Mission) ","title":"TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance Mission)"},{"id":"1444969","text":" USS Pulaski County (LST-1088) was a of the United States Navy, named for seven counties in the United States. ==Construction== LST-1088 was laid down by the American Bridge Company of Ambridge, Pennsylvania, on 16 December 1944. The ship was launched on 11 February 1945, sponsored by Mrs. A. J. Paddock; and commissioned at Algiers, Louisiana, on 27 March 1945, with Lieutenant Sheldon Potter III in command. ==Service history== ===World War II, 1945-1946=== After shakedown off Florida, LST-1088 departed the Gulf Coast on 6 May for the Pacific. She put into Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, Guam, Saipan, Manila, and Lingayen Gulf before landing occupation troops at Wakayama, Honsh≈´, Japan on 28 October. She subsequently carried troops and cargo to Okinawa, Sasebo, Saipan, Pearl Harbor, and San Francisco, arriving there on 19 January 1946. In March she sailed for Portland, Oregon where she underwent pre-inactivation overhaul, was decommissioned on 29 August 1946, and berthed with the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. On 1 July 1955, LST-1088 was named USS Pulaski County (LST-1088). In 1961 Pulaski County was moved to the Reserve Group at Bremerton, Washington. ===1963-1967=== On 21 May 1963, she recommissioned and was assigned to Reserve LST Squadron 2 homeported in Little Creek, Virginia. The ship underwent refresher training at San Diego from 17 June to 2 July, then sailed on 20 July via the Panama Canal for Little Creek, arriving on 22 August. In January and February 1964, Pulaski County transported obsolete ammunition from the Naval Ammunition Depot Earle, Monmouth County, New Jersey, for disposal at sea. She then operated along the east coast from Florida to New York, and provided training services for the Army at Little Creek. In late February 1965 Pulaski County supported a Project Gemini space flight. From 22 May through 25 August she supported Army troops during the Dominican Republic operations. In early 1966 Pulaski County deployed from Little Creek to the Pacific via the Panama Canal. She spent most of the year in the western Pacific, particularly off South Vietnam, but also making port calls at Okinawa and Japan. Her main duty was transporting cargo to Vietnam. She continued to operate in Vietnam and the Far East in early 1967. LST 1088 served in the Mekong Delta giving supplies to various stops including posts at C·∫ßn Th∆° and M·ªπ Tho as well as support for Patrol Boat Rivers on the river. In July 1967 she was transferred to Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), and was redesignated USNS Pulaski County (T-LST-1088). She served with MSTS into 1970. ==Disposal== Struck from the Navy List on 1 November 1973, Pulaski County was sold for scrapping on 1 January 1975 by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service. ==Awards== Pulaski County earned two battle stars for Vietnam War service. == References == * ==External links== * Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Cold War amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Vietnam War amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:United States Navy Arkansas-related ships Category:United States Navy Georgia-related ships Category:United States Navy Illinois-related ships Category:United States Navy Indiana-related ships Category:United States Navy Kentucky-related ships Category:United States Navy Missouri-related ships Category:United States Navy Virginia-related ships Category:Ships built in Ambridge, Pennsylvania Category:1945 ships Category:Pacific Reserve Fleet, Bremerton Group Category:Pacific Reserve Fleet, Astoria Group Category:Monuments and memorials to Casimir Pulaski ","title":"USS Pulaski County (LST-1088)"},{"id":"1444970","text":"Directional statistics (also circular statistics or spherical statistics) is the subdiscipline of statistics that deals with directions (unit vectors in Rn), axes (lines through the origin in Rn) or rotations in Rn. More generally, directional statistics deals with observations on compact Riemannian manifolds. The overall shape of a protein can be parameterized as a sequence of points on the unit sphere. Shown are two views of the spherical histogram of such points for a large collection of protein structures. The statistical treatment of such data is in the realm of directional statistics. The fact that 0 degrees and 360 degrees are identical angles, so that for example 180 degrees is not a sensible mean of 2 degrees and 358 degrees, provides one illustration that special statistical methods are required for the analysis of some types of data (in this case, angular data). Other examples of data that may be regarded as directional include statistics involving temporal periods (e.g. time of day, week, month, year, etc.), compass directions, dihedral angles in molecules, orientations, rotations and so on. ==Circular and higher- dimensional distributions== Any probability density function (pdf) p(x) on the line can be \\"wrapped\\" around the circumference of a circle of unit radius.Bahlmann, C., (2006), Directional features in online handwriting recognition, Pattern Recognition, 39 That is, the pdf of the wrapped variable : \\\\theta = x_w=x \\\\bmod 2\\\\pi\\\\ \\\\ \\\\in (-\\\\pi,\\\\pi] is : p_w(\\\\theta)=\\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}{p(\\\\theta+2\\\\pi k)}. This concept can be extended to the multivariate context by an extension of the simple sum to a number of F sums that cover all dimensions in the feature space: : p_w(\\\\vec\\\\theta)=\\\\sum_{k_1=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\cdots \\\\sum_{k_F=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty{p(\\\\vec\\\\theta+2\\\\pi k_1\\\\mathbf{e}_1+\\\\dots+2\\\\pi k_F\\\\mathbf{e}_F)} where \\\\mathbf{e}_k=(0,\\\\dots,0,1,0,\\\\dots,0)^{\\\\mathsf{T}} is the kth Euclidean basis vector. The following sections show some relevant circular distributions. ===von Mises circular distribution=== The von Mises distribution is a circular distribution which, like any other circular distribution, may be thought of as a wrapping of a certain linear probability distribution around the circle. The underlying linear probability distribution for the von Mises distribution is mathematically intractable; however, for statistical purposes, there is no need to deal with the underlying linear distribution. The usefulness of the von Mises distribution is twofold: it is the most mathematically tractable of all circular distributions, allowing simpler statistical analysis, and it is a close approximation to the wrapped normal distribution, which, analogously to the linear normal distribution, is important because it is the limiting case for the sum of a large number of small angular deviations. In fact, the von Mises distribution is often known as the \\"circular normal\\" distribution because of its ease of use and its close relationship to the wrapped normal distribution (Fisher, 1993). The pdf of the von Mises distribution is: ::f(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\kappa)=\\\\frac{e^{\\\\kappa\\\\cos(\\\\theta-\\\\mu)}}{2\\\\pi I_0(\\\\kappa)} where I_0 is the modified Bessel function of order 0. ===Circular uniform distribution=== The probability density function (pdf) of the circular uniform distribution is given by ::U(\\\\theta)=1/(2\\\\pi).\\\\, It can also be thought of as \\\\kappa = 0 of the von Mises above. ===Wrapped normal distribution=== The pdf of the wrapped normal distribution (WN) is: :: WN(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{k=-\\\\infty} \\\\exp \\\\left[\\\\frac{-(\\\\theta - \\\\mu - 2\\\\pi k)^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2} \\\\right]=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\vartheta\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta-\\\\mu}{2\\\\pi},\\\\frac{i\\\\sigma^2}{2\\\\pi}\\\\right) :where Œº and œÉ are the mean and standard deviation of the unwrapped distribution, respectively and \\\\vartheta(\\\\theta,\\\\tau) is the Jacobi theta function: :: \\\\vartheta(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)=\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty (w^2)^n q^{n^2} where w \\\\equiv e^{i\\\\pi \\\\theta} and q \\\\equiv e^{i\\\\pi\\\\tau}. ===Wrapped Cauchy distribution=== The pdf of the wrapped Cauchy distribution (WC) is: :: WC(\\\\theta;\\\\theta_0,\\\\gamma)=\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\pi(\\\\gamma^2+(\\\\theta+2\\\\pi n-\\\\theta_0)^2)} =\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sinh\\\\gamma}{\\\\cosh\\\\gamma-\\\\cos(\\\\theta-\\\\theta_0)} :where \\\\gamma is the scale factor and \\\\theta_0 is the peak position. ===Wrapped L√©vy distribution=== The pdf of the wrapped L√©vy distribution (WL) is: :: f_{WL}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,c)=\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{c}{2\\\\pi}}\\\\,\\\\frac{e^{-c/2(\\\\theta+2\\\\pi n-\\\\mu)}}{(\\\\theta+2\\\\pi n-\\\\mu)^{3/2}} where the value of the summand is taken to be zero when \\\\theta+2\\\\pi n-\\\\mu \\\\le 0, c is the scale factor and \\\\mu is the location parameter. ==Distributions on higher-dimensional manifolds== Three points sets sampled from different Kent distributions on the sphere. There also exist distributions on the two-dimensional sphere (such as the Kent distributionKent, J (1982) The Fisher‚ÄìBingham distribution on the sphere. J Royal Stat Soc, 44, 71‚Äì80.), the N-dimensional sphere (the von Mises‚ÄìFisher distributionFisher, RA (1953) Dispersion on a sphere. Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A., 217, 295‚Äì305) or the torus (the bivariate von Mises distribution). The matrix von Mises‚ÄìFisher distribution is a distribution on the Stiefel manifold, and can be used to construct probability distributions over rotation matrices. The Bingham distribution is a distribution over axes in N dimensions, or equivalently, over points on the (N ‚àí 1)-dimensional sphere with the antipodes identified. For example, if N = 2, the axes are undirected lines through the origin in the plane. In this case, each axis cuts the unit circle in the plane (which is the one-dimensional sphere) at two points that are each other's antipodes. For N = 4, the Bingham distribution is a distribution over the space of unit quaternions. Since a unit quaternion corresponds to a rotation matrix, the Bingham distribution for N = 4 can be used to construct probability distributions over the space of rotations, just like the Matrix-von Mises‚ÄìFisher distribution. These distributions are for example used in geology, crystallography and bioinformatics. Kent, J.T., Hamelryck, T. (2005). Using the Fisher‚ÄìBingham distribution in stochastic models for protein structure. In S. Barber, P.D. Baxter, K.V.Mardia, & R.E. Walls (Eds.), Quantitative Biology, Shape Analysis, and Wavelets, pp. 57‚Äì60. Leeds, Leeds University Press == Moments == The raw vector (or trigonometric) moments of a circular distribution are defined as : m_n=\\\\operatorname E(z^n)=\\\\int_\\\\Gamma P(\\\\theta) z^n \\\\, d\\\\theta where \\\\Gamma is any interval of length 2\\\\pi, P(\\\\theta) is the PDF of the circular distribution, and z=e^{i \\\\theta}. Since the integral P(\\\\theta) is unity, and the integration interval is finite, it follows that the moments of any circular distribution are always finite and well defined. Sample moments are analogously defined: : \\\\overline{m}_n=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N z_i^n. The population resultant vector, length, and mean angle are defined in analogy with the corresponding sample parameters. : \\\\rho=m_1 : R=m_1 : \\\\theta_n=\\\\operatorname{Arg}(m_n). In addition, the lengths of the higher moments are defined as: : R_n=m_n while the angular parts of the higher moments are just (n \\\\theta_n) \\\\bmod 2\\\\pi. The lengths of all moments will lie between 0 and 1. == Measures of location and spread == Various measures of location and spread may be defined for both the population and a sample drawn from that population.Fisher, NI., Statistical Analysis of Circular Data, Cambridge University Press, 1993. The most common measure of location is the circular mean. The population circular mean is simply the first moment of the distribution while the sample mean is the first moment of the sample. The sample mean will serve as an unbiased estimator of the population mean. When data is concentrated, the median and mode may be defined by analogy to the linear case, but for more dispersed or multi-modal data, these concepts are not useful. The most common measures of circular spread are: * The '. For the sample the circular variance is defined as: :: \\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{Var}(z)}=1-\\\\overline{R}\\\\, :and for the population :: \\\\operatorname{Var}(z)=1-R\\\\, :Both will have values between 0 and 1. * The '''''' :: S(z)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\ln(1/R^2)}=\\\\sqrt{-2\\\\ln(R)}\\\\, :: \\\\overline{S}(z)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\ln(1/{\\\\overline{R}}^2)}=\\\\sqrt{-2\\\\ln({\\\\overline{R}})}\\\\, :with values between 0 and infinity. This definition of the standard deviation (rather than the square root of the variance) is useful because for a wrapped normal distribution, it is an estimator of the standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution. It will therefore allow the circular distribution to be standardized as in the linear case, for small values of the standard deviation. This also applies to the von Mises distribution which closely approximates the wrapped normal distribution.

This measure of spread is found useful in the statistical analysis of variance. == Distribution of the mean == Given a set of N measurements z_n=e^{i\\\\theta_n} the mean value of z is defined as: : \\\\overline{z}=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N z_n which may be expressed as : \\\\overline{z} = \\\\overline{C}+i\\\\overline{S} where : \\\\overline{C} = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\cos(\\\\theta_n) \\\\text{ and } \\\\overline{S} = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\sin(\\\\theta_n) or, alternatively as: : \\\\overline{z} = \\\\overline{R}e^{i\\\\overline{\\\\theta}} where : \\\\overline{R} = \\\\sqrt{{\\\\overline{C}}^2+{\\\\overline{S}}^2} \\\\text{ and } \\\\overline{\\\\theta} = \\\\arctan (\\\\overline{S}, \\\\overline{C}).

The calculation of the distribution of the mean for most circular distributions is not analytically possible, and in order to carry out an analysis of variance, numerical or mathematical approximations are needed. The central limit theorem may be applied to the distribution of the sample means. (main article: Central limit theorem for directional statistics).

It is a neighborhood in New York City primarily populated by mutants, first seen during Grant Morrison's run on the series New X-Men in New X-Men #127. The ghetto was established in Alphabet City, ManhattanNew X-Men #127 (also known as Loisaida), a neighborhood in the East Village (located between Avenues A to D, and between Houston and 14th Streets). This would fall within New York's 12th congressional district and the New York City Council's 2nd district. According to the front cover of X-Factor #31, it had a population of 743, having been much reduced by the Decimation. District X also refers to a comic book series about the neighborhood and its inhabitants. Written by David Hine, the series was a police procedural, starring Bishop and Ismael Ortega, who investigated crimes committed by and against the ghetto's mutant residents. The series also explored Ortega's complicated personal relationships and gradual descent into drug abuse and adultery. It ran as District X for 14 monthly issues beginning in May 2004, then as Mutopia X as part of the crossover House of M event for five monthly issues beginning in July 2005. ==District X: The area== Alphabet City, identified as the location of Mutant Town in New X-Men #127. The rise in Manhattan's mutant population, coupled with racism among normal humans, led to mutants forming their own community in Manhattan's Lower East Side (described as the fictional 'Middle East Side' in Peter David's X-Factor). Although humans lived in this neighborhood, they formed a minority. NYX established that District X is an official title for the region. The neighborhood was poor, overcrowded and violent, with a high crime rate and warring mutant gangs. Most of the residents regarded it as a ghetto. It was described in District X as having the \\"highest unemployment rate in the USA, the highest rate of illiteracy and the highest severe overcrowding outside of Los Angeles\\", even though New York City as a whole had seen a decrease in violent crime. (These figures would suggest a large population.) It also had the highest crime rates in the country for narcotics, prostitution, and burglary. Many of its inhabitants had mutations more akin to curses than gifts, further exacerbating the neighborhood's poverty and disadvantage. It also had a large 'underground' population, inhabiting tunnels beneath the neighborhood and living in homeless squalor. Many residents were immigrants, such as Bosnian immigrant Dzemal. In X-Men Unlimited #2, Bishop noted that \\"there are mutants in District X from every nation on Earth. Every race, religion and culture.\\" Margaret O'Connell, writing for Sequential Tart, describes District X as \\"the mutant ghetto of the Marvel Universe version of New York City\\", and as \\"a slum where minor-league mutants from all over the globe ‚Äì often more visibly handicapped or disfigured by their genetic abnormalities than the relatively glamorous and outwardly normal X-Men ‚Äì have congregated in a disaffected and varyingly dysfunctional clump.\\" There were also a range of mutant-owned businesses, clubs and restaurants, as well as a burgeoning mutant subculture. Bands such as 'Sentinel Bait' and 'Juggernauts' were mentioned as parts of this subculture, while mutant fashion designers like Jumbo Carnation and nightclubs such as Daniel's Inferno created a vibrant, mutant-oriented nightlife. In this respect, District X may be considered a Marvel Universe analogue to Harlem, the Meatpacking District, or Little Italy, as a cultural center, 'ethnic' enclave and population hub for a disenfranchised minority. Grant Morrison's creation of an analogy to an ethnic ghetto has been praised, with J. Caleb Mozzocco noting that \\"[i]f the mutants were always being likened to oppressed ethnic groups and minorities, then why not treat them like a real ethnic group, complete with mutant language, styles, culture and a \\"Mutant Town\\" in New York City?\\" David Brothers, writing for 4thletter!, notes that: > Morrison turned mutants into a subculture, a logical extension of what > happens when new elements are introduced into society. They were still > oppressed, but they actually had some kind of culture to go along with their > oppression. He gave them their own Chinatown, their own Little Italy, and > made it a point to show that mutants, while not entirely accepted just yet, > were more than just mutant paramilitary teams. During the House of M storyline, the district was transformed into a rich, exclusively mutant neighborhood named Mutopia X (during the same storyline, Hell's Kitchen was transformed into a human ghetto called Sapien Town). After this story, the residents suffered the 'Decimation', with most of them stripped of their mutant abilities. Many remaining mutants were moved to a relocation camp on the grounds of the Xavier Institute. Some former mutants remained in District X, with many ‚Äî like Quicksilver and Rictor ‚Äì suffering from depression and alienation. After the Decimation, the district became known as the (fictional) 'Middle East Side', losing many of its distinctive characteristics. The area became increasingly depopulated as former mutants sought to live normal lives. In X-Factor, anti-mutant riots gripped the district after the Decimation, with agents of the human supremacist group Purity roaming the area in X-Men: The 198. In Peter David's X-Factor (vol.3), The former ghetto was the base of operations for X-Factor Investigations, who frequently dealt with the aftermath of the Decimation and its effects on the local community. In the Civil War storyline, Jamie Madrox and his team declared 'Mutant Town' as a sanctuary for superheroes being pursued by the government. This brought them into conflict with the regular X-Men team, who eventually allowed them to have their way. The former 'Mutant Town' was later besieged by X-Cell, a terrorist group composed of former mutants who blamed the United States government for the loss of their powers. After the events of X-Men: Messiah Complex, the neighborhood was briefly taken over by Arcade, working for an ex-Purifier, Taylor. Mutant Town was completely destroyed in X-Factor #31, 'The Middle East Side is Burning', as a 'back-up' plan by Arcade following his defeat. A series of explosions incinerated much of the neighborhood, with Arcade's force fields preventing fire fighters from entering the area until the entire district had been utterly annihilated. In X-Factor #32, Valerie Cooper announced that the ruins would be demolished and replaced with suburban housing, and that \\"in a few decades, no one will even know that this used to be called Mutant Town\\". ==District X: The series== District X was a comic book series published by Marvel Comics. A police procedural, it was set in 'Mutant Town'. The series starred the X-Man and FBI agent Lucas Bishop, assigned to the ghetto to investigate rising crime rates among the population in New York's (fictional) '11th Precinct' in Alphabet City. Bishop works with NYPD patrolman Ismael Ortega, an ordinary human married to a mutant (Armena Ortega). A major subplot concerned Ismael's relationship with his family, with the stresses of his job adversely affecting his home life. ===Publication history=== The series was part of the Marvel Knights imprint. It started in X-Men Unlimited v2 #2 and then ran for fourteen issues from July 2004 to August 2005. It briefly changed title to Mutopia X for five issues, between September 2005 and January 2006, before its cancellation. The series was written by British writer David Hine, who previously worked on the Mambo series for 2000 AD. It was originally drawn by Australian artist David Yardin, followed by Filipino artist Lan Medina. The series was mostly inked by Filipino artist Alejandro \\"Boy\\" Sicat. All artists involved worked with Brian Haberlin's Avalon Studios during the series' publication. During the House of M crossover, the series was replaced by the miniseries Mutopia X. Hine continued some of the series' plot points in X-Men: The 198 miniseries. ===Plot===  Mr. M (#1‚Äì6)  Officers Gus Kucharsky and Ismael Ortega are assigned to New York's 11th Precinct, commonly known as District X or 'Mutant Town'. While investigating allegations that Jake Costanza is holding his mutant wife against her will and abusing her, Kucharsky falls under Mrs. Costanza's mutant mental powers and kills them both, before attempting to take his own life. Gus survives and Ortega covers for him. Gus is forced to retire early and Izzy is assigned to serve as the liaison to federal agent, Lucas Bishop. Violence erupts between rival crime lords \\"Shaky\\" Kaufman and \\"Filthy Frankie\\" Zapruder over a mutant, Toad Boy, and the addictive narcotic he produces (known as 'Toad Juice'). When Kaufman learns of the lucrative sales of 'Toad Juice' in District X, he raids Zapruder's facilities and kidnaps the Toad Boy for himself. However, it is unknown that Toad Juice can be fatal to normal humans; a theft of the drug leads to the death of over a dozen human teenagers. After the death of a human patron at the nightclub Daniel's Inferno caused by exposure to Toad Juice, the police begin a desperate investigation before other unsuspecting addicts face the same fate. This prompts a turf war between Zapruder and Kaufman. Both men are eventually arrested. When Absolom Mercator finally decides to use his powers to try to help others, his efforts backfire and he suffers an intense identity crisis. Believing that he must use his powers to destroy Mutant Town, Mercator warns his friend, Hanna Levy so that she can escape safely. The police intervene and use Lara the Illusionist to show Mr. M the devastation he could unleash. This snaps the mutant back to his senses and he willingly returns to his peaceful life of quiet isolation after a short period in jail. Underworld (#7‚Äì12) A series of brutal murders followed by a mysterious blackout leads to an investigation of the growing underground mutant community, called the Tunnel Rats. Calling themselves \\"Those Who Live in Darkness\\", the tunnelers claim responsibility for the blackout and state that they want the city to leave them alone. In recent months, police and social services have put pressure on the Tunnel Rats by destroying their homes and remanding their children into state custody. Tensions with the Tunnel Rats come to a head just as Bishop and Officer Ortega manage to track down The Worm, a hideously mutated young man who is seeking revenge for being cast out by his parents. Bishop convinces many of the Tunnel Rats to rejoin surface society but a small band decides to dwell deeper in the tunnels under Mutant Town. Their journey is cut short by The Worm who massacres them all before being stopped by Bishop and Ortega, who kills him. One of Us (#13‚Äì14) William \\"Billy\\" Bates discovers that he is a mutant, calling himself \\"The Porcupine\\", and becomes a frequent patron at the Caf√© Des Artistes. He falls in love with the Caf√©'s waitress, Sylvie Lauziere. When a group of anti-mutant humans start harassing her, Billy steps in and inadvertently kills several humans with his emerging powers. He barricades himself in the Caf√© with Sylvie, which the authorities perceive as a hostage situation. In order to hide the fact that a mutant slaughtered several members of Purity, an anti- mutant movement, Alexei Vazhin orders hitwoman Sashenka Popova to kill the boy, and pays hush money to the Lauzieres to cover up the truth of the incident. Mutopia X (#1‚Äì5) The Scarlet Witch transforms the entire world into a mutant paradise ruled by her father Magneto. This shift in reality turns District X into \\"Mutopia X\\", the center of art and culture in the new mutant-dominated world. The denizens of District X find themselves in a newly elevated societal status. Lara the Illusionist is a movie star married to entertainment mogul, Daniel \\"Shaky\\" Kaufman. Absolon Mercator and Gregor Smerdyakov have founded the Center for Transformation and Illumination and are the center of a spiritual following as they help mutants achieve their genetic potential. Ishmael Ortega is tasked with protecting Mercator from assassination. After the Decimation, Ishmael Ortega's daughter dies. He attempts suicide, before reuniting with his family. ===Characters=== District X's large ensemble cast included: * A \\"mysterious stranger\\" called Mr. M (also the title of the first story-arc), who attempted to destroy District X out of sheer world-weariness but was stopped by Bishop and Ortega. * Two rival crime lords, \\"Filthy\\" Frankie Zapruder and Daniel \\"Shaky\\" Kaufman. * Gregor Smerdyakov, a mutant who puts down roots whenever he falls asleep. * Winston Hobbes, a large worm-like mutant who inhabits the District X sewer system. * Lara the Illusionist, a high-paid call-girl whose customers include 'a former President of the United States', capable of creating highly realistic illusions and fantasies. * Armena Ortega, wife of Ismael Ortega who generates a protective bubble when she sleeps. The district also possessed a large population of mutants whose mutations and/or personalities made them unsuitable for the flashier or more dangerous \\"super\\" life. These include: * A woman who can burst into flames but is not immune to being burnt. * A man whose sole power is that his skin is bright blue. * A woman who could control men with the sound of her voice (her husband kept her bound and gagged in their apartment because of this). * A boy who has large skin flaps under his arms. ===Reception=== In his review of issue #3, Paul O'Brien described the series as \\"one of the best things to come out of Reload\\". In his review of 2004, O'Brien noted that \\"[District X has] not been a complete creative success, but at least it's been trying\\". However, O'Brien was less favourable to later issues of the series; in his review of District X in 2005, he noted that \\"ultimately, District X feels like a case of potential never quite realised ‚Äì and not just because it got cut off by a change in the direction of the line\\". Comic Book Galaxy noted, with reference to the Mr. M arc (issues #1‚Äì6), that \\"the potential for an excellent book is evident\\". Comics Bulletin were highly favourable to the series, stating that \\"[i]t is a rare comic book that is able to breathe new life into a stale genre, and yet that is precisely what District X has managed to do... District X is more than just a traditional superhero comic, establishing itself as an entertaining blend of action, crime noir and social commentary\\". Writing for Sequential Tart, Margaret O'Connell praised the series as an \\"absorbing, well-crafted tale which effectively combines both crime and science fictional elements\\", comparing the series to George R. R. Martin's Wild Cards series, NYPD Blue, and DC Comics' Gotham Central. ==Collected editions== The series, both written by David Hine, was collected into two trade paperbacks: * Mr. M (collects District X #1‚Äì6, with pencils by David Yardin, Lan Medina and Mike Perkins, and inks by Alejandro Sicat, Avalon Studios and Drew Hennessy, 144 pages, January 2005, ) * Underground (collects District X #7‚Äì14 and the prologue from X-Men Unlimited #2, with art by Adi Granov, pencils by Lan Medina, and inks by Alejandro Sicat, 200 pages, October 2005, ) Mutopia X was collected into the trade paperback House of M: Mutopia X () and as part of the hardcover collection House of M, Vol 4: No More Mutants (). ==In other media== ===Video games=== * Mutant Town appears in Marvel Heroes. It gets founded after there is an increase of the mutant population in New York City, and the mutants felt a need for a place of their own. However, the city is under almost constant attack of the Purifiers who want to kill all its inhabitants. ==See also== * Asteroid M * Genosha ==ReferencesUncannyXmen.Net Category:2004 comics debuts Category:Marvel Comics titles Category:X-Men titles Category:Fictional neighborhoods ","title":"District X"},{"id":"1444981","text":"Micro process engineering is the science of conducting chemical or physical processes (unit operations) inside small volumina, typically inside channels with diameters of less than 1 mm (microchannels) or other structures with sub- millimeter dimensions. These processes are usually carried out in continuous flow mode, as opposed to batch production, allowing a throughput high enough to make micro process engineering a tool for chemical production. Micro process engineering is therefore not to be confused with microchemistry, which deals with very small overall quantities of matter. The subfield of micro process engineering that deals with chemical reactions, carried out in microstructured reactors or \\"microreactors\\", is also known as microreaction technology. The unique advantages of microstructured reactors or microreactors are enhanced heat transfer due to the large surface area-to-volume ratio, and enhanced mass transfer. For example, the length scale of diffusion processes is comparable to that of microchannels or even shorter, and efficient mixing of reactants can be achieved during very short times (typically milliseconds). The good heat transfer properties allow a precise temperature control of reactions. For example, highly exothermic reactions can be conducted almost isothermally when the microstructured reactor contains a second set of microchannels (\\"cooling passage\\"), fluidically separated from the reaction channels (\\"reaction passage\\"), through which a flow of cold fluid with sufficiently high heat capacity is maintained. It is also possible to change the temperature of microstructured reactors very rapidly to intentionally achieve a non-isothermal behaviour. ==Process intensification== While the dimensions of the individual channels are small, a micro process engineering device (\\"microstructured reactor\\") can contain many thousands of such channels, and the overall size of a microstructured reactor can be on the scale of meters. The objective of micro process engineering is not primarily to miniaturize production plants, but to increase yields and selectivities of chemical reactions, thus reducing the cost of chemical production. This goal can be achieved by either using chemical reactions that cannot be conducted in larger volumina, or by running chemical reactions at parameters (temperatures, pressures, concentrations) that are inaccessible in larger volumina due to safety constraints. For example, the detonation of the stoichiometric mixture of two volume unit of hydrogen gas and one volume unit of oxygen gas does not propagate in microchannels with a sufficiently small diameter. This property is referred to as the \\"intrinsic safety\\" of microstructured reactors. The improvement of yields and selectivities by using novel reactions or running reactions at more extreme parameters is known as \\"process intensification\\". ==History== Historically, micro process engineering originated around the 1980s, when mechanical micromachining methods developed for the fabrication of uranium isotope separation nozzles were first applied to the manufacturing of compact heat exchangers at the Karlsruhe (Nuclear) Research Center. ==See also== * Microreactor * Flow chemistry Category:Chemical process engineering Category:Microtechnology ","title":"Micro process engineering"},{"id":"1444983","text":"Yuen Long Nullah (ÂÖÉÊúóÊ∏†) is a nullah across western Yuen Long, Hong Kong.

While there, he witnesses the President of the United States and the billionaire's wife having sex. However, their lovemaking turns violent and Secret Service agents burst in and kill the woman, which Whitney also sees.

It was published by Nabokov‚Äôs his son Dmitri Nabokov in 2009, despite the author‚Äôs request that the work be destroyed upon his death. Commenters lambasted the quality of the writing and admonished Nabokov's executor for publishing the work in that state. == Plot == Based on discussions with unidentified scholars, The Times summarizes the plot as follows: > Philip Wild, an enormously corpulent scholar, is married to a slender, > flighty and wildly promiscuous woman called Flora. Flora initially appealed > to Wild because of another woman that he‚Äôd been in love with, Aurora Lee. > Death and what lies beyond it, a theme which fascinated Nabokov from a very > young age, are central.

It is not > clear how old Wild is, but he is preoccupied with his own death and sets > about obliterating himself from the toes upwards through meditation, a sort > of deliberate self-inflicted self-erasure. == Background == According to his diaries, Nabokov first noted his work on the project on December 1, 1974, under the title Dying Is Fun. By the summer of 1976, he noted that the story was completed in his mind, but by then his health was failing rapidly. When Nabokov died on July 2, 1977, he was still working on the novel, since retitled The Opposite of Laura and finally The Original of Laura. The incomplete manuscript consists of Nabokov's own handwriting across 138 index cards,Interview with Dmitri Nabokov on NPR ‚Äì April 30, 2008 https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90073521 the equivalent of about 30 manuscript pages.Vladimir Nabokov, A Bibliography of Criticism, by Dieter E. Zimmer with additions by Jeff Edmunds The use of index cards was normal for Nabokov, the basis of many of his works, such as Lolita and Pale Fire. == Executor's dilemma == Nabokov was a perfectionist and made it clear that, upon his death, any unfinished work was to be destroyed. Nabokov's wife, V√©ra, and their son, Dmitri, became his literary executors, but ultimately ignored his will, and did not destroy the manuscript. Dmitri noted that V√©ra Nabokov \\"failed to carry out this task, her procrastination due, 'to age, weakness and immeasurable love.'\\"Michiko Kakutani, \\"In a Sketchy Hall of Mirrors, Nabokov Jousts With Death and Reality\\", New York Times, November 10, 2009.

Salon Books Article. Retrieved January 29, 2005 Dmitri wavered on whether to destroy the manuscript. On the one hand, he felt bound to uphold his \\"filial duty\\" and grant his father's request, but he also said the novel \\"would have been a brilliant, original, and potentially totally radical book, in the literary sense very different from the rest of his oeuvre.\\" Dmitri noted \\"his father, ... or his 'father‚Äôs shade,' would not 'have opposed the release of ‚ÄòLaura‚Äô once ‚ÄòLaura‚Äô had survived the hum of time this long.'\\" Scholars and enthusiasts disagreed over whether the manuscript should be made public; as the (London) Times posed the question: \\"the demands of the literary world versus the posthumous rights of an author over his art.\\" The younger Nabokov remarked cryptically that one other person possessed a key to the manuscript, but did not say who that person was. Like Nabokov, many observers were on the fence about the disposition of the manuscript. The author Edmund White compared the author's last request to Virgil's request to destroy the Aeneid (ignored by Augustus Caesar) or Franz Kafka's request to destroy his papers (ignored by Max Brod). Nabokov weighed in on Nikolai Gogol's decision to burn the sequels to Dead Souls. The journalist Ron Rosenbaum, who corresponded with Dmitri Nabokov, said that the son had been inclined toward destroying the manuscript, swayed by criticism of his father, such as allegations of plagiarism that arose from the discovery of a 1916 German short story, \\"Lolita\\" with some similarities to Nabokov's work, or critics who had interpreted Nabokov's work as suggesting that Nabokov was sexually abused. In April 2008 Dmitri Nabokov told many publications, including Nabokov Online Journal and Der Spiegel, that he intended to publish the manuscript after all.Van Gelder, Lawrence. \\"Son Plans to Publish Nabokov's Last Novel\\". The New York Times, April 28, 2008. Retrieved April 29, 2008. In the Nabokov Online Journal interview with Suellen Stringer-Hye, Nabokov stated that he had never seriously considered burning the manuscript. Once Dmitri decided to publish the manuscript, \\"several short excerpts were published in advance - in the Sunday Times Magazine and also Playboy, to which Nabokov was a contributor.\\" BBC Newsnight predicted that the novel's publication was \\"likely to be the literary event of 2009.\\" == Publication of excerpts == In the late 1990s Dmitri Nabokov read a portion of the book to a group of about 20 scholars at a centenary celebration of his father at Cornell University. The scholars Brian Boyd and Lara Delage-Toriel claim to have read the manuscript. In 1999 two passages from The Original of Laura were published in The Nabokovian, a scholarly publication devoted to Nabokov. Zoran Kuzmanovich, a scholar of Nabokov, said of passages he heard at Cornell University, \\"It sounds as though the story is about aging but holding onto the original love of one's life.\\" The German weekly Die Zeit in its 14 August 2008 issue reproduced some of Nabokov's original index cards which had been obtained by journalist Malte Herwig. In the accompanying article, Herwig concluded that \\"Laura\\", although fragmentary, was \\"vintage Nabokov\\".Malte Herwig, \\"Vladimir Nabokov: Sein letztes Spiel\\", Die Zeit, 14 August 2008. According to a 2006 account of the book by Lara Delage-Toriel, the narrator and protagonist of Nabokov's book receives a novel titled My Laura from a painter. The narrator realizes that the novel is in fact about his own wife Flora, whom the painter had once pursued. In this novel within the novel, Laura is \\"destroyed\\" by the narrator (the \\"I\\" of the book). Delage-Toriel also notes that the names of Laura and Flora, possibly refer to well-known High Renaissance portraits of women by Titian and Giorgione, both evoking the Italian sonneteer Petrarch's unconsummated obsession with a woman named Laura. According to Delage-Toriel, the meaning of \\"the Original\\" is unclear: > Does it refer to the mistress of the ‚ÄúI,‚Äù the Laura of My Laura, or to the > probable mistress of this novel‚Äôs author, the Flora of The Original of > Laura? The manuscript‚Äôs playful juxtapositions obviously incite the reader > to fuse both ‚Äòoriginals‚Äô into a single original, a gesture which Nabokov > graphically performs in ‚Äòchapter‚Äô 5, by contriving an amusing hybrid, > ‚ÄòFlaura‚Äô. On close observation of the manuscript, one notices that the name > contains in fact two capital letters, ‚ÄòF‚Äô and ‚ÄòL‚Äô, as though Nabokov had > been loath to give precedence to either name and had instead opted for some > typographical monster, a bicephalous cipher of sorts. The Original of Laura was the subject of a 1998 literary prank which capitalized on its cachet as a mysterious \\"lost work\\" of a renowned author. Jeff Edmunds, a Pennsylvania State University employee and editor of the Nabokov website Zembla, posted an essay on his site entitled \\"The Original of Laura: A First Look at Nabokov's Last Novel\\". The essay, supposedly written by a Swiss scholar named Michel Desommelier, included concocted passages from Laura that fooled scholars and even Dmitri Nabokov. Edmunds then worked with Nabokov's Russian translator, Sergei Il'in, to publish the fake passages in Russian literary journals. == Content == Laura, painted 1506 by Giorgione Flora, painted 1515 by Titian John Banville called the published volume, designed by Chip Kidd, \\"a triumph of the book maker's art\\". The pages are gray and heavy. Each one comprises a reproduction of an index card above and a printed version of the card below. The photographs of the cards are perforated so the reader can take them out and rearrange them. Banville considered the perforations \\"dubious\\", and a review in the Washington Times called it \\"little more than gimmick\\" that \\"would surely have disgusted the author\\", but a review in the Cornell Daily Sun called the format \\"ingenious\\". The book also includes an introduction by Dmitri Nabokov about the writing of the book and his decision to publish it. == Literary significance and reception == A review of the German translation in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung compared the fragment to a \\"labyrinthine, overgrown garden without a gazebo in its center\\" and \\"a puzzle with too many missing pieces\\". Alexander Theroux's review of the book in The Wall Street Journal criticized the publication as an exemplar of a writer who has lost his literary powers except for a few hints and \\"witty Nabokovian moments\\", comparing the Nabokov of Laura to Lou Gehrig in 1939.\\"In the Cards, A Last Hand.\\" Wall Street Journal, 13 November 2009, A21. Martin Amis echoed this sentiment somewhat more directly in his review in The Guardian, \\"When a writer starts to come off the rails, you expect skidmarks and broken glass; with Nabokov, naturally, the eruption is on the scale of a nuclear accident.\\" Theroux concluded, \\"The last card of The Original of Laura is a poignant list of synonyms for 'efface'‚Äîexpunge, erase, delete, rub out, wipe out, obliterate ... it is a pity that his instructions were ignored and the novel survived in such a form. English professors may assign The Original of Laura to their students someday, but it is really better suited to a college ethics class.\\" He was not the only reviewer to suggest that the fragments should not have been published or should not be read. However, a reviewer in New York Magazine was glad to have the book; he enjoyed reading it and enjoyed the opportunity to see Nabokov's work \\"rough\\". A reviewer in the Christian Science Monitor said the book was \\"filled with sly wit and memorable images\\" and considered the publication of it \\"a generous gift to readers\\". Writing for Literary Review, David Lodge asks, \\"Is it, as the blurb claims, Nabokov's 'final great book'? No. Does it contain brilliant, funny, astonishing sentences only Nabokov could have written? Yes. Should it have been preserved and published? Definitely.\\" Few reviewers commented on the introduction, but at least two criticized it harshly. == See also == *List of works published posthumously == References == == External links == * Kirschbaum, Alexis. \\"The inside story of Nabokov's last work\\".

NATO assigned the missile the reporting name SS-N-6 Serb. In the USSR, it was given the GRAU index 4K10. It was a liquid fuel rocket using a hypergolic combination of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as fuel, and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) as oxidizer. Between 1974 and 1990, 161 missile launches were conducted, with an average success rate of 93%.USSR R-27 missile Total production was 1800 missiles. The R-27Korabli VMF SSSR, Vol. 1, Part 1, Yu.

The missile was a two-stage development of the single-stage R-27, the second stage containing the warhead as well as propulsion and terminal guidance. Initial submarine testing began on 9 December 1972 on board the K-102, a project 605 class submarine, a modified Project 629/ NATO Golf class lengthened 17.1m (formerly B-121), to accommodate four launch tubes as well as the Rekord-2 fire control system, the Kasatka B-605 Target acquisition system and various improvements to the navigation and communications systems. Initial trials ended on 18 December 1972 because the Rekord-2 fire control system hadn't been delivered yet. After a number of delays caused by several malfunctions, test firings were finally carried out between 11 September and 4 December 1973. Following the initial trials, the K-102 continued making trial launches with both the R-27 and the R-27K, until it was accepted for service on 15 August 1975. Using external targeting data, the R-27K/SS-NX-13 would have been launched underwater to a range of between 350-400 nm (650‚Äì740 km), covering a \\"footprint\\" of 27 nm (50 km). The Maneuvering Re-Entry vehicle (MaRV) would then home in on the target with a CEP of . Warhead yield was between 0.5-1 Mt. The missile system never became operational, since every launch tube used for the R-27K counted as a strategic missile in the SALT agreement, and they were considered more important. Although the R-27K could fit in the launch tubes of the Project 667A (NATO Yankee class), the subs lacked the necessary equipment to target and fire the missile. == Operators == Map with R-27 Zyb operators in blue with former operators in red ; : The Soviet Navy was the only operator of the R-27. == See also == *Hwasong-10, based on the R-27 *Khorramshahr based on the Hwasong-10 == References == ==External links== *R-27 (Globalsecurity.org) R-027 ","title":"R-27 Zyb"},{"id":"1445025","text":"The IV Cavalry Brigade (Polish IV Brygada Kawalerii) was a unit of the Polish Army during the Polish-Bolshevik War and later in the inter-war period.

He was created by Simon Spurrier and artist Carl Critchlow. ==Overview== Ugly of temper and with a pair of claws surgically grafted onto his sides, Lobster Random was a genetically modified soldier, adapted to never need sleep or to feel pain. After being discharged from the military he found his talents lay in the art of torture, and hired out his services for any client who required information and wasn't squeamish about the methods employed to get it. \\"Lob\\" is a cranky old bald man with two huge lobster claws emerging from his back, and is part of a long tradition in 2000 AD giving their protagonists a distinctive visual appearance at odds with the comic book stereotype of square-jawed, good- looking action heroes. Lob's character is portrayed as extremely grumpy, cynical and sometimes psychotic (all resulting from both decades without sleep and his experiences during the time after his discharge from the military). Lob has also had his left arm amputated on three separate occasions (twice was this self-inflicted). The art, by Carl Critchlow, represented a departure from his older painted style and instead used a computer-based line drawing technique that he developed in his self-published Thrud the Barbarian. Lobster Random debuted in an eight-part adventure in 2003, entitled \\"No Gain, No Pain\\" (progs 1342-1349). A hardback collection of this 45-page story was released by Rebellion Developments for the European market in April 2005. The second series, \\"Tooth and Claw\\", ran for nine episodes (with a double-length finale), from progs 1411-1419 (October to December 2004). The third series was called \\"The Agony and the Ecstasy\\". ===\\"The Vort\\" and subsequently series=== Writing under the pseudonym G. Powell, Spurrier introduced a world called The Vort in its own standalone series. At the conclusion, it was revealed that one of the main characters was a hideously scarred Lobster Random. It was followed by the fourth series of Lobster Random entitled \\"The Forget-Me-Knot\\" starting in prog 1601 in 2008. ==Bibliography== The character has appeared in his own eponymous series, the first instalment now reprinted as a trade paperback by Rebellion Developments, and The Vort: *Lobster Random (by Simon Spurrier and Carl Critchlow): ** \\"No Gain, No Pain\\" (in 2000 AD #1342-1349, 2003, tpb, 48 pages, March 2005, ) ** \\"Tooth and Claw\\" (in 2000 AD #1411-1419, 2004) ** \\"The Agony & The Ecstasy\\" (in 2000 AD #1482-1490, 2006) ** \\"The Forget-Me-Knot\\" (in 2000 AD #1601-1610, 2008) *The Vort (by G.

This small iguana can reach and becomes mature at seven years and may live for twenty. A single clutch of up to nine eggs is laid each year, and these take three months to hatch. This iguana is mostly herbivorous, but supplements this by adding some animal matter to its diet. At one time numerous, these iguanas have been depleted by introduced predators, mainly cats and dogs. Their habitat is being degraded by overgrazing and trampling of vegetation which reduces the availability of food for the iguanas. They have been wiped out of some islands and cling on precariously in others. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated them as endangered. Various conservation efforts are being undertaken, and some iguanas have been relocated to uninhabited islets in an effort to prevent them from becoming extinct. ==Taxonomy== The Turks and Caicos rock iguana, Cyclura carinata carinata, was first described by American Zoologist Richard Harlan in Fauna Americana in 1825. Its specific name carinata means \\"keeled\\" and refers to the animal's scales. The species is endemic to 50-60 of the 200 islands and cays that make up the Turks and Caicos Islands. It has one subspecies which lives on Booby Cay, Bartsch's iguana (Cyclura carinata bartschi). Morphological and genetic data indicate that the closest living relative of C. carinata is C. ricordi of Hispaniola. ==Anatomy and morphology== Measuring less than in length when full grown, the Turks and Caicos Rock iguana is one of the smallest species of Cyclura. The lizard's basic color can range from green to brownish grey, usually patterned by darker markings. The species lacks the large scales on the upper surface of its head, characteristic of other species of cyclura and possesses larger dorsal spines than other species of iguana. Like other members of the genus Cyclura, males of this species are larger than females (in this case twice as large in body mass) and have larger dorsal crests and femoral pores on their thighs making the animals sexually dimorphic. ==Habitat and distribution== Turks and Caicos rock iguana The Turks and Caicos rock iguana inhabits small cays, but has been reduced to less than 5% of its original range largely due to the introduction of predators. 2,000 iguanas are the only land creatures that inhabit Little Water Cay. To promote tourism on Little Water Cay, a boardwalk has been built throughout the island. Tourists can take a tour of the island, along this boardwalk, but are not permitted to step off it. The Turks and Caicos rock iguana dwells in rocky areas and sandy habitats as sand is required for nesting. The Turks and Caicos iguana is diurnal and spends the night in the burrows it has dug or in natural retreats in or under the rocks. ==Diet and longevity== Like all Cyclura species, the Turks and Caicos rock iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 58 different plant species. This diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, mollusks, crustaceans, arachnids, lizards, and carrion. It has been noted that in captivity, it eats both animal and plant food. Gerber and Iverson write that the Turks and Caicos rock iguana may live at least 20 years. ==Mating== Adult males are sexually mature at seven years of age and are territorial throughout the year in order to guarantee access to food and females. Females only become territorial when defending their nest site upon laying eggs and for several weeks following. The animals mate in May, and the female lays a single clutch of two to nine eggs in June. The eggs hatch in September after a 90-day incubation period. ==Causes of decline== Like most Cyclura species the Turks and Caicos rock iguana is in decline. In this species' case it is primarily due to its small body size which makes it vulnerable to introduced predators such as dogs and cats. In the 1970s a population of 15,000 iguanas was completely destroyed within five years by a mere handful of dogs and cats brought to Pine Cay by hotel workers. Competitive grazing with domestic and feral livestock is a secondary factor. ==Conservation measures== Iguanas on Little Water Cay Although Little Water Cay is home to over 2,000 Turks and Caicos rock iguanas, they have been wiped out from the other cays in their former range. Little Water Cay is now a nature reserve and neither dogs nor cats are permitted on the island to ensure the survival of the critically endangered species. In 2000 scientists from the San Diego Zoo's division of Conservation and Research for Endangered Species (CRES), under the direction of Conservation Research Fellow Dr. Glenn Gerber translocated 218 iguanas from Big Ambergris and Little Water Cay where their populations were threatened to four uninhabited cays within the Turks and Caicos reserve system. To date, these iguanas have experienced a 98 percent survival rate; they have adapted to new conditions and even successfully reproduced the immediate breeding season. Yearling iguanas resulting from the reproduction of the original translocated adults from 2002 are exceeding the size of their counterparts on the source Cays from which their ancestors were translocated by as much as 400%. Legislation to protect the iguanas has been drafted by the Turks and Caicos government in 2003. Additionally, the National Trust for the Turks and Caicos Islands has stewardship for the Little Water Cay to ensure that it is not mismanaged and has initiated a program to remove feral cats from Pine Cay and Water Cay. ==References== ==External links== *Cyclura.com *International Iguana Foundation *Turks and Caicos -Nature Category:Cyclura iguana, Turks And Caicos Rock Iguana, Turks and Caicos Rock Iguana, Turks and Caicos Rock Category:Critically endangered fauna of North America Category:Critically endangered biota of South America Category:Reptiles described in 1825 Category:Taxa named by Richard Harlan ","title":"Turks and Caicos rock iguana"},{"id":"1445100","text":"This may refer to: *Baron Bruce of Anandale (1295), a subsidiary title for the Earl of Carrick, abeyant 1371 *Baron Bruce of Whorlton (1641), formerly a subsidiary title for the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, extinct 1747 *Baron Bruce of Skelton (1664), formerly a subsidiary title for the Earl of Ailesbury, extinct 1747 *Baron Bruce of Tottenham (1746), a subsidiary title for the Marquess of Ailesbury ","title":"Baron Bruce"},{"id":"1445101","text":"Pointe √† la Hache ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, United States. \\"Census 2000 Data for the State of Louisiana\\" (town list), US Census Bureau, May 2003, webpage: C2000-LA. Located on the east bank of the Mississippi River, the village has been the seat for Plaquemines Parish since the formation of the parish. As of the 2010 census, its population was 187, less than half its 1930 population. It suffered severe damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Tropical Storm Lee in 2011. The Pointe √† la Hache Ferry, which connects to West Pointe a la Hache across the Mississippi, is the furthest downriver vehicle crossing point on the river. Pointe √† la Hache was the home of E. W. Gravolet, a cannery businessman. He was elected to both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature from Plaquemines Parish, serving in total from 1948 until his death in 1968. ==History== Native American settlement in the area goes back thousands of years. The earliest European settlement in the area was by the French about 1700. The name \\"Pointe √† la Hache\\" is French for \\"axe point, or cape\\". In the Mitchell Map of 1755, this is marked as \\"Hatchet Point\\" Ruins remain of the early 18th-century French installation, Fort de La Boulaye, that was built by French colonists to defend their claim of territory against the Spanish and English interests. The land there is mostly marshland, with a strip of higher land less than a mile wide between the wetlands and the Mississippi River. Plaquemines Parish was one of the original 19 divisions of the Territory of Orleans established in 1807 after the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase. After Louisiana achieved U.S. statehood in 1812, it was one of the original state parishes. In the 1812 Louisiana hurricane, a storm surge from the Gulf pushed all the way into the River, and there was widespread death and destruction. The area has always been subject to seasonal hurricane damage, with some years worse than others. The 1915 New Orleans Hurricane devastated the area, breaching levees and flooding the region. Thirty-one persons died in Pointe √† la Hache. The Parish Courthouse was destroyed, but some of its material was salvaged for reuse in the new Courthouse completed the same year. Pointe √† la Hache once had several beautiful old homes and historic businesses, most of which have been lost to hurricane and flooding damage. The 1930 census recorded a population of 404 in the community. In 1943, the area was involved in a political skirmish between the infamous Leander Perez and Governor Sam Houston Jones, resulting in the 'Invasion of Point √† la Hache. In 1965 Hurricane Betsy damaged the area, flooding the courthouse.Glen Jeansonne, Leander Perez: Boss of the Delta, p. 354 More than 50 people rode out the storm in the courthouse. All survived. During January 12, 2002 the parish courthouse was severely damaged by arson. Since then, the parish government has used several temporary buildings in Belle Chasse. The Plaquemines Parish Council has proposed to move the parish seat three times, but voters rejected the alternatives. Pointe √† la Hache was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. On Mardi Gras Day 2011, the Mississippi River broke through its east bank about five miles below Pointe √† la Hache. This breach has resulted in sediment-rich flow of the river into the wetlands, what coastal advocates have called a \\"cost-free\\" sediment diversion.

Project SHAD encompassed tests designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical agents or biological warfare agents and to develop procedures to respond to such attacks while maintaining a war- fighting capability. ==History== Project SHAD was part of a larger effort by the Department of Defense called Project 112. Project 112 was a chemical and biological weapons research, development, and testing project conducted by the United States Department of Defense and CIA handled by the Deseret Test Center and United States Army Chemical Materials Agency from 1962 to 1973. The project started under John F. Kennedy's administration, and was authorized by his Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, as part of a total review of the US military. The name of the project refers to its number in the 150 review process. ==Mission== The Shipboard Hazard and Defense Project (SHAD) was a series of tests conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense during the 1960s to determine how well service members aboard military ships could detect and respond to chemical and biological attacks. Dee Dodson Morris of the Army Chemical Corps who coordinated the ongoing investigation, says, \\"The SHAD tests were intended to show how vulnerable Navy ships were to chemical or biological warfare agents. The objective was to learn how chemical or biological warfare agents would disperse throughout a ship, and to use that information to develop procedures to protect crewmembers and decontaminate ships.\\" DoD investigators note that over a hundred tests were planned but the lack of test results may indicate that many tests were never actually executed. 134 tests were planned initially, but reportedly, only 46 tests were actually completed. ==Declassification== Public Law 107‚Äì314 required the identification and release of not only Project 112 information to the United States Veterans Administration but also that of any other projects or tests where a veteran might have been exposed to a chemical or biological warfare agent and directed The Secretary of Defense to work with veterans and veterans service organizations to identify the other projects or tests conducted by the Department of Defense that may have exposed members of the Armed Forces to chemical or biological agents. In 2000 the Department of Defense began the process of declassifying records about the project and according to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, approximately 6,000 U.S. Service members were believed to be involved in conducting the tests.About Project 112 and Project SHAD US Dept. of Veteran's Affairs In 2002, the Department of Defense began publishing a list of fact sheets for each of the tests. ==Identification== Although many of the roughly 5,500 veterans who took part were aware of the tests, some were involved without their knowledge. Certain issues surrounding the test program were not resolved by the passage of the law and the Department of Defense was accused of continuing to withhold documents on Cold War chemical and biological weapons tests that used unsuspecting veterans as \\"human samplers\\" after reporting to Congress it had released all medically relevant information. A Government Accounting Office May 2004 report, Chemical and Biological Defense: DOD Needs to Continue to Collect and Provide Information on Tests and Potentially Exposed Personnel indicates that almost all participants who were identified from Project 112 ‚Äî 94 percent ‚Äî were from ship-based tests of Project SHAD that comprised only about one-third of the total number of tests conducted. ==Medical Studies== Jack Alderson, a retired Navy officer who commanded the Army tugboats told CBS News that he believes the Pentagon used him and other service members to test weapons and those tests including agents, vaccines, and decontamination products have led to serious medical problems including cancer.Martin, David, \\"Retired Navy Officer Seeks Justice\\", CBS News, June 12, 2008. Secrecy agreements can now be ignored by veterans in order to pursue healthcare concerns within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The V.A. has offered screening programs for veterans who believe they were involved in DoD sponsored tests during their service. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies has commissioned studies of Project SHAD participants.

He was born in the Cameron Hill section of Chattanooga, Tennessee on July 25, 1899. He entered the University of Chattanooga, later University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, in 1918 and graduated in 1922. == Life == === Academic career === At the University of Chattanooga Grote joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity and earned his bachelor's degree. Following his time there he studied at Columbia University and earned his master's degree in 1923. He later attended the University of Cincinnati where he earned his Ph.D. in 1925. ===Pharmaceutical and educational career=== Following his graduation from University of Cincinnati in 1925, Grote started working for the William S. Merrell Company. While working there he became a faculty member of the Winthrop College in South Carolina. After only a year there, however, he began working for the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical company instead. Grote went on to accept a faculty position as an associate professor of chemistry at his alma mater in 1931, and eventually moved on to professor of chemistry in 1941. He would eventually become head of the Chemistry Department, from which he retired in 1964. From 1941 to 1972 Grote also served as scientific advisor for the Chattanooga Medicine Company, later to be called Chattem Co. Grote might be most noted for his contributions to the development of over the counter medicines Rolaids and Bufferin. While working for Chattanooga Medicine Company he worked with John C. Krantz developing an antacid-buffer that Chattanooga Medicine Co sold to Bristol-Myers co who would market it as Bufferin. In 1955, the dihydroxy aluminum sodium carbonate compound he developed was given to American Chicle Co and became the active ingredient in Rolaids. ===Personal life=== Grote is said to have had one of the largest collections of wine and fine liqueurs. He had over 3000 bottles from more than a hundred different countries. He married a fellow student at UC, Nita Marie Tansey, in 1926. He died in his sleep at his home on August 6, 1972. In honor of his service to education, the University renamed their science building after him and endowed a professorship bearing his name, as well as awarding scholarships to chemistry scholars. ==References== Category:1899 births Category:1972 deaths Category:20th-century American chemists Category:University of Tennessee at Chattanooga alumni Category:People from Chattanooga, Tennessee Category:20th- century American inventors ","title":"Irvine W.

This article covers the period 10,000 to 800 BC and ends immediately before any written records of civilizations, such as the first mention of Cyprus by the Romans. ==Epipalaeolithic== Cyprus was not settled in the Paleolithic (before agriculture), which allowed survival of numerous dwarf forms, such as dwarf elephants (Elephas cypriotes) and pygmy hippos (Hippopotamus minor) well into the Holocene. These animals are thought to have arrived on the island as a result of being swept out to sea while swimming off the coast of the nearby mainland.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247936933_The_origin_and_extinction_of_the_large_Pleistocene_mammals_of_Cyprus There are claims of an association of this fauna with artifacts of Epipalaeolithic foragers at Aetokremnos near Limassol on the southern coast of Cyprus. The extinction of the pygmy hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of Homo sapiens on Cyprus. There is evidence of this because of the piles of burned bones in the camps occupied by these early humans in caves on the southernmost point on the Island.https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/files/9_Simmons_start.pdf ==Neolithic== ===Aceramic Neolithic=== The oldest evidence of neolithic settlement is dated to 8800‚Äì8600 BC.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131209142553.htm The first settlers were already agriculturalists (PPNB), but did not yet produce pottery (aceramic Neolithic).Swiny, 2001 They introduced the dog, sheep, goats and maybe cattle and pigs as well as numerous wild animals like foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) that were previously unknown on the island. The PPNB settlers built round houses with floors made of terrazzo of burned lime (e.g. Kastros, Shillourokambos, Tenta) and cultivated einkorn and emmer. Pig, sheep, goat and cattle were kept, but remained morphologically wild. Evidence for cattle (attested at Shillourokambos) is rare and when they apparently died out in the course of the 8th millennium they were not reintroduced until the early Bronze Age. Neolithic archeological site at Choirokoitia (reconstruction) In the 6th millennium BC, the aceramic Choirokoitia culture (Neolithic I) was characterized by round houses (tholoi), stone vessels and an economy based on sheep, goats and pigs. The daily life of the people in those Neolithic villages was spent in farming, hunting, animal husbandry and the lithic industry, while homesteaders (likely women) were engaged in spindling and weaving cloths, in addition to their probable participation in other activities. The lithic industry was the most individual feature of this aceramic culture and innumerable stone vessels made of grey andesite have been discovered during excavations. The houses had a foundation of river pebbles, the remainder of the building was constructed in mudbrick. Sometimes several round houses were joined together to form a kind of compound. Some of these houses reach a diameter of up to 10 m. Inhumation burials are located inside the houses. Water wells discovered by archaeologists in western Cyprus are believed to be among the oldest in the world, dated at 9,000 to 10,500 years old, putting them in the Stone Age. They are said to show the sophistication of early settlers, and their heightened appreciation for the environment. Plant remains indicate the cultivation of cereals, lentils, beans, peas and a kind of plum called Bullace. Remains of the following animal species were recovered during excavations: Persian fallow deer, goat, sheep, mouflon and pig. More remains indicate Red deer, Roe deer, a kind of horse and a kind of dog but no cattle as yet. Life expectancy seems to have been short; the average age at death appears to have been about 34 years, and there was a high infant mortality rate. In 2004, the remains of an 8-month-old cat were discovered buried with its human owner at a Neolithic archeological site in Cyprus.Wade, Nicholas, \\"Study Traces Cat's Ancestry to Middle East\\", The New York Times, June 29, 2007 The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, predating Egyptian civilization and pushing back the earliest known feline- human association significantly. ===Ceramic Neolithic=== The aceramic civilisation of Cyprus came to an end quite abruptly around 6000 BC. It was probably followed by a vacuum of almost 1,500 years until around 4500 BC when one sees the emergence of Neolithic II (Ceramic Neolithic). At this time newcomers arrived in Cyprus introducing a new Neolithic era. The main settlement that embodies most of the characteristics of the period is Sotira near the south coast of Cyprus. The following ceramic Sotira phase (Neolithic II) has monochrome vessels with combed decoration. It had nearly fifty houses, usually having a single room that had its own hearth, benches, platforms and partitions that provided working places. The houses were on the main free- standing, with relatively thin walls and tended to be square with rounded corners. The sub-rectangular houses had two or three rooms. In Khirokitia, the remains of the Sotira phase overlay the aceramic remains. There are Sotira- ceramics in the earliest levels of Erimi as well. In the North of the island, the ceramic levels of Troulli may be synchronous with Sotira in the South. The Late Neolithic is characterised by a red-on white ware. The late Neolithic settlement of Kalavassos-Pamboules has sunken houses. ===Chalcolithic=== The Neolithic culture was destroyed by an earthquake c. 3800 BC. In the society that emerged there are no overt signs of newcomers but signs of continuity, therefore despite the violent natural catastrophe, there is an internal evolution that is formalised around 3500 BC with appearance of the first metalwork and the beginning of the Chalcolithic (copper and stone) period that lasted until about 2500/2300 BC. Very few chisels, hooks and jewellery of pure copper have survived, but in one example there is a minimal presence of tin, something which may support contact with Asia Minor, where copper-working was established earlier. During the Chalcolithic period changes of major importance took place along with technological and artistic achievements, especially towards its end. The presence of a stamp seal and the size of the houses that was not uniform, both hint at property rights and social hierarchy. The same story is supported by the burials because some of them were deposited in pits without grave goods and some in shaft graves with relatively rich furniture, both being indications of wealth accumulation by certain families and social differentiation. The Eneolithic or Chalcolithic period is divided into the Erimi (Chalcolithic I) and Ambelikou/Ayios Georghios (Chalcolithic II) phases. The type site of the Neolithic I period is Erimi on the South coast of the island. The ceramic is characterised by red-on white pottery with linear and floral designs. Stone (steatite) and clay figurines with spread arms are common. In Erimi, a copper chisel has been found, this is the oldest copper find in Cyprus so far. Otherwise, copper is still rare. Another important Chalcolithic site is Lempa (Lemba). The Chalcolithic period did not come to an end at the same time throughout Cyprus, and lingered in the Paphos area until the arrival of the Bronze Age. ==Bronze Age== ===Early Bronze Age=== The new era was introduced by people from Anatolia who came to Cyprus about 2400 BC. The newcomers are identified archaeologically because of a distinct material culture, known as the Philia Culture. This was the earliest manifestation of the Bronze Age. Philia sites are found in most parts of the island. As the newcomers knew how to work with copper they soon moved to the so-called copperbelt of the island, that is the foothills of the Troodos mountains. This movement reflects the increased interest in the raw material that was going to be so closely connected with Cyprus for several centuries afterwards. The Philia phase of the Bronze Age (or Philia phases) saw a rapid transformation of technology and economy.Webb, 1999 Rectilinear buildings made of mud-brick, the plough, the warp-weighted loom and clay pot stands are among the characteristic introductions. Cattle were reintroduced, together with the donkey. The succeeding Early Bronze Age is divided into three general phases (Early Cypriot I - III) - a continuous process of development and population increase. Marki Alonia is the best excavated settlement of this period. Marki Alonia and Sotira Kaminoudhia are excavated settlements. Many cemeteries are known, the most important of which is Bellapais Vounous on the North coast. ===Middle Bronze Age=== The Middle Bronze Age which followed the Early Bronze Age (1900‚Äì1600 BC) is a relatively short period and its earlier part is marked by peaceful development. The Middle Bronze Age is known from several excavated settlements: Marki Alonia, Alambra Mouttes and Pyrgos Mavroraki. These give evidence of economy and architecture of the period. From Alambra and Marki in central Cyprus we know that the houses were rectangular with many rooms, with lanes allowing people to move freely in the community. At the end of the Middle Bronze Age fortresses were built in various places, a clear indication of unrest, although its cause is uncertain. The most important cemeteries are at Bellapais, Lapithos, Kalavasos and Deneia. An extensive collection of Bronze Age pottery can be seen on-line from the cemeteries at Deneia. The up to now oldest copper workshops have been excavated at Pyrgos-Mavroraki, 90 km southwest of Nicosia. Cyprus was known as Alasiya, the name is preserved in Egyptian, Hittite, Assyrian, Ugaritic documents. The first recorded name of a Cypriote king is \\"Kushmeshusha\\" as appears on 13th c. BCE letters sent to Ugarit. ===Late Bronze Age=== The beginning of the Late Bronze Age does not differ from the closing years of the previous period. Unrest, tension and anxiety mark all these years, probably because of some sort of engagement with the Hyksos who ruled Egypt at this time but were expelled from there in the mid-16th century. Soon afterwards peaceful conditions prevailed in the Eastern Mediterranean that witnessed a flowering of trade relations and the growing of urban centres. Chief among them was Enkomi the earliest predecessor of modern Famagusta, though several other harbour towns also sprung up along the southern coast of Cyprus. Around 1500 BC Thutmose III claimed Cyprus and imposed a tax on the island. Literacy was introduced to Cyprus with the Cypro- Minoan syllabary, a derivation from Cretan Linear A. It was first used in early phases of the late Bronze Age (LCIB, 14th century BC) and continued in use for c. 400 years into the LC IIIB, maybe up to the second half of the 11th century BC. It likely evolved into the Cypriot syllabary. Late Bronze Age horned altar at Pigadhes. The Late Cypriot (LC) IIC (1300‚Äì1200 BC) was a time of local prosperity. Cities were rebuilt on a rectangular grid plan, like Enkomi, where the town gates now correspond to the grid axes and numerous grand buildings front the street system or newly founded. Great official buildings constructed from ashlar-masonry point to increased social hierarchisation and control. Some of these buildings contain facilities for processing and storing olive oil, like at Maroni-Vournes and building X at Kalavassos-Ayios Dhimitrios. Other ashlar-buildings are known from Palaeokastro. A Sanctuary with a horned altar constructed from ashlar-masonry has been found at Myrtou-Pigadhes, other temples have been located at Enkomi, Kition and Kouklia (Palaepaphos). Both the regular layout of the cities and the new masonry techniques find their closest parallels in Syria, especially in Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra). Rectangular corbelled tombs point to close contacts with Syria and Palestine as well. The practice of writing spread, and tablets in the Cypro-Minoan script have been found on the mainland as well (Ras Shamra). Ugaritic texts from Ras Shamra and Enkomi mention Ya, the Assyrian name of Cyprus, that thus seems to have been in use already in the late Bronze Age. Cyprus was a part of the Hittite empire but was a client state and as such was not invaded but rather merely part of the empire by association and governed by the ruling kings of Ugarit.Thomas, Carol G. & Conant, C.: The Trojan War, pages 121-122. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. , 9780313325267. As such Cyprus was essentially \\"left alone with little intervention in Cypriot affairs\\". However, during the reign of Tudhaliya IV the island was briefly invaded by the Hittites for either reasons of securing the copper resource or as a way of preventing piracy. Shortly afterwards the island was reconquered by his son Suppiluliuma II around 1200 BC. Some towns (Enkomi, Kition, Palaeokastro and Sinda) show traces of destruction at the end of LC IIC. Originally, two waves of destruction, c. 1230 BC by the Sea Peoples and 1190 BC by Aegean refugees, or 1190 and 1179 BC according to Paul Astr√∂m had been proposed. Some smaller settlements (Ayios Dhimitrios and Kokkinokremnos) were abandoned but do not show traces of destruction. The years of peace that brought about such a flowering of culture and civilisation did not last. During these years Cyprus reached unprecedented heights in prosperity and it played a rather neutral role in the differences of her powerful neighbours. Rich finds from this period testify to a vivid commerce with other countries. We have jewellery and other precious objects from the Aegean along with pottery that prove the close connections of the two areas, though finds coming from Near Eastern countries are also plentiful. In the later phase of the late Bronze Age (LCIIIA, 1200‚Äì1100 BC) great amounts of \\"Mycenaean\\" IIIC:1b pottery were produced locally. New architectural features include Cyclopean walls, found on the Greek mainland as well and a certain type of rectangular stepped capitals, endemic on Cyprus. Chamber tombs are given up in favour of shaft graves. Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks by the end of the Bronze Age, beginning so the Hellenization of the island.Andreas G. Orphanides, \\"Late Bronze Age Socio-Economic and Political Organization, and the Hellenization of Cyprus\\", Athens Journal of History, volume 3, number 1, 2017, pp. 7‚Äì20 Large amounts of IIIC:1b pottery are found in Palestine during this period as well. There are finds that show close connections to Egypt as well. In Hala Sultan Tekke Egyptian pottery has been found, among them wine jugs bearing the cartouche of Seti I and fish bones of the Nile perch. Another Greek invasion was believed to have taken place in the following century (LCIIIB, 1100‚Äì1050), indicated, among other things, by a new type of graves (long dromoi) and Mycenean influences in pottery decoration. Most authors claim that the Cypriot city kingdoms, first described in written sources in the 8th century BC were already founded in the 11th century BC. Other scholars see a slow process of increasing social complexity between the 12th and the 8th centuries, based on a network of chiefdoms. In the 8th century (geometric period) the number of settlements increases sharply and monumental tombs, like the 'Royal' tombs of Salamis appear for the first time. This could be a better indication for the appearance of the Cypriot kingdoms. This period shows the appearance large urban centers. ==Iron Age== The Iron Age follows the Submycenean period (1125‚Äì1050 BC) or Late Bronze Age and is divided into the: * Geometric 1050‚Äì700 BC * Archaic 700‚Äì525 BC In the ensuing Early Iron Age Cyprus becomes predominantly Greek. Pottery shapes and decoration show a marked Aegean inspiration although Oriental ideas creep in from time to time. Pottery types also appear from other Mediterranean cultures as evidenced from in archaeological recovery on Cyprus of pottery from Cydonia, a powerful urban center of ancient Crete.C. Michael Hogan, Cydonia, The Modern Antiquarian, Jan. 23, 2008 New burial customs with rock-cut chamber tombs having a long \\"dromos\\" (a ramp leading gradually towards the entrance) along with new religious beliefs speak in favour of the arrival of people from the Aegean. The same view is supported by the introduction of the safety pin that denotes a new fashion in dressing and also by a name scratched on a bronze skewer from Paphos and dating between 1050‚Äì950 BC. Foundations myths documented by classical authors connect the foundation of numerous Cypriot towns with immigrant Greek heroes in the wake of the Trojan war. For example, Teucer, the brother of Aias was supposed to have founded Salamis, and the Arcadian Agapenor of Tegea to have replaced the native ruler Kinyras and to have founded Paphos. Some scholars see this a memory of a Greek colonisation already in the 11th century. In the 11th-century tomb 49 from Palaepaphos- Skales three bronze obeloi with inscriptions in Cypriot syllabic script have been found, one of which bears the name of Opheltas. This is first indication of the use of Greek language on the island, although is written in the Cypriot syllabary that remained in use down to the 3rd century BC. Cremation as a burial rite is seen as a Greek introduction as well. The first cremation burial in Bronze vessels has been found at Kourion-Kaloriziki, tomb 40, dated to the first half of the 11th century (LCIIIB). The shaft grave contained two bronze rod tripod stands, the remains of a shield and a golden sceptre as well. Formerly seen as the Royal grave of first Argive founders of Kourion, it is now interpreted as the tomb of a native Cypriote or a Phoenician prince. The cloisonn√© enamelling of the sceptre head with the two falcons surmounting it has no parallels in the Aegean, but shows a strong Egyptian influence. The evidence for Greek settlement is thus not very strong, but many Greek Cypriot archaeologists have consistently downplayed the \\"oriental\\" influence. In the 8th century, numerous Phoenician colonies were founded, like Kart-Hadasht ('New Town'), present day Larnaca and Salamis. The oldest cemetery of Salamis has indeed produced children's burials in Canaanite jars, clear indication of Phoenician presence already in the LCIIIB (11th century). Similar jar burials have been found in cemeteries in Kourion-Kaloriziki and Palaepaphos-Skales near Kouklia. In Skales, many Levantine imports and Cypriote imitations of Levantine forms have been found and point to a Phoenician expansion even before the end of the 11th century. The 8th century BC saw a marked increase of wealth in Cyprus. Communications to the east and west were on the ascent and this created a prosperous society. Testifying to this wealth are the so- called royal tombs of Salamis, which, although plundered, produced a truly royal abundance of wealth. Sacrifices of horses, bronze tripods and huge cauldrons decorated with sirens, griffins etc., chariots with all their ornamentation and the horses' gear, ivory beds and thrones exquisitely decorated were all deposited into the tombs' \\"dromoi\\" for the sake of their masters. The late 8th century is the time of the spreading of the Homeric poems, the \\"Iliad\\" and the \\"Odyssey\\". Funerary customs at Salamis and elsewhere were greatly influenced by these poems. The deceased were given skewers and firelogs in order to roast their meat, a practice found in contemporary Argos and Crete, recalling the similar gear of Achilles when he entertained other Greek heroes in his tent. Honey and oil, described by Homer as offerings to the dead are also found at Salamis, and the flames of fire that consumed the deceased were quenched with wine as it happened to Patroclus' body after it was given to the flames. The hero's ashes were gathered carefully wrapped into a linen cloth and put into a golden urn. At Salamis the ashes of the deceased are also wrapped into a cloth and deposited into a bronze cauldron. Therefore, the Cypriots along with their extravagant display of wealth that bears many oriental features, do not forget their roots for which they must have been very proud. The circulation of the Homeric poems must have revived the interest in their ancestors whose system of government they never lost sight of. The Prehistoric Period came to an end with the writing of the first works that still survive, first by the Assyrians, then by Greeks and Romans. ==See also== *Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus *Cyprus dwarf elephant ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Bernard Knapp, A.

Impressed by Hillier's paintings, the director F.W. Murnau offered him a job as camera assistant on Tabu (1931), but Hillier's father intervened because of Murnau's homosexuality. Fortunately, Murnau recommended him to director Fritz Lang at UFA studios, who employed him on his classic M (1931). Soon after he moved to Britain to pursue a career in film. In Britain, he worked as a camera assistant for Gaumont Pictures, where he worked with Hitchcock. He later moved to Elstree Studios, working on The Man Behind the Mask (1936) with Michael Powell, who noted his \\"insane enthusiasm\\". His debut as cinematographer came with Lady from Lisbon (1942). ==Work with The Archers== Impressed by his work on The Silver Fleet (1943) for their Archers Film Productions, Powell & Pressburger ('The Archers') hired Hillier as cinematographer on A Canterbury Tale (1944), a film about which Powell later said Hillier \\"did a marvelous job\\". Despite Powell's recent work with the three-strip Technicolour film process, war shortages meant a return to the black-and-white stock that Hillier was familiar. The film is a mixture of British realism and the German expressionist use of extreme light and shade which Hillier has been trained in, and is remembered for its depiction of the English landscape. In his autobiography, Powell recalled his obsession with clouds; he often begged for filming to be delayed until a cloud had appeared to break up a clear sky. His next film I Know Where I'm Going! (1945), again with The Archers, continued the style of its predecessor. It is features Hillier's technical accomplishments, including mixing studio shots with exteriors, concealing the fact that Roger Livesey, the film's male lead, was working in London while the film was being shot in Scotland. With the war at an end, Powell & Pressburger at last had access to colour film. They asked Hillier to share cinematographic duties with the experienced Technicolor cameraman Jack Cardiff on A Matter of Life and Death. Unwilling to be sidelined, he declined, bringing his intensely creative partnership with Powell & Pressburger to an end. ==Post-war career== Hillier made his first colour film London Town (1946), starring Sid Field, although he often returned to work in black and white, typical of many British films of the 1940s and 1950s. His films retained a distinctive expressionist influence in both mediums. He worked for director Michael Anderson on Private Angelo (1949), the first of many collaborations. The last was to be opulent The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968). Their best remembered film is The Dam Busters (1955), featuring some aerial photography by Hillier. He continued to work until 1970. He died in London in 2005, aged 93 leaving a widow, daughter and sister Gerda Ehrenzweig. ==Selected filmography== * Sing as You Swing (1937) * Lady from Lisbon (1942) * Rhythm Serenade (1943) * Welcome, Mr. Washington (1944) * They Knew Mr. Knight (1946) * The Mark of Cain (1947) * Mr. Perrin and Mr. Traill (1948) * The Interrupted Journey (1949) * Shadow of the Eagle (1950) * The Rival of the Empress (1951) * The Woman's Angle (1952) * Father's Doing Fine (1952) * Go to Blazes (1962) * Sammy Going South (1963) * The Quiller Memorandum (1966) * The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) ==ReferencesErwin Hillier at screenonline. * Obituary from The Independent. * Obituaries at the Powell & Pressburger pages Category:1911 births Category:2005 deaths Category:English cinematographers Category:German cinematographers Category:Film people from Berlin Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom Category:German people of English descent ","title":"Erwin Hillier"},{"id":"1445145","text":"Koninklijke Football Club Rhodienne-De Hoek is a Belgian association football club based in Sint-Genesius-Rode, Flemish Brabant. The club was created in 1894 as Racing Football Club. It became a member of the Royal Belgian Football Association in 1895 as Racing Club de Bruxelles and later received the matricule n¬∞6. It took part in the first Belgian league the same year and won 6 titles and 1 cup until the First World War. Then, the club declined, and in 1963, it merged with White Star Woluw√© A.C. to avoid bankruptcy. The new club was then called Royal Racing White. It was decided that this club would keep the matricule N¬∞47 of White Star Woluw√©. Thus to avoid that the matricule n¬∞6 of Royal Racing Club de Bruxelles (as it was named since 1921) was erased, the club exchanged its matricule with that of K. Sport Sint-Genesius-Rode. ==History== ===R.R.C. de Bruxelles history (1894‚Äî1963)=== Royal Racing Club de Bruxelles was founded in 1891 as an athletic club; the football section was also founded three years later. In 1895 the club became one of the founding members of both the Royal Belgian Football Association and the Belgian Pro League, dominating the league in its first 19 seasons, winning six Belgian titles along the way. RC de Bruxelles won the first Belgian Cup in 1912. After its first stint in the top division (interrupted by the first world war), the club was demoted to the second division in 1925. It later bounced around between the first and third tiers, never regaining its glory years. The club suffered financially in later years, both on and off the field; it managed to play in the top tier for the last time (1954‚Äì55 season), but finished second from bottom at the end of the season (15th out of 16), never returning to the top again. Due to increasing financial hardships which were further compounded by heated discussions with the La Rhodienne management about ideas of a merger, Racing's management decided to formally merge the club with La Rhodienne (through switching matricule numbers) in 1963 (see next section). ===K. Sport Sint-Genesius-Rode history (1927‚Äî1963)=== In 1927, Rhodienne- Verrewinkel was officially founded as F.C. La Rhodienne and one year later the first official match was played. The team started to compete in the third regional division in 1929, where it immediately won its league. In 1936 the club reached the provincial divisions. After the War it progressed into the national divisions. In 1963, La Rhodienne came into play to keep Racing Brussels' matricule n¬∞6 alive. On 21 June 1963, Racing Club changed its name to Royal F.C. La Rhodienne, keeping the matricule n¬∞6. On the next day, K. Sport Sint-Genesius-Rode (matricule n¬∞1274) changed its name to Royal Racing Club de Bruxelles. On 23 June, the club wearing the matricule N¬∞6, which had just been renamed to Royal FC La Rhodienne, now changed its name to K. Sport St-Genesius-Rode. The clubs had effectively changed names, so although the original Racing Club merged into R. Racing White in 1963, it was effectively the matricule n¬∞1274 that merged, and the old matricule 6 was kept alive in a different club. ===K.F.C. Rhodienne-Verrewinkel/Rhodienne-De Hoek history (1963‚Äîpresent)=== In 1996, K.V.C. Verrewinkel (founded in 1928) merged into K. Sport St-Genesius-Rode, changing its name to K.F.C. Rhodienne-Verrewinkel. It later adopted the present name Rhodienne-De Hoek in 2010. ==Honours== *Belgian First Division: **Winners (6): 1896‚Äì97, 1899‚Äì1900, 1900‚Äì01, 1901‚Äì02, 1902‚Äì03, 1907‚Äì08 *Belgian Cup: **Winners (1): 1911‚Äì12 *Belgian Second Division: **Winners (2): 1925‚Äì26, 1941‚Äì42 ==External links== * RWDM website ‚Äì R.R.C. de Bruxelles History * K.F.C.

With its moderately high banking and a wide racing surface, it was suitable for close racing and passing. The track hosted an ARCA RE/MAX Series race in 2009, and it also hosted the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series from 2004 to 2008. On January 18, 2013 Grant Milliron of Milliron Industries, a local facility specializing in waste, recycling and scrap metal, purchased the former Mansfield Motorsports Park for $800,000 in an auction held by the Richland County Sheriff‚Äôs office following the property's seizure by the County in lieu of unpaid property taxes.https://www.destinationmansfield.com/blog/milliron- buys-mansfield-motorsports-park/ For 2017, it was announced that the track would undergo a transition from asphalt to dirt. The track had previously been dirt up until 1999. The track name was also changed from Spitzer Motor Speedway to Mansfield Motor Speedway for 2017. With the new dirt surface, Mansfield Motor Speedway will now be hosting series like the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series and the Arctic Cat All Star Circuit of Champions. ==Former events== Mansfield formerly hosted a wide variety of events, most notably the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series (formerly Craftsman Truck Series), which raced at Mansfield on Memorial Day weekend since 2004. Mansfield was the shortest track on the Camping World Truck Series schedule and was the only track in the United States to be on the Camping World Truck Series schedule as well as being Dodge Weekly Series sanctioned. This ended in 2007 when the weekly race program at the track was discontinued. In addition, Mansfield hosted two annual rounds of the USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series as well as the NASCAR Camping World East Series and Whelen Modified Tour, the ASA Late Model Series, ISMA and MSA Supermodifieds and HOSS sprint cars. The facility received a safety upgrade in 2006 when SAFER barriers were installed in the turns. During early 2009, Music City Motorplex authorities announced a new promoter for the Nashville speedway, who chose to remove all \\"upper level\\" touring series races (NASCAR and ARCA) and decided not to renew its NASCAR sanction. Track officials were contacted by former Nashville promoter Joseph Mattioli III about having their major touring series races moved to Mansfield. In February 2009, the track replaced Nashville on the ARCA RE/MAX Series tour, with the Tim Richmond Memorial ARCA Re/Max 200 scheduled to be held on June 20, 2009. ==Drag strip== A drag strip has been planned for the facility since 2006, following the decision by Summit Motorsports Park (located roughly north in Norwalk) to discontinue their affiliation with the IHRA and join the NHRA. It was intended to have Mansfield replace Norwalk as the venue for the IHRA World Nationals by 2007 and to host a Live Nation IHRA eMax Nitro Jam event as part of the drag strip's opening festivities. ==Former NASCAR Races== * NASCAR Camping World Truck Series - Ohio 250 (2004-2008) ==Track NASCAR Records== * NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Qualifying: Ron Hornaday Jr., 16.277 sec.

Over the course of her 54-year concert career, she became an internationally renowned virtuoso pianist and was often referred to as the \\"Valkyrie of the Piano\\". Carre√±o was an early adopter of the works of one of her students and friend, American composer and pianist Edward MacDowell (1860‚Äì1908) and premiered several of his compositions across the globe. She also frequently performed the works of Norwegian composer and pianist Edvard Grieg (1843‚Äì1907). Carre√±o composed approximately 75 works for solo piano, voice and piano, choir and orchestra, and instrumental ensemble. Several composers dedicated their compositions to Carre√±o, including Amy Beach (Piano Concerto in C-sharp minor) and Edward MacDowell (Piano Concerto No. 2). ==Early life and education== Mar√≠a Teresa Carre√±o Garc√≠a de Sena was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on December 22, 1853, to Manuel Antonio Carre√±o (1812‚Äì1874) and Clorinda Garc√≠a de Sena y Rodr√≠guez del Toro (1816‚Äì1866). Her father was the son of Jos√© Cayetano Carre√±o (1773‚Äì1836) and came from a musical family. He gave her music lessons from an early age and oversaw her career until his death in 1874. Her mother was a cousin of Maria Teresa Rodriguez del Toro y Alayza, wife of South America's founding father Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, on whose honor she was named. Before leaving Caracas she also studied with a German musician, Julio Hohene. ==Career== Manuel Antonio Carre√±o In 1862 her family emigrated to New York City and Carre√±o entered the musical world with a series of private and public concerts. During the first few weeks in New York City, she met American pianist and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk, who heard her perform and promoted her as an artist.; accessed via RIPM(subscription required). At the age of eight on November 25 she made her debut at Irving Hall performing a Rondo Brillant, Op. 98 (Johann Nepomuk Hummel), accompanied by a quintet (Mosenthal, Matzka, Bergner, C. Preusser); Grande Fantaisie sur Moise, Op. 33 (Sigismond Thalberg); Nocturne (Theodor D√∂hler), Jerusalem (Louis Moreau Gottschalk); and Variations on \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\" Op. 72 (Thalberg) for an encore. This debut was followed by concerts (1863‚Äì1865) across the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States, including stops in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. During the fall of 1863 Carre√±o performed for Abraham Lincoln at the White House.Music in Lincoln's White House - White House Historical Association Interspersed with her North American concerts were concert performances in Cuba during the spring of 1863 and fall of 1865. In the spring of 1866, Carre√±o and her family left the United States for Paris, France, where she made her debut on May 14 at the Salle √ârard. During her time in Paris, she met many prominent musicians, including Gioachino Rossini, Georges Mathias (a pupil of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin who may have given her a few lessons), Charles Gounod, and Franz Liszt. Between 1866 and 1872, Carre√±o performed regularly in concerts across cities in the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. While in Paris, she studied voice with Rossini and later, during the 1870s, with Signor Fontana and Russian soprano Herminia Rudersdorff (1822‚Äì1882). Her preparation enabled her to step into the role of and appeared as the Queen in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots during a performance with the Colonel Henry Mapleson troupe in Edinburgh, Scotland, after the leading lady, Th√©r√®se Tiejens (1831‚Äì1877), became ill. In New York, on February 25, 1876, she again performed in an operatic role, this time as Zerlina in Mozart's Don Giovanni. In 1872, she returned to the United States with an artist troupe (led by Max Strakosch) consisting of well-known musicians, including American singer Annie Louise Cary, operatic soprano Carlotta Patti, French violinist and composer √âmile Sauret, baritone Signor Del Puente, and Italian tenor Giovanni Matteo de Candia, who went by the stage name of Mario. During 1873/1874 she appeared in performances in England with the Philharmonic Society, and in M. Riviere's promenade concerts, London Ballad Concerts,http://admin.concertprogrammes.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/2790 Hanover Square Rooms, and the Monday Popular Concerts. While touring with the Max Strakosch troupe, Carre√±o and Sauret became romantically involved and on July 13, 1873, they were married in London, England. They had one child, Emilita (b. March 23, 1874), who was left in the care of a family friend, Mrs. James Bischoff, while Carre√±o and Sauret pursued musical opportunities in the United States. Emilita was eventually adopted by the Bischoff family. thumb130px Emile Sauretalt=Emile Sauret Between 1876 and 1889, Carre√±o resided and toured primarily in the United States, sharing concert bills with famous operatic singers, including Adelina Patti, Emma Abbott, Clara Louise Kellogg, Emma C. Thursby, and Ilma De Murska, and musicians, including violinist August Wilhelmj and Giovanni Tagliapietra. After Carre√±o's marriage to Sauret dissolved, she became involved with Tagliapietra and entered into a common-law marriage. They had three children: Louisa (March 1, 1878 ‚Äì May 16, 1881), Teresita (December 24, 1882 ‚Äì 1951), and Giovanni (January 8, 1885 ‚Äì 1965). Following in their mother's footsteps, Teresita pursued a career as a concert pianist, and Giovanni as an opera singer. During these years she appeared with the Theodore Thomas Orchestra and Damrosch Orchestra. Although Carre√±o often appeared as a supporting artist during the 1870s into the early 1880s, she on occasion performed solo piano concerti, including Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto no. 1, and Grieg's Piano Concerto, Op. 16. By 1883 Carre√±o began promoting and performing the works of Edward MacDowell in the United States and later abroad. Some of the most frequently performed works include his First Modern Suite, Op. 10, Serenade, Op. 16, Second Modern Suite, Op. 14, \\"Erz√§hlung\\" and \\"Hexentanz\\" from 2 Fantasiest√ºcke, Op. 17; √âtude de concert, Op. 36; Piano Concerto No. 1, Op. 15; Piano Concerto No. 2 in D minor, Op. 23 (dedicated to her). At the invitation of General Joaqu√≠n Crespo, the president of Venezuela, Carre√±o and Tagliapietra traveled to Caracas, Venezuela, arriving in October 1885, with the intention of establishing an opera company and plans for a music conservatory. Carre√±o gave several performances, including one on October 27 at Teatro Guzm√°n Blanco in Caracas, which included the performance of her composition, Himno a Bol√≠var, dedicated to Venezuela's founding father. Carre√±o and Tagliapietra returned to Venezuela again in 1887 in order to open the season at Teatro Guzm√°n Blanco with their new opera company. Unfortunately their efforts did not pay off largely due to the political unrest, dissatisfied audiences, and abandoned musical posts. They returned to New York in August 1887 and continued performing in the United States. For several years, Carre√±o had planned to return to Europe and establish herself as a virtuoso pianist. On November 18, 1889, she debuted with the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Gustav F. Kogel at the Singakademie. On this occasion she performed Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto, Schumann's Symphonic Studies, Op. 13, and Weber's Polonaise brillante (arr. Franz Liszt). During the early years in the United States, Carre√±o's concerts were managed by several different individuals, however, as she established herself in Germany and abroad, she chose to work primarily through the Hermann Wolff Concert Bureau and became close friends with Hermann Wolff and his wife, Louise. Around 1890, Carre√±o became acquainted with Scottish-born German pianist and composer Eugen d'Albert, also managed by Wolff. Their musical friendship turned romantic and by late 1891 they moved into a home, which they named Villa Teresa in Coswig. They were married on July 27, 1892. On September 27, 1892, their first child, Eugenia was born, followed by Hertha on September 26, 1894. During their marriage, the couple often appeared on the same concert bill and Carre√±o began performing works by d'Albert, including his Piano Concerto no. 2, Op. 12. D'Albert was a controlling individual in matters related to child rearing, household management, and even Carre√±o's repertoire choices, which resulted in the exclusion of MacDowell's music from her performances during their marriage.Letter from Frances MacDowell to Carre√±o, May 24, 1896. Series 3: Correspondence, folder 8.11. Teresa Carre√±o Papers, Archives and Special Collections Library, Vassar College Libraries. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1895.Divorce papers, Series 6: Legal Documents, folder 14.1. Teresa Carre√±o Papers, Archives and Special Collections Library, Vassar College Libraries. She would remarry again in June 1902 to Arturo Tagliapietra, the brother of her second husband. He had joined her in Berlin around 1897 and assisted her with her concert plans and accounts. Carre√±o at piano in 1917 alt=Eugen d'Albert Following her success in Germany and other European states, Carre√±o returned to the United States in 1897 to an eager audience. Performing in Hartford, Connecticut, a critic for the Hartford Courant wrote: \\"Teresa Carreno the piano virtuoso, made her first appearance to-day at the Philharmonic Concert, Carnegie Hall, under the baton of Anton Seidl. Her magnificent technique displayed to the highest degree the marvelous sonority of the Knabe piano, upon which she played, and she received one of the greatest ovations of the season.\\" From this point forward in her career, Carre√±o appeared in concerts as a featured artist, solo or with orchestra. She performed under the baton of many prominent conductors, including Edvard Grieg, Gustav Mahler, Theodore Thomas, Wilhelm Gericke, Hans von B√ºlow, and Henry Wood. In his memoir, Henry Wood wrote that \\"It is difficult to express adequately what all musicians felt about this great woman who looked like a queen among pianists - and played like a goddess. The instant she walked onto the platform her steady dignity held her audience who watched with riveted attention while she arranged the long train she habitually wore. Her masculine vigour of tone and touch and her marvellous precision on executing octave passages carried everyone completely away.\\" Among the most frequently performed composers in her repertoire were Chopin, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Grieg, MacDowell, Schumann, Rubinstein, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Weber, and occasionally her own. Carre√±o recorded over forty compositions for the reproducing piano between 1905 and 1908. These were released primarily by Welte-Mignon and reissued by other piano roll manufacturers. Her daughter Teresita also recorded for player piano in 1906 for Welte-Mignon. In addition to her performances, Carre√±o gave lessons to students in many of the cities she visited. In the early 1900s, her students traveled to her summer residence during the summer months to study with her for weeks at a time. Amongst her students were her early biographer Marta Milinowski, as well as Fanny Nicod√© n√©e Kinnel, Helen Wright,The Helen Wright Papers, MSS 2 and Julia Gibansky- Kasanoff.Julia Gibansky Kasanoff papers relating to Teresa Carre√±o, 1902-1937 For the remainder of her career, Carre√±o performed in cities across Europe (including Russia) with only a few concert seasons in North America during 1907‚Äì08, 1909‚Äì10, and 1916, as well as two visits to Australia and New Zealand in 1907/1908 and 1910/1911, the latter which also included stops in South Africa. Carre√±o and A. Tagliapietra returned to New York City in September 1916 for a 1916‚Äì1917 concert season with performances planned across the United States and Cuba. In 1916 she performed for President Woodrow Wilson at the White House. During her trip to Havana, Cuba in March 1917, however, she became ill and returned to New York where she was diagnosed with diplopia. Her health declined rapidly and she died on June 12, 1917, in her apartment in New York City at the age of 63. 96th Street, New York Cityalt=Plaque commemorating Teresa Carre√±o at the place of her death. New York City. ==Compositions== Teresa Carre√±o composed approximately 75 works for piano, voice and piano, choir and orchestra, chamber music, and several merengues, incorporating the form as an interlude in some of her pieces (for example, in her piece entitled Un Bal en R√™ve). Her earliest compositions (in manuscript) date back to ca. 1860. One of her first pieces published the year after her debut in New York City was the \\"Gottschalk Waltz\\" (1863),104.044 - Gottschalk Waltz.  Levy Music Collection dedicated to Louis Moreau Gottschalk. The majority of her works were composed before 1875 and were published by various publishers in locations including Paris (Heugel, Brandus & S. Dufour), London (Duff & Stewart), Madrid (Antonio Romero), New York (G. Schirmer, Edward Schuberth), Boston (Oliver Ditson & Co.), Philadelphia (Theodore Presser), Cincinnati (The John Church Company), Leipzig (Fr. Kistner & C. F. W. Siegel) Sydney and Melbourne (Allan & Co.). Only a handful of works were composed post-1880, including two works for chorus, Himno a Bol√≠var (ca. 1883) and Himno al ilustre americano (ca. 1886). The first piece was dedicated to General Joaqu√≠n Crespo and premiered during her visit to Caracas in 1885. The second piece was written in honor of Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, president of Venezuela (1879‚Äì1884, 1886‚Äì1887). Her composition Kleiner Walzer (Mi Teresita) (ca. 1885) composed for her daughter Teresita was one of her most popular pieces during her lifetime and she often performed it as an encore at her own concerts. During her Berlin residency in the 1890s, Carre√±o composed two chamber works, Serenade for String Orchestra (ca. 1895) and String Quartet in B-minor (1896). The latter which was performed by the Klinger Quartet in the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1896. ==Legacy== In 1938 Carre√±o's ashes were repatriated to Caracas, Venezuela. They were later exhumed and interred at the Pante√≥n Nacional in 1977. Vassar College acquired Teresa Carre√±o's papers in the early 1930s and officially purchased them in 1941. In 1957 a portion of the (un-inventoried) collection was dispersed between Vassar and the National Library in Caracas, Venezuela. These materials are now housed in the Centro Documental Teatro Teresa Carre√±o. A finding aid is available for the extant Teresa Carre√±o Papers at Vassar College in the Archives & Special Collections Library. The Teresa Carre√±o Cultural Complex in Caracas is named in honor of Carre√±o.Jean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, \\"Solo nec plus ultra\\", Neva Editions, 2015, p.51. . The center serves as the residence for the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra. The complex also houses the Centro Documental Teatro Teresa Carre√±o and the Sala de Exposici√≥n Teresa Carre√±o. The Centro Documental serves as the main archive for Carre√±o in Venezuela. It houses primary source materials, including correspondence, legal documents, concert programs, scores, reviews, photographs, and other personal items. The Sala de Exposici√≥n exhibits materials once owned by Carre√±o, including her concert dresses, Weber piano (recovered through the efforts of Venezuelan pianist Rosario Marciano), and other personal items. There is also a crater on Venus named after Carre√±o. As of June 1, 2015 Andreina G√≥mez began directing a feature film, Teresita y El Piano, about the life of Teresa Carre√±o. In 2018, a Google Doodle was created to celebrate her 165th Birthday. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Albuquerque, Anne E. (1988). Teresa Carre√±o: Pianist, Teacher, and Composer.

The assigned values to unknown points are calculated with a weighted average of the values available at the known points. The name given to this type of methods was motivated by the weighted average applied, since it resorts to the inverse of the distance to each known point (\\"amount of proximity\\") when assigning weights. ==Definition of the problem== The expected result is a discrete assignment of the unknown function u in a study region: :u(x): x \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\quad x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{D} \\\\sub \\\\mathbb{R}^n, where \\\\mathbf{D} is the study region. The set of N known data points can be described as a list of tuples: :[(x_1, u_1), (x_2, u_2), ..., (x_N, u_N)]. The function is to be \\"smooth\\" (continuous and once differentiable), to be exact (u(x_i) = u_i) and to meet the user's intuitive expectations about the phenomenon under investigation. Furthermore, the function should be suitable for a computer application at a reasonable cost (nowadays, a basic implementation will probably make use of parallel resources). == Shepard's method == === Historical reference === At the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, beginning in 1965, a varied collection of scientists converged to rethink, among other things, what we now call geographic information systems. The motive force behind the Laboratory, Howard Fisher, conceived an improved computer mapping program that he called SYMAP, which, from the start, Fisher wanted to improve on the interpolation. He showed Harvard College freshmen his work on SYMAP, and many of them participated in Laboratory events. One freshman, Donald Shepard, decided to overhaul the interpolation in SYMAP, resulting in his famous article from 1968. Shepard‚Äôs algorithm was also influenced by the theoretical approach of William Warntz and others at the Lab who worked with spatial analysis. He conducted a number of experiments with the exponent of distance, deciding on something closer to the gravity model (exponent of -2). Shepard implemented not just basic inverse distance weighting, but also he allowed barriers (permeable and absolute) to interpolation. Other research centers were working on interpolation at this time, particularly University of Kansas and their SURFACE II program. Still, the features of SYMAP were state-of-the-art, even though programmed by an undergraduate. === Basic form === Shepard's interpolation for different power parameters p, from scattered points on the surface z=\\\\exp(-x^2-y^2) A general form of finding an interpolated value u at a given point x based on samples u_i=u(x_i) for i=1,2,...,N using IDW is an interpolating function: :u(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{\\\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{ w_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_i } }{ \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{ w_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) } }, & \\\\text{if } d(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}_i) eq 0 \\\\text{ for all } i, \\\\\\\\\\\\ u_i, & \\\\text{if } d(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}_i) = 0 \\\\text{ for some } i, \\\\end{cases} where :w_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\frac{1}{d(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}_i)^p} is a simple IDW weighting function, as defined by Shepard, x denotes an interpolated (arbitrary) point, xi is an interpolating (known) point, d is a given distance (metric operator) from the known point xi to the unknown point x, N is the total number of known points used in interpolation and p is a positive real number, called the power parameter. Here weight decreases as distance increases from the interpolated points. Greater values of p assign greater influence to values closest to the interpolated point, with the result turning into a mosaic of tiles (a Voronoi diagram) with nearly constant interpolated value for large values of p. For two dimensions, power parameters p \\\\leq 2 cause the interpolated values to be dominated by points far away, since with a density \\\\rho of data points and neighboring points between distances r_0 to R, the summed weight is approximately :\\\\sum_j w_j \\\\approx \\\\int_{r_0}^R \\\\frac{2\\\\pi r\\\\rho \\\\,dr}{r^p} = 2\\\\pi\\\\rho\\\\int_{r_0}^R r^{1-p} \\\\,dr, which diverges for R\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty and p\\\\leq2. For M dimensions, the same argument holds for p\\\\leq M. For the choice of value for p, one can consider the degree of smoothing desired in the interpolation, the density and distribution of samples being interpolated, and the maximum distance over which an individual sample is allowed to influence the surrounding ones. Shepard's method is a consequence of minimization of a functional related to a measure of deviations between tuples of interpolating points {x, u} and i tuples of interpolated points {xi, ui}, defined as: :\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, u) = \\\\left( \\\\sum_{i = 0}^{N}{\\\\frac{(u-u_i)^2}{d(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}_i)^p}} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{p}} , derived from the minimizing condition: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, u)}{\\\\partial u} = 0. The method can easily be extended to other dimensional spaces and it is in fact a generalization of Lagrange approximation into a multidimensional spaces. A modified version of the algorithm designed for trivariate interpolation was developed by Robert J. Renka and is available in Netlib as algorithm 661 in the toms library. === Example in 1 dimension === Shepard's interpolation in 1 dimension, from 4 scattered points and using p = 2 === ≈Åukaszyk‚ÄìKarmowski metric === Yet another modification of the Shepard's method was proposed by ≈Åukaszyk also in applications to experimental mechanics. The proposed weighting function had the form :w_k(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\frac{1}{(D_{**}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{x}_k) )^\\\\frac{1}{2}}, where D_{**}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{x}_k) is the ≈Åukaszyk‚ÄìKarmowski metric chosen also with regard to the statistical error probability distributions of measurement of the interpolated points. === Modified Shepard's method === Another modification of Shepard's method calculates interpolated value using only nearest neighbors within R-sphere (instead of full sample). Weights are slightly modified in this case: :w_k(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\max(0,R-d(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}_k))}{R d(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}_k)} \\\\right)^2. When combined with fast spatial search structure (like kd-tree), it becomes efficient N log N interpolation method suitable for large-scale problems. == References == == See also == * Multivariate interpolation * Kernel density estimation Category:Geostatistics Category:Multivariate interpolation ","title":"Inverse distance weighting"},{"id":"1445177","text":"Extensible programming is a term used in computer science to describe a style of computer programming that focuses on mechanisms to extend the programming language, compiler and runtime environment. Extensible programming languages, supporting this style of programming, were an active area of work in the 1960s, but the movement was marginalized in the 1970s. Extensible programming has become a topic of renewed interest in the 21st century.Gregory V. Wilson, \\"Extensible Programming for the 21st Century\\", ACM Queue 2 no. 9 (Dec/Jan 2004‚Äì2005). == Historical movement == The first paper usuallyStandish, Thomas A., \\"Extensibility in Programming Language Design\\", SIGPLAN Notices 10 no. 7 (July 1975), pp. 18‚Äì21.Sammet, Jean E., Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals, Prentice-Hall, 1969, section III.7.2 associated with the extensible programming language movement is M. Douglas McIlroy's 1960 paper on macros for higher-level programming languages.McIlroy, M.D., \\"Macro Instruction Extensions of Compiler Languages\\", Communications of the ACM 3 no. 4 (April 1960), pp. 214‚Äì220. Another early description of the principle of extensibility occurs in Brooker and Morris's 1960 paper on the Compiler- Compiler.Brooker, R.A. and Morris, D., \\"A General Translation Program for Phrase Structure Languages\\", Journal of the ACM 9 no. 1 (January 1962), pp. 1‚Äì10. The paper was received in 1960. The peak of the movement was marked by two academic symposia, in 1969 and 1971.Christensen, C. and Shaw, C.J., eds., Proceedings of the Extensible Languages Symposium, SIGPLAN Notices 4 no. 8 (August 1969).Schuman, S.A., ed., Proceedings of the International Symposium on Extensible Languages, SIGPLAN Notices 6 no. 12 (December 1971). By 1975, a survey article on the movement by Thomas A. Standish was essentially a post mortem. The Forth programming language was an exception, but it went essentially unnoticed. === Character of the historical movement === As typically envisioned, an extensible programming language consisted of a base language providing elementary computing facilities, and a meta-language capable of modifying the base language. A program then consisted of meta- language modifications and code in the modified base language. The most prominent language-extension technique used in the movement was macro definition. Grammar modification was also closely associated with the movement, resulting in the eventual development of adaptive grammar formalisms. The Lisp language community remained separate from the extensible language community, apparently because, as one researcher observed, > any programming language in which programs and data are essentially > interchangeable can be regarded as an extendible [sic] language. ... this > can be seen very easily from the fact that Lisp has been used as an > extendible language for years.Harrison, M.C., in \\"Panel on the Concept of > Extensibility\\", pp. 53‚Äì54 of the 1969 symposium. At the 1969 conference, Simula was presented as an extensible programming language. Standish described three classes of language extension, which he called paraphrase, orthophrase, and metaphrase (otherwise paraphrase and metaphrase being translation terms). * Paraphrase defines a facility by showing how to exchange it for something previously defined (or to be defined). As examples, he mentions macro definitions, ordinary procedure definitions, grammatical extensions, data definitions, operator definitions, and control structure extensions. * Orthophrase adds features to a language that could not be achieved using the base language, such as adding an i/o system to a base language that previously had no i/o primitives. Extensions must be understood as orthophrase relative to some given base language, since a feature not defined in terms of the base language must be defined in terms of some other language. Orthophrase corresponds to the modern notion of plug- ins. * Metaphrase modifies the interpretation rules used for pre-existing expressions. It corresponds to the modern notion of reflection. === Death of the historical movement === Standish attributed the failure of the extensibility movement to the difficulty of programming successive extensions. An ordinary programmer might build a single shell of macros around a base language, but if a second shell of macros was to be built around that, the programmer would have to be intimately familiar with both the base language and the first shell; a third shell would require familiarity with the base and both the first and second shells; and so on. (Note that shielding the programmer from lower-level details is the intent of the abstraction movement that supplanted the extensibility movement.) Despite the earlier presentation of Simula as extensible, by 1975, Standish's survey does not seem in practice to have included the newer abstraction-based technologies (though he used a very general definition of extensibility that technically could have included them). A 1978 history of programming abstraction from the invention of the computer to the (then) present day made no mention of macros, and gave no hint that the extensible languages movement had ever occurred.Guarino, L.R., \\"The Evolution of Abstraction in Programming Languages\\", CMU-CS-78-120, Department of Computer Science, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pennsylvania, 22 May 1978. Macros were tentatively admitted into the abstraction movement by the late 1980s (perhaps due to the advent of hygienic macros), by being granted the pseudonym syntactic abstractions.Gabriel, Richard P., ed., \\"Draft Report on Requirements for a Common Prototyping System\\", SIGPLAN Notices 24 no. 3 (March 1989), pp. 93ff. == Modern movement == In the modern sense, a system that supports extensible programming will provide all of the features described below. === Extensible syntax === This simply means that the source language(s) to be compiled must not be closed, fixed, or static. It must be possible to add new keywords, concepts, and structures to the source language(s). Languages which allow the addition of constructs with user defined syntax include Camlp4, OpenC++, Seed7,Zingaro, Daniel, \\"Modern Extensible Languages\\", SQRL Report 47 McMaster University (October 2007), page 16. Red, Rebol, and Felix. While it is acceptable for some fundamental and intrinsic language features to be immutable, the system must not rely solely on those language features. It must be possible to add new ones. === Extensible compiler === In extensible programming, a compiler is not a monolithic program that converts source code input into binary executable output. The compiler itself must be extensible to the point that it is really a collection of plugins that assist with the translation of source language input into anything. For example, an extensible compiler will support the generation of object code, code documentation, re-formatted source code, or any other desired output. The architecture of the compiler must permit its users to \\"get inside\\" the compilation process and provide alternative processing tasks at every reasonable step in the compilation process. For just the task of translating source code into something that can be executed on a computer, an extensible compiler should: * use a plug-in or component architecture for nearly every aspect of its function * determine which language or language variant is being compiled and locate the appropriate plug-in to recognize and validate that language * use formal language specifications to syntactically and structurally validate arbitrary source languages * assist with the semantic validation of arbitrary source languages by invoking an appropriate validation plug-in * allow users to select from different kinds of code generators so that the resulting executable can be targeted for different processors, operating systems, virtual machines, or other execution environment. * provide facilities for error generation and extensions to it * allow new kinds of nodes in the abstract syntax tree (AST), * allow new values in nodes of the AST, * allow new kinds of edges between nodes, * support the transformation of the input AST, or portions thereof, by some external \\"pass\\" * support the translation of the input AST, or portions thereof, into another form by some external \\"pass\\" * assist with the flow of information between internal and external passes as they both transform and translate the AST into new ASTs or other representations === Extensible runtime === At runtime, extensible programming systems must permit languages to extend the set of operations that it permits. For example, if the system uses a byte-code interpreter, it must allow new byte-code values to be defined. As with extensible syntax, it is acceptable for there to be some (smallish) set of fundamental or intrinsic operations that are immutable. However, it must be possible to overload or augment those intrinsic operations so that new or additional behavior can be supported. === Content separated from form === Extensible programming systems should regard programs as data to be processed. Those programs should be completely devoid of any kind of formatting information. The visual display and editing of programs to users should be a translation function, supported by the extensible compiler, that translates the program data into forms more suitable for viewing or editing. Naturally, this should be a two-way translation. This is important because it must be possible to easily process extensible programs in a variety of ways. It is unacceptable for the only uses of source language input to be editing, viewing and translation to machine code. The arbitrary processing of programs is facilitated by de-coupling the source input from specifications of how it should be processed (formatted, stored, displayed, edited, etc.). === Source language debugging support === Extensible programming systems must support the debugging of programs using the constructs of the original source language regardless of the extensions or transformation the program has undergone in order to make it executable. Most notably, it cannot be assumed that the only way to display runtime data is in structures or arrays. The debugger, or more correctly 'program inspector', must permit the display of runtime data in forms suitable to the source language. For example, if the language supports a data structure for a business process or work flow, it must be possible for the debugger to display that data structure as a fishbone chart or other form provided by a plugin. ==Examples== * Camlp4 * Felix * Nemerle * Seed7 * Red (programming language) * Rebol * Ruby (programming language) (Metaprogramming) * IMP (programming language) * OpenC++ * XL (programming language) * Forth (programming language) * Scheme (programming language) * Lisp (programming language) * Lua * Racket (programming language) * PL/I == See also == * :Category:Extensible syntax programming languages * Adaptive grammar * Concept programming * Dialecting * Grammar-oriented programming * Language-oriented programming * Homoiconicity == References == == External links == === General === # Greg Wilson's Article in ACM Queue # Slashdot Discussion # Modern Extensible Languages - A paper from Daniel Zingaro === Tools === # MetaL ‚Äî an extensible programming compiler engine implementation # XPS ‚Äî eXtensible Programming System (in development) # MPS ‚Äî JetBrains Metaprogramming system === Programming languages with extensible syntax === # OpenZz # xtc ‚Äî eXTensible C # English-script # Nemerle Macros # Boo Syntactic Macros # Stanford University Intermediate Format compiler # Seed7 - The extensible programming language # Katahdin - a programming language with syntax and semantics that are mutable at runtime # œÄ - another programming language with extensible syntax, implemented using an Earley parser Category:Programming paradigms ","title":"Extensible programming"},{"id":"1445192","text":"The Parent-Child Interaction Assessment-II (PCIA-II; Holigrocki, Kaminski, & Frieswyk, 1999, 2002) is a direct observation procedure. Parents and 3- to 10-year-old children are videotaped as they play at a make-believe zoo. They are presented with a series of story stems and are asked to \\"Play out what happens together.\\" Once the story creation part has finished, they complete the PCIA-II Inquiry video-recall procedure where they are shown selections from their videotape. The videotape is paused; and they are individually interviewed regarding what is happening and what each and the other are doing, thinking, feeling, and wanting. The PCIA-II takes approximately 45 minutes to administer (30 minutes for the videotaped interaction and 15 minutes for the Inquiry) This measure is employed in research and clinical interventions with parent-child dyads. As a research tool, the PCIA-II is used to test hypotheses relevant to clinical psychology, psychiatry, and child development. Clinically, the PCIA-II is used in assessment and treatment. As a psychological assessment measure, information is obtained about parent-child relational functioning and each person's behaviors and cognitions. Videorecordings are analyzed qualitatively and/or quantitatively using a set of parent, child, or relational codes that have demonstrated good psychometric properties (see Holigrocki, 2008). As a treatment, the PCIA-II is a core part of the Modifying Attributions of Parents (PCIA-II/MAP) cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention (Bohr, 2005; Bohr & Holigrocki, 2005). The PCIA-II/MAP begins with the therapist reviewing a PCIA-II pre-treatment recording of the parent and child to identify competency areas as well as areas of parenting difficulties such inaccurate, dysfunctional, or negative attributions. During the intervention sessions, the clinician and parent work together to enhance strengths and recognize and change the parent's attributions. The PCIA-II/MAP is currently being used in treatment and treatment outcome research in Ontario, Canada. Richard Holigrocki, Patricia Kaminski, Siebolt Frieswyk, George Hough, and Karen Shectman developed the PCIA between 1995 and 1997 at The Menninger Clinic and the measure was updated and revised in 2002 by the first three authors. Peter Fonagy, director of the Menninger Child and Family Center, provided consultation for the project. Questions under investigation involve studying the influence of psychopathology of the parent or child on the other member of the dyad; child attachment; parental attunement; the relationship between defense mechanisms, internal representations, and aggression; parenting styles; the efficacy of the PCIA-II/MAP intervention; and cross cultural comparisons between samples collected in Hong Kong and the United States. ==See also== *Child therapy *Attachment measures ==References== * Bohr, Y.

Screws Biography Jackson Source on May 4, 1930 in Clayton, Alabama to Prince Albert (October 16, 1907 ‚Äì January 21, 1995) and Martha Screws (n√©e Upshaw; December 14, 1902 ‚Äì April 25, 1990). The elder of two daughters, Jackson contracted polio at age two, which left her with a noticeable permanent limp. In 1934, her father changed his surname to 'Scruse', and renamed his daughter \\"Katherine Esther\\". Jackson Source As a child, Jackson aspired to become an actress or country singer, but was dismayed to find no notable black country stars. Jackson's parents divorced when she was still a child. Jackson joined her high school band while a student at Washington High School in East Chicago, Indiana. In 1947 she met Joseph \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a fellow resident of East Chicago. Joseph began dating Katherine after obtaining an annulment his earlier marriage. The couple married on November 5, 1949 after dating for a year. In January 1950, they purchased a two-bedroom house in Gary. During the couple's early years in Gary, they sang together, with Joe playing guitar. After the end of Joe's boxing career, he continued working at nearby East Chicago's Inland Steel Company. From 1950 until 1966, Jackson gave birth to 10 children, including twins Marlon and Brandon, the latter of whom died a few hours after birth. ==Jackson family== Joe eventually enlisted Michael and older brother Marlon into the group not as vocalists, but as backing instrumentalists, playing percussion. In 1966, Joe began to see seven-year-old Michael's overall talents two years after Jackson's discovery. Beforehand, Michael had performed onstage without his father's knowledge at several school recitals starting at five. By the end of 1966, Michael was positioned as the second frontman of the group after Jermaine. Acting on advice from a schoolteacher in 1965, Joe changed the group's name to The Jackson Five. In 1967, after winning several talent shows in Gary, Joe Jackson decided to make the group a professional act when Gordon Keith, an owner and vocalist at Gary's Steeltown Records, discovered and signed them to their first contract with him on November 21. Their first single, \\"Big Boy\\",Big Boy, 40th Anniversary http://www.jackson5abc.com/steeltown/ produced by Keith, was released on January 31, 1968. 45 RPM Records \\"Big Boy\\" became a local hit, playing on radio stations in the Chicago-Gary area. During the Jackson 5's 1970‚Äì71 heyday, Jackson ‚Äì along with her three daughters and youngest son ‚Äì was barely mentioned in the press. This changed in 1974 when Joe began building careers around his three younger children and eldest daughter. Jackson started to become part of her husband's management team when the grown-up members of the group (which renamed themselves The Jacksons after splitting from Motown in 1975) reunited for the Victory Tour in 1984. Michael dedicated his 1982 album Thriller to her. Janet Jackson did the same following the release of her 1989 album Rhythm Nation 1814, the first album where she was not under the watchful eye of her father following the success of Control, as Janet had fired him months after its release. In 1985, acknowledging what was then a positive impact on her children's successful music careers, national urban magazine Essence honored her as \\"Mother of the Year\\". Jackson filed for divorce in March 1973 but chose to rescind the divorce papers. Iin August 1974 Joe and Cheryl Terrell's daughter, Joh'Vonnie Jackson, was born; her birth caused Joe and Kathrine to be permanently estanged. Jackson would again file for divorce in 1982. In 1990, Jackson released her autobiography, My Family, The Jacksons, which documented her early years and her relationship with her husband and their children, eight of whom wrote salutes to their mother in the book's foreword. In 1980 Jackson and her two youngest children, Randy and Janet, confronted a woman who worked for Joseph's company, whom Jackson had often reportedly accused of cheating with Joseph. The incident was redramatized for the 1992 miniseries The Jacksons: An American Dream. However, in the miniseries, Jackson was shown confronting Joseph instead of the woman about the alleged incident. During the late 1980s, Jackson began experiencing an estrangement from her daughter La Toya after she was being managed by Jack Gordon. In her 1991 memoir La Toya: Growing Up in the Jackson Family, La Toya alleged that Jackson was emotionally abusive, charges Jackson denied and blamed La Toya's husband for \\"brainwashing\\" her. In 1997, La Toya and her mother reconciled after she filed for divorce from Gordon. Jackson was portrayed by Angela Bassett in the 1992 miniseries The Jacksons: An American Dream. Patricia Idlette portrayed her in the 2004 film Man in the Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story. ==Recent years== Jackson has spent the last couple of decades talking to the press defending her children, mainly Michael, who began to gain notoriety. In an interview promoting her Michael Jackson vip Book/DVD on The Oprah Winfrey Show, however, Jackson acknowledged that she got her husband to admit to physically disciplining their children. Over the years, some claimed that Joe was abusive towards his children, which he continually denied. As of 2011, Jackson resided with her grandson T. J. Jackson, along with his family, at her home in Calabasas, California. Jackson had moved out of her Hayvenhurst home in Encino, California, due to house renovations. Jermaine Jackson related in his 2011 memoir You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes, that Jackson had told her children that she had wanted to see them peform together one last time. One of Michael Jackson's future plans as part of his deal with AEG Live was a final reunion tour with his brothers. She most recently appeared at the BET Awards 2015 with her daughter Janet as she accepted the Ultimate Icon Award. Joe Jackson died from pancreatic cancer on June 27, 2018, aged 89. ==Death of Michael Jackson== On June 25, 2009, Michael died from an overdose of propofol. In July 2009 Katherine and Debbie Rowe, the mother of Michael's two oldest children, reached a settlement pertaining to the care of her children, Prince and Paris, in which the children will be raised by Katherine, and Rowe will have visitation rights and continue to receive the yearly payments to which Michael had agreed. On August 3, 2009, a judge named Jackson as the children's permanent guardian. On July 25, 2012, Jackson's guardianship of the children was suspended by the court amid allegations that she may have been held against her will by several Jackson family members as a result of a financial dispute between those family members and Michael's estate. Guardianship of the children was temporarily given to Michael's nephew, TJ, one of Tito's sons. Katherine Jackson's guardianship resumed with T.J. Jackson added as a co-guardian. On November 1, 2017, Jackson resigned as co-guardian of Michael's youngest son, Blanket. Jackson stated her reasons for resigning included her own advanced age, the fact that Michael's oldest children Prince and Paris were now adults, and that Blanket was now 15 years old. TJ Jackson was, without objection, awarded sole custody of Blanket.Katherine Jackson resigns as Blanket Jackson's co-guardian ==Children== Ten children ‚Äî seven sons and three daughters ‚Äî were born to Katherine and Joe Jackson: *Maureen Reillette \\"Rebbie\\" Jackson (born May 29, 1950) *Sigmund Esco \\"Jackie\\" Jackson (born May 4, 1951) *Toriano Adaryll \\"Tito\\" Jackson (born October 15, 1953) *Jermaine La Jaune Jackson (born December 11, 1954) *La Toya Yvonne Jackson (born May 29, 1956) *Marlon David Jackson (born March 12, 1957); 2 months premature *Brandon David Jackson (born and died March 12, 1957); 2 months premature *Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) *Steven Randall \\"Randy\\" Jackson (born October 29, 1961) *Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) ==References== ==External Links== Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:African-American people Category:American Jehovah's Witnesses Category:American autobiographers Category:Converts to Jehovah's Witnesses Category:Former Baptists Katherine Jackson Category:People from Clayton, Alabama Category:People from East Chicago, Indiana Category:People from Gary, Indiana Category:People from Los Angeles Category:People with polio Category:Women autobiographers ","title":"Katherine Jackson"},{"id":"1445200","text":"{ style=\\"width:170px;\\" align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" -  } Birdlings Flat, originally named Te Mata Hapuku, is a settlement in Canterbury, New Zealand, close to the shore of Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora. William Birdling (1822‚Äì1902) Fishing at Birdling's Flat Pebbles from Birdling's Flat Birdling's Flat also commonly refers to the nearby pebble beach that is part of Kaitorete Spit. The beach is well known as a place to find small agates and a variety of other attractive rounded pebbles. Due to strong ocean currents, swimming and surfing is not advised. Birdlings Flat is named for the Birdling family, who were the first European Settlers to farm the area. William Birdling was the first member of the Birdling family to arrive in New Zealand. He was employed by George Rhodes in 1843 to come to Banks Peninsula and work as his overseer. William built a house, Waikoko, in the area which was later to bear his name. On 16 May 1882, a branch line railway was opened to Birdlings Flat from a junction with the Southbridge Branch in Lincoln. This line became known as the Little River Branch, with the extension to Little River opened on 11 March 1886. The railway served Birdlings Flat until its closure on 30 June 1962. The railway's old formation remained well preserved and has now been revitalised into a public walking and cycling track, the Little River Rail Trail. It has been used as a launch site for sounding rockets. The University of Canterbury has a meteorological research station based there.

It is a nationwide autonomous Local of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. It organizes designers, artists, and craftspeople in the entertainment and decorative arts industries. The organization was part of International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades, however it reaffiliated with IATSE in 1999. United Scenic Artists was organized to protect craft standards, working conditions and wages for the entertainment and decorative arts industries. The members of Local USA 829 are Artists and Designers working in film, theatre, opera, ballet, television, industrial shows, commercials and exhibitions. The current membership totals nearly 3,800. USA 829 establishes wages for designers and artists, and negotiates with employers the best possible terms and conditions of employment, as well as Health Insurance and Retirement benefits through employer contributions of Pension, Welfare, 401(k) and Annuity plans.http://www.usa829.org/Home/Introduction.aspx Local USA 829 currently has many Collective Bargaining Agreements some of which include: *National: League of Resident Theatres (LORT) *Eastern Region: Broadway, Opera, Ballet, ABC, CBS, NBC; Scenic Suppliers in New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Florida; Motion Pictures in New York, New England and Philadelphia; AICP Commercials. *Central Region: Scenic Suppliers and theatre and opera Scenic Shops in Chicago and St. Louis; The Court and Victory Gardens Theatres, Chicago Opera Theatre, St. Louis MUNY, CBS, NBC. *Western Region: The Ahmanson Theatre, the Los Angeles Opera and the San Francisco Opera; The Marin Theatre Company and The Magic Theatre; Seattle Children's Theatre.http://www.usa829.org/Home/Introduction.aspx ==History== The union of Scenic Artists was founded in 1895 under the title \\"the United Scenic Artists Association\\", which was briefly a local of the IATSE. Eventually the AFL-CIO ruled that the local must leave the IATSE and join the painters union. The organization instead chose to be independent. This lasted until 1918 when jurisdictional encroachment forced an affiliation with the IBPAT. However, the Brotherhood was guaranteed complete autonomy in its historical and traditional jurisdiction. On June 21, 1918, at their regular meeting at Geneva Hall in New York City, the Scenic Artists voted to accept a charter as United Scenic Artists of America (hence the USAA still seen in the union‚Äôs logo) being Local 829, an autonomous local of the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paper Hangers of America. From that time on, Local 829 grew to include Scenic, Costume and Lighting Designers, Mural and Diorama Artists, Scenic Painters, Production Designers and Art Directors, Commercial Costume Stylists, Storyboard Artists and most recently Computer Artists, Art Department Coordinators, Sound Designers and Projection Designers working in all areas of the entertainment industry. In 1983, a group of West Coast designers chose to affiliate with United Scenic Artists, and the Union opened a Los Angeles Regional office to serve them. In March 1990, a merger with IBPAT Local 350 in Chicago was effected and thereby jurisdiction was gained throughout the United States. Finally, on April 27 of 1999, after decades of suffering from a debilitating lack of common interest with the IBPAT, the membership of United Scenic Artists Local 829 voted by an overwhelming majority to re-affiliate with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) and to disaffiliate from the IBPAT. The vote reflected a belief that the IATSE, an entertainment union, would provide better representation for United Scenic Artists, who work in every type of theatrical, dance, motion picture, television, opera, and commercial production in the United States and around the world. At a special meeting of the IA‚Äôs General Executive Board, United Scenic Artist‚Äôs request for re-affiliation was unanimously approved and United Scenic Artists, Local USA 829, IATSE was born. The members of IATSE Local USA 829 (so named because another Local 829 already existed in the IA) now enjoy full membership rights in the IATSE. In its hundred-ten-plus years of existence, the local has negotiated Agreements with major film studios, television networks, the Broadway League, the League of Resident Theatres (LORT), numerous scenery supply companies, opera companies, ballet companies, and numerous independent production companies.http://www.usa829.org/AboutUs/History.aspx ==Membership== Local USA 829 currently admits members into the following Categories or Classifications of Membership SCENIC ARTIST Lay-out, surface decoration, sculpting, mold- making, casting and painting of scenery and properties for all media, plus the execution of models, miniatures, matte-shots and some graphics for motion pictures, commercials and television.

Before his arrest in 1984 he was successively a journalist, a junior Norwegian Labour Party politician and a medium-level official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Norway. Treholt's espionage is generally seen as the most serious spy case in the modern history of Norway. He was arrested in 1984 and sentenced to 20 years in prison the following year, of which he served nine in a maximum security prison. After his release from prison in 1992, Treholt moved to Russia where he started a company together with a former KGB general. Following his arrest Treholt was described as \\"the greatest traitor to Norway since Quisling.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/29/world/portrait-of-spy-as-golden- young-man.html After his release from prison Treholt has occasionally been active in public debate, and he has been accused by Norwegian media of promoting Russian propaganda.\\"Kjell Dragnes: \\"Russland med front mot Norge\\" (Aftenposten, 7. januar 2020) ==Career== He was a member of the Norwegian Labour Party and also worked as a journalist for Arbeiderbladet. He was political secretary for the minister of commerce Jens Evensen before he became deputy foreign minister in the bureau of maritime affairs (1976‚Äì1978). From 1979 to 1982 he was connected to the Norwegian UN delegation in New York as an embassy counsellor. During the years 1982‚Äì1983 he studied at the Norwegian Joint Staff College. He was also department head of division for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' press from 1983.Arne Treholt med selvbiografi ==Investigation leading to arrest== Treholt was placed under surveillance by Norwegian counterintelligence services for several years of his career in the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) and the Norwegian ministry of foreign affairs. On 20 January 1984, he was arrested by √òrnulf Tofte, head of counter-intelligence, at Oslo Airport on his way to Vienna to meet with KGB officers. The police conducted two searches of Treholt's apartment. In May 1982, they found 10,000 USD in a suitcase. In August 1983 they found 30,000 USD in the same suitcase. Treholt and his lawyer later alleged that Norwegian counterintelligence services produced this evidence themselves, and that the police and the judges conspired to cheat with the cash evidence, to make it appear as if the money came from the KGB. These allegations have been refuted as untrue. Furthermore, Treholt during the trial admitted to having received \\"expenses\\" from the KGB, but claimed that it could \\"only\\" have been 26,000 or 27,000 USD. Tapes from the trial, that were released in 2014, show that the notes in the suitcase were 50- and 100-dollar notes, and not as the verdict states: 20- and 50-dollar notes.Lydopptak avdekker feil i Treholt-dommen ==Trial and conviction== Following a much publicized trial presided over by Astri Rynning, Treholt was convicted for treason and sentenced to 20 years in prison, one year short of the maximum sentence allowed under the Norwegian penal code. The conviction included espionage for the Soviet Union and Iraq, and high treason. Treholt was convicted and sentenced for passing classified material to KGB in the period 1974‚Äì1983 and to the Iraqi Intelligence Service 1981‚Äì1983. The sentence also encompassed handing over secrets obtained at the Norwegian Joint Staff College where he was enrolled with authorization from the non-socialist coalition government. Despite the fact that the government of Prime Minister K√•re Willoch knew that he was under suspicion of espionage, he was admitted so as not to reveal the suspicions harboured by the authorities. The trial led to a heated and extensive public debate about the Treholt case in Norway. The controversy concerned the evidence, and lack thereof, against Treholt, the conduct of the police and prosecuting authorities, and what was viewed as lenient treatment of Treholt while he was under suspicion. ==Incarceration and release== Ila Prison Treholt was incarcerated in Drammen Prison from 1984 to 1985. He was transferred to Ila Prison, a maximum security prison for dangerous criminals, in 1985. In 1986, prison officials discovered that he planned to break out, and he was swiftly transferred to another maximum security prison for long term inmates, Ullersmo Prison. On 3 July 1992 he was reprieved by the Labour government of Gro Harlem Brundtland. His pardon by Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour government in 1992, was controversial.Stein Vale: Teppefall i Treholtsaken, Oslo 2009, p. 222-224 He was imprisoned for more than 8 years. ==2008 Criminal Cases Review Commission rejection of case review== On 15 December 2008 the Norwegian Criminal Cases Review Commission (Gjenopptakelseskommisjon) ruled that the case would not be reviewed. The decision is final and cannot be appealed. As a result of the decision, the prosecutor who handled the case in 2008, Stein Vale, wrote a book to summarize the case. The book ‚Äì Teppefall i Treholtsaken (\\"Curtain falls on the Treholt case\\") ‚Äì was published in September 2009. The chairwoman of the review commission, Janne Kristiansen, was appointed as head of the Norwegian Police Security Service (Politiets sikkerhetstjeneste), the descendant organization of the Police surveillance service (Politets overv√•kningstjeneste). Kristiansen and the PST would be defending the former POT from allegations of evidence tampering later on. ==2010 claims by Geir Selvik Malthe-S√∏renssen== In September 2010, a new book by the con artist Geir Selvik Malthe-S√∏renssen, who then claimed to be a private investigator, claimed that the searches of Treholt's apartment had not taken place and that one of the pieces of evidence presented in court had been fabricated by the police. On 18 September 2010, the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten wrote that an anonymous former counter-intelligence employee claimed Treholt's and his lawyer's claim of evidence fabrication was true, but a few days later the anonymous alleged former employee withdrew many of his claims, stating that he didn't know.http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10036613 The Attorney General asked the Criminal Cases Review Commission to look at the case again in light of the recent claims. The Attorney General stated that he did not believe the outcome of the case would have been any different without the evidence in question. Malthe-S√∏renssen was publicly exposed as a fraudster in 2016, and his alleged source was revealed by Verdens Gang to be a used car salesman and convicted murderer and con artist with no connection to the Treholt case, who was paid by Malthe-S√∏renssen to impersonate a police security service employee.Treholt-bl√∏ffen, VGForfalskeren, VGHelen S√¶ter om Treholt-bl√∏ffen: - Ikke overrasket, VG ==2010 investigation by the Criminal Cases Review Commission== On 24 September 2010, the Norwegian Criminal Cases Review Commission decided to reopen its investigation of the case, previously closed in 2008. On 9 June 2011, the commission decided that the Arne Treholt criminal case would not be reopened. Based on interviews with 29 witnesses (18 of whom were former police investigators who had been involved in the Treholt investigation) as well as forensic studies of photographs, negatives and documents, the commission unanimously concluded that there was no basis to suggest that evidence against Treholt had been tampered with or had been fabricated. In a 59-page document, the commission completely discounted the allegations made in the 2010 book. After the verdict, PST-director Kristiansen, who had denied re-openening the case in 2008, demanded an apology from Treholts supporters. The demand was rejected. ==2014 claims by Geir Selvik Malthe-S√∏renssen== In 2014 Treholt's lawyer Harald Stabell claimed to have been tipped off by an employee of Police Security Service that his law office had been under audio surveillance in 2010 and 2011. After Geir Selvik Malthe-S√∏renssen had been exposed as a fraudster in 2016, Stabell stated that the source of this claim was Malthe-S√∏renssen and not an employee of the Police Security Service.Gjenopptar etterforskning av p√•st√•tt advokat- avlytting, Hegnar.noPolitiet gjenopptar etterforskning av p√•st√•tt Stabell- avlytting, VG ==Personal life== In 1987, he married Renee Michelle Steele (1968‚Äì92), a fellow inmate until her release.

In 2013, Smithsonian named it one of \\"20 Most Iconic Foods in America\\". Its name evokes comparison to chili con carne, but the two are dissimilar in consistency, flavors and serving methods, which for Cincinnati chili more resemble Greek pasta sauces and the spiced-meat hot dog topping sauces seen in other parts of the United States. Ingredients include ground beef, water or stock, tomato paste, spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, cumin, chili powder, bay leaf, and in some home recipes unsweetened dark chocolate in a soupy consistency. The most popular order is a 'three-way', which adds shredded cheddar cheese to the chili-topped spaghetti ('two-way'), while serving it 'four-' or 'five-ways' comes from addition of chopped onions and/or beans. Dishes are often served with oyster crackers and a mild hot sauce. Cincinnati chili is almost never served or eaten by the bowl. While served in many local restaurants, it is most often associated with the over 250 independent and chain \\"chili parlors\\" (restaurants specializing in Cincinnati chili) found throughout greater Cincinnati with franchise locations throughout Ohio and in Kentucky, Indiana, Florida, and the Middle East. The dish is the Cincinnati area's best-known regional food. ==Origins and history== Cincinnati chili originated with immigrant restaurateurs from Greece who were trying to expand their customer base by moving beyond narrowly ethnic styles of cuisine. Slavic Macedonians Tom and John Kiradjieff immigrated from Argos Orestiko, fleeing the Balkan Wars, ethnic rivalries, and bigotry, in 1921. They began serving a \\"stew with traditional Mediterranean spices\\" as a topping for hot dogs which they called \\"coneys\\" in 1922 at their hot dog stand located next to a burlesque theater called the Empress, which they named their business after. Tom Kiradjieff used the sauce to modify a traditional Greek dish, speculated to have been pastitsio, moussaka or saltsa kima to come up with a dish he called chili spaghetti. He first developed a recipe calling for the spaghetti to be cooked in the chili but changed his method in response to customer requests and began serving the sauce as a topping, eventually adding grated cheese as a topping for both the chili spaghetti and the coneys, also in response to customer requests. To make ordering more efficient, the brothers created the \\"way\\" system of ordering. The style has since been copied and modified by many other restaurant proprietors, often fellow Greek and Macedonian immigrants who had worked at Empress restaurants before leaving to open their own chili parlors, often following the business model to the point of locating their restaurants adjacent to theaters. Skyline Chili location in Cincinnati Gold Star Chili restaurant interior Empress was the largest chili parlor chain in Cincinnati until 1949, when a former Empress employee and Greek immigrant, Nicholas Lambrinides, started Skyline Chili. In 1965, four brothers named Daoud, immigrants from Jordan, bought a restaurant called Hamburger Heaven from a former Empress employee. They noticed that the Cincinnati chili was outselling the hamburgers on their menu and changed the restaurant's name to Gold Star Chili. As of 2015, Skyline (over 130 locations) and Gold Star (89 locations) were the largest Cincinnati chili parlor chains, while Empress had only two remaining locations, down from over a dozen during the chain's most successful period. Besides Empress, Skyline, and Gold Star, there are also smaller chains such as Dixie Chili and Deli and numerous independents including the acclaimed Camp Washington Chili. Other independents include Pleasant Ridge Chili, Blue Ash Chili, Park Chili Parlor, Price Hill Chili, Chili Time, Orlando based Cincinnati Chili Company, and the Blue Jay Restaurant, in all totalling more than 250 chili parlors. In 1985 one of the founders of Gold Star Chili, Fahid Daoud, returned to Jordan, where he opened his own parlor, called Chili House. Outside of Jordan, Chili House as of 2020 had locations in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Oman, Palestine, Turkey and Qatar. In addition to the chili parlors, some version of Cincinnati chili is commonly served at many local restaurants. Arnold's Bar and Grill, the oldest bar in the city, serves a vegetarian \\"Cincy Lentils\\" dish ordered in \\"ways.\\" Melt Eclectic Cafe offers a vegan 3-way. For Restaurant Week 2018, a local mixologist developed a cocktail called \\"Manhattan Skyline,\\" a Cincinnati chili-flavored whiskey cocktail. The history of Cincinnati chili shares many factors in common with the apparently independent but simultaneous development of the Coney Island hot dog in other areas of the United States. \\"Virtually all\\" were developed by Greek or Macedonian immigrants who passed through Ellis Island as they fled the fallout from the Balkan Wars in the first two decades of the twentieth century. ==Preparation, ordering, serving and eating== Raw ground beef is crumbled in water and/or stock, tomato paste and seasonings are added, and the mixture is brought to a boil and then simmered for several hours to form a thin meat sauce. Many recipes call for an overnight chill in the refrigerator to allow for easy skimming of fat and to allow flavors to develop, then reheating to serve. Typical proportions are 2 pounds of ground beef to 4 cups of water and 6 oz tomato paste to make 8 servings. ===The \\"way\\" system=== Partially eaten 5-way from Skyline, garnished with oyster crackers Ordering Cincinnati chili is based on a specific ingredient series: chili, spaghetti, shredded cheddar cheese, diced onions, and kidney beans. The number before the \\"way\\" of the chili determines which ingredients are included in each chili order. Customers order a: * Two-way: spaghetti topped with chili (also called \\"chili spaghetti\\") * Three-way: spaghetti, chili, and cheese * Four-way onion: spaghetti, chili, onions, and cheese * Four-way bean: spaghetti, chili, beans, and cheese * Five-way: spaghetti, chili, beans, onions, and cheese Skyline cheese coney (hot dog topped with Cincinnati-style chili, mustard, onions, and a heap of shredded cheese) Some chili parlors will also serve the dish \\"inverted\\": cheese on the bottom, so that it melts. Some restaurants, among them Skyline and Gold Star, do not use the term \\"four-way bean\\", instead using the term \\"four-way\\" to denote a three-way plus the customer's choice of onions or beans. Some restaurants may add extra ingredients to the way system; for example, Dixie Chili offers a \\"six-way\\", which adds chopped garlic to a five-way. Cincinnati chili is also used as a hot dog topping to make a \\"coney\\", a regional variation on the Coney Island chili dog, which is topped with shredded cheddar cheese to make a \\"cheese coney\\". The standard coney also includes mustard and chopped onion. The \\"three-way\\" and the cheese coney are the most popular orders. Very few customers order a bowl of plain chili. Most chili parlors do not offer plain chili as a regular menu item. Polly Campbell, food editor of The Cincinnati Enquirer, calls ordering a bowl of chili, \\"Ridiculous. Would you order a bowl of spaghetti sauce? Because that's what you're doing.\\" ===Serving and eating=== Ways and coneys are traditionally served in a shallow oval bowl. Oyster crackers are usually served with Cincinnati chili, and a mild hot sauce such as Tabasco is frequently available to be used as an optional topping to be added at the table. Locals eat Cincinnati chili as if it were a casserole, cutting each bite with the side of the fork instead of twirling the noodles. ==Misnomer== The name \\"Cincinnati chili\\" is often confusing to those unfamiliar with it because the term \\"chili\\" evokes the expectation of chili con carne, which it \\"bears no resemblance to.\\" Cincinnati chili is a Mediterranean-spiced meat sauce for spaghetti or hot dogs, and is very seldom eaten by the bowl as is typical with chili con carne. It is common for Cincinnatians to describe it starting with, \\"Well, it's not really chili...\\" Cincinnati Enquirer food editor Chuck Martin and Cincinnati Magazine dining editor Donna Covrett agree, \\"It is not chili.\\" Cincinnati chili is always seasoned with cinnamon, allspice, cloves, cumin, nutmeg, and chili powder. Many home recipes call for a small amount of dark unsweetened chocolate, but according to Dann Woellert, author of The Authentic History of Cincinnati Chili, \\"There is no chili parlor in Cincinnati that uses chocolate in its chili.\\" It is normally of a thin consistency, closer to a soup than a stew, and contains no vegetables or chunks of meat, though it is common to find large pieces of cayenne pepper hulls in Empress chili. The flavors, consistency and serving method are more similar to Greek pasta sauces or the spiced meat sauces used to top hot dogs in Rochester and other parts of Upstate New York, Rhode Island, and Michigan than they are to chili con carne. ==Reception== Cincinnati chili is the area's \\"best known regional food\\". According to the Greater Cincinnati Convention and Visitors Bureau, Cincinnatians consume more than of Cincinnati chili each year, topped by of shredded cheddar cheese. Overall industry revenues were $250 million in 2014. Anthony Bourdain called it \\"the story of America on your plate\\". National food critics Jane and Michael Stern wrote, \\"As connoisseurs of blue-plate food, we consider Cincinnati chili one of America's quintessential meals\\" and \\"one of this nation's most distinctive regional plates of food\\". Huffington Post named it one of \\"15 Beloved Regional Dishes\\". In 2000, Camp Washington Chili won a James Beard Foundation America's Classics Award. In 2013, Smithsonian named Cincinnati chili one of \\"20 Most Iconic Foods in America\\", calling out Camp Washington Chili as their destination of choice. John McIntyre, writing in The Baltimore Sun, called it \\"the most perfect of fast foods\\", and, referring to the misnomer, opined that \\"if the Greeks who invented it nearly a century ago had called it something other than chili, the [chili] essentialists would be able to enjoy it.\\" In 2015, Thrillist named it \\"the one food you must eat in Ohio\\". Eater called it \\"America's most controversial plate of pasta\\". It is common for those unfamiliar with it, confused by the misnomer and expecting chili con carne, to \\"scorn it\\" as a poor example of chili. A 2013 piece published by the sports and culture website Deadspin went so far as to call it \\"horrifying diarrhea sludge\\". ==In popular culture== Blues musician Lonnie Mack, who was born and raised just outside Cincinnati, released a guitar instrumental called Camp Washington Chili on his 1986 album Second Sight. Country music duo Big & Rich sang about flying through Cincinnati and grabbing a bowl of Skyline chili in their song \\"Comin' to Your City\\" on the 2005 album of the same name. Cincinnati chili is used allegorically as a symbol for vapid social interaction and social disconnection in the 2015 animated film Anomalisa, as the main character when on a business trip to Cincinnati is exhorted in multiple banal encounters to try the local specialty. ==Similar dishes== * Chili dog, the generic term for a hot dog topped with meat sauce * Chili John's, founded in Green Bay, Wisconsin by a Lithuanian immigrant, offers \\"Green Bay chili\\", a dish similar to a five-way created in 1913 * Chili mac, which tops pasta with chili con carne rather than Cincinnati chili * Coney Island hot dog, a dish similar to a coney developed by Greek-Macedonian immigrants, apparently independently, across the Midwest ==See also== * Cuisine of the Midwestern United States * List of regional dishes of the United States * Filipino spaghetti, another example of a fusion-cuisine spaghetti dish * Barbecue spaghetti, another fusion-cuisine spaghetti dish ==References== ==External links== * Category:Chili con carne Category:American stews Category:Cuisine of Cincinnati Category:Greek-American cuisine Category:Macedonian American history Category:Meat-based sauces Category:Tomato sauces Category:Spaghetti dishes Category:Hot dogs ","title":"Cincinnati chili"},{"id":"1445252","text":"Ruggiero is recruited by Boston Blades with # 8 Caitlyn Cahow and # 22 Kacey Bellamy during a special draft on August 12th, 2010 Angela Marie Ruggiero (born January 3, 1980) is an American former ice hockey defenseman, gold medalist, and four-time Olympian.

Periods of Cyprus's ancient history from 1050 BC have been named according to styles of pottery as follows: * Cypro-Geometric I: 1050‚Äì950 BC * Cypro-Geometric II: 950‚Äì850 BC * Cypro-Geometric III: 850‚Äì700 BC * Cypro-Archaic I: 700‚Äì600 BC * Cypro-Archaic II: 600‚Äì475 BC * Cypro-Classical I: 475‚Äì400 BC * Cypro-Classical II: 400‚Äì323 BC The documented history of Cyprus begins in the 8th century BC. The town of Kition, now Larnaka, recorded part of the ancient history of Cyprus on a stele that commemorated a victory by Sargon II (722‚Äì705 BC) of Assyria there in 709 BC.http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=291290&partId;=1Yon, M., Malbran-Labat, F. 1995: \\"La st√®le de Sargon II √† Chypre\\", in A. Caubet (ed.), Khorsabad, le palais de Sargon II, roi d‚ÄôAssyrie, Paris, 159‚Äì179. Assyrian domination of Cyprus (known as Iatnanna by the Assyrians) appears to have begun earlier than this, during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III (744‚Äì727 BC), and ended with the fall of the Neo Assyrian Empire in 609 BC, whereupon the city-kingdoms of Cyprus gained independence once more. Following a brief period of Egyptian domination in the sixth century BC, Cyprus fell under Persian rule. The Persians did not interfere in the internal affairs of Cyprus, leaving the city-kingdoms to continue striking their own coins and waging war amongst one another, until the late-fourth century BC saw the overthrow of the Persian Empire by Alexander the Great. Jug with Scenic Decoration, Cyprus, 800‚Äì600 BC, Neues Museum, Berlin Alexander's conquests only served to accelerate an already clear drift towards Hellenisation in Cyprus. His premature death in 323 BC led to a period of turmoil as Ptolemy I Soter and Demetrius I of Macedon fought together for supremacy in that region, but by 294 BC, the Ptolemaic kingdom had regained control and Cyprus remained under Ptolemaic rule until 58 BC, when it became a Roman province. During this period, Phoenician and native Cypriot traits disappeared, together with the old Cypriot syllabic script, and Cyprus became thoroughly Hellenised. Cyprus figures prominently in the early history of Christianity, being the first province of Rome to be ruled by a Christian governor, in the first century, and providing a backdrop for events in the New Testament ==Early history== ===Mycenaean settlement=== The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus (5th century BC) claims that the city of Kourion, near present-day Limassol, was founded by Achaean settlers from Argos. He supports the discovery of a Late Bronze Age settlement lying several kilometres from the site of the remains of the Hellenic city of Kourion, whose pottery and architecture indicate that Mycenaean settlers did indeed arrive and augment an existing population in this part of Cyprus in the twelfth century BC.Christou, Demos, 1986. Kourion: A Complete Guide to Its Monuments and Local Museum. Filokipros Publishing Co. Ltd., Nicosia. Introduction, p 7. The kingdom of Kourion in Cyprus is recorded on an inscription dating to the period of the Pharaoh Ramses III (1186‚Äì1155 BC) in Egypt. ===Assyrian conquest=== An early written source of Cypriot history mentions the nation under Assyrian rule as stele found in 1845 in the city formerly named Kition, near present-day Larnaka, commemorates the victory of King Sargon II (721‚Äì05 BC) in 709 BC over seven kings in the land of Ia', in the district of Iadnana or Atnana.Na'aman, N., 'Sargon II and the rebellion of the Cypriote kings against Shilta of Tyre', Orientalia 67 (1998), 239‚Äì247 [reprinted in N. Na'aman, Ancient Israel and its neighbors: interaction and counteraction (Collected essays, vol. 1), Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2005, 118‚Äì128]. The land of Ia' is assumed to be the Assyrian name for Cyprus, and some scholars suggest that the latter may mean 'the islands of the Danaans', or Greece. There are other inscriptions referring to the land of Ia' in Sargon's palace at Khorsabad.Radner, K. 2010: \\"The Stele of Sargon II of Assyria at Kition: A focus for an emerging Cypriot identity?‚Äù, in R. Rollinger, B. Gufler, M. Lang, I. Madreiter (eds), Interkulturalit√§t in der Alten Welt: Vorderasien, Hellas, √Ñgypten und die vielf√§ltigen Ebenen des Kontakts, Wiesbaden, 429‚Äì449. The ten kingdoms listed on the prism of Esarhaddon in 673‚Äì2 BC have been identified as Soloi, Salamis, Paphos, Kourion, Amathus and Kition on the coast, and Tamassos, Ledrai, Idalion and Chytroi in the interior of the island. Later inscriptions add Marion, Lapithos and Kerynia (Kyrenia). ===Independent city-kingdoms=== Ancient city-kingdoms of Cyprus Cyprus gained independence after 627 BC following the death of Ashurbanipal, the last great Assyrian king. Cemeteries from this period are chiefly rock-cut tombs. They have been found, among other locations, at Tamassos, Soloi, Patriki and Trachonas. The rock-cut 'Royal' tombs at Tamassos, built in about 600 BC, imitate wooden houses. The pillars show Phoenician influence. Some graves contain the remains of horses and chariots. The main deity of ancient Cyprus was the Great Goddess, the Assyro-Babylonian Ishtar, and Phoenician Astarte, later known by the Greek name Aphrodite.Frazer, J G, 1922, reprinted 1996. The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion. Abridged edition, with an introduction by George W Stocking, Jr. XXXI, Adonis in Cyprus, pp 397‚Äì404. Penguin Books Limited. She was called \\"the Cypriote\\" by Homer. Paphian inscriptions call her \\"the Queen\\". Pictures of Aphrodite appear on the coins of Salamis as well, demonstrating that her cult had a larger regional influence. In addition, the King of Paphos was the High Priest of Aphrodite. Other Gods venerated include the Phoenician Anat, Baal, Eshmun, Reshef, Mikal and Melkart and the Egyptian Hathor, Thoth, Bes and Ptah, as attested by amulets. Animal sacrifices are attested to on terracotta-votives. The Sanctuary of Ayia Irini contained over 2,000 figurines. ==Egyptian period== In 570 BCE, Cyprus was conquered by Egypt under Amasis II. This brief period of Egyptian domination left its influence mainly in the arts, especially sculpture, where the rigidity and the dress of the Egyptian style can be observed. Cypriot artists later discarded this Egyptian style in favour of Greek prototypes. Statues in stone often show a mixture of Egyptian and Greek influence. In particular, ceramics recovered on Cyprus show influence from ancient Crete. Men often wore Egyptian wigs and Assyrian-style beards. Armour and dress showed western Asiatic elements as well. == Persian period == Achaemenid empire at its greatest extent In 525 BCE, the Persian Achaemenid Empire conquered Cyprus. Under the Persians, the Kings of Cyprus retained their independence but had to pay tribute to their overlord. The city-kingdoms began to strike their own coins in the late-sixth century BCE, using the Persian weight system. Coins minted by the kings were required to have the overlord's portrait on them. King Evelthon of Salamis (560‚Äì25 BCE) was probably the first to cast silver or bronze coins in Cyprus; the coins were designed with a ram on the obverse and an ankh (Egyptian symbol of good luck) on the reverse. Royal palaces have been excavated in Palaepaphos and in Vouni in the territory of Marion on the North coast. They closely follow Persian examples like Persepolis. Vouni, on a hill overlooking Morphou Bay, was built around 520 BCE and destroyed in 380 BCE. It contained Royal audience chambers (liwan), open courtyards, bathhouses and stores. Towns in Cyprus during this period were fortified with mudbrick walls on stone foundations and rectangular bastions. The houses were constructed of mud-bricks as well, whereas public buildings were faced with ashlar. The Phoenician town of Carpasia, near Rizokarpasso (), had houses built of rubble masonry with square stone blocks forming the corners. Temples and sanctuaries were built mainly in a Phoenician style. Soloi had a small temple with a Greek plan. A definite influence from Greece was responsible for the production of some very important sculptures. The archaic Greek art with its attractive smile on the face of the statue is found on many Cypriot pieces dating between 525‚Äì475 BCE; that is, the closing years of the Archaic period in Greece. During the Persian rule, Ionian influence on the sculptures intensified; copies of Greek korai appear, as well as statues of men in Greek dress. Naked kouroi, however, although common in Greece, are extremely rare in Cyprus, while women (Korai) are always presented dressed with rich folds in their garments. The pottery in Cyprus retained its local influences, although some Greek pottery was imported. The most important obligation of the kings of Cyprus to the Shah of Persia was the payment of tribute and the supply of armies and ships for his foreign campaigns. Thus, when Xerxes in 480 BC invaded Greece, Cyprus contributed 150 ships to the Persian military expedition. === Ionian revolt === Except for the royal city of Amathus, the Kingdoms of Cyprus took part in the Ionian Revolt in 499 BC. The revolt on Cyprus was led by Onesilos of Salamis, brother of the King of Salamis, whom he dethroned for not wanting to fight for independence. The Persians crushed the Cypriot armies and laid siege to the fortified towns in 498 BCE. Soloi surrendered after a five-month siege. Around 450 BCE, Kition annexed Idalion with Persian help. The importance of Kition increased again when it acquired the Tamassos copper-mines. ===Evagoras I of Salamis=== Evagoras I of Salamis (435‚Äì374 BCE) dominated Cypriot politics for almost forty years until his death in 374 BCE. He had favoured Athens during the closing years of the Peloponnesian War, elicited Persian support for the Athenians against Sparta and urged Greeks from the Aegean to settle in Cyprus, assisting the Athenians in so many ways that they honoured him by erecting his statue in the Stoa (portico) Basileios in Athens. At the beginning of the 4th century BC, he took control of the whole island of Cyprus and within a few years was attempting to gain independence from Persia with Athenian help. Following resistance from the kings of Kition, Amathus and Soli, who fled to the great king of Persia in 390 BC to request support, Evagoras received less help from the Athenians than he had hoped for and in about 380 BCE, a Persian force besieged Salamis and Evagoras was forced to surrender. In the end, he remained king of Salamis until he was murdered in 374 BCE, but only by accepting his role as a vassal of Persia. Evagoras I of Salamis introduced the Greek alphabet to Cyprus. In other parts of the island, the Phoenician script (Kition) or the Cypriot syllabic alphabet were still used. Together with Egypt and Phoenicia, Cyprus rebelled against Persian rule again in 350 BCE, but the uprising was crushed by Artaxerxes III in 344 BCE. ==Hellenistic period== Map of Alexander's empire. ===Alexander the Great=== Long and sustained efforts to overthrow Persian rule proved unsuccessful and Cyprus remained a vassal of the Persian Empire until the Persian's defeat by Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great (Alexander of Macedon and Alexander III of Macedon), was born in Pella in 356 BC and died in Babylon in 323 BCE. Son of King Philip II and Olympias, he succeeded his father to the throne of Macedonia in 336 BC at the age of 20. He was perhaps the greatest commander in history and led his army in a series of victorious battles, creating a vast empire that stretched from Greece to Egypt in Africa and to the Caspian Sea and India. The various kingdoms of Cyprus became allies of Alexander following his victorious campaigns at Granicus (334 BC), Issus (333 BCE) and on the coast of Asia Minor, Syria and Phoenicia, where Persian naval bases were situated. The Cypriot kings, learning of the victory of Alexander at Issus, and knowing that sooner or later, Alexander would be the new ruler of the island, since the occupation of Cyprus was necessary (along with that of Phoenicia) to open lines of communication to Egypt and Asia, rose up against their Persian overlords and made available to the fleet of Alexander the ships formerly in the service of Persia. There was a mutuality of interests: Alexander the Great increased the capacity of his fleet, and the Cypriot kings achieved political independence. Siege of Tyre From the area of Phoenicia, only Tyre resisted Alexander's control, and so he undertook a siege. The Cypriot fleet, together with Cypriot engineers, contributed much to the capture of this highly fortified city. Indeed, king Pnytagoras of Salamis, Androcles of Amathus, and Pasikratis of Soloi, took a personal part in the siege of Tyre. Tyre, then the most important Phoenician city, was built on a small island that was 700 metres from the shore and had two harbors, the Egyptian to the south and Sidonian to the north. The Cypriot kings, in command of 120 ships, each with a very experienced crew, provided substantial assistance to Alexander in the siege of this city, which lasted for seven months. During the final attack, the Cypriots managed to occupy the Sidonian harbour and the northern part of Tyre, while the Phoenicians loyal to Alexander occupied the Egyptian harbour. Alexander also attacked the city with siege engines by constructing a \\"mole\\", a strip of soil from the coast opposite Tyre, to the island where the city was built. In this operation, Alexander was helped by many Cypriot and Phoenician engineers who built earthworks on his behalf. Many siege engines battered the city from the \\"mole\\" and from \\"ippagoga\\" ships. Although they lost many quinqueremes, the Cypriots managed to help capture the city for Alexander. His gratitude was shown, for example, by the help he gave to Pnytagora, who seems to have been the main driver of this initiative to support Alexander, to incorporate the territory of the Cypriot kingdom of Tamassos into that of Salamis. The kingdom of Tamassos was then ruled by King Poumiaton of Kition who had purchased it for 50 talents from king Pasikypro. In 331 BCE, while Alexander was returning from Egypt, he stayed for a while in Tyre, where the Cypriot kings, wishing to reaffirm their trust and support for him, put on a great show of honour. Alexander in Asia Cyprus was an experienced seafaring nation and Alexander used the Cypriot fleet during his campaign into India; because the country had many navigable rivers, he included a significant number of shipbuilders and rowers from Cyprus, Egypt, Phoenicia and Caria in his military expedition. Cypriot forces were led by Cypriot princes such as Nikoklis, son of King Pasikrati of Solon, and Nifothona, son of King Pnytagora of Salamis. As Alexander took over control of the administrative region that had been the Persian Empire, he promoted Cypriots to high office and great responsibility; in particular, Stasanor of Solon was appointed satrap of the Supreme Court and Drangon in 329 BC. The hope of full independence for Cyprus following the fall of the Persian Empire, however, was slow to be realized. The mints of Salamis, Kition and Paphos began to stamp coins on Alexander's behalf rather than in the name of the local kings. The policy of Alexander the Great on Cyprus and its kings soon became clear: to free them from Persian rule but to put them under his own authority. Away from the coast of Cyprus, the interior kingdoms were left largely independent and the kings maintained their autonomy, although not in issues such as mining rights. Alexander sought to make clear that he considered himself the master of the island, and abolished the currencies of the Cypriot kingdoms, replacing them by the minting of his own coins. Death of Alexander The death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, while still in his early thirties, put an end to Greek aspirations for global domination. The empire he had created was divided between his generals and successors, who immediately started fighting one another. The death of Alexander the Great marks the beginning of the Hellenistic period of Cypriot history. After the death of Alexander the Great, Cyprus passed on to the Ptolemaic rule. Still under Greek influence, Cyprus gained full access to the Greek culture and thus became fully hellenised. ===Egypt and Syria=== The wars of Alexander's successors inevitably began to involve Cyprus, and focused on two claimants, Antigonus Monophthalmus in Syria (assisted by his son Demetrius Poliorcetes) and Ptolemy Lagus in Egypt. The Cypriot kings who, so far, had managed largely to maintain their kingdoms' independence, found themselves in a new and difficult position. This was because, as Cyprus became the focus of discord between Ptolemy and Antigonus, the kings of the island now had to make new choices and alliances. Some Cypriot kingdoms chose alliance with Ptolemy, others sided with the Antigonus, yet others tried to remain neutral, leading to inevitable controversy and confrontation. The largest city and kingdom of Cyprus then appears to have been Salamis, whose king was Nicocreon. Nicocreon strongly supported Ptolemy. According to Arrian, he had the support of Pasikratis of Solon, Nikoklis of Paphos and Androcles of Amathus. Other kings of Cyprus, however, including Praxippos of Lapithos and Kyrenia, the Poumiaton (Pygmalion) of Kition and Stasioikos of Marion, allied themselves with Antigonus. Against these, Nicocreon and other pro-Ptolemaic kings conducted military operations. Ptolemy sent military support to his allies, providing troops under the command of Seleucus and Menelaus. Lapithos-Kyrenia was occupied after a siege and Marion capitulated. Diodorus Siculus tells us that Amathus was forced to provide hostages, while Kition was laid siege to in about 315 BCE. ===Ptolemy to Cyprus=== Ptolemy entered Cyprus with further military forces in 312 BCE, captured and killed the king of Kition and arrested the pro-Antigonid kings of Marion and Lapithos-Kyrenia. He destroyed the city of Marion and annulled most of the former kingdoms of Cyprus. This crucial and decisive intervention by Ptolemy in 312 BCE gave more power to the kings of Solon and Paphos, and particularly to Nicocreon of Salamis, whom Ptolemy seems to have appreciated and trusted completelyand who won the cities and the wealth of expelled kings. Salamis extended its authority throughout eastern, central and northern Cyprus, since Kition and Lapithos were absorbed into it and Tamassos already belonged. Furthermore, Nicocreon of Salamis took office as chief general in Cyprus with the blessing of Ptolemy, effectively making him master of the whole island. But the situation was fluid and the rulers of Solon and Paphos had been kept in power. Soon, King Nikoklis of Paphos was considered suspect; he was besieged and forced to suicide, and his entire family put to death (312 BCE). The following year (311 BCE) Nicocreon of Salamis died. ===Demetrius=== After the intervention of Ptolemy in Cyprus, which subjugated the island, Antigonus and his son Demetrius reacted against the besiegers and Demetrius led a large military operation in Cyprus. Demetrius was born in 336 BC and initially fought under the command of his father in 317 BCE against Eumenes, where he particularly distinguished himself. In 307 BC he liberated Athens, restoring democracy there and in 306 BCE, led the war against the Ptolemies. Wishing to use Cyprus as a base for attacks against Western Asia, he sailed from Cilicia to Cyprus with a large infantry force, cavalry and naval ships. Meeting no resistance, he landed in the Karpasia peninsula and occupied the cities Urania and Karpasia. Meanwhile, Menelaus, brother of Ptolemy I Soter, the new general of the island, gathered his forces at Salamis. Ptolemy arrived to aid his brother, but was decisively defeated at the Battle of Salamis, after which Cyprus came under Antigonid control. Demetrius's father Antigonus Monophthalmus was killed in the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC and Demetrius, having reorganized the army, was proclaimed King of Macedon, but was evicted by Lysimachus and Pyrrhus. Cyprus came once again under Ptolemaic control in 294 BC and remained under Ptolemaic rule until 58 BC, when it became a Roman province. It was ruled by a series of governors sent from Egypt and sometimes formed a minor Ptolemaic kingdom during the power struggles of the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. During this time, Cyprus forged strong commercial relationships with Athens and Alexandria, two of the most important commercial centres of antiquity. Full Hellenisation of Cyprus took place under Ptolemaic rule. During this period, Phoenician and native Cypriot traits disappeared, together with the old Cypriot syllabic script. A number of cities were founded during this time. For example, Arsinoe was founded between old and new Paphos by Ptolemy II. Ptolemaic rule was rigid and exploited the island's resources to the utmost, particularly timber and copper. A great contemporary figure of Cypriot letters was the philosopher Zeno of Citium who was born at Kition about 336 BCE and founded the famous Stoic School of Philosophy at Athens, where he died about 263 BCE. ==Roman period== Cyprus became a Roman province in 58 BCE. This came about, according to Strabo, because Publius Clodius Pulcher held a grudge against Ptolemy of Cyprus. The renowned Stoic and strict constitutionalist Cato the Younger was sent to annex Cyprus and organize it under Roman law. Cato was relentless in protecting Cyprus against the rapacious tax farmers that normally plagued the provinces of the Republican period. After the civil wars that ended the Roman Republic, Mark Antony gave the island to Cleopatra VII of Egypt and their daughter Cleopatra Selene, but it became a Roman province again after his defeat at the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE. From 22 BCE onwards, Cyprus was a senatorial province \\"divided into four districts centred around Paphus, Salamis, Amathus and Lapethus.\\"Talbert, Richard J A (Ed), 1985. Atlas of Classical History. Routledge. Roman Cyprus, pp 156‚Äì7. After the reforms of Diocletian it was placed under the Diocese of Oriens. The Pax Romana (Roman peace) was only twice disturbed in Cyprus in three centuries of Roman occupation. The first serious interruption occurred in 115‚Äì16, when a revolt by Jews inspired by Messianic hopes broke out. Their leader was Artemion, a Jew with a Hellenised name, as was the practice of the time. The island suffered great losses in this war; it is believed that 240,000 Greek and Roman civilians were killed. Although this number may be exaggerated, there were few or no Roman troops stationed on the island to suppress the insurrection as the rebels wreaked havoc. After forces were sent to Cyprus and the uprising was put down, a law was passed that no Jews were permitted to land on Cyprian soil, even in cases of shipwreck. Turmoil sprang up two centuries later in 333‚Äì4, when a local official Calocaerus revolted against Constantine I. This rebellion ended with the arrival of troops led by Flavius Dalmatius and the death of Calocaerus.George Hill, (1940, reprint 2010) A History of Cyprus, vol. 1 (New York: Cambridge University Press), p. 244. === Olive oil trade in the late Roman period === Olive oil was a very important part of daily life in the Mediterranean in the Roman Period. It was used for food, as a fuel for lamps, and as a basic ingredient in things like medicinal ointment, bath oils, skin oils, soaps, perfumes and cosmetics.Tyree, E.L. 1996, \\"The Olive Pit and Roman Oil Making\\". The Biblical Archaeologist 59: 171‚Äì8. Even before the Roman Period, Cyprus was known for its olive oil, as indicated by Strabo when he said that \\"in fertility Cyprus is not inferior to any one of the islands, for it produces both good wine and good oil\\".Papacostas, T., 2001, The Economy of Late Antique Cyprus. In: Economy and Exchange in the East Mediterranean during Late Antiquity. Proceedings of a conference at Somerville College, Oxford, 29 May 1999, edited by S. Kingsley and M. Decker, 107‚Äì28. Oxford: Oxbow Books. There is evidence for both a local trade of Cypriot oil and for a larger trading network that may have reached as far as the Aegean, although most Cypriot oil was probably limited to the Eastern Mediterranean. Many olive oil presses have been found on Cyprus, and not just in rural areas, where they might be expected for personal, local use. They have been found in some of the larger coastal cities as well, including Paphos, Curium and Amathus. In Alexandria, Egypt, there is a large presence of a type of amphora made in Cyprus known as Late Roman 1 or LR1 that was used to carry oil. This indicates that a lot of Cypriot oil was being imported into Egypt. There is also evidence for Cypriot trade with Cilicia and Syria. Olive oil was also traded locally, around the island. Amphorae found at Alaminos- Latourou Chiftlik and Dreamer's Bay, indicate that the oil produced in these areas was mostly used locally or shipped to nearby towns.Leonard, J. and S. Demesticha. 2004, Fundamental Links in the Economic Chain: Local Ports and International trade in Roman and Early Christian Cyprus. In: Transport Amphorae and Trade in the Eastern Mediterranean. Acts of the International Colloquium at the Danish Institute at Athens, September 26‚Äì9, 2002, edited by J. Eiring and J. Lund, 189‚Äì202. Aarhus: Aarhus University Press. The amphora found on a contemporary shipwreck at Cape Zevgari indicate that the vessel, a typical small merchant ship, was carrying oil and there is evidence from the location of the wreck and the ship itself that it was traveling only a short distance, probably west around the island.Leidwanger, J. 2007, Two Late Roman Wrecks from Southern Cyprus. IJNA 36: 308‚Äì16. ===Christianity=== Roman Cyprus was visited by the Apostles Paul, Barnabas and St. Mark, who came to the island at the beginning of their first missionary journey in 45 AD, according to Christian tradition, converting the people of Cyprus to Christianity and founding the Church of Cyprus, After their arrival in Salamis, they proceeded to Paphos where they converted the Roman governor Sergius Paulus to Christ. In the New Testament book of Acts of the Apostles, author St. Luke describes how a Jewish magician named Bar-Jesus (Elymas) was obstructing the Apostles in their preaching of the Gospel. Paul rebuked him, announcing that he would temporarily become blind due to God's judgment. Paul's prediction immediately came true. As a result of this, Sergius Paulus became a believer, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord. In this way, Cyprus became the first country in the world to be governed by a Christian ruler. Paul is credited with underpinning claims for ecclesiastical independence from Antioch. At least three Cypriot bishops (the sees of Salamis, Tremithus, and Paphos) took part in the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and twelve Cypriot bishops were present at the Council of Sardica in 344. Early Cypriot Saints include: St. Heracleidius, St. Spiridon, St. Hilarion and St. Epiphanius. Several earthquakes led to the destruction of Salamis at the beginning of the 4th century, at the same time drought and famine hit the island.

His father, Rev. George Halyburton, had been a minister in the Church of Scotland but was ejected for adherence to the principles of the Covenanters. In 1676 the Privy Council of Scotland denounced the former minister for holding conventicles (church services in the open air, unauthorised by the established church and outlawed by the government). George died that same year, and in 1685 his wife moved the family to Rotterdam to avoid the fierce persecution which was carried out against the Covenanters. In Rotterdam young Thomas was educated in the school founded by Erasmus. Following the Glorious Revolution, he returned to Scotland and continued his education in Edinburgh. After a period of inner struggle with the philosophy of Deism, Halyburton returned to the faith of his father. On completing theological training, Halyburton graduated from the University of St Andrews in 1696. He was licensed to preach in the Church of Scotland by Queen Anne, and ordained to the ministry of the church in Ceres, Fife in 1700. The church was part of the presbytery of Kirkcaldy. After serving the church in Ceres for ten years, Halyburton became Professor of Divinity at St Mary's College, St Andrews. He died two years later at the age of 37, following an illness. His body was buried in St Andrews Cathedral next to Rev. Dr. Samuel Rutherford. ==Legacy== Thomas Halyburton‚Äôs theological and apologetic writings are marked by a distinctive thoroughness. The surviving scripts of his sermons show him to have been richly theological, deeply experimental (i.e. dealing with the experiences of the soul) and very practical ‚Äî a master of the classic Puritan style of preaching.James Begg Society, Thomas Halyburton The extant writings of Rev.

Otlet created the Universal Decimal Classification, which would later become a faceted classification. Otlet was responsible for the development of an early information retrieval tool, the \\"\\" (RBU) which utilized 3x5 inch index cards, used commonly in library catalogs around the world (now largely displaced by the advent of the online public access catalog (OPAC)). Otlet wrote numerous essays on how to collect and organize the world's knowledge, culminating in two books, the ' (1934) and ' (1935).Michael Buckland, Paul Otlet, Pioneer of Information Management, biography of Paul Otlet for the School of Information at UC Berkeley, n.d.Alex Wright, Forgotten Forefather, Paul Otlet. , Boxes and Arrows, 10 Nov. 2003. In 1907, following a huge international conference, Otlet and Henri La Fontaine created the Central Office of International Associations, which was renamed to the Union of International Associations in 1910, and which is still located in Brussels. They also created a great international center called at first (World Palace), later, the Mundaneum to house the collections and activities of their various organizations and institutes. Otlet and La Fontaine were peace activists who endorsed the internationalist politics of the League of Nations and its International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (the forerunner of UNESCO). Otlet and La Fontaine witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of information, resulting in the creation of new kinds of international organization. They saw in this organization an emerging global polity, and wished to help solidify it. La Fontaine won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1913. == Early life and career == Otlet was born in Brussels, Belgium on 23 August 1868, the oldest child of √âdouard Otlet (Brussels 13 June 1842-Blanquefort, France, 20 October 1907) and Maria (n√©e Van Mons). His father, √âdouard, was a wealthy businessman who made his fortune selling trams around the world. His mother died in 1871 at the age of 24, when Otlet was three. Through his mother, he was related to the Van Mons family, a prosperous family, and to the Verhaeren family, of which Emile Verhaeren was one of the most important Belgian poets. His father kept him out of school, hiring tutors instead, until he was 11, believing that classrooms were a stifling environment. Otlet, as a child, had few friends, and played regularly only with his younger brother Maurice. He soon developed a love of reading and books. At the age of six, a temporary decline in his father's wealth caused the family to move to Paris. At the age of 11, Paul went to school for the first time, a Jesuit school in Paris, where he stayed for the next three years. The family then returned to Brussels, and Paul studied at the prestigious Coll√®ge Saint-MichelAlain Deneef and Xavier Rousseaux (eds.), Quatre si√®cles de pr√©sence j√©suite √† Bruxelles, Kadoc, no. 58, Louvain, 2012. . in Brussels. In 1894, his father became a senator in the Belgian Senate for the Catholic Party (until 1900). His father remarried to Valerie Linden, daughter of famed botanist Jean Jules Linden; the two eventually had five additional children. The family travelled often during this time, going on holidays and business trips to Italy, France and Russia. Otlet was educated at the Catholic University of Leuven and at the , where he earned a law degree on 15 July 1890. He married his step-cousin, Fernande Gloner, soon afterward, on 9 December 1890. He then clerked with famed lawyer Edmond Picard, a friend of his father's. Otlet soon became dissatisfied with his legal career, and began to take an interest in bibliography. His first published work on the subject was the essay \\"Something about bibliography\\", written in 1892. In it he expressed the belief that books were an inadequate way to store information, because the arrangement of facts contained within them was an arbitrary decision on the part of the author, making individual facts difficult to locate. A better storage system, Otlet wrote in his essay, would be cards containing individual \\"chunks\\" of information, that would allow \\"all the manipulations of classification and continuous interfiling.\\" In addition would be needed \\"a very detailed synoptic outline of knowledge\\" that could allow classification of all of these chunks of data. In 1891, Otlet met Henri La Fontaine, a fellow lawyer with shared interests in bibliography and international relations, and the two became good friends. They were commissioned in 1892 by Belgium's Societ√© des Sciences sociales et politiques (Society of social and political sciences) to create bibliographies for various of the social sciences; they spent three years doing this. In 1895, they discovered the Dewey Decimal Classification, a library classification system that had been invented in 1876. They decided to try to expand this system to cover the classification of facts that Otlet had previously imagined. They wrote to the system's creator, Melvil Dewey, asking for permission to modify his system in this way; he agreed, so long as their system was not translated into English. They began work on this expansion soon afterwards and thus created the Universal Decimal Classification. During this time, Otlet and his wife then had two sons, Marcel and Jean, in quick succession. Otlet founded the (IIB) in 1895, later renamed as (in English) the International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID). == The Universal Bibliographic Repertory == R√©pertoire Bibliographique Universel In 1895, Otlet and La Fontaine also began the creation of a collection of index cards, meant to catalog facts, that came to be known as the \\"\\" (RBU), or the \\"Universal Bibliographic Repertory\\". By the end of 1895 it had grown to 400,000 entries; later it would reach more than 15 million entries. In 1896, Otlet set up a fee-based service to answer questions by mail, by sending the requesters copies of the relevant index cards for each query; scholar Charles van den Heuvel has referred to the service as an \\"analog search engine\\". By 1912, this service responded to over 1,500 queries a year. Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search. Otlet envisioned a copy of the RBU in each major city around the world, with Brussels holding the master copy. At various times between 1900 and 1914, attempts were made to send full copies of the RBU to cities such as Paris, Washington, D.C. and Rio de Janeiro; however, difficulties in copying and transportation meant that no city received more than a few hundred thousand cards. == The Universal Decimal Classification == In 1904, Otlet and La Fontaine began to publish their classification scheme, which they termed the Universal Decimal Classification. The UDC was originally based on Melvil Dewey's Decimal classification system. Otlet and La Fontaine contacted Melvil Dewey to inquire if they could modify the Dewey Decimal System to suit the perimeters of their bibliographic project, namely, organizing information in the social and natural sciences. Dewey granted them permission as long as it substantially differed from his original version.Rayward, W. 1. (1997). The origins of information science and the International Institute of Bibliography/International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID). Journal of the American Society For Information Science, 48, 289‚Äì300. They worked with numerous subject experts, for example with Herbert Haviland Field at the Concilium Bibliographicum for Zoology, and completed this initial publication in 1907. The system defines not only detailed subject classifications, but also an algebraic notation for referring to the intersection of several subjects; for example, the notation \\"31:[622+669](485)\\" refers to the statistics of mining and metallurgy in Sweden. The UDC is an example of an analytico-synthetic classification, i.e., it permits the linking of one concept to another. Although some have described it as faceted, it is not, though there are some faceted elements in it. A truly faceted classification consists solely of simple concepts; there are many compound concepts listed in the UDC. It is still used by many libraries and bibliographic services outside the English-speaking world, and in some non-traditional contexts such as the BBC Archives. == Personal difficulties and World War I == In 1906, with his father √âdouard near death and his businesses falling apart, Paul and his brother and five step-siblings formed a company, (\\"Otlet Brothers\\") to try to manage these businesses, which included mines and railways. Paul, though he was consumed with his bibliographic work, became president of the company. In 1907, √âdouard died, and the family struggled to maintain all parts of the business. In April 1908, Paul Otlet and his wife began divorce proceedings. Otlet remarried in 1912, to Cato Van Nederhesselt. In 1913, La Fontaine won the Nobel Peace Prize, and invested his winnings into Otlet and La Fontaine's bibliographic ventures, which were suffering from lack of funding. Otlet journeyed to the United States in early 1914 to try to get additional funding from the U.S. Government, but his efforts soon came to a halt due to the outbreak of World War I. Otlet returned to Belgium, but quickly fled after it became occupied by the Germans; he spent the majority of the war in Paris and various cities in Switzerland. Both his sons fought in the Belgian army, and one of them, Jean, died during the war in the Battle of the Yser. Otlet spent much of the war trying to bring about peace, and the creation of multinational institutions that he felt could avert future wars. In 1914, he published a book, \\"\\" (\\"The End of War\\") that defined a \\"World Charter of Human Rights\\" as the basis for an international federation. == The Mundaneum == In 1910, Otlet and La Fontaine first envisioned a \\"city of knowledge\\", which Otlet originally named the \\"\\" (\\"World Palace\\"), that would serve as a central repository for the world's information. In 1919, soon after the end of World War I, they convinced the government of Belgium to give them the space and funding for this project, arguing that it would help Belgium bolster its bid to house the League of Nations headquarters. They were given space in the left wing of the , a government building in Brussels. They then hired staff to help add to their Universal Bibliographic Repertory. In 1921 Otlet wrote to W. E. B. Du Bois offering the use of the Palais Mondial for the 2nd Pan-African Congress. Although both Otlet and Fontaine offered a warm welcome to the Congress, these sentiments were not shared across all of Belgian society. The Brussels based paper Neptune stated that the organisers ‚Äì particularly the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People were funded by the Bolsheviks and raised concern that it might lead to difficulties in the Belgian Congo by drawing together \\"all the ne‚Äôer-do-wells of the various tribes of the Colony, aside from some hundreds of labourers\\". The Palais Mondial was briefly shuttered in 1922, due to lack of support from the government of Prime Minister Georges Theunis, but was reopened after lobbying from Otlet and La Fontaine. Otlet renamed the Palais Mondial to the Mundaneum in 1924. The RBU steadily grew to 13 million index cards in 1927; by its final year, 1934, it had reached more than 15 million.W. Boyd Rayward \\"Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868‚Äì1944) and Hypertext.\\" , Journal of the American Society for Information Science 4(4):235‚Äì250. May 1994. Index cards were stored in custom-designed cabinets, and indexed according to the Universal Decimal Classification. The collection also grew to include files (including letters, reports, newspaper articles, etc.) and images, contained in separate rooms; the index cards were meant to catalog all of these as well. The Mundaneum eventually contained 100,000 files and millions of images. In 1934, the Belgian government again cut off funding for the project, and the offices were closed. (Otlet protested by keeping vigil outside the locked offices, but to no avail.) The collection remained untouched within those offices, however, until 1940, when Germany invaded Belgium. Requisitioning the Mundaneum's quarters to hold a collection of Third Reich art and destroying substantial amounts of its collections in the process, the Germans forced Otlet and his colleagues to find a new home for the Mundaneum. In a large but decrepit building in Leopold Park they reconstituted the Mundaneum as best as they could, and there it remained until it was forced to move again in 1972, well after Otlet's death. == The World City == The World City or Cit√© Mondiale is a utopian vision by Paul Otlet of a city which like a universal exhibition brings together all the leading institutions of the world.In 2011 Wouter Van Acker completed his PhD on the visionary schemes and schemas of Paul Otlet. The World City would radiate knowledge to the rest of the world and construct peace and universal cooperation. Otlet‚Äôs idea to design a utopian city dedicated to international institutions was largely inspired by the contemporary publication in 1913 by the Norwegian-American sculptor Hendrik Christian Andersen and the French architect Ernest H√©brard of an impressive series of Beaux-Arts plans for a World Centre of Communication (1913). For the design of his World City, Otlet collaborated with several architects. In this way a whole series of designs for the World City was developed. The most elaborated plans were: the design of a Mundaneum (1928) and a World City (1929) by Le Corbusier in Geneva next to the palace of the League of Nations, by Victor Bourgeois in Tervuren (1931) next to the Congo Museum, again by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with Huib Hoste) on the left bank in Antwerp (1933), by Maurice Heymans in Chesapeake Bay near Washington (1935), and by Stanislas Jassinski and Rapha√´l Delville on the left bank in Antwerp (1941). In these different designs the program of the World City stayed more or less fixed, containing a World Museum, a World University, a World Library and Documentation Centre, Offices for the International Associations, Offices or Embassies for the Nations, an Olympic Centre, a residential area, and a park. == Exploring new media == Otlet integrated new media, as they were invented, into his vision of the networked knowledge-base of the future. In the early 1900s, Otlet worked with engineer Robert Goldschmidt on storing bibliographic data on microfilm (then known as \\"micro-photography\\"). These experiments continued into the 1920s, and by the late 1920s he attempted along with colleagues to create an encyclopedia printed entirely on microfilm, known as the ', which was housed in the Mundaneum. In the 1920s and 1930s, he wrote about radio and television as other forms of conveying information, writing in the 1934 ' that \\"one after another, marvellous inventions have immensely extended the possibilities of documentation.\\" In the same book, he predicted that media that would convey feel, taste and smell would also eventually be invented, and that an ideal information-conveyance system should be able to handle all of what he called \\"sense-perception documents\\". ==Political views and involvement== Otlet was a firm believer in international cooperation to promote both the spread of knowledge and peace between nations. A self- identified liberal, universalist and pacifist, his endeavor to catalog and classify is an expression of the commitment to the Eurocentric project to structure knowledge according to universal categories and taxonomies, of which the Universal Decimal Classification is an example. The Union of International Associations, which he had founded in 1907 with Henri La Fontaine, later participated to the development of both the League of Nations and the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, which was later merged into UNESCO. At several occasions, Otlet published racist statements dressed up as scientific facts, starting at the beginning of his career with L'Afrique Aux Noirs (1888) where he argued that white people or 'westernized' blacks were to be tasked with 'civilising' Africa. Similarly, in Monde (1935), near the end of his life, he claimed the biological superiority of white people. His interest in advancing 'The African Issue' was fuelled by a firm conviction of the superiority of European culture and intelligence which fitted the Enlightenment project that he was dedicated to. Otlet‚Äôs organisational support to the 1921 Pan-African Congress at the Palais Mondial (later: Mundaneum) therefore needs to be considered in connection with the racist statements that he published both before and after the event. In 1933, Otlet proposed building in Belgium near Antwerp a \\"gigantic neutral World City\\" to employ a massive number of workers, in order to alleviate the unemployment generated by the Great Depression.Work for All the World, TIME Magazine, 23 January 1933 == Fade into obscurity == Otlet died in 1944, not long before the end of World War II, having seen his major project, the Mundaneum, shuttered, and having lost all his funding sources. According to Otlet scholar W. Boyd Rayward: : \\"The First World War marked the end of the intellectual as well as sociopolitical era in which Otlet had functioned hitherto with remarkable success. After the war, he and his schemes were never taken seriously except with the circle of his disciples. He quickly lost the support of the Belgian government. In the late 1920s he faced the defection of his followers in the International Institute of Documentation, as the International Institute of Bibliography \\"W. Boyd Rayward, \\"Visions of Xanadu: Paul Otlet (1868‚Äì1944) and Hypertext\\", Journal of the American Society for Information Science 4(4), May 1994, p. 284. And: : \\"Perhaps at one level, Otlet, is best regarded as a fin de si√®cle figure whose work enjoyed a considerable measure of acceptance and support at home and abroad before World War I. But after the War, it rapidly lost favour. Once influential nationally and internationally, at least in a relatively specialised circle, Otlet came to be regarded as difficult and obstructive as he grew old. His ideas and the extraordinary institutional arrangements in which they had finally come to be expressed, the Palais Mondial or Mundaneum, seemed grandiose, unfocused and pass√©. In the early 1930s there was a quietly dramatic struggle to remove the International Institute of Bibliography, transformed eventually into the International Federation for Documentation, from this institutional complex and from under what was considered to be the dead hand of the past - effectively the hand of the still very much alive but ageing Otlet.\\"W. Boyd Rayward, \\"Knowledge organisation and a new world polity:the rise and fall and rise of the ideas of Paul Otlet\\", Transnational Associations, no. 1‚Äì2 (2003), p. 4. In the wake of World War II, the contributions of Otlet to the field of information science were lost sight of in the rising popularity of the ideas of American information scientists such as Vannevar Bush, Douglas Engelbart, Ted Nelson and by such theorists of information organization as Seymour Lubetzky. == Rediscovery == Beginning in the 1980s, and especially after the advent of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s, new interest arose in Otlet's speculations and theories about the organization of knowledge, the use of information technologies, and globalization. His 1934 masterpiece, the Trait√© de documentation, was reprinted in 1989 by the Centre de Lecture publique de la Communaut√© fran√ßaise in Belgium. (Neither the Trait√© nor its companion work, \\"Monde\\" (World) has been translated into English so far.) In 1990 Professor W. Boyd Rayward published an English translation of some of Otlet's writings. He also published a biography of Otlet (1975) that was translated into Russian (1976) and Spanish (1996, 1999, and 2005). In 1985, Belgian academic Andr√© Canonne raised the possibility of recreating the Mundaneum as an archive and museum devoted to Otlet and others associated with them; his idea initially was to house it in the Belgian city of Li√®ge. Cannone, with substantial help from others, eventually managed to open the new Mundaneum in Mons, Belgium in 1998. This museum is still in operation, and contains the personal papers of Otlet and La Fontaine and the archives of the various organizations they created along with other collections important to the modern history of Belgium. == Analysis of Otlet's theories == Otlet scholar W. Boyd Rayward has written that Otlet's thinking is a product of the 19th century and the philosophy of positivism, which holds that, through careful study and the scientific method, an objective view of the world can be gained. According to W. Boyd Rayward, his ideas placed him culturally and intellectually in the Belle √âpoque period of pre‚ÄìWorld War I Europe, a period of great \\"cultural certitude\\". Otlet's writings have sometimes been called prescient of the current World Wide Web. His vision of a great network of knowledge was centered on documents and included the notions of hyperlinks, search engines, remote access, and social networks‚Äîalthough these notions were described by different names.Charles van den Heuvel, \\"Building Society, Constructing Knowledge, Weaving the Web\\". In: W. Boyd Rayward, ed., European Modernism and the Information Society. Informing the Present, Understanding the Past. Aldershot 2008, pp. 127‚Äì153 In 1934, Otlet laid out this vision of the computer and internet in what he called \\"Radiated Library\\" vision. == Grave == The Paul Otlet's grave is located in the Etterbeek Cemetery, in Wezembeek- Oppem, Flemish Brabant, Belgium. == See also == === People === * Ada Lovelace * Andries van Dam * Conrad Gessner * Douglas Engelbart * George Dyson * Henri La Fontaine * Herbert Haviland Field * J.C.R.

Arthur Rose and music by Noel Gay). The song takes its name from a local street, Lambeth Walk, once notable for its street market and working class culture in Lambeth, an area of London. The tune gave its name to a Cockney dance made popular in 1937 by Lupino Lane. The story line of Me and My Girl concerns a Cockney barrow boy who inherits an earldom but almost loses his Lambeth girlfriend. It was turned into a 1939 film The Lambeth Walk which starred Lane. ==Dance craze== The choreography from the musical, in which the song was a show-stopping Cockney-inspired extravaganza, inspired a popular walking dance, performed in a jaunty strutting style. Lane explained the origin of the dance as follows: \\"I got the idea from my personal experience and from having worked among cockneys. I'm a cockney born and bred myself. The Lambeth Walk is just an exaggerated idea of how the cockney struts.\\" When the stage show had been running for a few months, C.L. Heimann, managing director of the Locarno Dance Halls, got one of his dancing instructors, Adele England, to elaborate the walk into a dance. \\"Starting from the Locarno Dance Hall, Streatham, the dance-version of the Lambeth Walk swept the country.\\" The craze reached Buckingham Palace, with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth attending a performance and joining in the shouted \\"Oi\\" which ends the chorus.\\" The fad reached the United States in 1938, popularized by Boston-based orchestra-leader Joseph (Joe) Rines, among others. Rines and his band frequently performed in New York, and the dance became especially popular at the \\"better\\" night clubs. As with most dance crazes, other well-known orchestras did versions of the song, including Duke Ellington's. The dance then spread across America, and to Paris and Prague. Mass Observation devoted a chapter of their book Britain (1939) to the craze. In Germany, big band leader Adalbert Lutter made a German-language adaptation called Lambert's Nachtlokal that quickly became popular in swing clubs. A member of the Nazi Party drew attention to it in 1939 by declaring The Lambeth Walk \\"Jewish mischief and animalistic hopping\\", as part of a speech on how the \\"revolution of private life\\" was one of the next big tasks of National Socialism in Germany. However, the song continued to be popular with the German public and was even played on the radio, particularly during the war, as part of the vital task of maintaining public morale. In Italy the song was popularized by Dino Di Luca and the Trio Lescano in an Italian version titled: \\"Balliamo il passo Lambeth\\". In 1942, Charles A. Ridley of the Ministry of Information made a short propaganda film, Schichlegruber - Doing the Lambeth Walk, which edited existing footage - including comical 'backstepping'- taken from Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will to make it appear as if they were goose-stepping and skipping to \\"The Lambeth Walk\\". The propaganda film was distributed uncredited to newsreel companies, which would supply their own narration. Joseph Goebbels placed Ridley on a Gestapo list for elimination if Britain were defeated. One of photographer Bill Brandt's best-known pictures is \\"Dancing the Lambeth Walk\\", originally published in 1943 in the magazine Picture Post. Both Russ Morgan and Duke Ellington had hit records of the song in the United States. ==Cultural impact== \\"The Lambeth Walk\\" had the distinction of being the subject of a headline in The Times in October 1938: \\"While dictators rage and statesmen talk, all Europe dances ‚Äî to The Lambeth Walk.\\"Nicholson, Geoff. The Lost Art of Walking: The History, Science, and Literature of Pedestrianism. Penguin, 2009, Chapter 5 In the movie The Longest Day (1962), about the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944, this song is sung by the squadron of Major John Howard in a glider on its way to capture Pegasus Bridge. The composer Franz Reizenstein wrote a set of Variations on the Lambeth Walk, each variation a pastiche of the style of a major classical composer. Notable are the variations in the styles of Beethoven, Chopin, and Liszt. ==1899 song by Alec Hurley== An earlier, different song titled \\"The Lambeth Walk\\" (composed in 1899 by Edward W. Rogers) was popularised by music hall singer Alec Hurley (1871-1913). == References == ==Bibliography== *Ariane Mak, \\"Danser la Lambeth Walk ou les formes de folklorisation de la culture cockney. √âtude et revisite de l‚Äôenqu√™te du Mass Observation\\", Mil neuf cent.

As such, it is an academic rank, and not a postgraduate qualification. No further examination or study is required for this promotion. This practice differs from most other universities worldwide, at which the degree reflects further postgraduate study or achievement. These degrees are therefore sometimes referred to as the Oxford and Cambridge MA and the Dublin or Trinity MA, to draw attention to the difference.See for instance a reader's letter to Times Higher Education: , an Independent article and an article in The Oxford Student However, as with gaining a postgraduate degree from another university, once incepted and promoted to a Master, the graduate no longer wears the academic dress or uses the post-nominal letters pertaining to a Bachelor of Arts, being no longer of that rank: i.e. the Master of Arts degree is not awarded separately (for instance, in addition to that of Bachelor of Arts), but rather the new rank is treated as a conversion of one degree to another. All three universities have other masters' (i.e. postgraduate) degrees which do require further study and examination, but these have other titles, such as Master of Letters (M.Litt.), Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.), Master of Studies (M.St.), Master of Engineering (M.A.I., or MEng), and Master of Science (M.Sc.). In the ancient universities of Scotland, a degree with the same name is awarded as a first degree to graduates in certain subjects (see Master of Arts (Scotland)). ==Requirements== In all three universities, a Bachelor of Arts may \\"incept\\" as a Master of Arts after a given lapse of time or as soon as a person is of the required academic standing. No further examinations or residence are required, but some institutions require the incipient to pay a fee. *At Oxford, the rank of MA may be conferred during or after the twenty-first term from matriculation (i.e., ordinarily seven years after joining the University) upon anyone holding an Oxford BA or Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree. An exception is that a Bachelor of Arts who attains the degree of Doctor of Philosophy may immediately incept as a Master of Arts, before the requisite number of terms have passed. *At Cambridge, the MA degree may be conferred six years after the end of the first term in residence to a person holding a Cambridge Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, provided they have held it for at least two years.Ordinances of the University of Cambridge regarding Master of Arts degree The MA degree can also be awarded by the University of Cambridge to senior members of staff of the university or colleges, after three years of employment, if they have not previously graduated from Cambridge. *At Dublin, the rank of MA may be conferred to anyone who has held a Dublin BA degree (or another bachelor's degree after at least nine terms' residence) for at least three years. A fee (‚Ç¨637 in 2012) is payable, but is waived in the case of graduates of more than fifty years' standing. The MA degree may be conferred in some other situations, but these are by far the most common. Details of these other instances may be found in the sections referenced. In accordance with the formula of ad eundem gradum, a form of recognition that exists among the three universities, a graduate of Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin who is entitled to an MA degree may be conferred with the equivalent degree at either of the other two universities without further examination. The Board of Trinity College, Dublin currently restricts its ad eundem awards to eligible members of the Dublin academic staff, or those who wish to register for a higher degree at Dublin; Cambridge restricts its awards to those \\"matriculated as a member of the University\\"; Oxford considers applicants who are undertaking a course of study or fulfil some educational role at Oxford, or who have \\"rendered valuable services to the University or to its members.\\" This process is called \\"incorporation\\". ==Post-nominal style== Masters of Arts of the three universities may use the post-nominal letters \\"MA\\". Although honours are awarded for the examinations leading to the BA degree (hence \\"BA (Hons)\\"), it is incorrect to use the style \\"MA (Hons),\\" as there is no examination for the MA degree. The abbreviated name of the university (Oxon, Cantab or Dubl) is therefore almost always appended in parentheses to the initials \\"MA\\" in the same way that it is to higher degrees, e.g. \\"John Smith, MA (Cantab), PhD (Lond),\\" principally so that it is clear (to those who are aware of the system) that these are nominal and unexamined degrees. If someone incorporates from one of the above universities to another, the Latin et can be inserted between the university names, e.g. \\"MA (Oxon. et Cantab)\\", etc. as opposed to \\"MA (Oxon), MA (Cantab)\\" which would indicate that the holder graduated BA at both universities. The Oxford University Gazette and University Calendar have, since 2007, used Oxf rather than Oxon (also Camb rather than Cantab and Dub rather than Dubl) to match the style used for other universities, stating that: \\"It is not feasible to use the form ‚ÄòOxon‚Äô because to do so would entail Latinising all of the very many university names which occur in the Calendar\\". This style is used equally for all degrees, with no distinction being made between incorporated, incepted, and examined MAs except that BA is not shown if the graduate has taken the MA ‚Äì \\"BA MA Oxf should not appear\\". For example, someone who gained a BA at Oxford and took the MA, studied for an MA in London, then moved to Cambridge and became an MA by incorporation, would be shown as MA Camb, MA Lond, MA Oxf (note the universities are ordered alphabetically), while someone who had taken both a BA and an MA in London would be shown as BA MA Lond. ==History and rationale== This system dates from the Middle Ages, when the study of the liberal arts took seven years. In the late Middle Ages most students joined their university at an earlier age than is now usual, often when aged only 14 or 15. The basic university education in the liberal arts comprised the Trivium (grammar, rhetoric and dialectic) and the Quadrivium (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy and music), and typically took seven years of full-time study. In between matriculation and licence to teach, which was awarded at the end of an undergraduate's studies (whereafter he was incepted as a Master of Arts), he took an intermediate degree known as the baccalaureate, or degree of Bachelor of Arts. The division into trivium and quadrivium did not always correspond with the division between the studies required for the BA and MA degrees, but was adopted in Cambridge in the Tudor era and maintained long after it was abandoned elsewhere in Europe. In the University of Paris the baccalaureate was granted soon after responsions (the examination for matriculation), whereas in Oxford and Cambridge the bachelor's degree was postponed to a much later stage, and gradually developed a greater significance. On inception and admission to the degree of Master of Arts, a student would become a full member of the university, and was allowed to vote in discussions of the house of Convocation. The new MA would be required to teach in the university for a specified number of years (during which time he was a 'regent' or 'regent master'). Upon completion of these duties, he would become a 'non-regent master' and would be allowed either to leave the university (often to become a clerk or to enter the priesthood), or to remain and undertake further studies in one of the specialised or 'higher' faculties:. Divinity, Canon or Civil Law, and Medicine. Later, it became possible to study in the higher faculties as a BA, though the higher degree could not be taken until the graduate had the required seniority to incept as an MA. While the requirements for the bachelor's degree increased, those for the master's degree gradually diminished. By the 18th century, the ancient system of disputations had degenerated into a mere formality, and it was possible to satisfy the prescribed terms of residence, which formerly included compulsory attendance at set lectures, by keeping one's name on the college books. Examinations along modern lines were introduced for the BA and MA degrees in Oxford by the first great statute to reform the examination system in 1800, but the MA examination was abolished by a second statute in 1807. From at least the sixteenth century, the most select group of students were the noblemen (peers, eldest sons of peers or relatives of the monarch) who paid four times the normal fee and were given an MA degree after two years residence only, and without any formal exercises - thus bypassing the BA degree. However they might not stay long enough to graduate. At the universities this group was marked with gold tassels (\\"tufts\\") on their mortarboard caps, compared to the black ones that socially lower ranking students wore.Tufthunter Those students of the next rank, fellow-commoners at Cambridge or Dublin, or gentlemen commoners at Oxford, paid twice the normal fee, ate with the fellows and were also excused from attending college lectures and performing their exercises for the plain BA. They could graduate a year earlier than the next category below. Nevertheless, both higher categories of student still had to take the Senate House Examination if they wished to have an honours degree.A History of the University of Cambridge, vol. III, 1750-1870, Peter Searby, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp. 68-69 Commoners (Oxford) or Pensioners (Cambridge & Dublin) paid the standard fee and were more likely to graduate. Below came servitors (Oxford) and sizars (Cambridge & Dublin) whose fees were subsidised by their college and who in return had to fetch and carry, sweep, and serve at table. This group was much more likely to graduate. Oliver Goldsmith was a sizar: Isaac Newton was a subsizar. These privileges and humiliations were gradually removed during the nineteenth century. Reforms in the late sixteenth century allowed some ordinary students also to skip the BA stage: after the bachelor of arts degree it used to be necessary to wait another three years to become a bachelor of laws or medicine, but after paying a fine it was possible to leave college after three years in residence, study at the Inns of Court or a teaching hospital in London or abroad and return at the five year mark for a professional bachelor's degree, allowing later progression to a doctorate, as happened in the case of William Blackstone. Students at King's College, Cambridge, who until 1865 were all from Eton College, could until 1851 obtain the BA, and in due course the MA, without taking the university examinations. Students at New College, Oxford, who all used to come from Winchester College, had the same exemptions until 1834. While the length of the undergraduate degree course has been shortened to three or four years in all subjects, all three universities still require roughly seven years to pass before the awarding of the MA degree. The shortening of the degree course reflects the fact that much of the teaching of the liberal arts was taken over by grammar schools, and undergraduates now enter universities at an older age, in most cases between 17 and 19. (It may be noted that the school-leaving certificate in France today is known as the baccalaureate.) Durham University (first MA awarded 1838) and the University of London (first MA awarded 1840) broke away from the ancient model of England by considering the MA to be a higher degree distinct from the initial degree, awarded after further examination. However, in instituting a course of further study beyond the initial baccalaureate, these universities can be seen to have reverted to the ancient model. Almost all newer universities followed their lead, with the result that the Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin model is now the anomaly. Some followed that model for some years (allowing progressions in the same faculty such as from BSc to MSc, etc.) but changed to the newer system afterwards. Among the \\"steamboat ladies\\", who were denied Oxford or Cambridge degrees but granted Dublin degrees ad eundem between 1904 and 1907, some like Julia Bell obtained an MA. ; ==Rights and privileges== The degree of Master of Arts traditionally carried various rights and privileges, the chief of which was membership of the legislative bodies of the universities ‚Äì Convocation at Oxford and the Senate at Cambridge and Dublin. These were originally important decision- making bodies, approving changes to the statutes of the universities and electing various officials, including the two members of Parliament for each university. Inception to the MA degree was the principal way of becoming a member of these bodies, though it is not the only way, e.g. at Oxford Doctors of Divinity, Medicine and Civil Law were always also automatically members of Convocation. Today, the main role of Convocation and Senate is the election of the Chancellor of each university as well as the Professor of Poetry at Oxford and the High Steward at Cambridge. The privileges accorded to MAs and other members of Convocation/Senate were formerly very important. At Oxford, until 1998 the Proctors only had the power to discipline \\"junior members\\" (those who had not been admitted to membership of Convocation), which meant that any graduate student who had incepted as an MA was immune from their authority. At Cambridge, MAs and those with MA status continue to be exempt from the rules governing the ownership of motor vehicles by students. Other privileges intended for academic staff and alumni, e.g. the right to dine at High Table, to attend Gaudies, to walk upon college lawns, etc., are in most colleges restricted to MAs, which excludes the majority of graduate students. For Cambridge, membership of the Senate is no longer limited to the MA and in 2000, Oxford opened membership of Convocation to all graduates. For Dublin, the right to elect senators to the upper house of the Irish parliament, Seanad √âireann, is now restricted to those who are Irish citizens and since 1918 the franchise was extended to include all graduates, not only those with an MA. ==Precedence== The MA degree gives its holder a particular status in the universities' orders of precedence/seniority. In the University of Oxford a Master of Arts enjoys precedence, standing, and rank before all doctors, masters, and bachelors of the university who are not Masters of Arts, apart from Doctors of Divinity and Doctors of Civil Law. However, members of the university with undergraduate master's degrees automatically gain the precedence of a Master of Arts 21 terms after matriculation. Precedence, standing, and rank were formerly important for determining eligibility for appointments such as fellowships, but now generally have only a ceremonial significance. ==MA status== In Oxford, until 2000 the university statutes required that all members of Congregation (the academic and senior staff of the university) have at least the degree of DD, DM, DCL or MA or have MA status. This linked back to the MA as the licence to teach in the university. MA status was thus routinely granted to academics from other universities who came to take up positions within the university; while it is no longer granted in this way, many members of Congregation appointed before 2000 retain MA status. In Cambridge, the status of MA is automatically accorded to graduates of other universities studying in Cambridge who are aged 24 or older (graduate students under 24 years are given BA status). This entitles them to wear the appropriate Cambridge gown, but without strings. For the above cases, the status is not a degree so is automatically relinquished upon leaving the University (in the case of Oxford) or completion of their degree (for Cambridge). ==Recognition== In 2000, research by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education showed that 62% of employers were unaware that the Cambridge MA did not represent any kind of postgraduate achievement involving study. The same survey found widespread ignorance amongst employers regarding university-level qualifications in general: 51% believed the Edinburgh MA to be a postgraduate qualification, 22% were unaware that a Doctorate in Business Administration was a higher qualification than an undergraduate Diploma of Higher Education, and 40% thought that a BA or BSc was a postgraduate degree. In February 2011, the then Labour MP for Nottingham East, Chris Leslie, sponsored a private member's bill in Parliament, the master's degrees (Minimum Standards) Bill 2010‚Äì12, to \\"prohibit universities awarding Master's degrees unless certain standards of study and assessment are met\\". The Bill's supporters described the practice as a \\"historical anachronism\\" and argued that unearned qualifications should be discontinued to preserve the academic integrity of the taught MA. Further, they warned that the title gave Oxbridge graduates an unfair advantage in the job market. The Bill's opponents disputed that the title provided an unfair advantage in practice, noted that the QAA had previously investigated the matter and was unconcerned, and questioned whether it was desirable for Parliament to interfere in the academic procedures of autonomous universities, especially when there was no suggestion that analogous practices at Scottish universities be similarly reformed. The Bill received its second reading on 21 October 2011, during which many of these points were raised, but subsequently failed to complete its passage through Parliament before the end of the session and thus made no further progress. ==See also== *Wooden spoon (award) *Wrangler (University of Cambridge) ==References== ==External links== *Ordinances of the University of Cambridge regarding Master of Arts degree *The Oxford MA, Oriel College, Oxford *Oxbridge MA degrees under threat (BBC website) Category:Academic courses at the University of Cambridge Category:Academic courses at the University of Oxford Category:Education in England Arts Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge ","title":"Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)"},{"id":"1445277","text":"is a volcanic Japanese islandNussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric.

It is one of the Izu Seven Islands group of the seven northern islands of the Izu archipelago, and is located approximately south of T≈çky≈ç and south of Shimoda Shizuoka Prefecture. The island is the larger inhabited component of the village of Niijima Village, ≈åshima Subprefecture of Tokyo Metropolis, which also contains the larger, neighboring island of Shikine-jima and the smaller, uninhabited Jinai-t≈ç. Nii-jima is also within the boundaries of the Fuji- Hakone-Izu National Park. On the southern tip of Nii-jima, there was formerly a launch site for experimental and sounding rockets. ==Geography== Nii-jima is unusual amongst the Izu Islands in that it has an elongated shape. Measuring approximately long by wide, it has a land area of 23.87 km2. The island is made of eight rhyolitic lava domes in two groups at the northern and southern ends of the island, separated by a low, flat isthmus. The complex in the southern portion of the island and the Achiyama lava dome at the northern end were formed during Nii-jima's only historical eruptions in the 9th century AD. The northern end also contains , the island's highest point, at . The Atchiyama rhyolitic lava dome and neighboring Wakago basaltic pyroclastic deposit contain rare xenoliths composed of gabbro. These gabbroic rock fragments originated from magma bodies that were located beneath the rhyolitic volcano. Shikine-jima and Jinnai-to are part of the same complex, and form separate islands to the southwest and west of Nii-jima. Rhyolite lava gives the island its famed white cliffs and white sandy beaches Nii-jima is prone to earthquake swarms. According to the US Geological Survey map, the area around Nii-jima averages 10‚Äì20 earthquakes, with a magnitude of 5 or greater, each year. However, the often repeated legend that Nii-jima and Shikine-jima were once a single island that was separated by huge tsunami caused by the 1703 Genroku earthquake has no basis in geology. ==Nature== Even though Nii-jima is located relatively close to Honshu, the small population and lower exploitation has allowed the island's natural wildlife to be well preserved, and many varieties can be seen. Riding on the Kuroshio current, many oceanic species and birds migrate thorough the island, Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins that have seemingly moved to here, and other areas, from Mikurajima inhabit the near shores; along with nesting sea turtles, and the occasional visiting manta ray. Almost completely wiped out, due to past hunting, biodiversity of other marine mammals, such as cetaceans and pinnipeds, have become very small and today are only a remnant of their historical numbers. Sperm whales and humpback whales, are the most likely of the larger whales to be observed around Nii-jima, using the island as either a resting ground or a migratory collider from, and to, the wintering grounds around the Bonin Islands. There are also sightings of extremely rare and critically endangered species such as the northern elephant seal (a vagrant was captured in 1989, making it the first record of the species in Japan). retrieved on 19-05-2014 and North Pacific right whales (one whale stayed just several meters off the port in 2011, and kept tail-slapping continuously for several hours).http://niijima.jp/mt/archives/2011/03/post_326.html. retrieved on 19-05-2014The second record of houling-out by an elephant seal and another sighting of a right whales occurred in almost exactly the same area of Tateyama. Additionally the, possibly now-extinct, Japanese sea lion used to breed in the Izu Islands and in the vicinity of Nii-jima, there was a colony on Udone-shima. Although on a different island, in the past a saltwater crocodile has appeared on Hachij≈ç-jima. ==Access== Niijima Airport and Downtown Nii-jima is 2 hours and 20 minutes away by jet boat from Takeshiba Sanbashi Pier, in Tokyo, operated by T≈çkai Kisen. T≈çkai Kisen also operates a 9-hour overnight ferry. The ferry leaves Takeshiba Sanbashi at 22h00 (23h00 in the summer months) and arrives early morning in Izu ≈åshima (approximately 6h00), before continuing on to To-shima (7h00), Nii-jima (8h00), Shikine-jima (8h30), and K≈çzu-shima (9h30). The ferry then returns following the same route, leaving Nii-jima at 12h00 and docking in Tokyo at 17h00. It is possible that in rough weather, the ferry is unable to dock in Nii-jima. There are daily flights, weather permitting, from Ch≈çfu Airport located in western Tokyo. The flight takes approximately 45 minutes. Other ferries leave from Shimoda, Shizuoka Prefecture. Niijima-mura also operates a high-speed ferry between Nii-jima and Shikine-jima with 3 boats per day, and 4 per day in the summer months. ==History== Nii-jima has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and archaeologists have found numerous remains from the J≈çmon period, including stone and ceramic utensils. During the Edo period, as with Hachij≈ç- jima, Nii-jima was used as a place of exile for convicts. The practice was discontinued after the Meiji Restoration. ==Industry== Doraemon visits Niijima High School. A moyai sits in the upper right of the photo. Main industries in Nii-jima include commercial and sports fishing, construction, koga rock mining, and tourism. There is also some small scale farming. Koga stone, a pumice-derived rock of rhyolite was utilized as house building material. Now its silica component is used to make transparent green glass art. It can also be used to make moyai art. The stone is indigenous only to Nii-jima and Lipari Island, Italy. ==Tourism== ===Sites=== The Western, or Maehama side of Nii- jima with December waves crashing through the port. To-shima is the island top left. Maehama Beach on the western side of Nii-jima sees many wind surfers. The triathlon and ocean water swims take place here. Mount Fuji can often be seen from Maehama. Habushi Beach, on the eastern side of the island, is a nationally protected reserve with its waves and white sand, and is a good location for surfing. The beach is approximately 6.5 km long and is overlooked by koga volcanic cliffs, the highest of which is 250 meters. Moyai Hill, overlooking Yunohama and Maehama beaches, contains more than 100 large stone carvings. In the local dialect, moyai means 'to work together in effort', and these statues make evident this effort. On the western side of JR Shibuya in Tokyo proper is a giant moyai statue, a gift from the people of Nii-jima. Yunohama Onsen hot spring, on Yunohama Beach, is a large outdoor bath built in the style of pseudo-Greek ruins that provides stunning panoramic views of the setting sun and the Pacific Ocean. The bath itself accommodates up to 100 bathers. Water used in the bath is drawn from the ocean below. J≈´sansha Jinja, is a Shinto shrine at the base of the cliffs of Mount Miyatsuka in the north- western corner of the main village on the island. This shrine, built in the Edo period, is recognized as caretakers of intangible cultural assets by the Tokyo government for the kagura music and sacred dancing, known as shishi- kiyari that are held every December 8. Nearby J≈´sansha is Ch≈çei-ji, Ch≈çei Temple, a temple dedicated to Nichiren Buddhism. Beside the temple lies the Exiles' Cemetery. The cemetery, covered with the local white sand, is dominated by the gravestones of the 118 exiles, banished to Niijima by the Tokugawa Shogunate during the Edo era for non-political crimes. A short walk from Ch≈çei Temple is the Exile Execution Ground. Eleven exiles who committed crimes on the island were executed here. Komori Yasu, from the kabuki story 'Yowa Nasake Ukinano Yokoguchi' is buried here. Niijima Glass Art Center is a world-renowned site which hosts the Niijima International Glass Art Festival every autumn. At the center, visitors are able to create their own glass work to take home. Next to the museum is the Niijima Glass Art Museum which houses works from guest artists at the festival. Niijima-mura Museum, houses artifacts from the island's pre-history up to its modern-day surfing culture. Included is a replica fishing vessel and house from the Edo period. Details of the criminal exiles are given. A collaborative effort between the education board and the English department at Niijima High School ensured that the museum is completely bilingual: Japanese-English. ===Events=== Swimmers begin the Tokyo Islands Triathlon in Nii-jima at Maehama Beach Niijima hosts the Tokyo Islands Triathlon in Niijima (1.5 km swim, 35 km bicycle ride, and a 10 km run) every May and the Niijima Open Water Swimming (1.5, 3, and 4.5 km open water swims). In the summer months, a number of surfing competitions take place at Habushi Beach. Sport fishing and scuba diving are also popular with both residents and tourists. Every autumn, the Niijima International Glass Art Festival takes place. The festival has taken place since 1988. The festival draws leading glass artists who lead workshops and demonstrations in glass art. Artists who have participated in the festival in the past include: Dale Chihuly, William Morris, and Lucio Bubaco. Work by the above artists, and many more, are on display in the museum. ===Other attractions=== Other attractions on Nii-jima include: Ebine (Calanthe discolor), a pinkish-purplish orchid, can be found throughout the island, especially in Ebine Park, which opens from early spring. Souvenirs from Niijima include the island specialty kusaya - a dried fish, usually mackerel scad (Decapterus macarellus), that has been soaked in a special brine. Kusaya, which means smells bad in Japanese, has an odor that is indeed 'quite' distinct. The village museum has a video on the making of kusaya. If you can get past the smell, you will be rewarded with a rich, delicious meal. Other souvenirs are milk senbei, the ashitaba plant, Niijima glass art, and a local Sh≈çch≈´ called Shima Jiman, island pride. Popular YouTuber from Japan, Chris Gen, featured a trip to Nii-jima and some of his favorite spots of interest in his video. ===Further points of interest=== * LORAN-C transmitter Niijima File:Niijima Habushi Beach.JPGHabushi Beach File:Niijima Habushi Campg-9D9A9.JPGHabushi Campground in early morning File:Niijima Jyusansha Shrine.JPGJ≈´sansha Shrine File:Yunohama Onsen.jpgYunohama Onsen File:Jinai-island.jpgJinai-t≈ç File:Hayashima(Izu-Islands).jpgHanshima File:Nii-jima aerial.jpgAerial photo of Nii-jima ==See also== * Izu Islands * List of islands of Japan * List of volcanoes in Japan ==References== ==External links== * Niijima Village Official Website * Niijima - Japan Meteorological Agency * - Japan Meteorological Agency * Niijima Volcano Group - Geological Survey of Japan * Niijima: Global Volcanism Program - Smithsonian Institution Category:Active volcanoes Category:Islands of Tokyo Category:Izu Islands ","title":"Nii-jima"},{"id":"1445286","text":"Shazzan is an American animated television series, created by Alex Toth and produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that aired on CBS from September 9, 1967 to January 20, 1968 and continued reruns until September 6, 1969. The series follows the adventures of two teenage siblings, Chuck and Nancy, traveling around a mystical Arabian world, mounted on Kaboobie the flying camel. During their journey they face several dangers, but they are aided by Shazzan, a genie with magical powers. 18 half-hour episodes were produced, made up of two 11-minute segments. ==Plot== Chuck (voiced by Jerry Dexter) and Nancy (voiced by Janet Waldo) come across a cave off the coast of Maine where they find a mysterious chest containing halves of a strange ring. When they first joined the rings, they end up transported back to the fabled land of the Arabian Nights where they meet their genie Shazzan (voiced by Barney Phillips). Shazzan creates a magical flying camel named Kaboobie (voiced by Don Messick) to serve as their transportation. Shazzan tells Chuck and Nancy that he can't return them home until they deliver the two rings to his rightful owner. Shazzan is very large, being able to hold Chuck, Nancy and Kaboobie in the open palm of his hand. He is wise and jolly in nature, usually appearing with a cheerful \\"Ho-ho ho-HO!\\" and addressing the two children as his \\"little masters\\". Chuck and Nancy each wear one half of the broken ring, which has to be joined to bring forth their magical servant. A frequent plot device is that the two teenagers became separated, most often by the act of a villain. They can not summon the omnipotent genie until they manage to find each other. Once Shazzan materializes, it is extremely bad news for the villain. ==Style == The series is similar in its style and production details to the other Alex Toth- created CBS Saturday morning cartoons of 1966‚Äì1968, relying heavily on music and sound effects earlier created for Jonny Quest. As is typical for both animated and live-action TV series of the era that revolve around an ongoing dilemma (Dino Boy in the Lost Valley, Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor, Lost In Space, Gilligan's Island, Lidsville, etc.), the heroes never resolve their long-term situation. Chuck and Nancy never find the ring's owner and thus never return to their American teenage lives. ==Voice cast== The cast included: * Barney Phillips as Shazzan * Jerry Dexter as Chuck * Janet Waldo as Nancy * Don Messick as Kaboobie ==List of episodes== Each half-hour episode consists of two 11-minute cartoons. { class= style=\\"width:95%; background:white\\" - style=\\"color:white\\" !

In the episode \\"Mufti Trouble,\\" he had a long-standing rivalry with Mentok the Mindtaker. Shazzan appeared in \\"The Final Encounter\\", an episode of Space Ghost. It was last episode of the six part \\"The Council of Doom\\". Space Ghost falls in a trap that transports him to the dimension of Shazzan. Shazzan helps him defeat the Sultan of Flame and transports him back to his own dimension. A satirized version of Shazzan named Shazzang! appeared as an animated short as part of Robert Smigel's \\"TV Funhouse\\" feature on the late night sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, on the May 14, 2005 episode. The parody depicted the genie Shazzang quickly defeating the villain, but then maiming and executing the villain in an increasingly sadistic fashion, to the horror of Chuck, Nancy, and Kaboobie, eventually babbling about having to \\"please his dad\\". It is shown on the DVD version of the SNL special \\"The Best of TV Funhouse\\". ==Home video== Two episodes of Shazzan were released on a Saturday morning cartoon compilation, along with a short video containing some background information. On April 3, 2012, Warner Archive released Shazzan: The Complete Series on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna‚ÄìBarbera Classics Collection. This is a Manufacture-on- Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and Amazon.com. All episodes, while not perfect, have been faithfully remastered for this release. ==ReferencesCategory:CBS original programming Category:1967 American television series debuts Category:1968 American television series endings Category:1960s American animated television series Category:Genies in television Category:Television series by Hanna- Barbera Category:Hanna-Barbera superheroes Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated science fantasy television series ","title":"Shazzan"},{"id":"1445288","text":"Molodyozhnaya (, \\"Youth\\") (also known as \\"Molodezhnaya\\") was a Soviet, then Russian research station in East Antarctica at 67¬∞40‚Ä≤S 45¬∞50‚Ä≤E.

The area around the station is composed mostly of rocky ridges separated by snow-covered depressions and lakes. The sea near the station is covered in pack ice for much of the year, out to a distance of as much as 100 km at the end of winter. The rise to the summit of the massive East Antarctic Ice Sheet (Dome A) begins 1.5-2.0 km from the shore. Kheis Glacier is located in 15 km east of the station, and Campbell Glacier is roughly the same distance to the southwest.Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI): Molodezhnaya station ==History== The site was opened in February 1962, and used as a launch site for suborbital meteorological sounding rockets. From 25 May 1969 and 26 December 1990, 1104 M-100 model research sounding rockets were launched from Molodyozhnaya Station.Encyclopedia Astronautica: Molodezhnaya On 28 February 1979, the MMR06 model was launched from Molodyozhnaya. This was the only instance of this model rocket being launched from Molodyozhnaya Station.Encyclopedia Astronautica: MMR-06 Funding for meteorological research became scarce during the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union was collapsing. Launches of the M-100 abruptly ended in 1990, and the station was mothballed. In the 1990s, several scientific and environmental studies were undertaken in the area to fulfill the requirements of the Protocol for the Defence of Nature in the Antarctic Treaty System, but the station wasn't reopened. In February 2006, Valeriy Lukin, the head of the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE), said: > There are plans to open the mothballed stations Molodyozhnaya, > Leningradskaya and Russkaya in the 2007-2008 season.

While there were 33 episodes in the first season of Video Power, only 26 episodes of The Power Team were produced. As a result, some episodes of The Power Team would be aired more than once. The Power Team segments did not appear in Video Power's second season. The Power Team was directed by Steven Martiniere and Jack Olesker was the developer and story editor. The cartoon series was produced by Bohbot Entertainment. The show reran on USA Network as Acclaim Masters. ==Overview== The cartoon show featured characters from Acclaim video games, although Acclaim never actually created these games, but merely published the home console versions. They included Max Force from NARC (originally an arcade game by Williams, ported to the NES by Rare), Kuros from the Wizards and Warriors series (originally created by Rare), Kwirk from the game of the same name (originally by Atlus), Tyrone from Arch Rivals (originally by Midway) and Bigfoot from the game of the same name (developed by Beam Software, and based on the famous monster truck). The cartoon show also featured a cartoon version of the host of Video Power, Johnny Arcade, as they fought against villains from the Acclaim lineup, mainly Mr. Big from NARC, although Malkil from Wizards and Warriors or Kwirk's enemies from his own game occasionally appeared as well. The show seemed intended to capitalize on the audiences of both Captain N: The Game Master and The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! a DiC, Saban, and Nintendo series but instead of having two Brooklyn type plumbers transported to a mushroom realm and becoming protectors, as well by having a Malibu teenager getting zapped into a land of video game heroes, The Power Team took the opposite tack by having the game characters come to the real world. A common device on the show was the characters trying to recover the ‚Äúgame paks‚Äù from Mr. Big which would send them home. Mr. Big would actually use the Game Paks to try to blast the characters back home during their battles. While this is what the heroes wanted, had Mr. Big sent them home, doing so would leave Mr. Big in the real world to cause havoc without any competition. Joe Rockhead and Spike, two other NARC characters, worked for Mr. Big. During battles, Johnny would use a special communication device that looked like an NES Advantage controller to direct the Power Team members from his room. ===\\"Radical\\" redesigning=== A few of the characters underwent radical redesigns from their game incarnations: Max Force, for example, looked like a SWAT officer and had a utility belt instead of machine guns, and Kuros bore more resemblance to a barbarian (as Kuros was depicted on the Wizards and Warriors box art), especially the original He-Man, than a knight in armor. Tyrone was given a small afro, likely so he wouldn't resemble Michael Jordan as much as his Arch Rivals counterpart. Mr. Big more closely resembled his game counterpart, but he didn't use a wheelchair and didn't have a \\"second form\\", instead of using cigar-related gadgets and weapons (\\"cigar missiles\\", for example). Secondary villain Malkil was also based on the sinister-looking character from the Wizards and Warriors box art, rather than the stereotypical bearded wizard in purple robes and hat from the games. ===Johnny Arcade's involvement=== Before the beginning of each episode, Johnny Arcade is briefly shown playing each character's game on his NES before they come flying out of the screen. While Johnny was always leading the team, he was very rarely actually seen hanging out with the characters. He'd always be in his room calling the shots. Even though Max Force does take a bit of a leader role, one episode had Mr. Big tamper with Johnny's controls making him unable to give orders. ===Other villains=== While Mr. Big was the primary villain, on occasion, other villains, who were the adversaries of the other characters, would appear, such as Kwirk's enemy Rowdy Roddy Radish. Mr. Big is missing his mustache from the arcade version of his origin. The show also featured an evil living monster truck named Burnt Rubber, who acted as an adversary to Bigfoot. Outside of Mr. Big, the primary villain was Malkil, the warlock who was the main enemy of Kuros, who appeared to be far more sinister than Mr. Big and worked alone, save for one episode when Mr. Big was targeting the Power Team only to be interrupted by Malkil appearing, and both villains figured an alliance may be best to destroy the Power Team. Malkil had also figured that the team would be lost without Johnny Arcade, so at one time he transported the team members to the gothic land of Sindarin, Kuros' native land. The team learned to work without Johnny's leadership and survive in the medieval realm. While Kuros was glad to be home, he explained that he must return to the real world as the goal of the Power Team was to keep villains like Malkil and Mr. Big from ever invading and allow each team member to return to their worlds in peace, thus explaining the rationale of the series. ==Episodes list== #Yes We Have No Tomatoes #Treasure of Bangladar #Hooray for Hollyweird #New Gang in Town #Burnt Rubber #Speedway Assault #Turf Wars #Big Footenstein #It Came to Millburg #Pull the Plug #Deaf Ears #Back to the Game World #Tunnel Radish #Rigged Deal #Criss Cross Double Cross #The Day Johnny Stayed at School #Train Game #Video Virus #A Man and his Belt #Slice & Dice #The Bride of Mr. Big #Who's Game World Is This Anyway? #Ski Patrol #The Greatest Heist of All #The Golden Joystick #Bums ==References== ==External links== * Category:Animated series based on video games Category:Crossover animated television series Category:Superhero teams Category:Television shows based on video games Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:1990s American animated television series Category:1990 American television series debuts Category:1992 American television series endings Category:American children's animated superhero television series ","title":"The Power Team (TV series)"},{"id":"1445301","text":"Prof Robert Hamilton (11 June 1743, Edinburgh ‚Äì 14 July 1829) was a Scottish mathematician and political economist. He was a founder member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. ==Life== The grave of Prof Robert Hamilton, St Nicholas Churchyard, Aberdeen He was born in Edinburgh on 11 June 1743. He was the eighth son of Gavin Hamilton, a bookseller and publisher. His grandfather, William Hamilton, was Professor of Divinity and had also been a Principal of Edinburgh University. His paternal uncle was the Very Rev Prof Robert Hamilton (1707‚Äì87), and he was the cousin of James Hamilton (1749-1835). Having completed his education at the High School, Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh, where he was distinguished in mathematics, Robert was induced to enter a banking-house in order to acquire a practical knowledge of business, but his ambition was really academic. In 1769 he gave up business pursuits and accepted the rectorship of Perth Academy. In 1779 he was presented to the chair of natural philosophy at the University of Aberdeen. For many years, however, by private arrangement with his colleague Professor Patrick Copland, Hamilton taught the class of mathematics. In 1816 he was presented to the latter chair. He retired in 1817 and was succeeded by Prof John Cruickshank.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/130702846/john-cruickshank In his later years he lived at 82 Broad Street in Aberdeen.Aberdeen Post Office Directory 1825-26 He died in 1829. He is buried in the churchyard of the Kirk of St Nicholas on Union Street in Aberdeen. His huge monument (the largest in the churchyard) lies close to the main entrance on Union Street. The grave was designed by the Aberdeen architect James Smith.https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/npmuseum/Scitour/Hamilton.pdf ==Works== Hamilton's most important work is the Essay on the National Debt, which appeared in 1813 and was undoubtedly the first to expose the economic fallacies involved in Pitt's policy of a sinking fund. It is still of value. A posthumous volume published in 1830, The Progress of Society, is also of great ability, and is a very effective treatment of economical principles by tracing their origin and position in the development of social life. Some minor works of a practical character (Introduction to Merchandise, 1777; Essay on War and Peace, 1790) are now forgotten. ==Family== He married twice: firstly to Ann Mitchell of Ladath, and, following her death in 1778, to Jane Morison (d.1825).

Among modern birds, most studies show that Vegavis is most closely related to ducks and geese (Anatidae), but it is not considered to be a direct ancestor of them, Supporting information although other studies question these results.Mayr, G. et al. (2018) On the taxonomic composition and phylogenetic affinities of the recently proposed clade Vegaviidae Agnol√≠n et al., 2017 ‚Äí neornithine birds from the Upper Cretaceous of the Southern Hemisphere. Cretaceous Research, 86:178-185. Vegavis was a bird with high metabolism, which allowed it to live at high latitudes in Antarctica. It also shows a degree of osteosclerosis, a condition shared with Polarornis. This different degrees of osteosclerosis could be related to variations in diving behaviour. == Etymology == The genus name, Vegavis, is a combination of the name of Vega Island and \\"avis\\", the Latin word for bird. The species name, \\"iaai\\", is after the acronym for Instituto Antartico Argentino (IAA), the Argentine scientific expedition to Antarctica. == Description == The discovery of the type species, Vegavis iaai, demonstrates that the major groups of bird alive today had already diversified in the Cretaceous. This supports the longstanding phylogenetic inferences of paleornithologists. It has been hailed as the first definitive physical proof that representatives of some of the groups of modern birds lived in the Mesozoic. The holotype specimen of Vegavis is held by the Museo de La Plata, Argentina. The specimen, cataloged as MLP 93-I-3-1, was found in the L√≥pez de Bertodano Formation at Cape Lamb on Vega Island, Antarctica, in 1993, but was only described as a new species in 2005 because it consists of the very delicate remains of one bird embedded in a concretion, which had to be meticulously prepared for study. CT scans were utilized to gain a clearer picture of the bone structure without running danger of damaging or destroying the fossil. A second specimen, MACN-PV 19.748, was found beside the holotype specimen. It was preserved in three dimensions; CT scans were again utilized to visualize the intact syrinx of this specimen. The syrinx has an asymmetrical third segment, suggesting that Vegavis had two sources of sound in the neck and along with large soft-tissue resonating structures. This indicates that it was likely capable of honks as in ducks, geese, and other basal neognaths. In 2017 a phylogenetic study Agnol√≠n and colleagues have found Vegavis to be stem-anseriforms along with Polarornis, Neogaeornis and Australornis in the family Vegaviidae. == See also == * Asteriornis == References == == External links == * 'Dinosaurs Mingled with Cousins of Ducks and Chickens', from Live Science * ‚ÄòThese Are the Dinosaurs That Didn't Die‚Äô, from National Geographic Category:Anatoidea Category:Bird genera Category:Cretaceous birds of Antarctica Category:Fossils of Antarctica Category:Fossil taxa described in 2005 ","title":"Vegavis"},{"id":"1445323","text":"Ren√© Moore (born Ivan Rene Moore; May 19, 1959)Rene Moore birth reference, from Jet magazine, issue from 8/22/1983. is an American singer-songwriter and producer, and is more memorable musically for hits he produced with his soul co-singer Angela Winbush as part of Ren√© & Angela, including \\"I'll Be Good,\\" \\"Save Your Love (For #1),\\" \\"Your Smile,\\" and \\"You Don't Have to Cry.\\"CRATE-DIG DUSTY: The Career of Angela Winbush ==Biography== Moore and singer Angela Winbush first met in 1979 in his hometown of Los Angeles, California and began performing together as Rene & Angela later that year, recording a self-titled debut album. They would go on to become one of the most successful writer/producer duos in R&B; history, cultivating hit songs for contemporary luminaries, including Stephanie Mills and Kurtis Blow. Ren√© & Angela released their self-titled debut album in 1980, followed by Wall to Wall (1982), and Rise (1983), all on Capitol Records. During this period they had two moderate R&B; hit singles, \\"I Love You More\\" and \\"My First Love\\". The two stopped working professionally together in 1986. They pursued successful solo careers amid legal disputes over creative rights to their work together, and others with which they collaborated as composers, songwriters, and producers. In spite of this, both Winbush and Moore continue to enjoy substantial success in their respective solo careers, with Moore going on to compose and produce hits for many major artists, most notably Michael Jackson; and together they wrote and produced four songs for Janet Jackson's first, self-titled album. Over the course of his career, Moore has been nominated for two Grammys: one for Song of the Year, Michael Jackson's New Jack Swing-hit Jam and a second for Producer of the Album of the Year, Michael Jackson's HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. Moore released a solo album, Street Songz for Rufftown Entertainment Group, Inc. in 2004. ==A Street Called Desire == During Rene & Angela's early years, Moore and Winbush were asked to produce songs for Janet Jackson's 1982 self-titled debut album, Janet Jackson. One of the songs, \\"Young Love\\", became Jackson's first top ten R&B; hit reaching number six on the chart.Ebony Jun 1990 They also wrote successfully for Stephanie Mills, (their \\"I Have Learned to Respect the Power of Love\\", gave Mills her first- ever No. 1 R&B; single, in 1985). Just prior to that, Rene & Angela decided to branch out and find a bigger fan base signing with Mercury Records in 1984. They released their breakthrough album, A Street Called Desire in early 1985. Among the hit singles included on this classic album was their first R&B; No. 1 with the dance single, \\"Save Your Love (For #1)\\", which included guest vocals from rapper Kurtis Blow, making it besides Chaka Khan's \\"I Feel For You\\", one of the first songs to prominently feature a guest rapper as a featured performer. Other hit singles included the Top 5 hit single \\"I'll Be Good\\"; \\"Your Smile\\" was another R&B; No. 1 hit while the subsequent \\"You Don't Have to Cry\\", hit Number Two in the beginning of 1986, followed by yet another Top 5 hit, \\"No How-No Way\\". Eventually A Street Called Desire sold over a million copies going platinum, but on the brink of their greatest success, tensions between Moore and Winbush had grown, and they dissolved the partnership. Moore went on to compose and produce hits most notably for, and with, Michael Jackson. ==Influence== Since starting out with Rene & Angela, Moore and Winbush have played and continue to play an influence on various R&B; and hip-hop acts. In the latter genre, their music has been sampled by acts such as Jay-Z (who sampled their \\"Imaginary Playmates\\" for his song \\"Imaginary Players\\"), The Notorious B.I.G. (who featured Jay-Z on his Rene & Angela sampled \\"I Love You More\\" for the song \\"I Love the Dough\\"), Foxy Brown (who sampled their \\"I'll Be Good\\" for her 1997 top ten hit, \\"I'll Be\\" which featured Jay-Z; as well as their song \\"Secret Rendezvous\\" for her hit, \\"Bonnie and Clyde, Part 2\\"); Hip-Hop Group Junior M.A.F.I.A. sampled Rene & Angela's \\"Your Smile\\" for their rap song \\"Backstabbers\\"; Rapper Sylk-E. Fyne's 1998 Platinum hit \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" sampled Rene & Angela's R&B; Top 5 hit \\"You Don't Have to Cry\\"; Sylk-E. Fyne also sampled their Top 5 hit \\"Your Smile\\" for her song \\"Your Style\\"; additionally, Adina Howard re-recorded their \\"You Don't Have to Cry\\" as a duet; and Avant re-recorded the Rene & Angela ballad, \\"My First Love\\", with singer Keke Wyatt in 2000. Moore and former partner Winbush also shared the distinction for being one of the first R&B; acts to prominently feature a rap act in a R&B; song, sharing that distinction with Jody Watley, Chaka Khan and funk band Cameo. ==Albums== * Destination Love (1988)Ren√© Moore- Destination Love @Discogs.com Retrieved June 25, 2011. * Street Songz (2004) ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Songwriters from California Category:Record producers from California Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Singers from Los Angeles Category:American rhythm and blues musicians ","title":"Ren√© Moore"},{"id":"1445330","text":"The Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground, also known as Musudan- ri,http://www.planet4589.org/space/jsr/back/news.607 is a rocket launching site in North Korea. ==Location== It lies in southern Hwadae County, North Hamgyong Province, near Musu Dan, the cape marking the northern end of the East Korea Bay. The area was formerly known as Taep'o-dong (ÎåÄÌè¨Îèô) during the period when Korea was occupied by Japan, and the Taepodong rockets take their name from this. This single loose-surface road is susceptible to seasonal flooding. The site is 45 km northeast of port city of Kimchaek and 45 kilometers (28 miles) from the town of Kilju (Í∏∏Ï£ºÏùç). There is a small wharf located at the fishing village of Tongha-dong but can only accommodate vessels smaller than 40 meters in length. ==History== By the early 80s, North Korea needed a flight-test facility for its program to reverse-engineer and produce copies of the Scud-B which it acquired from the Soviet Union in the late 60s. Previously, North Korea used a facility at Hwajin-ri (ËèØÈÄ≤Èáå), Pyongwon-kun, South Pyongan Province to test for anti-ship missiles and probably FROGs, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and other rockets. However, Hawjin-ri had insufficient range for the Hwasong-5, which would enter Chinese territorial waters during a test. The construction of the facility continued off and on throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Construction was made by the 117th Regiment under the Air Force Construction Bureau (Á©∫ËªçÂª∫Ë®≠ÈÉ®) of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces.\\"Two Facilities Seen at North Korean missile Base, Newspaper Says,\\" Deutsche Presse-Agentur, 3 August 1999 Construction of the launch pad was completed in 1985. During the early stage of construction, the site had an extremely rudimentary infrastructure, such as a few roads, a command bunker, a radar facility, and modest storage and support facilities. However, by the early 1990s the Tonghae site was reportedly expanded from 2 km to 9 km and the following infrastructure was added: a missile assembly facility, a fuel storage facility, a guidance and range control center, and tracking facilities. Since 1984 military rockets of the types Hwasong, Rodong and Taepodong-1 were launched from Musudan-ri. In 1998, North Korean media reported the successful launch of the Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-1 satellite by a Baekdusan-1 SLV from Musudan-ri. North Korea claimed their first satellite was successfully placed into orbit, but no independent sources have confirmed this. A review of the rocket engine test stand on DigitalGlobe imagery coverage from February 15, 2002 to February 26, 2009 revealed a variety of activity, including drying grain on the concrete, the presence of cylindrical storage tanks and the arrival/departure of multiple support vehicles and personnel. A second failed satellite launch attempt apparently occurred in 2006. ==Facilities== Map showing missile assembly building at the left, and the launch pad at the right.

He became a Quaker icon because of his paintings. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Edward Hicks, The Peaceable Kingdom (1826), National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC Edward Hicks was born in his grandfather's mansion at Attleboro (now Langhorne), in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. His parents were Anglican. Isaac Hicks, his father, was a Loyalist who was left without any money after the British defeat in the Revolutionary War. After young Edward's mother died when he was eighteen months old, Matron Elizabeth Twining ‚Äì a close friend of his mother's ‚Äì raised him as one of her own at their farm, known as the Twining Farm. Note: This includes He apparently also resided at the David Leedom Farm. Note: This includes She also taught him the Quaker beliefs, which had a great effect on the rest of his life. At the age of thirteen Hicks began an apprenticeship to coach makers William and Henry Tomlinson. He stayed with them for seven years, during which he learned the craft of coach painting. In 1800 he left the Tomlinson firm to earn his living independently as a house and coach painter, and in 1801 he moved to Milford to work for Joshua C. Canby, a coach maker.Hicks 2009, p. 40. At this stage of his life Hicks was, as he later wrote in his memoirs, \\"in my own estimation a weak, wayward young man ... exceedingly fond of singing, dancing, vain amusements, and the company of young people, and too often profanely swearing\\".Hicks 2009, pp. 37‚Äì38. Dissatisfied with his life, he started to attend Quaker meetings regularly, and in 1803 he was accepted for membership in the Society of Friends. Later that same year he married a Quaker woman named Sarah Worstall. ===Working career=== A Peaceable Kingdom with Quakers Bearing Banners (1829‚Äì30), Terra Foundation for American Art. In 1812, his congregation recorded him as a minister, and by 1813, he began traveling throughout Philadelphia as a Quaker preacher. To meet the expenses of traveling, and for the support of his growing family, Hicks decided to expand his trade to painting household objects and farm equipment as well as tavern signs. His painting trade was lucrative, but it upset some in the Quaker community, because it contradicted the plain customs they respected. In 1815 Hicks briefly gave up ornamental painting and attempted to support his family by farming, while also continuing with the plain, utilitarian type of painting that his Quaker neighbors thought acceptable.Weekley and Barry 1999, p. 29. His financial difficulties only increased, as utilitarian painting was less remunerative, and Hicks did not have the experience he needed to cultivate the land, or run a farm primarily on his own. By 1816, his wife was expecting a fifth child. After a relative of Hicks, at the urging of Hicks' close friend John Comly, talked to him about painting again, Hicks resumed decorative painting. This friendly suggestion saved Hicks from financial disaster, and preserved his livelihood not as a Quaker Minister but as a Quaker artist.Miller and Mather. Edward Hicks, His Peaceable Kingdoms and Other Paintings. Newark: 1983. Around 1820, Hicks made the first of his many paintings of The Peaceable Kingdom. Hicks' easel paintings were often made for family and friends, not for sale, and decorative painting remained his main source of income.Weekley and Barry 1999, p. 6. In 1827, a schism formed within the Religious Society of Friends, between Hicksites (named after Edward Hicks' cousin Elias Hicks) and Orthodox Friends.Weekley and Barry 1999, p. 10. As new settlers swelled Pennsylvania's Quaker community, many branched off into sects whose differences sometimes conflicted with one another, which greatly discouraged Edward Hicks from continuing to preach.Bauman, J. For The Reputation of Truth. London:1971 Nonetheless, in his lifetime Hicks was better known as a minister than as a painter.Weekley and Barry 1999, p. 34. He is buried at Newtown Friends Meetinghouse Cemetery in Newtown Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. ===Painting=== Quaker beliefs prohibited a lavish life or having excessive quantities of objects or materials. Unable to maintain his work as a preacher and painter at the same time, Hicks transitioned into a life of painting, and he used his canvases to convey his beliefs. He was unconfined by rules of his congregation, and able to freely express what religion could not: the human conception of faith.Saliner, Sharon. To Serve Well and Faithfully. London: 1862. One of over 60 versions of The Peaceable Kingdom painted by Edward Hicks, c. 1833‚Äì1834. Brooklyn Museum Although it is not considered a religious image, Hicks' Peaceable Kingdom exemplifies Quaker ideals. Hicks painted 62 versions of this composition. The animals and children are taken from Isaiah 11:6‚Äì8 (also echoed in Isaiah 65:25), including the lion eating straw with the ox. Hicks used his paintings as a way to define his central interest, which was the quest for a redeemed soul. This theme was also from one of his theological beliefs.Hicks, E., & Mather, E. P. Edward Hicks: A gentle spirit. New York: Andrew Crispo Gallery Inc., 1975. Hicks' work was influenced by a specific Quaker belief referred to as the Inner Light. George Fox and other founding Quakers had established and preached the Inner Light doctrine. Fox explained that along with scriptural knowledge, many individuals achieve salvation by yielding one's self-will to the divine power of Christ and the \\"Christ within\\". This \\"Christ in You\\" concept was derived from the Bible's Colossians 1:27. Hicks depicted humans and animals to represent the Inner Light's idea of breaking physical barriers (of difference between two individuals) to working and living together in peace. Many of his paintings further exemplify this concept with depictions of Native Americans meeting the settlers of Pennsylvania, with William Penn prominent among them. Hicks admired Penn as an opponent of British power in America, and he hoped that Penn could help ensure reform. Like Penn, Hicks opposed Britain's hierarchy. Hicks most esteemed Penn for establishing the treaty of Pennsylvania with the Native Americans, because it was a state that strongly fostered the Quaker community. Morrison, C.M. Remember William Penn 1644. William Penn's Religion. Pennsylvania: 1703. ===Exhibition=== Peaceable Kingdom of the Branch, oil on canvas, c. 1826‚Äì1830. Reynolda House Museum of American Art Edward Hicks' first major exhibition took place in 1860 at Williamsburg, Virginia. It got mixed reviews due to Hicks' habit of repeating various arrangements over and over again. Hicks' earliest presentation of work was in 1826. Kingdoms of the Branch was at that time in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Hicks used Penn and the Native Americans to paraphrase Isaiah's prophecy, in full. His work often focused on religious subject matter while using current events to portray them. Hicks conveyed meaning through symbols,Vlach, John. Quaker Tradition and the Paintings of Edward A Strategy for the Study of Folk Art, JSTOR. New York: American Folk Society,1981. and depicted predators (such as lions) and prey (such as lambs) next to each other to show a theme of peace. Peaceable Kingdoms of the Branch (1826‚Äì30), is now located in Reynolda House, Museum of American Art, Winston-Salem, NC. It is a notable example of Hicks' legacy.Twinning. Hicks, 1780‚Äì1849. Abby Aldrich Rockefeller American Folk Art Museum, 2008. A special collection on Edward Hicks is among the holdings of the Newtown Historic Association. ===Works=== Hicks' works display similarities from painting to painting. For example, his 1834 version of \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" and 1845 version of \\"The Residence of David Twining\\" offer many comparisons (please see first two paintings displayed below). First, the right area of both paintings appears to be the most congested area, in which the size of each object seems to reflect its importance regardless of its position in space. Both paintings show humans and animals interacting together, and evoke a sense of community because the people are portrayed as trying to accomplish something. In the case of \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\", there are settlers in the background, signing a treaty with the Native Americans. Calmness and peace, rather than abrupt action, characterize Hicks' compositions. Many of the shapes and forms in his work appear to be organic, flowing and soft. One must pay close attention to the gestures of individuals and animals in his paintings to derive meaning. Hicks uses small detail variations as a way to force viewers to pay attention to content because they are deliberate and purposeful. Although none of his paintings are completely identical, there are certain compositional structures and patterns Hicks follows within all of his work. Although the space may appear shallow on the picture plane of these paintings, depth is created through objects and objects size, and secondarily by light and shadows. The foreground, middle ground and background are all defined by objects, animals, landscape, humans, and skylines. Hicks almost always painted outdoor scenes, in which the light source is the sun or sky. The color schemes of his work are not complicated, and within a painting such as \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" many of the colors have the same warmth or brown tone. This is another way that Hicks' tries to convey \\"uniformity\\" or peace. Most of these paintings are asymmetrically balanced, to reflect actions taking place between groups of people and animals within the work. ==Gallery of major works== File:Washington at the Delaware c1849 Edward Hicks.jpgWashington at the Delaware, (c.1849) Image:Edward Hicks 001.jpgThe Residence of David Twining, (1845‚Äì1848), Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection Image:Edward Hicks, American - Noah's Ark - Google Art Project.jpgNoah's Ark (1846), Philadelphia Museum of Art Image:Edward Hicks - Penn's Treaty.jpegPenn's Treaty (1847), private collection Image:Edward Hicks - The Cornell Farm.jpgThe Cornell Farm (1848), National Gallery of Art ==Selected works and their locations== * The Residence of David Twining 1785, 1846, American Folk Art Museum, New York City * The Peaceable Kingdom, c. 1833, Worcester Art Museum, Worcester, Massachusetts * The Falls of Niagara, c. 1825, and The Peaceable Kingdom, c. 1830‚Äì32, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City * Penn's Treaty With the Indians, c. 1830‚Äì40, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas * Noah's Ark, 1846 and The Peaceable Kingdom, c. 1844‚Äì46, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia * Grave of William Penn, 1847, Newark Museum, Newark, New Jersey * The Cornell Farm, 1848; The Grave of William Penn, c. 1847‚Äì48; The Landing of Columbus, c. 1837; The Peaceable Kingdom, c. 1834; Penn's Treaty With the Indians, c. 1840‚Äì1l44; and Portrait of a Child, c. 1840, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC * The Peaceable Kingdom, 1830‚Äì32, Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, Montgomery, Alabama * Peaceable Kingdom of the Branch, c. 1826‚Äì30, Reynolda House Museum of American Art, Winston-Salem, North Carolina ==References== ==Sources== *Bauman, J.

William Duff, M.A., minister, of Grange, Banffshire, 1821‚Äì44, who died 23 September 1844, aged 53, by his wife Mary Steinson. Andrew was educated at the Marischal College and the University of Aberdeen. On coming to London in 1849 he was for some time connected with the Morning Chronicle, the Leader, the People's Journal, and other periodicals. He soon became known as a writer, and discarded the name of Duff. In 1851 he wrote the article Beggars in Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor. His work having attracted the notice of Thackeray, he was invited to write for the Cornhill Magazine, and was a constant contributor to All the Year Round. To the latter periodical he furnished a series of essays from 1861 onwards, which were afterwards collected into volumes entitled Everyday Papers, Sunnyside Papers, and Town and Country. His article in All the Year Round called My Account with Her Majesty was reprinted by order of the postmaster-general, and more than half a million copies circulated. As one of the founders and president of the Savage Club in 1857, he naturally took an interest in dramatic writing, and on Boxing night 1858, in conjunction with Frederick Lawrence, produced at the Strand Theatre a burlesque entitled Kenilworth, which ran upwards of one hundred nights, and was followed by a travesty of Romeo and Juliet. In partnership with William Brough he then wrote the Pretty Horsebreaker, the Census, the Area Belle, and several other farces. In domestic drama he was the author of Daddy Gray, the Loving Cup, Checkmate, and Love's Dream, pieces produced with much success by Miss Oliver at the Royalty Theatre. The Great City, a piece put on the stage at Drury Lane on 22 April 1867, although not remarkable for the plot or dialogue, hit the public taste and ran 102 nights. The opening piece at the new Vaudeville Theatre, London, 16 April 1870, For Love or Money, was written by Halliday. He also was the writer of a series of dramas adapted from the works of well-known authors. These pieces were: Little Em'ly, Olympic Theatre, 9 October 1869, which ran two hundred nights; Amy Robsart, Drury Lane, 24 September 1870; Nell, Olympic Theatre, 19 November; Notre Dame, Adelphi Theatre, 10 April 1871; Rebecca, Drury Lane, 23 September; Hilda, Adelphi, 1 April 1872; The Lady of the Lake, Drury Lane, 21 September; and Heart's Delight, founded on Dickens Dombey and Son, Globe Theatre, 17 December 1873. After visiting Australia James Robertson Anderson appeared in 1874 at Drury Lane as Richard I in Halliday's adaption of Sir Walter Scott's novel The Talisman. He possessed a remarkable talent for bringing out the salient points of a novel, and his adaptations were successful where others failed. Charles Dickens warmly approved the construction of Little Em'ly. From 1873 Halliday suffered from softening of the brain. He died at 74 St. Augustine's Road, Camden Town, London, 10 April 1877, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 14 April. ==Printed works== His works include # The Adventures of Mr. Wilderspin in his Journey through Life, 1860. # Everyday Papers, 1864, 2 vols. # Sunnyside Papers, 1866. # Town and Country Sketches, 1866. # The Great City, a novel, 1867. # The Savage Club Papers, 1867 and 1868, edited by A.

He was the editor of The Granta in 1919. ==Sporting achievements== Whilst at Clifton, Keigwin partnered AEJ Collins in the school racquets pair (he was also the school racquets captain) and he captained the school cricket XI for 1902-3 when Collins also played. In March 1903 Keigwin was runner-up at the Cambridge University's Freshmen's Lawn Tennis Tournament, losing in the final in two straight sets to future Wimbledon champion Tony Wilding without winning a game. In addition to playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club at cricket, he also represented Cambridge University at cricket, rackets, football and hockey. He played hockey for Essex and England, and cricket and tennis for Gloucestershire. He also played for the Free Foresters against the Netherlands cricket XI in the 1920s, although he did not appear for Free Foresters at first-class level. After the First World War, as a result of Keigwin's interest in Danish cricket, the game in Denmark picked up whilst he lived there and British cricket teams began visiting Denmark more frequently - these teams included the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Leicestershire, Incogniti, Gentlemen of Worcestershire and Sir Julien Cahn's XI. Keigwin's best bowling figures in first-class cricket were 8/79 against Sussex in 1903. A year later, he scored his only first-class hundred, for Cambridge against Warwickshire.

Forming from a tropical wave on September 9, 1997, Linda steadily intensified and reached hurricane status within 36 hours of developing. The storm rapidly intensified, reaching sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and an estimated central pressure of ; both were records for the eastern Pacific until Hurricane Patricia surpassed them in 2015. The hurricane was briefly forecast to move toward southern California, but instead, it turned out to sea and lost its status as a tropical cyclone on September 17, before dissipating on September 21\\\\. Linda was the fifteenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season. While near peak intensity, Hurricane Linda passed near Socorro Island, where it damaged meteorological instruments. The hurricane produced high waves along the southwestern Mexican coastline, forcing the closure of five ports. If Linda had made landfall on southern California as predicted, it would have been the strongest storm to do so since a storm in 1939. Though it did not hit the state, the hurricane produced light to moderate rainfall across the region, causing mudslides and flooding in the San Gorgonio Wilderness; two houses were destroyed and 77 others were damaged, and damage totaled US$3.2 million (as of 1997; $ USD) == Meteorological history == The origins of Hurricane Linda are believed to have been in a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 24\\\\. The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development. An area of convection developed to the west of Panama in the Pacific Ocean on September 6, which is believed to have been related to the tropical wave. The system continued westward, and within three days of entering the basin, a poorly defined circulation formed. Banding features began to develop, and at around 1200 UTC on September 9, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. At the time, it was approximately south of the Mexican city of Manzanillo. On becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression moved northwestward at , partially under the influence of a mid- to upper-level low near the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Deep convection and banding features increased, and the depression intensified into a tropical storm early on September 10\\\\. Upon being designated, the cyclone was named Linda by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). As upper-level outflow became well- established, the storm began to strengthen quickly. By September 11, an intermittent eye appeared, by which time the NHC estimated that Linda reached hurricane status. The storm began to rapidly intensify; its small eye became well-defined and surrounded by very cold convection. In a 24‚Äëhour period, the minimum pressure dropped , or an average drop of per hour. Such intensification met the criterion for explosive deepening, an average hourly pressure decrease of at least . By early September 12, Hurricane Linda reached Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and around 0600 UTC, Linda attained estimated peak winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) about 145 mi (235 km) southeast of Socorro Island. Its maximum sustained winds were estimated between 180 mph (285 km/h) and 195 mph (315 km/h), based on Dvorak T-numbers of 7.5 and 8.0 respectively, and gusts were estimated to have reached 220 mph (350 km/h). The hurricane's pressure is estimated at , making Linda the most intense Pacific hurricane at the time. When the storm was active, its pressure was estimated to have been slightly lower, at . Visible satellite image of Hurricane Linda's eye near peak intensity Shortly after reaching peak intensity, Hurricane Linda passed near Socorro Island as a Category 5 hurricane. Around that time, tropical cyclone forecast models suggested that the hurricane would turn toward southern California due to an approaching upper-level trough. Had Linda struck the state, it would have been much weaker at that time, possibly moving ashore as a tropical storm. Instead, Hurricane Linda turned west-northwestward away from land in response to a building ridge to the north of the hurricane. Despite remaining away from land, moisture from the storm reached southern California to produce rainfall. On September 14, the Hurricane Hunters and airplanes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration investigated the hurricane to provide better data on the powerful hurricane. Hurricane Linda quickly deteriorated as it tracked toward cooler waters, weakening to tropical storm status on September 15\\\\. Two days later, when located about west of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, it weakened to tropical depression status. Linda no longer met the criteria for a tropical cyclone by September 18, although its remnant circulation persisted for a few more days before dissipating. Forecasters and computer models did not anticipate how quickly Linda would strengthen; in one advisory, the NHC under-forecast how strong the winds would be in 72 hours by . The maximum potential intensity for Linda was , lower than its actual intensity. The 1997 season was affected by the 1997‚Äì98 El Ni√±o event, which brought warmer than normal water temperatures and contributed to the high intensity of several storms. Hurricane Linda occurred about a month after the similarly powerful Hurricane Guillermo, which also reached Category 5 status. The passage of Linda cooled the waters in the region, causing Hurricane Nora to weaken when it passed through the area on September 21. == Preparations and impact == Hurricane Linda near Socorro Island on September 12 Although the eye of Hurricane Linda did not make landfall, the hurricane passed near Socorro Island while near peak intensity. The hurricane cut power to wind and pressure instruments. A station on the island recorded a pressure of before it stopped producing data. No tropical cyclone warnings or watches were issued for the hurricane. However, the threat for high tides and strong winds in Mexico prompted officials to issue coastal flood warnings and to close five ports. Waves of up to were reported along the coastline, causing flooding in the states of Michoac√°n, Jalisco, Nayarit, and Sinaloa. Forecast track of Linda on September 13, showing a track towards Southern California When Linda was predicted to turn towards the northeast, it was forecast to move ashore in Southern California as a weak tropical storm, which would have made Linda the first to do so since a tropical storm in 1939. The Oxnard, California National Weather Service office issued public information and special weather statements that discussed the possible impact of Linda on southern California. The advisories mentioned forecasting uncertainty, and advised the media not to exaggerate the storm. The office noted a threat for significant rainfall‚Äîpossibly causing flash flooding‚Äîas well as high surf. To prepare for possible flooding, workers cleaned storm drains and prepared sandbags for coastal properties. Although the storm did not make the turn, waves reached southern California. In Newport Beach, a wave swept five people off a jetty and carried them out to sea, although all were rescued by a passing boat. Moisture from the hurricane moved across the state, producing heavy rainfall and golfball-sized hail. A station in Forrest Falls, located within the San Gorgonio Wilderness, recorded rainfall rates of per hour. The rainfall caused severe flooding and mudslides which destroyed two houses, damaged 77 others, and inflicted $3.2 million in damage (1997 USD, $4.3 million 2008 USD). San Diego recorded of rain, the first measurable precipitation in 164 days; this tied the record for the longest duration without rainfall at the station, previously set in 1915 and 1924. Moisture from Linda extended into the Upper Midwest, contributing to a record daily rainfall total of in Minneapolis, Minnesota. == Records == With an estimated minimum central pressure of , Hurricane Linda became the most intense Pacific hurricane since reliable records began in the 1966 season. Until Hurricane Patricia of 2015, Linda was also believed to have been the strongest since overall records began in the basin in 1949. The previous most intense hurricane was Hurricane Ava in 1973, which had a confirmed minimum pressure of . Since no observations recorded the pressure during Linda's peak, its peak intensity was estimated. As such, Ava remained the strongest directly-measured hurricane in the basin at the time. == See also == * Other tropical cyclones named Linda * List of California hurricanes * List of Pacific hurricanes * Timeline of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season == References == Linda Linda (1997) Linda (1997) Linda (1997) Category:1997 natural disasters in the United States Category:1997 in California Category:1997 in Mexico ","title":"Hurricane Linda (1997)"},{"id":"1445382","text":"Zilog Z8 processor Zilog Z8 (Super-8 family) The Zilog Z8 is a microcontroller architecture, originally introduced in 1979, which today also includes the Z8 Encore!, eZ8 Encore!,The \\"Encore!\\" products contains the newer eZ8 core which is 2-3 times as clock cycle efficient as the original Z8 core. eZ8 Encore!

AgriLife Research is the agricultural and life sciences research agency of the U.S. state of Texas and a part of the Texas A&M; University System. Formerly named Texas Agricultural Research Service, the agency's name was changed January 1, 2008, as part of a rebranding of Texas A&M; AgriLife (formerly Texas A&M; Agriculture). The A&M; was formally added to the agency's name on September 1, 2012, as part of a branding effort by the Texas A&M; University System to strengthen the association between the agencies and Texas A&M; University. The agricultural experiment station division is headquartered at Texas A&M;'s flagship campus in College Station, Texas. Texas AgriLife Research serves all 254 Texas counties and operates 15 research centers throughout the state. Texas A&M; AgriLife Research specialists in beef cattle have produced the world's largest set of gene-mapping resources for beef cattle and have cloned what is believed to be the first animal‚Äîa calf‚Äîspecifically cloned for disease resistance. ==History== The history of Texas A&M; AgriLife Research began with the founding of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (Texas A.M.C.) in 1871, the state's first public institute of higher education. Initially, the university did not offer any agricultural classes, leading to protests by farmer groups and much of college's leadership being replaced. Despite the new curriculum in agriculture and engineering, the college's enrollment continued to drop. The land-grant colleges around the country were struggling. With the ample land available in the West, most farmers had little incentive to adopt intensive farming methods and other advanced agricultural technologies. As with Texas A.M.C., the agricultural colleges were being criticized for not actually giving their students the training that would enable them to return to their family farms, and instead the graduates were leaving the farm life altogether. For most observers, however, the biggest issue was that no solid agricultural research on which to base the practical teaching was being attempted, so to fill this need, Congress passed the Hatch Experiment Station Act of 1887, which provided funding for agricultural experiment stations in each state. This led to the founding of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in 1887 at Texas A.M.C. This new organization was given the task of conducting research in all aspects of crop and livestock operations. In 1948, Texas A&M; formed the Texas A&M; University System, incorporating Texas AgriLife Research and six related agencies which are still part of the system today.TAMU System Agency Overview FAQ In 2007, Dr. Elsa Murano, who was overseeing Texas A&M; Agriculture as a whole, hired a consulting firm to evaluate the name of Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, as well as other Texas A&M; Agriculture organizations. On January 1, 2008, the Experiment Stations' name was changed to Texas AgriLife Research. Murano felt that \\"AgriLife\\" better reflected the agency's foundational message that \\"agriculture is life\\", while Research better reflected what the organization did. The A&M; was formally added to the agency's name on September 1, 2012, as part of a branding effort by the Texas A&M; University System to strengthen the association between the agencies and Texas A&M; University. ==Research highlights== Through its research, the organization helped eradicate Texas fever, a bovine disease spread by ticks that threatened the state's cattle industry. In the 1920s, it conducted the first known studies on the crossbreeding of cattle, which went on to become a national practice still in use by the cattle industry. In 1931, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station developed the first mechanical cotton stripper, a machine that would become widely adopted by cotton farmers within a decade. The organization is a world leader in sorghum research, having begun with its developing the first known sorghum hybrid in 1955. In the 1950s, it also again came to the aid of the cattle industry by developing techniques for destroying screwworms which were plaguing cattle in Texas and Central America. It also developed the '1015Y' onion, opening the way for Texas to become the leading producer of fresh market onions in America. It helped produce a mild jalape√±o pepper ('TAM'), increasing the sales of salsa, and 'BetaSweet' carrots which have higher levels of beta carotene. Its animal researchers helped produce gene mapping resources for cattle, and lead to the cloning of the first calf. ===Center locations=== *Amarillo *Beaumont *Corpus Christi *Dallas *El Paso *Fort Stockton *Lubbock *Overton *Pecos *San Angelo *Stephenville *Temple *Uvalde *Vernon *Weslaco ==ReferencesAgriLife Research Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center Category:Texas A&M; University System Category:Organizations established in 1887 AgriLife Research, Texas AandM ","title":"Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research"},{"id":"1445402","text":"Farah may refer to: * Farah (name) * Farah River, a river in western Afghanistan * Farah, Afghanistan, a town in southwest Afghanistan on the banks Farah River * Farah, India, a town in Uttar Pradesh, India * Farah Province, one of the western provinces of Afghanistan ==See also== *Fara (disambiguation) *Farra (disambiguation) ","title":"Farah"},{"id":"1445404","text":"Dream Street was an American pop boy band\\"Into the Mouths of Babes\\". Phoenix New Times, Jimmy Magahern, July 18, 2002 that was formed in 1999 by Louis Baldonieri and Brian Lukow. The band disbanded in 2002 following a legal dispute between parents of the band members and the band's managers. ==History== The group was initially put together by music producers Louis Baldonieri and Brian Lukow. Originally named 'Boy Wonder' (a name borrowed from the nickname of comic book character Robin from the Batman comics and films). The band featured several boys aged 11‚Äì14 from the New York Broadway/Acting scene. Baldonieri and Lukow hoped to make an impact on the pop music industry by introducing a group of teenagers to the scene, all of whom had prior stage-singing experience. Among these original members were former The Broadway Kids members Gregory Raposo and the late Chris Trousdale, who would continue on into the remade group from 1999 until 2002. The lineup was changed not long after they debuted the show in front of several talent agents and record label reps. Their debut included a tap dance number and a jazzy theme song, both of which were sacked quickly after. It also included a cover of the popular song from the musical Rent \\"Seasons of Love.\\" Matt Ballinger, Frankie J. Galasso, Jesse McCartney, Raposo and Trousdale would become the new faces of the group and were given the name \\"Dream Street,\\" which was the name of Lukow and Baldonieri's recording studio in New York City. The only original song they kept was titled \\"Jennifer Goodbye\\", which was initially written for Brian Lukow's fiance, then was changed into its modern incarnation months later. Their eponymous debut album was released in 2000 It was certified Gold in the US by the RIAA peaking No. 1 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart and at No. 37 on the Billboard 200. The songs, \\"It Happens Every Time\\" and \\"I Say Yeah\\" were frequently played on Radio Disney. The boys soon made appearances on various talk shows and television events. In late 2000, Dream Street made an appearance on a show that fellow member McCartney had a recurring role on, ABC's All My Children. The final Dream Street release was the soundtrack album to the released 2002 film The Biggest Fan, which starred Trousdale. ==Breakup and Reunion== In mid-2002, parents of the band members filed a lawsuit against Baldonieri and Lukow, alleging that the underage band members were \\"exposed to booze, women, and pornography\\". In August 2002 the producers were ruled against, releasing the five band members from their contracts. On June 11, 2020, McCartney, Galasso, Ballinger, and Raposo reunited for a virtual performance of \\"It Happens Every Time\\" to pay tribute to Trousdale following his death on June 2, 2020 after contracting COVID-19. ==Post-break-up careers== McCartney at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival premiere of Beware the Gonzo. * McCartney has enjoyed a successful solo career releasing four albums, and spawning three top ten singles. He's appeared on many television shows, including Disney's Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, as well as a 2008 episode of Law & Order: SVU. Jesse had a starring role on The WB's show Summerland, alongside future stars like Zac Efron, and was set to star in Locke and Key; however, the pilot was not picked up for an entire season. In 2008, Jesse was cast as the lead role in the independent film Keith. Jesse had a recurring role in Season 4 of the ABC Family series, Greek, and appeared as a lead in the 2012 movie Chernobyl Diaries, which was a moderate box office success. In June 2011, Jesse released a fragrance for women, \\"Wanted\\". Jesse has also forayed into voice acting, performing as Dick Grayson/Robin on the show Young Justice, Terence in the Tinker Bell films, Theodore in the Alvin and the Chipmunks films, and voicing Roxas and Ventus in the popular (English versions) of Kingdom Hearts series of video games. He starred on the hit series Young & Hungry as Cooper. In 2020, he was named the runner-up on the third season of The Masked Singer as the \\"Turtle\\". Raposo in Concert * Raposo has been continuing his music career, performing in bands called \\"Raposo\\" and \\"Dead Celebrities\\". He is also a real estate investor and developer. Raposo is currently playing solo, mostly on the east coast but has toured as far as Japan and Costa Rica. Following the Dream Street breakup, Raposo released a self-titled album in 2003 that charted on the Billboard Independent Albums Chart at No. 40 during its opening week. His second solo album, LossLoveLife was fully funded by his fans through Kickstarter and released in May 2012. Fans also funded Greg's first official music video for the first single off his new album, That Day, which he wrote for a fan with cancer. Raposo has produced for many young artists and most recently signed a licensing deal for his original material. * Galasso is also a solo singer. In 2009, Frankie auditioned to be on Glee, but did not make it. So far, Frankie has released one album to Amazon on iTunes, containing three songs. Following the breakup of the band, Frankie was in a 2003 movie called \\"A Tale of Two Pizzas\\". Frankie has also performed with the First National Tour of Jersey Boys. * Trousdale since the breakup had started on his solo career, even being in a second movie with Kaila Amariah called \\"Seducing Spirits\\". He took a short break from the limelight to be with his family. Towards the end of 2010, Chris popped up again to the public eye, when he appeared on Disney's Shake It Up as a parody of Justin Bieber on an episode called \\"Age It Up\\". Trousdale also appeared on the show Days of Our Lives, and auditioned for The Voice in 2012, but did not make it past the blind auditions. He died on June 2, 2020, following complications of the Coronavirus. Following Chris Trousdale's death his former bandmates had a mini reunion on what would have been his 35th birthday to perform their hit song \\"It Happens Every Time\\".Dream Street Reunites to Perform Song in Memory of Late Bandmate Chris Trousdale's Birthday * Ballinger did not go solo, he went on to be the lead singer for a band called The Juice, which broke up in 2008.

Originally named Texas Agricultural Extension Service, then later Texas Cooperative Extension, the name Texas AgriLife Extension Service was adopted on January 1, 2008. A&M; was added to the agency name on September 1, 2012 as a result of a Texas A&M; University System change to strengthen the association with Texas A&M.; The primary mission of AgriLife Extension is to provide educational outreach programs and services to the citizens of Texas. In conjunction with Texas AgriLife Research, the Extension faculty members conduct research and bring practical applications of those research findings to the people of Texas. ==Programs== Texas A&M; AgriLife Extension, in partnership with federal, state, and local governments, as well as others, serves the state of Texas through relevant, research-backed, community-based education. The mission of AgriLife Extension is to improve the lives of people, businesses and communities across Texas and beyond. The educational programs, activities, and resources of AgriLife Extension are generally organized under one of four broad program areas: *Agriculture and Natural Resources *Family and Consumer Sciences *4-H and Youth Development *Community Economic Development ==History== The early history of Texas A&M; AgriLife Extension Service is a blending of the history of the Cooperative extension service itself, Texas A&M; University and Prairie View A&M; University. The first step towards the creation of Cooperative Extension occurred in 1862 with the passing of the Morrill Land-Grant College Act. This law granted every state of public land for each of its House and Senate members, with the land being used to endow land-grant colleges for the teaching of agriculture and other practical arts. This led to the Texas Legislature founding the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (referred to as Texas A.M.C. for short in 1871, which was funded through the Morill Act and was Texas' first public institution of higher education. In compliance with the Morrill Act, in 1876 the Fifteenth Texas Legislature endowed the Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Benefit of Colored Youth (the future Prairie View A&M; University) as part of Texas A.M.C. In 1890, an amendment to the Morrill Act was passed to deal with the issue of providing steading funding to the land- grant colleges and to prohibit racial discrimination at any of the funded colleges. During its early years, despite its name Texas A.M.C. didn't teach any agricultural classes at all, leading to protests by farmer groups and much of college's leadership being replaced. Despite the new curriculum in agriculture and engineering, the college's enrollment continued to drop. The land-grant colleges around the country were struggling. With the ample land available in the West, most farmers had little incentive to adopt intensive farming methods and other advanced agricultural technologies. As with Texas A.M.C., the agricultural colleges were being criticized for not actually giving their students the training that would enable them to return to their family farms, and instead the graduates were leaving the farm life all together. For most observers, however, the biggest issue was that there was no solid agricultural research on which to base the practical teaching being attempted, so to fill this need Congress passed the Hatch Experiment Station Act of 1887, which provided funding for agricultural experiment stations in each state. This led to the founding of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in 1887 at Texas A.M.C. This new organization was given the task of conducting research in all aspects of crop and livestock operations. The founding of the Experiment Stations were considered a big step towards improving farming, however the Experiment Station personnel soon realized that without a way to effectively communicate their findings to farmers, all their effort was for not. While they made attempts at out-reach, the results were limited and required diverting critical funds away from their core mission: research. In 1903, Seaman Asahel Knapp (1831-1911), a US Department of Agriculture agent, created two demonstration farms - the Walter C. Porter Demonstration Farm near Terrell, and the Greenville Demonstration Farm near Greenville - where he could show other farmers how new farming techniques and production methods could benefit them. In 1906, William C. Crider was appointed by Knapp as the first county agricultural agent in Texas (Smith County), and the first in the nation to serve a single county. Tom M. Marks organized the first Boys' Corn Club in Texas in Jack County, and this forerunner of Four-H Club activities became important. Girls' clubs, home demonstration, farmers' institutes, and the establishment of a Department of Extension at Texas A&M; followed. The Texas legislature passed laws authorizing the county commissioners' court to provide and fund offices and conduct extension work in agriculture and home economics with Texas A&M.; On January 16, 1912, in Milam County, Mrs. Edna W. Trigg became the first woman agent in the state. By 1913 demonstrations, shows, and fairs were common throughout Texas. As word of the work of Knapp and the others spread, Congress took notice. Impressed by the success, Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act on May 8, 1914, which gave states the ability to establish official extension agencies affiliated with their land-grant universities to help \\"extend\\" the research findings of the colleges and Experiment Stations in practical ways that helped the citizens in every county. Texas quickly took advantage of this new act, forming the Texas Agricultural Extension Service in June of the same year and associating it with Texas A.M.C. The Texas legislature formally accepted the provisions of the Smith-Lever Act on January 29, 1915. In 1948, Texas A&M; formed the Texas A&M; University System, incorporating the Extension agency and six related agencies which are still part of the system today. In 2001, Texas Agricultural Extension Service changed its name to Texas Cooperative Extension, feeling the new name would better reflect its mission and its focus on serving all Texans. In 2007, Dr. Elsa Murano, who was overseeing Texas A&M; Agriculture as a whole, implemented another name change. After paying for a consultation from an outside firm, she also undertook to change the name of Texas A&M; Agriculture, and Texas Agricultural Experiment Station. On January 1, 2008, Extension's name officially changed to Texas AgriLife Extension Service. The agency felt that \\"AgriLife\\" better reflected the agency's foundational message that \\"agriculture is life.\\" On September 1, 2012, following the recommendation of Texas A&M; University System Chancellor John Sharp, the agencies of the Texas A&M; University System formally added \\"A&M;\\" into their names. Texas AgriLife Extension Service became Texas A&M; AgriLife Extension Service on this date. The purpose of this effort was to create a unified branding which better associates the A&M; System entities with Texas A&M; University. ==Organizational model== Texas A&M; AgriLife Extension is the largest extension service in the US and a leading employer in the Brazos County. Headquartered at the Texas A&M; University campus in College Station, AgriLife Extension develops much of its own curriculum, which it then teaches across the state through its network of over 600 county extension agents located in 250 of the 254 Texan counties and its nearly 350 extension specialists. Together, these agents and specialists, aided by more than 150,000 volunteers, education the public through classes, publications, web sites, television series, and other outlets in the areas of agriculture, family and consumer sciences, human nutrition and health, environmental and natural resources, community development, and 4-H and youth development. Through its various programs, AgriLife Extension reaches over fifteen million Texans annually, and the Texas 4-H program is the largest in the nation and makes up one-sixth of the national enrollment numbers. ==See also== *Texas A&M; University *Texas A&M; University System *Cooperative extension service *Agricultural extension ==ReferencesCategory:Organizations established in 1914 AgriLife Extension Service, Texas Category:Texas A&M; University System Category:1915 establishments in Texas ","title":"Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service"},{"id":"1445411","text":"\\"My, Pierwsza Brygada\\" (We Are the First Brigade), also known as Marsz Pierwszej Brygady (The March of the First Brigade) and Legiony to ≈ºo≈Çnierska nuta (The Legions Are a Soldier's Song), is one of the best-known patriotic marches of the Polish Legions formed during World War I by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Extolling the First Brigade of the Polish Legions, the song is considered an important emblem of the early-20th-century struggle for Polish independence. It is also now an official anthem of the Polish Army. The song melody was borrowed from Kielce March #10 in the songbook of the Kielce Fire Department band. It had probably been composed by Captain Andrzej Brzuchal-Sikorski, the band's conductor from 1905, and later bandmaster of the First Brigade of the Polish Legions. It was he who arranged and first conducted the song.Leszek Marciniec, Vademecum Kuracjusza 21 Wojskowego Szpitala Uzdrowiskowo- Rehabilitacyjnego w Busku-Zdroju: przewodnik po Busku-Zdroju, 2005, p. 47. The earliest recognized version of the song appeared in 1917, the words being composed spontaneously during the war by several individuals including Colonel Andrzej Ha≈Çaci≈Ñski and Legions officer Tadeusz Biernacki. Between 1926 and 1927, many of Pi≈Çsudski's supporters viewed the song as the national anthem of Poland.

The neighbourhood of Westminster is immediately north of Highway 401, and east of Wellington Road. The majority of its residents live in low- density, single detached dwellings. The remaining residents live in row house dwellings. As of 2011, the area is home to 11,385 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $73,207, an average dwelling value of $216,133 and a home ownership rate of 88%. Historically, Westminster first referred to a rural township, after which the neighbourhood was named. ==History== ===Township=== Westminster Township was bounded on the north by the Thames River, which divides it from London Township; on the south by Elgin County, east by North Dorchester Township, and west by Delaware. It was one of the largest townships in Middlesex County. The first record of the Westminster Council is dated 4 March 1817. As the city of London (incorporated as a city in 1855) grew, areas on the south side of the Thames River were developed, being adjacent to the city core, and they were later annexed to the city, ceasing to be part of Westminster Township. In the 1940s and 1950s, the developed area was expanding to the present site of the Westminster neighbourhood, and became part of the city with the 1961 annexation. The neighbourhood became known as Westminster, and was substantially developed in the 1970s. The non-annexed portions of Westminster Township continued to be largely rural, with the most substantial population centre being the police village of Lambeth in the west. ===Town=== The Town of Westminster was a municipality established in 1988 from the former Westminster Township. It was created as an attempt to prevent annexation with nearby London. The town was made up of numerous population centres including Lambeth and Glanworth. Also, the municipality included the various commercial shopping malls along Wellington Road at Highway 401. However, the Town of Westminster's life was short-lived. In the early 1990s, the City of London proposed a massive land annexation, which included the entire Westminster municipality. In 1992, after months of political debates involving the Ontario government, the City of London, and local residents, the proposed annexation was allowed to proceed. On January 1, 1993, the Town of Westminster ceased to exist and most of it became part of the City of London. The rest was added to adjacent townships (Delaware Township to the west, South Dorchester Township to the east). The annexed areas formed Ward 8 on London City Council. Ben Veel, the final mayor of Westminster, was appointed as councillor until a by-election in March 1993. Veel was elected and served until the next municipal election in 1994. When the term expired, Ward 8 was eliminated and redistributed among the other seven wards. Most of the former town is excluded from London's current urban development area, but some portions annexed to the city are eligible for urban development and have been built on. The annexation solved infrstructure problems faced by the township subdivision of South Winds, now becoming able to be connected to city utilities without an interjurisdictional conundrum. ==Government and politics== Westminster exists within the federal electoral district of London-Fanshawe and Elgin‚ÄîMiddlesex‚ÄîLondon. The area north of Highway 401 is currently represented by Irene Mathyssen of the New Democratic Party, first elected in 2006 and re-elected in 2008, 2011 and 2015. The area south of Highway 401 is currently represented by Karen Vecchio of the Conservative Party of Canada, first elected in 2015. Provincially, the area is within the constituency of London-Fanshawe. It is currently represented by Teresa Armstrong of the New Democratic Party, first elected in 2011 and re- elected in 2014. Westminster is also within the constituency of Elgin‚ÄîMiddlesex‚ÄîLondon. It is currently represented by Jeff Yurek of the Progressive Conservative Party, first elected in 2003 and re-elected in 2011 and 2014. In London's non-partisan municipal politics, the former town of Westminster is split among wards 9, 12 and 14, with a very narrow sliver in Ward 10. The Westminster neighbourhood is entirely within Ward 14. It is currently represented by Councillor Jared Zaifman, first elected in 2014. ==See also== *List of townships in Ontario ==References== Category:Neighbourhoods in London, Ontario Category:Former municipalities in Ontario Category:1988 establishments in Ontario Category:1993 disestablishments in Ontario Category:Populated places disestablished in 1993 ","title":"Westminster, Middlesex County, Ontario"},{"id":"1445434","text":"Texas A&M; Engineering Extension Service (TEEX, pronounced \\"teeks\\") is a state extension agency that offers training programs and technical assistance to public safety workers, both in Texas and around the world. Established in 1940 as the Industrial Extension Service, the agency took on its current name when it joined The Texas A&M; University System in 1948. The agency sponsors the state's primary urban search and rescue force, Urban Search and Rescue Texas Task Force 1, and operates the Brayton Fire Training Field. Brayton is the largest firefighting training facility in the United States that also contains a mock city for conducting training operations for emergency responders. ==History== The first step toward the formation of the Texas A&M; Engineering Extension Service was the passing of the Morrill Land-Grant College Act in 1862, which led to the founding of several land-grant colleges, including the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in 1871, which later became known as Texas A&M; University. Despite its name, the college taught no agricultural classes, leading to protests by farmer groups and to much of the college's leadership being replaced. Other land-grant colleges around the country were also struggling, as farmers felt they had little incentive to adopt intensive farming methods and other advanced agricultural technologies. In response to the growing criticisms and lack of agricultural research being conducted, Congress passed the Hatch Experiment Station Act of 1887, which provided funding for agricultural experiment stations in each state. This led to the founding of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in 1887, tasked with conducting research in all aspects of crop and livestock operations. While considered a big step toward improving farming, the stations struggled to effectively communicate their findings to farmers. In 1903, Seaman Asahel Knapp (1831‚Äì1911), a US Department of Agriculture agent, created a demonstration farm, where he could show other farmers how new farming techniques and production methods could benefit them. His success got Congress' notice and led to the passing of the Smith-Lever Act on May 8, 1914, which gave states the ability to establish official extension agencies affiliated with their land-grant universities. The Act helped to \\"extend\\" the research findings of the colleges and Experiment Stations in practical ways that helped the citizens in every county. Texas quickly took advantage of this new act and formed the Texas Agricultural Extension Service in the same year, associating it with the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas (Texas AMC). Three years later, Congress passed the Smith-Hughes Act for establishing public vocational technical training. Texas AMC began offering a limited industrial teacher training service. In 1919, the school began offering the Trade and Industrial Teacher Training Service. Supervised by the school's Agricultural Education department, the program was designed to train industry professionals to teach trade and industrial courses at Texas public schools. The School of Vocational Training took over the program in 1924, with the offerings split into three departments: Rural Education, Agricultural Education, and Industrial Education. The Industrial Education department offered training conferences for oil field foremen, covering topics related to job planning and work supervision. The legislature and the State Firemen's and Fire Marshals' Association established a firefighter training school at the school in 1929. With the closing of the Vocational Training school in 1935, the Industrial Education department moved to the Engineering school. The Industrial Extension Service was founded in August 1940 and began offering training programs to water and sewage plant operators, custodial workers, police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and automobile mechanics. The firefighter school was merged into the agency in 1947. In July 1948, Texas A.& M. College formed The Texas A&M; University System, incorporating seven related agencies, including the Industrial Extension Service which was renamed to the Texas Engineering Extension Service. The agency was charged with \\"providing occupational and technical training services on an extension basis to the citizens of Texas\\". ==Organization model== Texas A&M; Engineering Extension Service operates as part of The Texas A&M; University System and is overseen by the university's board of regents. The agency is composed of six divisions: Emergency Services Training Institute (ESTI), Infrastructure Training & Safety Institute (ITSI), National Emergency Response & Rescue Training Center (NERRTC), OSHA Training Institute Southwest Education Center, Law Enforcement & Security Training (LAW), and Knowledge Engineering (KE). It maintains an office in Galveston, and has training facilities in Abilene, Arlington, Corpus Christi, Houston, and San Antonio. In 1993, the agency had an annual operating budget of $38 million and conducted some 5,700 training classes attended by 120,000 students. By 2013, its budget had grown to $76.4 million, and had reached some 183,750 students through over 2.84 million contact hours. The agency's current director is Gary F. Sera, who became the director in December 2007 after serving as the agency's interim director for nine months. Serving under the director are the deputy director, two associate agency directors, and six division heads. ==Brayton Fire Training Field== Brayton Fire Training Field is a live-fueled firefighter training facility located adjacent to Easterwood Airport. The largest in the United States, the facility has 132 training stations and 22 fueled live-fire props, including full-scale buildings, tanks, and a ship, that enable trainees to experience lifelike simulations. More than 4,000 firefighters and emergency workers visit the facility in the summer for its annual Texas Fire Training Schools. Adjacent to Brayton's southern border is \\"Disaster City\\"¬Æ, a mock city that serves as a training facility for emergency responders. Costing $7.7 million to construct, the city was built in 1998 in direct response to the Oklahoma City Bombing which then director G. Kemble Bennett felt highlighted the need for \\"a world-class facility to train responders in near-lifelike conditions.\\" The city acts as the main training location for Texas Task Force 1, and features collapsible structures that are designed to simulate various kinds of disasters and wreckage. It also provides complex interactive disaster scenarios for state and federal urban search and rescue teams, U.S. military CERFP and WMD-Civil Support Team teams, Department of Health and Human Services Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) and NVRT teams, and other specialized international search and rescue teams. ==References* The Disneyland of Disaster - slideshow by Der Spiegel Category:Texas A&M; University System Category:Organizations established in 1919 Engineering Extension Service, Texas Category:1919 establishments in Texas Category:Firefighting academies ","title":"Texas A&amp;M Engineering Extension Service"},{"id":"1445438","text":"New Addington is a town in South London, England, within the London Borough of Croydon and the historic county of Surrey. It is located 5 miles south east of Croydon, south of Addington Village and north of Biggin Hill. ==History== Until the 1930s, the area now known as New Addington was farmland and woodland in the southeast of the ancient parish of Addington. The farms were called Castle Hill, Addington Lodge and Fisher's Farms. At the time, central Croydon and London more generally had overcrowded slums causing concern to the authorities. In 1935, the First National Housing Trust purchased 569 acres (2.3 km¬≤) of Fisher's Farm with the intention of erecting a 'Garden Village', with 4,400 houses, shops, two churches, cinema, and village green. The Chairman of the Trust was Charles Boot, hence the earliest part of New Addington is sometimes called The Boot's Estate. By 1939, when the outbreak of World War II suspended construction, 1,023 houses and 23 shops had been built. The new estate was popular, but the provision of amenities had not kept pace with the house building. Only one of the proposed schools and few of the shops were in operation. For employment, decent shopping and entertainment, the residents had to travel off the estate. This heralded a long history of isolation for the estate, then nicknamed Little Siberia, because it is much colder than the rest of Croydon. The isolation was partly remedied 60 years later with the arrival of Tramlink route 3, mentioned below. Tramlink runs alongside Lodge Lane, the main (northern) road access. There is only one other point of access by road, where King Henry's Drive connects with minor roads to the south. After the war, there were concerns about the amount of green space being used for building around London and much of the countryside around the developing estate was designated as Green Belt land. The County Borough of Croydon bought the unused First National Housing Trust land and a further 400 acres (1.6 km¬≤) to add to it, for extensive further development. Many dozens of single-storey, detached, prefabricated houses (commonly known as \\"prefabs\\" as photographed in \\"A 1950s metal UK prefab at the Rural Life Centre, Tilford, Surrey.\\") were built in the Castle Hill area of the estate and these were inhabited until the 1960s when they were demolished and replaced with brick- built two-storey homes. At the same time as the smaller prefabs were built, larger two-storey semi-detached houses were also built. These houses, which had metal upper skins, still survive around the King Henry's Drive area near Wolsey School. This was more development than had originally been envisaged but it brought about the structure of the estate as seen today. Many more houses, blocks of flats, churches, factories and Central Parade with its shops, were built. The London Borough of Croydon obtained permission for a further 1,412 houses, which were completed in 1968. This area, at the Croydon end, is known as the Fieldway Estate and has developed its own identity to an extent. The total population counted by the 2011 Census was 22,280, of which 10,801 were in New Addington ward, with 11,479 in Fieldway ward. ==Reputation== Map of New Addington, showing its distance from other Croydon settlements The distance from Croydon and other centres, with patchy bus services being the only main transport links for many years, prevented New Addington residents from being able to access a full range of employment and educational facilities or indeed shops. A significant improvement was the arrival of Tramlink (route 3) in 2000, providing a connection with Croydon and Wimbledon in a little over 30 minutes, and from there connections to Central London. This provided the opportunity of a greater choice of schools and jobs. Several 'feeder' 'bus routes were also introduced to connect with Tramlink, along with general enhancement to bus services in the area. The area was declared one of the first Education Action Zones by the Labour government, with extra investment and opportunities for partnership for schools. The London Borough of Croydon increased its investment in the remaining housing stock and in the leisure and youth facilities. It also organised a neighbourhood partnership for the estate which local people lead to hold public institutions to account. New Addington has however continued to suffer from various reports of violence and public upset for several years, reflecting upon anti-social behaviour and gang violence involving youths on the estate from the 1970s to the present, as well as the perceived poor standard of schools, low educational and health standards, and a reported high number of teenage mothers, particularly in Fieldway. In a Croydon Advertiser survey in 2013, New Addington, in comparison with other areas, was said to be the worst in Croydon to live, based on life expectancy, incapacity benefit claimants rates and income support, unemployment, crime, school exam passes, public transport accessibility and access to open space and nature. The area was affected during the 2011 England Riots. A supermarket was destroyed by firebombs and stolen property was found in the area. An inquiry supported the provision of a local police station.CROYDON RIOTS: New Addington community 'lost faith' in police  Croydon Advertiser A councillor praised local recovery from the riots, claiming the area was now a stronger community than before and rates of anti-social behaviour were beginning to decline. The Fieldway estate came under criticism in 2011, following local resident Emma West being arrested and charged with a racially aggravated public order offence, weeks after a video was uploaded to YouTube of her racially abusing passengers on the Croydon Tramlink, attracting 11 million viewers by 2012. Her detainment on remand at HMP Bronzefield attracted a protest from the Britain First movement. On 1 July 2013 she was sentenced to 24 months' community service and ordered to be put under a supervision order, as well as receive mental health treatment.Judge orders Croydon tram race rant mum Emma West to 'keep the peace' on public transport  Croydon Advertiser The estate was also the scene of the disappearance and death of 12 year-old Tia Sharp in 2012. Residents of New Addington refuted comments from journalists who they felt inaccurately cited her death as an example in reflecting the area's issues. In 2013, the area was featured three times in the same episode of Crimewatch UK, predominantly focusing on the area's gang culture.Councillor hopes BBC Crimewatch appeal will help catch Gary Hayward's attackers  Croydon Advertiser ==Demography== The 2011 census showed that in the New Addington ward, White British was the largest ethnic group, encompassing 73% of the population. The second largest ethnic was Black African, at 9%. The most common household tenure were those rented from council (31% of households), followed by 29% of homes owned by a mortgage or loan. 7% of the economically active population were unemployed. The median age of the population is 34. 0.3% of the population (as well as Fieldway ward) commuted to work by bicycle, the second lowest in Greater London and only higher than Kenton East in Harrow.https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas ==Politics== Politically, New Addington has traditionally been a Labour stronghold, providing the only five Labour councillors out of 70 in the London Borough of Croydon between 1982 and 1986. Four of the last six leaders of the Labour Party on Croydon Council have been councillors representing the estate, including Geraint Davies, the area's former Member of Parliament, and Val Shawcross, now a London Assembly member. In 2006 the two ward had two Labour councillors each, both wards seeing strong challenges from the BNP. In the 2010 local elections, New Addington ward elected its first Conservative Councillor since 1968. Labour won all seats on the estate at the 2014 elections and voted for Sadiq Khan in the 2016 Mayoral Election and heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU Referendum. In the snap 2017 General Election, Gavin Barwell was unseated as the Conservative MP and replaced with Labour's Sarah Jones. In 2018, following a boundary review, New Addington was split into two wards: North and South. The Conservatives missed out on winning a seat in New Addington South by 180 votes, with Labour once again held all five seats. ==Facilities== St Edward the Confessor's Church, New Addington Church of the Good Shepherd, New Addington The Anglican parish church of New Addington is St Edward's Church at the end of Central Parade, built in 1957. Fieldway, however, is part of Addington parish, under the 11th century St Mary the Blessed Virgin Church in Addington village. There are also a Baptist church, the Good Shepherd Roman Catholic Church, the Salvation Army and several other smaller places of worship. Although most of the rest of Croydon has the London telephone dialling code '020', New Addington has the Orpington code for BT customers of '01689'. In recent years, cable telephone providers have entered the estate, using 020 for completely new customers, but existing BT customers transferring over to cable can retain the 01689 number if they so wish. New Addington is in the CR0 postal district, the largest (by population) in the country. Since the beginning of 2006, Croydon Council have started a consultation with the local community with a view to regenerating the Central Parade shopping district and bringing in a partner to develop new housing and a supermarket retail outlet. ==Transport== ===Rail=== The nearest National Rail stations to New Addington are Hayes, located 3.6 miles away and East Croydon, located 5 miles away. ===Trams=== The area is served by three Tramlink stops (Fieldway, King Henry's Drive and New Addington, linking the area with West Croydon and Wimbledon. ===Buses=== New Addington is served by London Buses routes 64 (24 hours), 130, 314, 464 & 664\\\\. These connect it with areas including Biggin Hill, Bromley, Croydon, Eltham, Hayes, South Norwood & Thornton Heath. ==Gallery== New in service at New Addington - geograph.org.uk - 1607118.jpgBus no.

As of 2020, it comprises 329 seats and meets in Baghdad inside the Green Zone. ==History== ===The monarchy=== An elected Iraqi parliament first formed following the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in 1925. The 1925 constitution called for a bicameral parliament whose lower house, the Chamber of Deputies of Iraq or Council of Representatives (Majlis an-Nuwwab) would be elected based on universal manhood suffrage. The upper house, the Senate of Iraq (Majlis al-A\`yan) was appointed by the king. Sixteen elections took place between 1925 and the coup of 1958. On January 17, 1953 elections for the Chamber of Deputies (also known as the National Assembly) took place. Following controversy over the implementation of the so-called Baghdad Pact, Prime Minister Nuri Pasha as-Said called for elections the following year, in early 1954. As-Said dissolved the assembly shortly thereafter and began to rule by decree, but opposition forced him to hold a third election within three years. The second 1954 election was very corrupt, with as-Said's political enemies banned from running, and widespread voter coercion. The assembly was suspended yet again, and in 1958 a military coup deposed as-Said and the monarchy, and abolished the parliament. ===Under Saddam Hussein=== The 1970 constitution created a republic with an elected National Assembly (al-Majlis al-Watani). However, elections for the Assembly did not take place until June 1980, under Iraq's new military president, Saddam Hussein. Several more elections took place between 1989 and 2003. Elections for its members were not considered free and fair by the international community. Only members of Hussein's own Baath Party were ever elected. ===The transitional period=== In 2003, Saddam Hussein was forcibly removed from power by the United States of America, the United Kingdom and their allies during the Iraq War. In March 2004 a governing council set up by the Coalition Provisional Authority signed an interim constitution which called for the election of a transitional National Assembly no later than the end of January 2005. This Assembly would draft a permanent constitution which would then be submitted to approval by the Iraqi people in a general referendum. Elections for this transitional National Assembly (al-Jam\`iyya al- Wataniyya) took place on January 30, 2005. The United Iraqi Alliance Party won the majority of seats with 48% of the popular vote resulting in 140 seats. Eighty-five members of the assembly were women. Talks between the UIA and other parties to form a coalition government began soon after the election. The assembly had its first meeting on March 16, 2005. After weeks of negotiations between the dominant political parties, on April 4, 2005, Sunni Arab Hajim al-Hassani was chosen as speaker; Shiite Hussain Shahristani and Kurd Aref Taifour were elected as his top deputies. The Assembly elected Jalal Talabani to head the Presidency Council on April 6, and approved the selection of Ibrahim al-Jaafari and his cabinet on April 28. ===The Constitution of 2005=== Under the permanent constitution approved on October 15, 2005, legislative authority is vested in two bodies, the Council of Representatives and the Council of Union. The Council of Representatives consists of 325 members elected for four years, with two sessions in each annual term. The Council passes federal laws, oversees the executive, ratifies treaties, and approves nominations of specified officials. It elects the president of the republic, who selects a prime minister from the majority coalition in the Council. (During an initial period, a three-member Presidential Council elected by the Council of Representatives will carry out the duties of the president of the republic.) Elections for the Council of Representatives were held on December 15, 2005. The Council first met on March 16, 2006, exactly one year after the first meeting of the transitional assembly. The Council of Representatives of Iraq has the same name in Arabic (ŸÖÿ¨ŸÑÿ≥ ÿßŸÑŸÜŸàÿßÿ®, Majlis an- Nuwwab) as the lower legislative houses of Bahrain, Morocco, Jordan, and Yemen, and as the unicameral legislatures of Lebanon and Tunisia. However, a number of different English terms are used to refer to these bodies. The Council of Union, or Federation Council (Majlis al-Ittihad), will consist of representatives from Iraq's regions and governorates. Its precise composition and responsibilities are not defined in the constitution and will be determined by the Council of Representatives. ===2007 Iraqi Parliament bombing=== On, April 12, 2007, Mohammed Awad, a political party member of the Iraqi National Dialogue Council, was killed at the convention centre canteen of the parliament building, and 22 were wounded, in the 2007 Iraqi Parliament Bombing. ===2007 issues=== A group of Sunni lawmakers boycotted parliament in a June 2007 protest of the removal of the speaker, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, after a series of controversial actions. They returned in July after the speaker was re-instated with the understanding that he would quietly resign after a few sessions. A group of Shiite members also returned in July after a boycott which gained them an investigation into the bombing of a Shiite mosque, along with reconstruction and improved security. The parliament was under pressure from the United States to pass legislation dealing with members of the Baath party, distribution of oil revenues, regional autonomy, and constitutional reform, by September 2007. === 2009 electoral reform === The Iraqi cabinet approved a draft elections law in September 2009. However, it took two months and ten delays for the law to pass in the Council of Representatives. The main areas of dispute concerned the \\"open list\\" electoral system and the voters roll in Kirkuk Governorate, which Arab and Turkmen parties alleged had been manipulated by the Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq. UNAMI advised the electoral system was changed to allow people to vote for individuals as well as party lists under the open list form of proportional representation. The last national elections had used a closed list system, but the Iraqi governorate elections of 2009 had used open lists. In the end, all parties except for the Kurdistani Alliance agreed to support open lists which was adopted. The law increased the size of the Council from 275 to 325 members‚Äîequal to one seat per 100,000 citizens, as specified in the Constitution of Iraq. ===2016 protests=== The parliament was stormed by protesters in April 2016; the protestors also attacked buildings within the parliamentary complex. === 2018 electoral reform === The Council of Representatives voted on 11 February 2018, to add an extra seat for minorities, in the Wasit Governorate for Feyli Kurds, making the total number of parliamentarians equal to 329 prior to the 2018 parliamentary elections. === 2019 electoral reform === As a result of the ongoing 2019 Iraqi protests, the Council of Representatives approved a new law on 24 December 2019 which aims to make it easier for independent politicians to win a seat in the Council of Representatives. The new law will see each of Iraq's governorates split into several electoral districts, with one legislator being elected per 100,000 people, thus replacing its proportional representation system for a district-based system. The new law will also prevent parties from running on unified lists. ==See also== * Politics of Iraq * List of legislatures by country ==Footnotes== ==References== * CIA Fact Book ‚Äì Iraq * The Iraqi Transitional Government * Katzman, Kenneth. ‚ÄúIraq: Elections, Government, and Consistution.‚Äù CRS Report for Congress: January 15, 2006. == External links == * Category:Iraqi parliaments Iraq Category:2005 establishments in Iraq ","title":"Council of Representatives of Iraq"},{"id":"1445451","text":"Chaperonins are proteins that provide favourable conditions for the correct folding of other proteins, thus preventing aggregation. They prevent the misfolding of proteins, which prevents diseases such as Mad Cow Disease. Newly made proteins usually must fold from a linear chain of amino acids into a three-dimensional tertiary structure. Chaperonins belong to a large class of molecules that assist protein folding, called molecular chaperones.Howard Hughes Investigators: Arthur L. Horwich, M.D. The energy to fold proteins is supplied by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Chaperonin proteins may also tag misfolded proteins to be degraded. ==Structure== The structure of these chaperonins resemble two donuts stacked on top of one another to create a barrel. Each ring is composed of either 7, 8 or 9 subunits depending on the organism in which the chaperonin is found. == Categories of chaperonins == ===Group I=== Group I chaperonins are found in bacteria as well as organelles of endosymbiotic origin: chloroplasts and mitochondria. The GroEL/GroES complex in E. coli is a Group I chaperonin and the best characterized large (~ 1 MDa) chaperonin complex. * GroEL is a double-ring 14mer with a greasy hydrophobic patch at its opening and can accommodate the native folding of substrates 15-60 kDa in size. * GroES is a single-ring heptamer that binds to GroEL in the presence of ATP or transition state analogues of ATP hydrolysis, such as ADP-AlF3. It's like a cover that covers GroEL (box/bottle). GroEL/GroES may not be able to undo protein aggregates, but kinetically it competes in the pathway of misfolding and aggregation, thereby preventing aggregate formation. ===Group II=== Thermosome chaperonin II, hetero16mer, Sulfolobus solfataricus. Group II chaperonins, found in the eukaryotic cytosol and in archaea, are more poorly characterized. TRiC, the eukaryotic chaperonin, is composed of two rings of eight different though related subunits, each thought to be represented once per eight-membered ring. TRiC was originally thought to fold only the cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin but is now known to fold dozens of substrates. Mm cpn (Methanococcus maripaludis chaperonin), found in the archaea Methanococcus maripaludis, is composed of sixteen identical subunits (eight per ring). It has been shown to fold the mitochondrial protein rhodanese; however, no natural substrates have yet been identified. Group II chaperonins are not thought to utilize a GroES- type cofactor to fold their substrates. They instead contain a \\"built-in\\" lid that closes in an ATP-dependent manner to encapsulate its substrates, a process that is required for optimal protein folding activity. == Mechanism of action == Chaperonins undergo large conformational changes during a folding reaction as a function of the enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP as well as binding of substrate proteins and cochaperonins, such as GroES. These conformational changes allow the chaperonin to bind an unfolded or misfolded protein, encapsulate that protein within one of the cavities formed by the two rings, and release the protein back into solution. Upon release, the substrate protein will either be folded or will require further rounds of folding, in which case it can again be bound by a chaperonin. The exact mechanism by which chaperonins facilitate folding of substrate proteins is unknown. According to recent analyses by different experimental techniques, GroEL-bound substrate proteins populate an ensemble of compact and locally expanded states that lack stable tertiary interactions. A number of models of chaperonin action have been proposed, which generally focus on two (not mutually exclusive) roles of chaperonin interior: passive and active. Passive models treat the chaperonin cage as an inert form, exerting influence by reducing the conformational space accessible to a protein substrate or preventing intermolecular interactions e.g. by aggregation prevention. The active chaperonin role is in turn involved with specific chaperonin‚Äìsubstrate interactions that may be coupled to conformational rearrangements of the chaperonin. Probably the most popular model of the chaperonin active role is the iterative annealing mechanism (IAM), which focus on the effect of iterative, and hydrophobic in nature, binding of the protein substrate to the chaperonin. According to computational simulation studies, the IAM leads to more productive folding by unfolding the substrate from misfolded conformations or by prevention from protein misfolding through changing the folding pathway. == Conservation of structural and functional homology == As mentioned, all cells contain chaperonins. * In bacteria, the archetype is the well-characterized chaperonin GroEL from E. coli. * In archaea, the chaperonin is called the thermosome. * In eukarya, the chaperonin is called CCT (also called TRiC). These protein complexes appear to be essential for life in E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes. While there are differences between eukaryotic, bacterial and archaeal chaperonins, the general structure and mechanism are conserved. ===Bacteriophage T4 morphogenesis=== SnustadSnustad DP. Dominance interactions in Escherichia coli cells mixedly infected with bacteriophage T4D wild-type and amber mutants and their possible implications as to type of gene-product function: catalytic vs. stoichiometric. Virology. 1968;35(4):550-563. doi:10.1016/0042-6822(68)90285-7 identified gene product 31 (gp31) of bacteriophage T4 as a protein required for bacteriophage morphogenesis that acts catalytically rather than being incorporated into the bacteriophage structure. The bacterium E. coli is the host for bacteriophage T4. The bacteriophage encoded gp31 protein appears to be functionally homologous to the E. coli cochaperonin protein GroES and able to substitute for it in the assembly of phage T4 virions during infection.Marusich EI, Kurochkina LP, Mesyanzhinov VV. Chaperones in bacteriophage T4 assembly. Biochemistry (Mosc). 1998;63(4):399-406 Like GroES, gp31 forms a stable complex with GroEL chaperonin that is absolutely necessary for the folding and assembly in vivo of the bacteriophage T4 major capsid protein gp23. == See also == * Chaperone * Heat shock protein * Arthur L.

The area, which consists of various geological strata and diverse trap types, was discovered and exploited during the first half of the 20th century. Most of the crude oil found in the onshore mid-continent oil field is considered to be of the mixed base or intermediate type (a mix of paraffin base and asphalt base crude oil types). ==History== The first commercially successful oil well drilled in what was to be called the Mid- continent Oil Field was the Norman No. 1 near Neodesha, Kansas, on November 28, 1892. The successes that followed of the Nellie Johnstone No. 1 at Bartlesville, Oklahoma in 1897, Spindletop at Beaumont, Texas in 1901, and the Ida Glenn No. 1 at Glenn Pool, Oklahoma in 1905, demonstrated the existence of a large oil field in the central and southwestern United States. It became known as the Mid-continent Oil Field. Continued drilling found many other oil fields and pools within the Mid-continent, both large and small. Historically this area has produced more oil than any other area in the United States, and until the discovery of oil in the Middle East, was the largest known oil reserve in the world. The Texas Railroad Commission estimates that the Texas reserves alone were of oil including the little more than 60 billion (10 km¬≥) already produced. Laws in the early days gave the oil flowing from the well- head to the owners of the well, prompting nearby property owners and lease holders to drill as many wells as possible to ensure they received the profits for the oil under their land. This led to rapid depletion of the resources and the immediate fall of oil prices. Also, the resulting influx of thousands of oil field workers led to wild growth of nearby boom towns and the lawlessness that accompanied them. The states eventually succeeded in regulating the industry and passing laws for the equitable distribution of oil royalties. Oil operators, in addition to continued exploration, use a variety of techniques to increase production, including deep wells, injection wells, etc. Natural gas, which in the early days was vented to the atmosphere or burned off, now accounts for a large percentage of the exploration efforts and profitability of the petroleum industry in the Mid-continent. ==Proven oil reserves== * Texas: ‚ÄîRanked 1st in the U.S. * New Mexico: ‚ÄîRanked 5th in the U.S. * Oklahoma: ‚ÄîRanked 6th in the U.S. * Louisiana: ‚ÄîRanked 7th in the U.S. * Kansas: ‚ÄîRanked 12th in the U.S. * Arkansas: ‚ÄîRanked 19th in the U.S. ==Historic oil fields within the Mid-continent Oil Field== Map Caddo oil field, Louisiana *El Dorado, 1915, Kansas, First oil field found using science/geologic mapping.

Although relatively rare, this disorder does occur with higher incidence within founder-effect populations due to lack of genetic variability. Observation of the inheritance pattern has illustrated that the disease is autosomal recessive, meaning that both parents have to carry the gene in order for an individual to be affected by the disorder. Ellis‚Äìvan Creveld syndrome is caused by a mutation in the EVC gene, as well as by a mutation in a nonhomologous gene, EVC2, located close to the EVC gene in a head-to-head configuration. The gene was identified by positional cloning. The EVC gene maps to the chromosome 4 short arm (4p16). The function of a healthy EVC gene is not well understood at this time. === Relation to other rare disorders: genetic ciliopathy === Until recently, the medical literature did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that are now being found to be related. As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying set of medical symptoms that are clinically visible in the disorders. Ellis‚Äìvan Creveld syndrome is one such disease, part of an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell, organelles which are present in many cellular types throughout the human body. The cilia defects adversely affect \\"numerous critical developmental signaling pathways\\" essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases. Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet‚ÄìBiedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alstr√∂m syndrome, Meckel‚ÄìGruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration. Weyers acrofacial dysostosis is due to another mutation in the EVC gene and hence is allelic with Ellis‚Äìvan Creveld syndrome.Shi L, Luo C, Ahmed MK, Attaie AB, Ye X (2015) Novel mutations in EVC cause aberrant splicing in Ellis-van Creveld syndrome. Mol Genet Genomics ==Treatment== There is no causative / curative therapy. Symptomatic medical treatments are focussing on symptoms caused by orthopaedic, dental or cardiac problems. Regarding perioperative / anesthesiological management, recommendations for medical professionals are published at OrphanAnesthesia. ==History== The disorder was described by Richard W. B. Ellis (1902‚Äì1966) of Edinburgh and Simon van Creveld (1895‚Äì1971) of Amsterdam. Each had a patient with this syndrome, as they had discovered when they met in the same train compartment on the way to a pediatrics conference in England in the late 1930s. A third patient had been referred to by L. Emmett Holt, Jr. and Rustin McIntosh in a textbook of pediatrics (Holt and McIntosh, 1933) and was included in full in the paper by Ellis and van Creveld (1940).Ellis, R. W. B.; van Creveld, S.: A syndrome characterized by ectodermal dysplasia, polydactyly, chondro-dysplasia and congenital morbus cordis: report of three cases. Arch. Dis. Child. 15: 65‚Äì84, 1940. McCusick et al. (1964) followed up with a study of its incidence in the Amish population. He observed the largest pedigree so far, in an inbred religious isolate, the Old Order Amish, in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Almost as many persons were known in this one kindred as had been reported in all the medical literature up to that time. ==Nomenclature== 'Six-fingered dwarfism' ('digital integer deficiency') was an alternative designation used for this condition when it was being studied in the Amish and may have served a useful function in defining this then little known condition for the medical profession, as well as the lay public. The term, however, has been found offensive by some because of the reference to the polydactyly, which is seen as a 'freakish' label. For this reason, six-fingered dwarfism has been removed as an alternative name for this entry. This leaves Ellis‚Äìvan Creveld syndrome with its initialism, EVC, as the only satisfactory designation. Chondroectodermal dysplasia and mesoectodermal dysplasia do not well define the entity and are not satisfactory for general usage, either medical or otherwise. ==References== == External links == Category:Autosomal recessive disorders Category:Genodermatoses Category:Syndromes affecting the heart Category:Syndromes affecting teeth Category:Syndromes affecting stature Category:Syndromes with dysmelia Category:Rare genetic syndromes ","title":"Ellis‚Äìvan Creveld syndrome"},{"id":"1445508","text":"TFS may refer to: ==Organisations== * Tasmania Fire Service * Texas Forest Service * Toronto Fire Services * Toronto French School ==Other uses== * Team Foundation Server, a Microsoft product for collaborative software development projects * Tenerife‚ÄìSouth Airport (IATA code) * Tramway Fran√ßais Standard, a type of tram ","title":"TFS"},{"id":"1445509","text":"The Big Come Up is the debut studio album by the American rock duo The Black Keys, released on May 14, 2002 on Alive Records. ==Background and recording== The album was created in Akron, Ohio, also known as the Rubber City.

The song \\"I'll Be Your Man\\" was used as the theme song for the HBO series Hung. \\"I'll Be Your Man\\" also appeared on the FX series Rescue Me. ==Reception== According to Nielsen Soundscan, the album sold around 139,000 copies. The two did not make much money off of the album, so they had trouble paying for a tour. Therefore, they raised money by mowing lawns for their landlord. Although the album sold poorly, it gained a cult following and attracted critics. In 2005 music critic Chuck Klosterman singled out The Big Come Up as one of 21 \\"high-quality albums\\" from the previous three years. As the two blues-rock singers began to gain attention, they caught the eye of American Independent record label, Fat Possum Records. Fat Possum Records quietly released blues music that drew inspiration from the gritty country blues guitar rhythms and from artists like Junior Kimbrough, one of Carney and Auerbach's leading inspirations. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Dan Auerbach ‚Äì electric guitar, vocals, bass, 12 string guitar, slide guitar *Patrick Carney ‚Äì drums, tambourine, maracas, beats, sampler, production *Gabe Fulvimar ‚Äì Moog bass on \\"She Said, She Said\\", \\"Heavy Soul\\", \\"The Breaks\\", and \\"Countdown\\" ==Production== *Patrick Boissel ‚Äì album cover design *Michael Carney ‚Äì album cover design, photography *Dave Schultz ‚Äì mastering ==References== Category:The Black Keys albums Category:2002 debut albums Category:Alive Naturalsound Records albums Category:Albums produced by Patrick Carney ","title":"The Big Come Up"},{"id":"1445510","text":"The abbreviation TTI can refer to: * Techtronic Industries, a Hong Kong electrical company * Texas A&M; Transportation Institute, a research agency * Texas Tennessee Industries, now Igloo Products Corporation * Transmission Time Interval in digital telecommunication * Toyota Technological Institute, Japan * Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago or TTI-Chicago * TTI, Inc., a distributor of electronics components * A belt worn with a martial arts dobok * TTI Telecom, an Operations Support Systems vendor * Transfusion transmitted infection * Time temperature indicator of the history of a perishable product * Travel Technology Interactive, airline software company * Turbo Technologies Incorporated, TurboDuo video game console maker ","title":"TTI"},{"id":"1445515","text":"Colonel Adam Nieniewski (19 May 1886 ‚Äì 25 April 1947) was a Polish military commander, an officer of the Polish Army and a veteran of World War I, Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War and World War II. == Biography == Adam Nieniewski was born May 19, 1886, in Zawady, Kalisz Governorate to a family of Stanis≈Çaw Nieniewski, a veteran of the January Uprising of 1863 and Halina n√©e Wybicka, granddaughter of J√≥zef Wybicki, the author of Polish national anthem. After finishing primary school in Ko≈°ice in 1897 he joined the cadet corps school in Hranice. After graduating from that school in 1904 he joined the Officer Cavalry School in Wiener Neustadt. In 1907 he was promoted to cavalry ensign and assigned to the 6th Uhlans Regiment, where he served as a platoon and then squadron commander. He also continued his military education, first at various courses in Tarn√≥w and Rzesz√≥w, and then (since 1911) at the Academy of the General Staff in Vienna. On November 1, 1912, he was promoted to lieutenant. In July 1914, during the mobilisation preceding the outbreak of the Great War, he was assigned to the Imperial General Staff. During the war he served at various staff posts in the Austro- Hungarian headquarters, and then in the HQ of the 1st Army, in the Ministry of War and in 130th Mountain Brigade, where he served as the chief of staff. For his merits in 1915 he was promoted to captain. On May 23, 1916, he was assigned to the headquarters of Pi≈Çsudski's Polish Legions, where he served as the deputy chief of staff and was soon promoted to major (on December 1, 1916). Following the Oath Crisis he was arrested on March 6 and interned in a prison camp in Hungary. After Poland regained independence in 1918, Nieniewski was released and joined the Polish Army. As one of the most experienced officers in Polish service, he was the second deputy chief of General Staff. On June 17, 1919, he became the chief of staff of General Haller's Blue Army after it arrived to Poland from France. In addition, since September 1, 1919, he served as the chief of staff of the Cieszyn Silesia front and Pomeranian Front. Between March and May 1920 he served as the chief of staff of the 1st Polish Army and, since July 5, of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division. On August 16, 1920, during the Battle of Warsaw, he was assigned as the commanding officer of Polish 4th Cavalry Brigade, which later became the core of the so-called Nieniewski's Operational Group during the Battle of the Niemen River. After the end of hostilities of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, Nieniewski graduated from a Generals' Course and on January 10, 1921, he was promoted to Colonel of Cavalry. Between May 18 and September 25, 1921, he commanded the VII Infantry Brigade. After it was disbanded, he continued to command its troops within the 7th Infantry Division. In 1925 he briefly held the post of the deputy rector of the Higher War School, later to be renamed to the Polish Academy of the General Staff. In 1926 he was also the head of the Staff Officers Courses in the Cavalry School in GrudziƒÖdz. On January 31, 1928, he resigned all his posts and was demobilised. Retired, he withdrew to his wife's village of Chorzenice, where he lived in a local manor. During World War II he moved to a nearby village of K≈Çomnice, but in 1945 both these villages were confiscated by the new Soviet-backed communist authorities of Poland. In 1945 he was yet again mobilised by General Micha≈Ç Rola-≈ªymierski and briefly served as the chief of staff of the Pozna≈Ñ Military Area Command, but in August of that year he was again demobilised. Adam Nieniewski died April 27, 1947, in Olsztyn. He was buried in Wr√≥blewo near ≈Å√≥d≈∫. His family manor in Chorzenice was turned into an orphanage. == Decorations == * Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari * Officer's Cross of the Polonia Restituta - 4th Class * Cross of Independence * Cross of Valour (Krzy≈º Walecznych) - 4 times * Chevalier of the L√©gion d'Honneur == Bibliography == * == See also == * Polish‚ÄìSoviet War Category:1886 births Category:1947 deaths Category:People from B≈Çaszki Category:People from Kalisz Governorate Category:Polish Austro- Hungarians category:Austro-Hungarian Army officers Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Polish legionnaires (World War I) Category:Polish Auxiliary Corps personnel Category:Polish Army officers category:Polish people of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War Category:Polish military personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari Category:Officers of the Order of Polonia Restituta Category:Recipients of the Cross of Independence Category:Recipients of the Cross of Valour (Poland) Category:Chevaliers of the L√©gion d'honneur ","title":"Adam Nieniewski"},{"id":"1445520","text":"Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the Canadian-American rock group The Band.

He had been previously employed as a store clerk, a waiter, and a bartender. In 2001, Cesternino graduated from the honors program at the State University of New York at Oswego with a Bachelor of Arts degree in broadcasting. ==Survivor== ===The Amazon=== Cesternino appeared on Survivor: The Amazon in 2003. Originally a member of the all-male Tambaqui tribe, Cesternino cut a number of deals throughout the game, which often resulted in him double-crossing his allies and convincing other tribe members to flip their votes. Cesternino lasted 38 of 39 days but was voted out by Jenna Morasca at the final three. ===All- Stars=== In 2004, he came back to play again in Survivor: All-Stars and was a member of the original Chapera tribe and he was voted out in a blindside led by \\"Boston\\" Rob Mariano. With all votes against him, he was the third person voted out and finished in 15th place, after fellow Amazon castaway Jenna Morasca quit the game to be with her dying mother. ==Post-Survivor== In May 2013, Cesternino was a guest on the Survivor After Show, hosted by Parvati Shallow. In June of that year, he appeared as a co-host and executive producer of Reality GameMasters, a YouTube show documenting six reality stars competing in a game of Risk. Cesternino was inducted into Xfinity's Survivor \\"Hall of Fame\\" in 2012, alongside Amanda Kimmel and Ethan Zohn. In addition, both of his seasons were voted by viewers as being among the top 10 greatest seasons of all time - The Amazon was 8th, while All-Stars was 6th. In a 2015 interview shortly before the premiere of the 30th season, Jeff Probst stated that Cesternino, along with Spencer Bledsoe from Survivor: Cagayan and Survivor: Cambodia, was his personal favorite non-winner contestant. ===Rob Has A Podcast=== Cesternino owns and manages his own website entitled Rob Has A Website, which is the home of his podcast series Rob Has A Podcast (RHAP), which has since expanded to include a YouTube channel. The podcast began during 2010, originally covering Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains and the final season of the ABC television drama series Lost. Cesternino also covers a wide range of other reality programs including Big Brother, The Amazing Race, and The Celebrity Apprentice. Cesternino and fellow Survivor alumni Stephen Fishbach, co-host of the RHAP show Survivor Know-It-Alls, were approached to compete together in The Amazing Race 31. The pair showed interest but were forced to decline due to Fishbach's impending wedding. ==Personal life== In August 2010, Cesternino married his longtime girlfriend, Nicole Palmeri. The couple's first child, Dominic James, was born on September 29, 2013. The couple's second child, Anthony Joseph, was born on November 12, 2015. ==References== ==External links== * *Rob Cesternino's Post Show Recaps website * *Rob Cesternino biography for Survivor: The Amazon at CBS.com *Rob Cesternino biography for Survivor: All-Stars at CBS.com Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American men podcasters Category:American podcasters Category:People from Wantagh, New York Category:People from Los Angeles Category:State University of New York at Oswego alumni Category:Survivor (American TV series) contestants ","title":"Rob Cesternino"},{"id":"1445539","text":"S√£o Sebasti√£o (Portuguese for \\"Saint Sebastian\\") may refer to: ==Places== ===Brazil=== * S√£o Sebasti√£o, Alagoas * S√£o Sebasti√£o, S√£o Paulo :* Ilha de S√£o Sebasti√£o, S√£o Paulo, alternate name of Ilhabela * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Alto, Rio de Janeiro * S√£o Sebasti√£o da Amoreira, Paran√° * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Anta, Minas Gerais * S√£o Sebasti√£o da Bela Vista, Minas Gerais * S√£o Sebasti√£o da Boa Vista, Par√° * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Ca√≠, Rio Grande do Sul * S√£o Sebasti√£o da Grama, S√£o Paulo * S√£o Sebasti√£o de Lagoa de Ro√ßa, Para√≠ba * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Maranh√£o, Minas Gerais * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Oeste, Minas Gerais * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Para√≠so, Minas Gerais * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Pass√©, Bahia * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Rio Preto, Minas Gerais * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Rio Verde, Minas Gerais * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Tocantins, Tocantins * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Uatum√£, Amazonas * S√£o Sebasti√£o do Umbuzeiro, Para√≠ba * S√£o Sebasti√£o da Vargem Alegre, Minas Gerais ===Portugal=== * S√£o Sebasti√£o (Guimar√£es), a civil parish in the municipality of Guimar√£es * S√£o Sebasti√£o (Lagos), a civil parish in the municipality of Lagos * S√£o Sebasti√£o (Loul√©), a civil parish in the municipality of Loul√© * S√£o Sebasti√£o (Rio Maior), a civil parish in the municipality of Rio Maior * S√£o Sebasti√£o (Set√∫bal), a civil parish in the municipality of Set√∫bal * S√£o Sebasti√£o da Pedreira, a civil parish in the municipality of Lisbon ; In the archipelago of the Azores * S√£o Sebasti√£o (Ponta Delgada), a civil parish in the municipality of Ponta Delgada * Vila de S√£o Sebasti√£o, a civil parish in the municipality of Angra do Hero√≠smo ===S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe=== * S√£o Sebasti√£o Museum ==See also== * Sebasti√£o (disambiguation) ==Other meanings== * Sport Club S√£o Sebasti√£o, a Brazilian football (soccer) club * The full traditional name of the city of Rio de Janeiro is S√£o Sebasti√£o do Rio de Janeiro.

A personable \\"hole-and-corner lawyer\\" (that is, one without a diploma) and swindler in Odessa,Adler, 1999, 38-41 Rosenberg was part of the migration of merchants and middlemen to Bucharest, Romania at the start of the Russo-Turkish War in 1877. These merchants and middlemen would prove a crucial component of the audience for the nascent professional Yiddish-language theater, consisting at that time only of a single troupe, that of Abraham Goldfaden. Unlike the rest of the migrants, Rosenberg actually joined the troupe and became an actor. Like many who worked with Goldfaden, he soon chafed under the latter's imperious style and with his countryman Jacob Spivakovsky, put together his own travelling troupe and set out for the eastern part of Romania. At first they did well, but with the end of the war much of their audience returned to Russia; after running through their money playing in the provinces, they turned up nearly broke in Odessa, where there was a pre-made audience of those who had already seen Yiddish theater in Romania during the recent war. There, in spring 1878, Rosenberg obtained some small backing and formed a troupe including Spivakovsky; Broder singers \\"Schmul with the Hoarse Throat\\", \\"Boris Budgoy\\" (Boris Holtzerman), Laizer Duke, Aaron Schrage; Jacob Adler, at that time new to performing; Sophia (Sonya) Oberlander, who later married Adler; and Masha Moskovich, whom Adler in his memoir describes as \\"a red-gold-haired beauty\\"; and various others, including singers from a local synagogue choir. Their first performance was at Akiva's restaurant, and consisted of two light vaudevilles and Goldfaden's very early play \\"The Recruits\\". The cast was all male, because the two women considered this an insufficiently respectable venue; that was soon remedied by renting the Remesleni Club, an 800-seat theater that had hosted many German- language performances. There they played Goldfaden's \\"Grandmother and Granddaughter\\" with yet another Broder singer, named Weinstein, clean-shaven for the first time in his adult life, as the grandmother and Masha Moskovich as the granddaughter. After several more successes in Odessa, most notably a production of Breindele Cossack starring Jacob Adler and Sonya Oberlander (then performing under the name Sonya Michelson), their run was cut short by the news that Goldfaden, whose plays they were using without permission, was coming with his troupe to Odessa, and that he had booked the Remesleni Club out from under them. Goldfaden's own account is that he was coming there at the urging of his father; Adler attributes it to Rosenberg and Spivakovsky's \\"enemies\\". Rosenberg, never the most ethical of men, hired Goldfaden's watchmaker brother Naphtal, renamed his troupe \\"the Goldfaden Company\\", and withdrew from Odessa to tour the hinterland, with Sonya's brother Alexander as an advance man.Adler, 1999, 104-105 In Kherson, a granary was adapted into a theater by a wealthy retired soldier, Lipitz Beygun, who even imported first- rate scenery from Spain. Here they acquired a new prompter, Avrom Zetzer--whom Adler describes as a \\"learned\\" man who had previously fulfilled the same function for Goldfaden in Romania-- and virtuoso Zorach Vinyavich became leader of their orchestra; Vinyavich's 16-year-old daughter Bettye also joined the troupe to play juvenile roles.Adler, 1999, 105-107 Returning to Odessa, they found Goldfaden \\"as difficult to approach as an emperor\\". [Adler, 1999, 114] When they finally managed to get an audience, Goldfaden agreed to allow Rosenberg's company to function as a provincial touring company, but with a different brother of Goldfaden's, Tulya, not merely on board but officially head of the troupe. Goldfaden also snagged Spivakovsky for his own Odessa company.Adler, 1999, 118 With Tulya in charge there were, as Adler wrote, \\"no more communistic shares, no more idealistic comradeship\\". They played a month in Chi≈üinƒÉu, where people slept in the courtyard to be the first to get tickets, and a 16-year-old David Kessler was almost accepted to join the company as an extra, but was prevented from doing so by his father.Adler, 1999, 124, 124-125 (commentary) Later they toured to Yelizavetgrad (now Kirovohrad), where they were joined by Israel and Annetta Grodner, who had re- joined Goldfaden in Odessa, but then had a falling-out.Adler, 1999, 128, 135 When his actors struck in Kremenchuk over low pay, Rosenberg himself triumphantly played the juvenile lead role in Shmendrik, effectively breaking the strike. Fences were mended, and one of their next performances, in Poltava, became a benefit as a wedding gift to players Adler and Oberlander. They toured on through Ukraine, lionized in some towns, harassed by the police in others, until Goldfaden called them back to Odessa, a call that most of his troupe obeyed, leaving Rosenberg and the Adler-Oberlander contingent (the leaders of the recent strike) in Smila, without a troupe.Adler, 1999, 138, 152, 155, 156 There, they had the good fortune to overhear the singing voice of a woman who would later become famous under the name Keni Liptzin, but who at this time called herself Keni Sonyes, who became their new prima donna. They toured on to Spolya, a town that at the time belonged to Count Alexander A. Abaza, probably the most philo-Semitic of Tsar Alexander II's advisors. The town lacked a theater, but at Abaza's behest a storehouse was turned into an excellent performance space, furnished in part from the count's own dacha. They continued on successfully to Zlatapolya, Novomirgorod, and Bogoslav, around which time Alexander Oberlander met a woman, married, settled down, and was replaced as advance man by a former employer of Adler's named Cheikel Bain.Adler, 1999, 157-161 Though their touring kept them living in decent style, things were not all rosy. In Pereiaslav, Adler reports, they played at a fine small theater, but the local police chief tried to treat the actresses as prostitutes. Goldfaden was making impossible demands for royalties; at one point Sonya Adler gave him nearly all of her jewelry to placate him; shortly after, in late 1880, Goldfaden briefly recruited the Adlers away from Rosenberg, but he treated them so badly that they ended up suing him for their wages and rejoining Rosenberg in Nezhin, where his troupe was performing in a tent theater.Adler, 1999, 162-166, 170 The period after the February 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II was a bad one for the Jews. Provocateurs were traveling around the empire, stirring up pogroms, one of which soon swept over the troupe in Nezhin. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.Adler, 1999, 192-197 They made their way to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where they did well enough to pay off some debts. Having heard that in Odessa Osip Mikhailovich Lerner and Goldfaden were each presenting their respective versions of Karl Gutzkow's Uriel Acosta, Rosenberg and company decided to do the same. Rosenberg translated; with Spivakovsky having ducked out only three days before opening, Adler played the title role; Liptzin played Uriel's mother; Sonya Adler played Judith. The production was a triumph, but they had about played out ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Spivakovsky returned, and nearly stole the troupe out from under Rosenberg; in the end, all united again, and they went on to Zhytomyr with a new director in charge, an apparently rich man named Hartenstein who seemed to want to invest in them.Adler, 1999, 197-214 Adler, in his memoir, indicates that he was rather unimpressed with Hartenstein, describing him as \\"a young man from Galicia with long hair and short brains, half educated in Vienna, and half an actor.\\" They thought they had found \\"a quiet corner\\" of the Russian Empire in which \\"to make a bit of a livelihood\\", but in fact Hartenstein was simply running through his money.Adler, 1999, 214-216 In Zhytomyr, they had shared a theater with a Russian troupe, who were sympathetic to their travails. Two Russian actors agreed to participate in a series of benefits on their behalf; one of them, whom Adler identifies only as \\"Mademoiselle Kislova\\", nearly destroyed them by making a speech from the stage excoriating the audience and Russian society in general for their lack of support for what she considered to be good theater.Adler, 1999, 216-218 The next incarnation of the company was actually organized by Adler, although Rosenberg was once again a partner. With Keni Liptzin, they toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, and to D√ºnaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban was about to be placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.Adler, 1999, 225 The troupe were left stranded in Riga. Chaikel Bain took ill and died. With some difficulty, passage to London for the troupe was arranged on a cattle ship, in exchange for entertaining the crew. However, about this time the Grodners reappeared. Adler wanted to include them in the group headed for London. According to Adler, Rosenberg, who played many of the same roles as Israel Grodner, essentially told Adler \\"it's him or me\\". Adler attempted to convince him to change his mind, but insisted on including Grodner in the travel party: Adler considered him one of the best actors in Yiddish theater, a great asset to any performances they would give in London, while he felt Rosenberg lacked depth as an actor. He tried to get Rosenberg to come with them to London, but Rosenberg would not budge.Adler, 1999, 93, 225-229 That is the end of the story of Rosenberg's career in theater. Adler in his memoir gives an account that when he went back in Europe in 1903 in the wake of the Kishinev (Chi≈üinƒÉu) pogrom, in an unsuccessful attempt to convince some of his family to join him in the United States, he encountered Rosenberg as a street beggar and unsuccessfully attempted to give him money. Shortly after, he heard that Rosenberg was dead.Adler, 1999, 352-353 ==Notes== == References == * Adler, Jacob, A Life on the Stage: A Memoir, translated and with commentary by Lulla Rosenfeld, Knopf, New York, 1999, . 38-41, 60, 78-80, 83, 89-93, passim.

Byers made phenomenological analyses of experimental observations leading to theoretical advances in particle physics and the theory of superconductivity. In \\"Theoretical considerations concerning quantized magnetic flux in superconductors,\\" she showed that observation of flux quantization in superconductors in units of hc/2e is experimental evidence for the Cooper pairing of electrons proposed by the BCS theory of superconductivity (Byers- Yang theorem). In addition to scientific papers, Byers published papers and edited a book on original and important contributions to modern physics by 20th century female physicists. She developed the website Contributions of 20th Century Women to Physics (CWP website), which documents original and important contributions to physics by over 80 female physicists of the 20th century. With Gary Williams, she edited a book based on data from the website that expands the biographies and describes more fully the scientific contributions of forty distinguished 20th century female physicists. Byers was elected to many offices in The American Physical Society (APS) and American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), including President of the APS Forum on History of Physics (2004‚Äì2005), APS Forum on Physics and Society (1982), and APS Councilor-at-large of the Society (1977‚Äì81). ==Works== ===Selected scientific publications=== * * * Nina Byers, \\"Einstein and Women\\", APS News Jun 2005. * Nina Byers, \\"Physicists and the 1945 Decision to Drop The Bomb\\", CERN Courier Oct 2002.
