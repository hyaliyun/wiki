It comprises musicians and singers who have passed the auditions before enlistment into the IDF, mostly in compulsory service. It performs at military ceremonies, official visits, and honor guards, as well as various non-official community events. ==History== The IDF Orchestra, forming a Star of David The Israel Defense Forces Orchestra was established in 1948 as a part of the newly formed Israel Defense Forces. It was formed out of four orchestras: The Alexandria Division Band, The Brigade Band, The Artillery Corps Band and The Givati Brigade Band. The orchestra's first conductor was Izhak Muse, a new immigrant from the Soviet Union who played wind instruments. Muse was a graduate of a prestigious military orchestra academy in Leningrad and immigrated to Israel in January 1949. On 4 May 1949, the band participated in the second annual IDF parade celebrating Independence Day, but the crowd that filled the streets blocked the parade route and forced the parade to stop. The event was later nicknamed \\"The March That Did Not March\\" and led to the creation of the first Israeli Commission of Inquiry. After several months, Shalom Ronli-Riklis, the former conductor of The Brigade Orchestra, took over as conductor of the orchestra. Ronli-Riklis greatly expanded the orchestra's repertoire from modern to classical music and light music during his tenure as conductor, a position he held until 1960. From 1953 to 1955, renowned Israeli composer Noam Sheriff served as Ronli-Riklis's assistant. Izhak Graziani, a long-time arranger, composer, and trumpet player in the orchestra, became conductor in 1962. Three months before he died, in 2003, Graziani retired. He was replaced by Lt. Col. Michael Yaaran, who conducted the orchestra until his own retirement in 2013. Major Noam Inbar became the conductor On 29 July 2013 and was succeeded by Rom Shamir on 25 April 2018. In 2018, the band received an honorary doctorate from Bar-Ilan University.  List of Israel Defense Forces Orchestra Directors of Music  Michael Yaaran in October 2011. {  - ! Number !! Name !!

Its base is located in Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv. In addition to the main orchestra, the IDF has a rabbinical choir and other military bands. The difference between the IDF Orchestra and the other bands (including the choir) is that the other bands are only for entertainment and morale, while the orchestra is also a ceremonial unit. Additionally, while the other military bands belong to the Education and Youth Corps, the IDF Orchestra belongs to the Regime and Discipline Branch--both are under the Manpower Directorate, which is responsible for Israel's state and military ceremonies. Among the many functions of the orchestra, its main activities are performing at graduation courses in military training bases, official visits by heads of state and military personnel, and official ceremonies (such as the torch-lighting ceremony held each year on Mount Herzl, Jerusalem to celebrate Israel's Independence Day). The unit's symbol is a harp of David placed between two trumpets amalgamated with olive branches. When the orchestra is not performing, its musicians wear the standard uniform (olive green) with a musician's pin above the left pocket. The ceremonial uniform, worn in official ceremonies, is a standard uniform together with a red belt, a red string (worn over the right shoulder), a ceremonial cap stamped with the band's symbol over a red background, and a larger musician's pin. The IDF Orchestra is the only IDF unit that has two pins identical in design but different in size. ==Activities==  Parades  In parades, the orchestra musicians are always on their feet, and in most parades they march across the parade ground. In parades that are not part of state ceremonies, the orchestra is the first military force to enter the parade ground, immediately followed by the other forces. In such parades, most commonly featured in the conclusion of military courses, the band is led by a drum major whose job is to direct the orchestra during the march, signal the turns, and mark the beginning and end of the music. In most state parades the band does not march, but rather stands with a military honor guard beside a red carpet to welcome the person of honor. However, some extremely large state parades include marching (e.g. large receptions held at Israel's main international airport). The instrumentation at such parades comprises: piccolo, oboe, clarinet, saxophone (alto and tenor), bassoon, french horn, trumpet, trombone, baritone horn, sousaphone (marching tuba), snare drum, bass drum, and cymbals.  Performances  The orchestra also performs in public, not only in Israel but sometimes abroad to perform for events like ceremonies, the arrival of world leaders, etc. These performances include a rich repertoire, comprising classical music for concert bands, popular music, Israeli songs, and marches. The band regularly performs with leading artists of Israeli music. Among others, the orchestra has performed with Yehoram Gaon, Ofra Haza, Ilanit, Yardena Arazi, Harel Skaat, David Broza, Kobi Aflalo, Rami Kleinstein. Ever since the 2000s, the orchestra performs annually at the Rishon LeZion Festival on Sukkot has become a tradition. ==See also== *Orchestra *Marching band *Military band ==NotesReferences * The official website of the Israel Defense Forces Orchestra Category:Israeli orchestras Category:Israel Defense Forces Category:Israeli military bands ","title":"Israel Defense Forces Orchestra"},{"id":"46351924","text":"Cecil Birch was a British film director of the silent era.Low p.101 He directed more than a hundred short and feature films.

She is best known for writing in favour of women's rights in the magazine Slovenka, and is considered the first Slovenian feminist. ==Biography== Dolinar was born in 1870 in Krško to parents of Austrian and German origin. She trained as a teacher, since teaching was, at the time, one of the only intellectual professions in Slovenia considered acceptable for women, but she later stopped teaching after getting married. She and her husband had four children; she would use her daughter's name, Danica, as her pen name. Dolinar became interested in women's issues while studying to become a teacher, which inspired her to write articles on the subject that were published in various Austrian magazines. Her most influential work was published in Slovenka (\\"Slovene Woman\\"), a magazine run from 1897 to 1902 that featured writing mainly by female teachers. She wrote more than 40 articles for Slovenka promoting women's rights. With her first article, \\"Ženska emancipacija\\" (\\"Women's emancipation\\"), published in 1897, she became the magazine's first contributor to explicitly promote women's rights, and has since been considered the first Slovenian feminist. Her most influential and widely read article, \\"Svobodna ljubezen in zakon\\" (\\"Free love and marriage\\"), was published in 1900 and proclaimed that divorce ought to be permissible when both spouses found the relationship \\"unbearable\\", a sentiment that contradicted the Catholic values held by most Slovenians at the time. She was widely criticised, especially by Catholics, for her views. In addition to journalism and opinion writing, she also wrote fiction. Dolinar died in 1961 in Bled. Throughout the period during which Slovenia was governed by communist Yugoslavia, beginning in 1945, Dolinar and other activists for the feminist movement were condemned, and only since Slovenia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 has she been regarded as \\"a pioneer of Slovenian feminist thought\\". ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Slovenian feminists Category:Slovenian women writers Category:People from Krško Category:Slovenian people of Austrian descent Category:Slovenian people of German descent ","title":"Elvira Dolinar"},{"id":"46351940","text":"Won by Losing is a 1916 British silent drama film directed by Bertram Phillips and starring Queenie Thomas and Frank McClellan.Low p.302 ==Cast== * Frank McClellan * Queenie Thomas as Polly / Daphne ==ReferencesBibliography== * Low, Rachael.

Outside of school, Hori is a homebody who dresses down and takes care of the household and her younger brother Souta. She tries to keep this a secret from her classmates. One day when Souta returned home with a nosebleed, he was helped by someone sporting multiple earrings and tattoos as well as a punk-styled appearance. The person recognizes her and reveals himself to be Miyamura. The two agree to keep their real personas a secret from their schoolmates, but start relating to each other as friends and later as a couple. Characters ; : :Kyoko is a bright and popular high school girl, but at home, she takes on a different look, dressing down and removing her makeup, tying her hair back, and doing housework while taking care of her little brother. She does not want her friends to see her in that state, but when Izumi Miyamura does, they agree to keep their real personas a secret. She begins to have romantic feelings towards Miyamura. She heard his confession to her when she had a cold and said she heard everything he said. They became a couple after she admits Izumi is her boyfriend when her father asked her when Izumi was present. ; : :At school, Izumi appears to be a gloomy otaku fanboy with glasses and keeps to himself. However, outside of school, he is rather good looking and laid back, with a punk-styled look and nine piercings (four on each of his ears, and one on his lip), as well as tattoos. Despite his school appearance, he has only a casual interest in manga and has mediocre grades. His family runs a bakery. He accepted his lonely existence but upon learning that Kyoko does not mind how he looks, he slowly gained confidence and friends among his classmates. Unlike his gloomy image in school, Izumi's look outside school would have easily gained him popularity with his pretty face that he hides under glasses. Izumi grows his hair long to hide his ear piercings, and wears long-sleeved shirts to cover his tattoos. He finds Kyoko's real side to be cute, even when she gets angry. He was fine with being friends but his honest attitude allows him to tell Kyoko the things he admires in her. They officially became a couple after Kyoko's dad asked Kyoko whether Izumi is her boyfriend. ; : :Toru likes Kyoko and befriends Izumi when he noticed the two are spending more and more time together. He learns of Izumi's secret about the tattoos and piercings. Toru confesses to Kyoko but is rejected. Izumi later considers him one of his friends. ; : :Kyoko's best friend; she was interested in Izumi when she accidentally saw him without glasses and did not recognize him. When she saw him again with Kyoko, Kyoko attempted to hide his secret between them by saying Izumi was her cousin. When Yuki met Izumi at Kyoko's home, he introduced himself as Konoha, after a manga character. Yuki has a crush on Konoha, but regards Izumi as an unattractive otaku. ; : :Kyoko's childhood friend and the student council president. He is seen as a bit weak, but is capable. He befriends Izumi and is Ayasaki Remi's boyfriend. ; :A member of the student council, but is seen mostly as a mascot. She has a small build and is very playful with others.

After tripping and getting a nosebleed, Izumi brings Souta back to his home and where Souta constantly asks his sister to invite his new friend to come back. This gives Kyoko an excuse to hangout with Izumi after classes. ; :Souta's kindergarten classmate who used to bully Souta for having a sister complex. After Izumi shows her some kindness, she and Souta become friends. ; :Kyoko's workaholic mother who can cook only curry, she appreciates Izumi's help in taking care of Souta with Kyoko. ; :Kyoko's wandering father, who favors the relationship between Kyoko and Izumi and treated Izumi like his own best friend whenever his own daughter unleashes her hostility on him. ==Media== Manga Hori-san to Miyamura-kun Horimiya Hori-san to Miyamura-kun Omake Anime Four original video animations (OVA) based on the Hori- san to Miyamura-kun manga have been produced.

At the 2014 local election Apostolos Tzitzikostas lost support by Nea Dimokratia because of his refusal to be nominated candidate mayor of Thessaloniki and his decision to run for the office the Regional Governor. He was challenged by ND candidate Yannis Ioannidis. With the support of right-wing parties ANEL, EPAL and LAOS, he defeated him in the second round, with a percentage of 71.03%,Ministry of Interior Affairs - Singular Logic - Elections May 2014 - Region of Central Macedonia and was popularly elected regional governor for five more years.

The five-part series was set on campaign buses belonging to the Conservative Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats and UK Independence Party featuring groups of mid-level party campaign organisers as each embarks on their respective election campaign. The series was written by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin. Episodes were written and produced within hours of transmission, allowing the characters to react to recent real-world events. ==Overview== The series cuts between the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and UKIP buses. Apart from a brief phone call at the end of the last episode, these groups do not interact with each other. All scenes are shot inside or in the immediate vicinity of the campaign buses, and much of the humour comes from the candidates talking candidly in private about their party and campaign in ways that they would not do in public. In each party there are interpersonal conflicts between individuals. Conservatives In the Conservative group nominal leader Martin (Hugh Dennis), a frustrated one-nation conservative, clashes with the well-connected Baz (Jimmy Akingbola), the latter of which openly supports what he considers to be Boris Johnson's inevitable rise to power and is far more willing to engage in more cynical campaign ploys. Women's issues consultant Siobhan (Hattie Morahan) feels marginalised by both men. The group is completed by dim-witted and politically uninformed intern Ruby (Liz Kingsman), who the group is forced to employ as she is the daughter of a major party donor. Labour In the Labour group Jack (Trevor Cooper), a long time party supporter, is confused and dismayed by how the party, politics and campaigning has changed. Social media organiser Conor (Theo Barklem-Biggs) continually suggests unhelpful online strategies, mostly to the chagrin of co- ordinator Christine (Daisy Haggard). The advice of American political strategy consultant Melanie (Kathleen Rose Perkins), who frequently attempts to secure a future job in the 2016 presidential election campaign, grates with her English colleagues. Liberal Democrats Liberal Democrat Kevin (Ben Miller), dismayed at the poor electoral prospects of his party, the last five years of coalition government, and a recent divorce, suffers a nervous breakdown, showing increasingly erratic behaviour as the series progresses. Assistant Charlotte (Esther Smith), tries to help, but party grandee Simon (Michael Fenton Stevens) repeatedly refuses to acknowledge that a problem exists. UKIP In the UKIP bus, communications manager Gerry (Andy Nyman), a UKIP supporter on purely Eurosceptic grounds, struggles to prevent political damage arising from offensive comments and behaviour of other UKIP members. This includes those of openly bigoted logistics manager Kate (Sarah Hadland). The bus is driven by Obi (Rhashan Stone), a friendly and resourceful Somalian immigrant. Gerry and Obi strike up a friendship, bonding over a mutual love of Star Wars, while Kate views him with suspicion due to his race. Gerry is forced to fire Obi after he learns he is an illegal immigrant, and his replacement Mick (Steven O'Donnell) is far more aligned with Kate's bigoted worldview. ==Power Monkeys== A sequel series, Power Monkeys began airing on 8 June 2016. While retaining the same up-to-the-minute production style, the new series focuses more broadly on current events, such as the EU referendum or the American election. ==See also== *Coalition *UKIP: The First 100 Days ==References * – official website * * – official website Category:2015 United Kingdom general election Category:Political satirical television series Category:Works set in the 2010s Category:Works about elections Category:Channel 4 original programming Category:Fiction set in 2015 Category:British political comedy television series Category:2015 British television series debuts Category:2015 British television series endings Category:2010s British satirical television series Category:Television series by Hat Trick Productions Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Ballot Monkeys"},{"id":"46352184","text":"The 2006–07 season of the Philippine Basketball League (PBL). ==2006-07 Silver Cup== {  - !

Kuomintang building in Vancouver Canada and the Republic of China (also known as Taiwan) have maintained unofficial bilateral relations since 1970. Relations between Canada and the ROC were established in 1942. Since Canada's recognition of the People's Republic of China as the sole representative of \\"China\\" in 1970, there are no ambassadorial relations between Canada and Taiwan due to the Chinese government's One-China policy, but there are strong ties of trade and culture between the two entities since at least 1986. Officially, Canada \\"takes note\\" of China's claim to Taiwan without endorsing or challenging this position. ==History== In 1942, Canada posted its first ambassador for the Republic of China (the successor state to the Qing dynasty) in the wartime capital of Chongqing. The embassy was then moved to the permanent capital of Nanjing in 1946. However, with the Communist victory over the Nationalists, which caused them to retreat to Taiwan while the Communists established the People's Republic of China, the Canadian embassy in Nanjing was kept open until February 26, 1951. Canada maintained its diplomatic relations with Nationalist China. Policy On 13 October 1970, Canada recognized People's Republic of China (PRC) and suspended diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan.List of Timetable of PRC's Diplomatic Relations from Ministry of Foreign Affairs of PRC In the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 Canada supported the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the successor state of the Republic of China. After diplomatic relations between Canada and the ROC were suspended, both diplomatic missions were replaced by representative offices. Presently, the Government of the Republic of China maintains the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada () in Ottawa,Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada OFFICIAL WEBSITE and two other offices in VancouverTaipei Economic and Cultural Office in Vancouver OFFICIAL WEBSITE and Toronto.Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Toronto OFFICIAL WEBSITE Taiwan External Trade Development Council also has offices in Toronto and Vancouver. The Government of Canada established the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei (CTOT) in 1986 during the days of Brian Mulroney. During the mandate of Stephen Harper the CTOT expanded and moved to the Xinyi District of Taipei. In October 2019, Stephen Harper visited Taipei as a private citizen to attend the Yushan Forum, promote his book, Right Here, Right Now, and give a speech that was described as a \\"thinly-veiled criticism of China's economic model\\" by the Globe and Mail. Victor Gao, vice president of the Chinese- government-aligned Center for China and Globalization, disapproved of Harper's visit. ==Economic== In 2019, Taiwan was reportedly the fifth-largest trading partner in Asia of Canada. The main exports from Canada to Taiwan are metal ore, mineral oil, asphalt, wood, coal, nickel, meat and railway vehicles.Trade Profile of Taiwan and Canada by the Ministry of Economic, ROC Canada is the 24th largest trade partner of Taiwan, which exported to Canada over $1.5bn worth of goods and services in 2017-18, ranking it 19th on the Canadian list. The main exports from Taiwan to Canada were mobile devices, recording equipment, boilers, steel products, and plastic products. In 2018, the balance of trade between Taiwan and Canada in 2018 was 47.9 billion in favour of the Taiwanese. As the Canadian difficulties with China mounted in 2019, academics like Hugh Stephens suggested that the Taiwanese relationship be fostered and promoted, which he saw as being consistent with Canada's democratic values. He would encourage the accession of Taiwan to the CPTPP, and noted that Taiwanese membership with the WTO allowed New Zealand to sign an FTA with Taiwan in 2013. In October 2019 it was remarked that the number of foreign diplomatic ties of Taiwan had dwindled to 15 countries, Canada not among them. ==Cultural== Since 1990, TaiwanFEST is held in Vancouver and Toronto. TaiwanFEST began in 1990 in Vancouver by musical/cultural magnate, Cecilia Chueh as a music festival but expanded to include various cultural events. From 2006 onwards, it is also expanded and celebrated in Toronto. ==See also== * Canada–China relations * Taiwanese Canadians ==ReferencesExternal links == *Canada and Taiwan - international.gc.ca Taiwan Category:Bilateral relations of Taiwan ","title":"Canada–Taiwan relations"},{"id":"46352200","text":"Bolivian police in La Paz.

Illegal drug trade  The Bolivian government has since 2004 implemented a policy of voluntary participation of farmers from all coca- growing regions in Bolivia. For instance, farmers in Chapare are allowed to grow one cato of coca per year. Any coca grown beyond that limit, or any cultivation outside of approved coca-cultivation regions such as Chapare, is subject to elimination. The strategy relies on coca growers federations’ ability to enforce the agreement. Such federations are influential, and penalties for violations by farmers or lax enforcement by federations can be stern (including seizure of lands). As a result, coca cultivation in Bolivia fell to 27,200 hectares in 2011 from 31,000 hectares in 2010 - a 12 per cent decrease.  Domestic violence  Domestic violence is a serious and underreported problem. According to the Center for the Women’s Information and Development (CIDEM) and Emancipation Fund study, the number of reported domestic violence cases increased by 37% between 2007 and 2011.

Whilst the Labour presence was reduced, the Conservatives were unable to win an outright majority, and both parties exited the election with 22 seats. The council Conservative group, under Brian Meek, was able to take over the council however due to support from the SDP-Liberal Alliance councillors.

In a precursor to the Rate-capping rebellion, several Scottish councils had refused to implement spending cuts necessitated due to a cut in funding from George Younger, the then Secretary of State for Scotland. Lothian in particular had seen its funding cut to the tune of £47 million in July 1981. The Labour leader of Lothian Regional Council; John Mulvey, pursued a policy of resisting the cuts, and claimed that Labour had a popular mandate to protect jobs and services through increasing local expenditure. The Lothian council, alongside the councils of certain other Scottish regions, planned spending above government guidelines. Younger responded by cutting the Lothian budget by a further £30 million, and the council caved in to pressure. ==Aggregate results== 278772 ==Ward resultsReferences== *Scottish Regional Elections 1982: Results and Statistics; J.M.

Centered on the junction of Market Square, Court Street, Water Street, and Main Street, it includes a relatively cohesive assortment of brick and masonry commercial buildings, designed by architects and built between 1885 and 1910, following the arrival of the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ==Description and history== Houlton was one of the first communities settled in southern Aroostook, and is still its most important economic center. The town was incorporated in 1831, but grew very slowly until 1870, when the New Brunswick Railway was extended westward into Maine. In 1893 the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad arrived in Houlton from the west, kicking of a commercial building boom. The downtown area which developed around Market Square was affected by fires in 1884 and 1902, which mainly resulted in the destruction of older wood-frame buildings. The result is a cohesive collection of brick and masonry buildings generally between two and four stories in height, built with a variety of architectural styles popular at the time. Market Square, 2014 The district is centered on the intersection of four roads just east of Pearce Brook, which snakes through the town, and a short way south of Interstate 95, the region's only highway. Market Square, the western branch of the junction, is a broad open area with parking at its center, lined on the east and west with historical buildings. Notable among these is the First National Bank of Houlton, the only building on the square with a granite facade; it was designed by George M. Coombs and built in 1907. Three of the eight buildings on the square were designed by Wilfred E. Mansur of Bangor, although they are each in different styles. Three buildings line the west side of Court Street just south of the intersection, and three more are north of the junction on Water Street, including the Romanesque Revival Post Office and Custom House. Main Street east of the junction is lined on both sides with historic buildings to Broadway and Powers Street, including several more designed by Mansur and Coombs. These include the Mansur-designed fire station, and the Colonial Revival Elks Lodge, which anchors the eastern end of the district. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Aroostook County, Maine ==References== Category:Victorian architecture in Maine Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Maine Category:Houlton, Maine Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Aroostook County, Maine Category:Historic districts in Aroostook County, Maine ","title":"Market Square Historic District (Houlton, Maine)"},{"id":"46352277","text":"Marion Derby (later Marian Wisberg and also known as Marion Mountain) (March 12, 1923 - May 15, 2013) was an author, artist, and zen student of Shunryū Suzuki.

Excess aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain more salt than normal, which in turn increases the body's fluid levels and causes high blood pressure. People with familial hyperaldosteronism may develop severe high blood pressure, often early in life. Without treatment, hypertension increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and kidney failure. There are other forms of hyperaldosteronism that are not inherited. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The various types of familial hyperaldosteronism have different genetic causes. It is unclear how common these diseases are. All together they appear to make up less than 1% of cases of hyperaldosteronism. ==Types== Familial hyperaldosteronism is categorized into three types, distinguished by their clinical features and genetic causes. Type I In familial hyperaldosteronism type I, hypertension generally appears in childhood to early adulthood and can range from mild to severe. This type can be treated with steroid medications called glucocorticoids, so it is also known as glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism (GRA). Type II In familial hyperaldosteronism type II, hypertension usually appears in early to middle adulthood and does not improve with glucocorticoid treatment. Type III In most with familial hyperaldosteronism type III, the adrenal glands are enlarged up to six times their normal size. These affected have severe hypertension that starts in childhood. The hypertension is difficult to treat and often results in damage to organs such as the heart and kidneys. Rarely, individuals with type III have milder symptoms with treatable hypertension and no adrenal gland enlargement. ==Cause== This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The various types of familial hyperaldosteronism have different genetic causes. Familial hyperaldosteronism type I is caused by the abnormal joining together (fusion) of two similar genes called CYP11B1 and CYP11B2, which are located close together on chromosome 8. These genes provide instructions for making two enzymes that are found in the adrenal glands. The CYP11B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxylase. This enzyme helps produce hormones called cortisol and corticosterone. The CYP11B2 gene provides instructions for making another enzyme called aldosterone synthase, which helps produce aldosterone. When CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 are abnormally fused together, too much aldosterone synthase is produced. This overproduction causes the adrenal glands to make excess aldosterone, which leads to the signs and symptoms of familial hyperaldosteronism type I. Familial hyperaldosteronism type III is caused by mutations in the KCNJ5 gene. The KCNJ5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a potassium channel, which means that it transports positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells. In the adrenal glands, the flow of ions through potassium channels produced from the KCNJ5 gene is thought to help regulate the production of aldosterone. Mutations in the KCNJ5 gene likely result in the production of potassium channels that are less selective, allowing other ions (predominantly sodium) to pass as well. The abnormal ion flow results in the activation of biochemical processes (pathways) that lead to increased aldosterone production, causing the hypertension associated with familial hyperaldosteronism type III. The genetic cause of familial hyperaldosteronism type II is unknown. ==DiagnosisTreatmentReferences External links == Category:Endocrine diseases ","title":"Familial hyperaldosteronism"},{"id":"46352379","text":"Craig Alexander Nitti (born January 19, 1992) is a retired American soccer player. ==Career== College & Youth Nitti played most of his youth soccer with the North Valley Fusion, an age group team in the Southern California Coast Soccer League.

Released on August 19, 2016, Endless was Ocean's last release with the record label Def Jam Recordings to fulfill his recording contract. Endless was distributed exclusively through Apple Music as a streaming-only video and was followed by the August 20 release of Ocean's second studio album, Blonde. Endless was later remastered and reissued on CD and vinyl on April 10, 2018, almost two years after its premiere. ==Background== On February 21, 2013, Ocean confirmed that he had started work on his second studio album, which he confirmed would be another concept album. He revealed that he was working with Tyler, The Creator, Pharrell Williams, and Danger Mouse on the record. He later stated that he was being influenced by The Beach Boys and The Beatles. He stated he was interested in collaborating with Tame Impala and King Krule and that he would record part of the album in Bora Bora. In April 2014, Ocean stated that his second album was nearly finished. In June 2014, Billboard reported that the singer was working with a string of artists including Happy Perez, Charlie Gambetta and Kevin Ristro (whom he worked with on Nostalgia, Ultra), as well as Hit-Boy, Rodney Jerkins and Danger Mouse. On November 29, 2014, Ocean released a snippet of a new song supposedly from his upcoming follow-up to channel ORANGE called \\"Memrise\\" on his official Tumblr page. The Guardian described the song as: \\"a song which affirms that despite reportedly changing labels and management, he has maintained both his experimentation and sense of melancholy in the intervening years\\". On April 6, 2015, Ocean announced that his follow-up to channel ORANGE would be released in July, as well as a publication, although no further details were released. The album was ultimately not released in July, with no explanation given for its delay. The publication was rumored to be called Boys Don't Cry, and the album was slated to feature the aforementioned \\"Memrise\\". ==Release and promotion== On July 2, 2016, he hinted at a possible second album with an image on his website pointing to a July release date. The image shows a library card labeled Boys Don't Cry with numerous stamps, implying various due dates. The dates begin with July 2, 2015 and conclude with July 2016 and November 13, 2016. Ocean's brother, Ryan Breaux, further suggested this release with an Instagram caption of the same library card photo reading \\"BOYS DON'T CRY #JULY2016\\". On August 1, 2016, a live video hosted by Apple Music showing an empty hall was launched on the website boysdontcry.co. The website also featured a new \\"boysdontcry\\" graphic. The video marked the first update on the website since a \\"date due\\" post from July. On August 1, 2016, a video appeared that showed Frank Ocean woodworking and sporadically playing instrumentals on loop. That same day, many news outlets reported that August 5, 2016, could be the release date for Boys Don't Cry. The video was revealed to be promotion for Endless, a 45-minute-long visual album that began streaming on Apple Music on August 19, 2016. It was later confirmed that Endless is a different project than Ocean's second studio album. The assumed title Boys Don't Cry had been replaced with a new title, which led to the release of Blonde. Endless was his last project with Def Jam Recordings to fulfill his recording contract with them. On April 24, 2017, Ocean aired a remix of the track \\"Slide On Me\\" on his radio show Blonded Radio featuring American artist Young Thug. On November 27, 2017, as part of Cyber Monday, Frank Ocean started selling physical copies of Endless on his website along with new merchandise. The new, remastered version of the album is available on vinyl, CD/DVD and VHS. ==Critical reception== Endless received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 13 reviews. In The Guardian, Tim Jonze said Ocean mixed the pop with the avant-garde on Endless, calling it \\"a rich, varied and – at times – challenging musical feast\\", however noting that \\"much of this album floats by hazily and with no clear direction\\". In a joint review of Endless and Blonde for Q magazine, Victoria Segal said \\"these records might not eclipse Channel Orange, but they have their own mercurial gleam, mapping the spaces between people, reaching for a hazy intimacy that almost feels real.\\" Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork wrote that \\"as a piece of filmed entertainment, Endless is painfully dull\\", however praised the \\"much more exciting\\" music, comparing it to a mixtape, and stating that it is \\"an intriguing peek into [Ocean's] process, and it contains some of the rawest vocal takes he’s ever put out\\". For Consequence of Sound, Nina Corcoran wrote that the video \\"wobbles between its highs and lows\\". She was ambivalent to the music's abstract nature, noting that \\"is filled with beauty, but it feels like a dream where you don’t remember much, even if you take a pen to paper as soon as you wake\\". In a mixed review for AllMusic, Andy Kellman wrote that the tracks \\"melt into one another\\", concluding that \\"it's a smartly ordered patchwork of mostly secondary material\\". Spin magazine's Brian Josephs was more critical, believing it did not work as an album. \\"As a whole, Endless feels formless,\\" Josephs wrote, \\"like pretty, curlicue-flaunting cursive with no adherence to notebook margins.\\" Dan Caffrey of The A.V. Club stated that the album's concept \\"would be slightly fascinating\\", if the length didn't result in \\"the video becom[ing] a chore to sit through\\". He praised the album's opening tracks, however criticised the music overall as \\"undercooked ambience, half-finished verses, and robotic descriptions of Apple products\\". == Track listing == All tracks produced by Frank Ocean, Vegyn, Troy Noka and Michael Uzowuru, except where noted. Notes * \\"Device Control\\" and its reprise are not included in audio-only releases of the album, with \\"Mitsubishi Sony\\" extended to 2:51, leading to a total length of 38:17. * There are some discrepancies between various track listings of the album. Not all releases list the songs \\"Ambience 001: A Certain Way\\", \\"Xenons\\", \\"Ambience 002: Honey Baby\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Impietas\\", \\"Mitsubishi Sony\\", and the reprise of \\"Device Control\\" in their track lists. *\\"Comme des Garçons\\" is incorrectly spelt \\"Commes des Garcons\\" in video releases. *\\"Mitsubishi Sony\\" is stylized as \\"Mitsu-Sony\\" in the VHS/DVD releases.

The inclusion of God supporting his crucified son within the picture was popular during the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, but is otherwise rare in art history. Beneath the holy figures are a series of smaller individuals, who are assumed by art historians to be the family who commissioned the painting; this is likely to be the Bettschold and Rothschild families, given the coats of arms present in the lower corners. The donors were often depicted during the Middle Ages as much smaller than the holy figures, in order to emphasise the difference between them. The painting was acquired in 1894 by the National Gallery, London, who still hold the piece as of 2015.

Retrieved 9 March 2018 It was a private tertiary education provider, accredited by the Australian government, specialising in training for Christian ministry. It was non-denominational and Pentecostal in its theology and ethos. ==History== In 1985 there was no Pentecostal theological college in Victoria. In response to this, a British AOG pastor, Ps. Alun Davies, began Harvest Bible College on the property of the church he pastored. Initially, it ran as a non-government accredited college. With Dr Scott Wilson and then Dr Kameel Majdali as Principals, the College then became the first Pentecostal college in Australia to be accredited by the government, and the first to offer a Licentiate. At first, a Certificate IV in Ministry was accredited, then a Diploma in Ministry, then finally a Bachelor of Arts in Ministry or Biblical Studies. After Dr Brendan Roach became Principal (2004) and then President (2011), the College accredited a Graduate Diploma in Theology, a Master of Arts in Ministry and a Doctorate of Ministry with the Australian government. The College has also campuses, in Queensland and Perth, Australia, and abroad in Denmark, as well as smaller rural extension centres and online training. In 2014 the College moved its headquarters from the property of Faith Christian Church to its own building in Scoresby, Victoria. Harvest consistently fulfilled its mission to Train Effective Ministry Worldwide to Serve Local Churches since 1985. For 33 years trained men and women to serve God in a variety of ministry roles and functions in and beyond the local church.

The album has been described as \\"haunting yet beautifully bare\\". == Background ==  Writing and recording  Nate Eiesland, Alissa Ricci and Ryne Estwing came together in the spring of 2012 to form a new band and record new material after the dissolution of their previous band, Scattered Trees. A three-week-long Scattered Trees recording session had been previously booked, so the trio decided to proceed and record in Toronto with producer Dave Newfeld. The threesome decided to \\"dismantle\\" the final songs they had written for Scattered Trees and to write a fresh batch in the studio. Singer Nate Eiesland described producer Newfeld as \\"a mad genius. His guidance was less about new sounds and more about new perspectives on how to make a record\\". Newfeld encouraged the band to experience recording from the exploration and experimentation side, rather than being solely about performance and getting perfect takes.  Musical style and influences  After working within the confines of a traditional rock band dynamic in Scattered Trees, On An On incorporated electronic elements into their songwriting for Give In. They utilised \\"all of these really old drum machines that Dave Newfeld had\\" and live drummer Tony Nesbitt-Larking was brought in to record on the album.  Themes  Keyboardist Alissa Ricci stated that the band were so excited to record an album that they didn't enter into the process with any preconceived statements or themes and themes which emerged during the writing process were \\"relationships, the tough things, the great things, death, pain, ambivalence and apathy\\". The death of principal writer Nate Eiesland's father during the making of the final Scattered Trees record the previous year continued to affect him during the making of Give In, with his lyrics reflecting a \\"more of an ambivalent attitude towards death, unlike the first stage of grief\\". \\"The Hunter\\" deals with Eiesland's \\"level of familiarity and understanding of death\\". Ryne Estwing revealed that the album title Give In is \\"another way of saying don’t give up\\". ==Critical reception== Music review aggregator Metacritic gives the album a score of 81, based on four reviews. The band's sound drew comparisons to Beach House, Yeasayer and Awolnation. ==Track listingPersonnel== *Nate Eiesland – vocals, guitar *Alissa Ricci – keyboards *Ryne Estwing – bass *Tony Nesbitt-Larking – drums, percussion *Dave Newfeld – mixing, production, mastering == References == Category:2013 albums ","title":"Give In"},{"id":"46352684","text":"Nisiturris is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.Bouchet, P.

The suite was commissioned by the Tcherepnin Society for the pianist Eric Himy, who played its world premiere that October 14 at Alice Tully Hall in New York City. The score exemplifies Liebermann's modernist style, in which tonal harmony and expressive gestures grounded in tradition coexist with avant-garde procedures. The piece has become one of Liebermann's most popular efforts, receiving more than ten recordings. Many cathedral gargoyles portray grotesque faces with great humor, and Liebermann intends precisely that in his pieces, which have the mordant wit of Serge Prokofiev's \\"bad boy\\" style in their ancestry. The brief opening movement commences with an arresting three-note “signal” and move forward with perpetual motion rhythms, the narrative studded with shock-effects. The following Adagio semplice, by contrast, is deeply introverted, presenting melancholy melodizing over patterns based on two alternating chords. Later, a still slower melody unfolds against repetitions of a single note. Crystalline sonorities mark the third Gargoyle which floats a songful theme over luminous liquid swirls, and ultimately develops into a duet. Mordancy and menace return in the finale, which is dominated by demonic galloping rhythms, as textures grow steadily more dense and virtuoso gestures steadily more flamboyant.Kravis Center for the Performing Arts Program Booklet, March 30, 2007. ==References== Category:Compositions by Lowell Liebermann Category:1989 compositions Category:Suites (music) Category:Compositions for solo piano ","title":"Gargoyles (Liebermann)"},{"id":"46352734","text":"Baby Boom () is an Israeli television series that debuted in 2014 on Channel 10.

An email from a constituent supporting marijuana legalization received a heated response from Sanborn, who opposes legalization, including legislation making its way through the state legislature. Sanborn wrote in the email, \\"I’m thinking if I call the [organization you received a scholarship from] and ask their opinion on legalization, they may have a different opinion (not to mention may be asking you for their scholarship money back…).\\" The constituent was believed to be a college freshman and a recipient of a scholarship, information that Sanborn declined to say how it was obtained. Sanborn responded to the controversy thus: \\"My e-mail was not a suggestion that I could or would work to revoke any scholarship, only to highlight that those involved with awarding him those funds may have made a different decision had he expressed similar pro- marijuana legalization efforts to them when applying.\\" Health care Sanborn is opposed to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and compared it to the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214.

He graduated from Arthur Voaden Secondary School, where he played football, soccer and wrestled. From 1984 he attended the University of Guelph, graduating in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. The following year he joined the London Police Service. == Police service == He began serving with the London Police Service in 1989, where he occupied several roles including patrol officer, undercover officer and detective with both a Youth Crime/Gang unit and a Major Crime Unit. In 1995 Wilson adopted the hate crime portfolio for the London Police Service. Wilson investigated a multitude of hate crimes which included investigations into organized hate groups, such as Northern Alliance, Tri-City Skins and the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team. The investigation into the Canadian Ethnic Cleansing Team resulted in two members of the group (James Scott Richardson and Alexian Kulbashian) being charged and convicted for spreading material likely to incite hatred, contrary to Section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. In 2003 Wilson left the London Police Service to join the New Westminster Police Service in British Columbia as a detective with the Domestic Violence and Elder Abuse Response Team.

This executive order required federal departments and agencies to consult with Indian tribal governments when considering policies that would impact tribal communities. Executive Order 13175 reiterated the federal government's previously acknowledged commitment to tribal self-government and limited autonomy. == Background == Early treaties established between the United States' government and tribal governments were characterized by provision for the preservation of separate native political and cultural organizations. This notion of self-government established in the treaties, however, was consistently ignored under progressive restrictions on native autonomy. Following concerted efforts by native groups throughout the 1960s and 1970s to reassert their tribal authority, President Richard Nixon marked an official end to Indian termination policy and reintroduced tribal self-government in a 1970 Congressional address. Since then, almost every United States president has reiterated his commitment to reestablishing a government-to-government relationship between federal and tribal governments. President Clinton's first significant action within Indian policy was his issuance of Executive Order 12875, \\"Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership,\\" in October 1993. This executive order called for a decrease in unfunded mandates and the development of a process for all elected officials, including tribal officials, to provide input on federal policies. On April 29, 1994 President Clinton invited leaders from all 547 recognized tribes to a tribal summit on issues facing tribal communities, the first such summit since James Monroe's presidency. In 1998, Clinton issued Executive Order 13084, which only two years later would be annulled and replaced by the identically titled and similarly purposed Executive Order 13175, \\"Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments.\\" == Provisions == The central provision of Executive Order 13175 is the consultation requirement, as the majority of the order focuses on the imperative of incorporating tribal input into policy decisions. Executive Order 13175 reiterates certain fundamental principles in tribal policy, including that the United States maintains a unique relationship with tribes as dependent nations. This relationship is governed by the acknowledgement of tribal self-government, sovereignty, and self-determination. In addition to committing the Clinton administration to these principles, Executive Order 13175 establishes standards of behavior for federal agencies and departments when considering, developing, and implementing policies that are anticipated to have significant impact on one or more recognized tribes. These standards include affording tribal governments maximum discretion in implementing federal policies within their communities, defaulting to tribal authority when feasible, and engaging in regular and meaningful consultation with tribal leadership throughout the policy development process. With regards to this consultation responsibility, Executive Order 13175 requests that all federal agencies and departments develop proposals for how they plan to coordinate with tribal governments. These plans should then be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review. In addition, each agency or department is directed to appoint a staff member responsible for ensuring compliance with Executive Order 13175. == Enforcement == President George W. Bush continued to support the ideas behind Clinton's Executive Order 13175, as he issued an executive memorandum entitled \\"Government-to-Government Relationship with Tribal Governments.\\" In this, Bush recommitted his administration to interacting with tribal governments on a 'government-to government' basis. The memorandum also repeated Executive Order 13175's support of policies that protect tribal sovereignty and right to self-determination. President Barack Obama also dedicated his administration to the principles outlined in Executive Order 13175. On November 5, 2009, President Obama published a \\"Memorandum on Tribal Consultation\\". In this memorandum, President Obama declared that each federal agency or department must submit a plan within 90 days detailing their cooperation with Executive Order 13175. President Obama's memorandum indirectly acknowledged that Executive Order 13175 had not been consistently and completely adhered to across departments and agencies. One of the reasons for this lack of compliance is that an executive order is difficult to enforce. Executive orders are typically unenforceable unless they are issued following a mandate and they provide private cause of action. The consultation requirement in Executive Order 13175 is not judicially enforceable because it depends on the trust responsibility outlined in the Constitution rather than a statutory mandate and the order explicitly states that it is not intended to create private cause of action. Full cooperation with Executive Order 13175 is further hindered by the lack of specificity of the order's requirements. While the order states that consultation should be regular and meaningful, it does not clarify at what point in the policy development process this consultation should take place, what communication format should be used for consultation, or how often consultation should take place. The lack of enforceability and specificity of Executive Order 13175 has resulted in inconsistent compliance with the executive order. For example, in 2003 a proposed reorganization of the Department of the Interior included divorcing the Office of Indian Education Programs from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This policy would create a new Bureau for Indian Education Programs. Although this would directly impact all recognized tribes, the Department of the Interior did not consult with tribal authorities at any point during the development of the proposed reorganization. Tribal input was finally considered only after a resolution passed by the National Congress of American Indians demanded it. The resulting consultation did not include a complete explanation of the proposed changes, so tribal leadership remained largely unaware of the implications of this reorganization, which included significant funding cuts. This incident was used by legal scholars, advocates, and tribal leaders to indicate that consultation under Executive Order 13175 remained inconsistent and ineffective. == Response == Conceptually, Executive Order 13175 has received little criticism. The principles of self-government, self- determination, and tribal sovereignty have been publicly acknowledged in Indian policy since President Nixon. The idea that consultation is part of the federal government's trust responsibility has been cited since early treaties between federal and tribal governments. Rather, the majority of criticism regarding Executive Order 13175 has concerned a lack of compliance with the order. Tribal leaders have protested that consultation under Executive Order 13175 occurs only when instigated by negative publicity regarding the implementation of policies that did not receive tribal input and consequently harmed tribal communities. In 2008, Representative Nick Rahall restated these concerns as he admonished the Bush administration for prioritizing consultation only after witnessing the disastrous results of the absence of consultation. Executive Order 13175 has also been widely criticized for not providing sufficient guidance to agencies and departments in developing consultation plans. Derek Haskew, a scholar at the University of Oklahoma College of Law, extended these criticisms of Executive Order 13175. In a 2000 study, he anticipated that the executive order would prove detrimental to the relationship between federal and tribal governments. Haskew argued that because Executive Order 13175 is not enforceable, it creates an uncertain set of benefits for tribal communities and an unclear set of responsibilities for federal agencies and departments. As a result, the executive order established expectations for consultation among tribal communities that would go unmet and so perpetuated a sense of betrayal within the relationship between federal and tribal governments. Haskew concluded his criticism of Executive Order 13175 by acknowledging that the executive order itself was not a product of consultation with tribal leadership. ==See also== *Tribal sovereignty in the United States * Native American self-determination * Indian Civil Rights Act ==References== Category:Executive orders of Bill Clinton ","title":"Executive Order 13175"},{"id":"46352930","text":"Bright Osayi-Samuel (born 31 December 1997) is a Nigerian–English footballer who plays as a left midfielder for Championship club Queens Park Rangers. ==Career== Osayi-Samuel was born in Okija, Nigeria, then moved with his family to Spain before emigrating to England when he was ten years old, settling in Woolwich, London.

It was first composed for voice and piano but later orchestrated. The songs are traditionally performed by a baritone or bass(-baritone). The cycle is made up of three independent pieces: Chanson Romanesque, Chanson épique, and Chanson à boire. The text was written by the librettist Paul Morand. It was composed between the years of 1932 and 1933. == Composition history == This was the last of Maurice Ravel's compositions, commissioned by the celebrated film director G. W. Pabst for a cinema version of Don Quixote starring the legendary bass Fyodor Chaliapin. The score was to include four songs (one more than the final version) along with background music for several episodes. As Ravel worked on the project in 1932, however, he suffered the increasingly disabling effects of Pick’s disease, a cerebral- neurological condition that gradually robbed him of motor skills and memory while afflicting him with periods of aphasia. How much Pabst knew about Ravel’s illness is unclear; but as 1932 wore on with no immediate prospect of receiving all the music, the director fired Ravel and hired Jacques Ibert for the job.Roger Nichols, Ravel, New Haven, 2011, p. 330. In fact, Pabst had simultaneously commissioned several composers, so that he could choose at will. When the film, completed in 1933, reached theaters with Ibert's music, Ravel sued the producers, but never obtained a judgement. In the end, Ravel wrote only three songs, both in piano-accompanied and orchestrated versions; the very ill Ravel was assisted at least in notating the orchestration by Lucien Garban and Manuel RosenthalRavel: Man and Musician, Arbie Orenstein, Columbia University Press, 1975, p. 206. He completed them in 1933 thanks to extensive secretarial help provided by friends and assistants (his condition soon progressed so far that he could not write his name). The first public performance, given by baritone Martial Singher in December 1934 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, featured the orchestral version, with an ensemble conducted by Paul Paray. For the lusty opening \\"Chanson Romanesque\\", Ravel chose the quajira dance-pattern, exploiting the quirks of its alternating and meters for word-painting, and enlivening it by sometimes garnishing the with a clashing dissonance. Sensuality subtly increases with a turn to the major, and the final rhapsodizing on the beloved (\\"O Dulcinée\\") deepens the emotional perspective of all that has gone before. Parallel harmonies create the atmosphere of medieval Christian liturgy in the prayer of \\"Chanson épique.\\" Here the oft-reiterated asymmetrical dance-rhythm of the zortzico imparts a sustained urgency unusual in slow music. Against the manic jota that dominates the \\"Chanson à boire\\", a tipsy Don Quixote revels in flamenco vocalizing and unleashes peals of laughter as keyboard flourishes suggest the bubbling and sparkling of wine.Alice Tully Hall Program Booklet, October 12, 2000 == Lyrics == Chanson Romanesque Si vous me disiez que la Terre A tant tourner vous offensa, Je lui dépêcherais Pança: Vous la verriez fixe et se taire.

She is best known for creating the wedding dress worn by Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the future Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, for her marriage to the Duke of York in 1923; and later, Queen Elizabeth's coronation gown in 1937. ==Early life== Born Elizabeth Fielding in Blackpool in 1867, she moved to London in the 1890s and set herself up as a court-dressmaker. In 1901 she married Major James Burke Handley-Seymour. The Major was described as having been a lifelong art critic in 1938. ==Business== According to a 1938 newspaper article, Handley-Seymour launched her business in 1908–09 with a staff of four. By 1912 Handley-Seymour was based on Bond Street, and had received her first Court commissions. She was still located at Bond Street in 1938, with a staff of 200 making up her designs, while her husband handled the administrative side of the business. From the beginning Handley-Seymour offered copies of Paris dresses for her clients, a practice that was very common among high end dressmakers in London at the time. A 1914 advertisement published in The Times listed a number of couturiers with whom Handley-Seymour had agreements to allow her to reproduce their models for her clientele, including Paul Poiret and the Callot Soeurs. Poiret was at that time considered one of the most avant-garde and daring couturiers, meaning that Handley-Seymour was catering to a clientele who expected to be offered the smartest, most fashionable Paris modes. Many of the gowns provided by Madame Handley-Seymour were co-designed and created by Avis Ford, who started out as an apprentice in the 1910s and eventually became chief designer and fitter. Following the retirement of Handley-Seymour and at the request of Queen Mary, Ford opened her own couture establishment in the early 1940s on Albemarle Street, and continued to provide clothing to the Royal Family. While it was reported that Handley-Seymour retired before the end of World War II which broke out in September 1939, she was still offering designs to the Duchess of Devonshire and Queen Mary in early 1940. However Handley-Seymour Ltd. was not formally wound up until 1950, following the deaths of Madame Handley-Seymour in 1948 and her husband's death in Buckinghamshire on 12 August 1949. Mrs Patrick Campbell as Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion, Act III. (1914) Theatre design One of Handley-Seymour's first high-profile clients was the actress Mrs. Patrick Campbell, who commissioned Handley-Seymour to create gowns for her role as Eliza Doolittle in the 1914 premiere of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion. Campbell exploited the dramatic potential of her clothing to draw attention, depending on Handley-Seymour to produce garments that would \\"transcend mere modishness.\\" To reflect Eliza's development from poor flower- seller to refined society lady, a dress worn midway through, in Act III, combined a fashionable cut with a gaudy yellow taffeta fabric with a brash \\"Futurist\\" print of scarlet roses. The final costume worn in the play, a pale grey dress and jacket with a boldly patterned black lining, presented Eliza as having achieved both fashionable refinement and freedom of thought, and was acclaimed by both the fashion press and the theatre critics. This final costume was adapted from a Paul Poiret ensemble. Shaw later criticised Handley-Seymour's costumes, declaring the print dress \\"horrible\\" and the Poiret-inspired ensemble \\"dramatically nonsensical,\\" although Kaplan and Stowell suggest that Campbell was taking inspiration from the Edwardian feminist who used refined and elegant attire to counteract accusations of being a \\"hammer-wielding suffragette.\\" Through rewrites and revisions, Shaw would later attempt to diminish Campbell's contributions to his play and downplay the success of her Eliza dressed by Handley-Seymour. Alongside Campbell, other actresses costumed by Handley-Seymour between 1913 and 1938 included Irene Vanbrugh and Diana Wynyard. Wedding of the Duke of York (the future George VI) and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, 1923 Royal designs In 1923 Handley-Seymour, at that time dressmaker to Queen Mary, was commissioned to make the bridal gown of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon for her 26 April wedding to the Duke of York. The ivory chiffon moire dress was embroidered with pearls and silver thread, with a train of Flanders lace, and a girdle of silver leaves and green tulle fastened with silver roses and thistles. Handley-Seymour also made a number of outfits for the Duchess's trousseau, which were exhibited to the press on 20 April and were noted for their modestly neutral colours, such as a grey-beige going-away costume. For the next 12 years Handley-Seymour remained the Duchess of York's favourite dressmaker, although by 1937 the Duchess - now Queen consort following the abdication of Edward VIII - was transferring her patronage to Norman Hartnell. Despite this, Elizabeth commissioned Handley-Seymour to create her gown for the Coronation (although Hartnell dressed the maids of honour). William Shawcross notes that, according to Elizabeth Longford, the Queen was aware that if Handley-Seymour had not been given the opportunity to make the Coronation gown it would have upset her greatly. The transfer to Hartnell was not total, as he and Handley-Seymour both supplied clothes for Queen Elizabeth's wardrobe for the 1939 royal tour of Canada. ==Legacy== In 1958 the Handley-Seymours' daughter Joyce donated a number of Handley-Seymour design books ranging from 1910 to early 1940 to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The breadth and scope of the collection of 51 volumes of designs is seen as an \\"unrivalled\\" record of a court-dressmaker's work. ==References== Category:1867 births Category:1948 deaths Category:English fashion designers Category:Wedding dress designers Category:1910s fashion Category:1920s fashion Category:1930s fashion Category:English costume designers Category:People from Blackpool ","title":"Elizabeth Handley-Seymour"},{"id":"46353006","text":"This article lists all the confirmed national football squads for the UEFA Women's Euro 1993.

Thus the 12Xgrs was of the X family, with reduction gearing and supercharger. Whereas the 12Xhrs was identical but rotated in the opposite direction. Lorraine- Dietrich 8Be aircraft engine.

The proposal was that an institution be formed to work towards setting up a regional network funded by Asian countries to overcome current and future economic crisis. During the Asian financial crisis, Asian leaders had difficulties in dealing with both regional and international institutions such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and particularly the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Countries such as Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and Thailand had to turn to bailouts from the IMF. However, the strict conditions of the IMF bailouts evoked discontent among Asian countries. This discontent was largely because Asian nations had little leverage on IMF crisis resolution measures despite the IMF being an international organisation. Another source of discontent was due to the financial volatility concerning the US dollar. More specifically, difficulties had arisen because for most of the 1990s, countries such as Thailand and Indonesia had largely implemented fixed exchange-rate systems with their currencies generally pegged to the US dollar. The proposal to establish an AMF led to sharp disagreement between Japanese and United States officials because the US Treasury, which had not been consulted on the proposal, did not support the idea of creating an AMF. In the face of this opposition from the US and a reluctance to support it from China, the Asian Monetary Fund was never established. ==See also== *African Monetary Fund *Arab Monetary Fund *European Stability Mechanism ==References== Category:Economy of Asia Category:International organizations based in Asia Category:Monetary economics Category:Proposed international organizations ","title":"Asian Monetary Fund"},{"id":"46353200","text":"The Seven O'Clock Show was an Irish evening-time television show on TV3.

The trivial, petty bourgeois urban environment forms the basis of many of his early realistic novels, whereas his later works turned towards religious and moral issues.Waldemar Hammenhög, Store norske leksikon. Writing more than 40 novels, Hammenhög is probably best known for Pettersson & Bendel (1931), a humorous novel adapted twice to screen. ==Life and work == Born in Stockholm in 1902 as Waldemar Anderson, he was the son of foreman Per Anderson and his wife Lydia Källgren.

He left his job as a clerk after he was awarded first-prize in a novel competition organized by the Stockholm-based publishing house Natur & Kultur with his debut novel Esther och Albert. He submitted the text under the pseudonym \\"Hammenhög\\", which became his official name in 1931.Vad skriva de härnäst?, Bonniers litterärar magasin, 1932, Vol 2. p. 67-69.

Esther och Alberts äktenskap (1936) was also a success, adapted to screen as Ung man söker sällskap (1954), starring Ulf Palme and Gaby Stenberg.Waldemar Hammenhög, Svensk filmdatabas. In the late 1940s, Hammenhög's writing turned from realistic humor towards moral issues as he was struggling with personal alcoholism.Waldemar Hammenhög - Pettersson & Bendel, Aftonbladet 1983. His writing reached a turning point with Torken (1951),\\"Torken\\" (literally: \\"dryer\\") is a Swedish non-standard word for an institution that takes care of drug detoxification. a novel about the failure of traditional alcoholic care. The novel is sometimes regarded as Hammenhög's second breakthrough as a novelist. A year later, Hammenhög published Omne animal (1952), a novel which implied that Hammenhög was heading toward Roman Catholicism. Most novels that followed often focused on religious and moral issues. ==Later life and death == Hammenhög's early commercial success as a productive novelist led to an extravagant lifestyle, and severe alcoholism. For years, alcoholic problems influenced his writing which was largely devastated by superficiality and haste.Waldemar Hammenhög, Nationalencyklopedin Vol 8, Bra Böcker: Höganäs, 1992. Later in life, Hammenhög became a \\"sober alcoholic\\". In that capacity, he frequently spoke in public about issues related to his alcoholism. Writing in newspapers, his signature was W H-g.

Gonzalez. The basic premise of the novel was originally published by Delirium Books in 2002 as a novella entitled Maternal Instinct. The book is cited by most critics as operating in the subgenre of “hardcore horror” as Gonzalez’ novel explores in graphic details controversial themes such as bestiality, cannibalism, mutilation, necrophilia, and snuff films. == Plot summary == When Brad and his wife Lisa plan a romantic weekend getaway, Lisa is ecstatic and looks forward to sharing the delightful news with her husband that she’s pregnant. However, the prospect of their vacation is dashed almost instantly as they’re involved in a curious altercation of road rage and Brad is subsequently arrested for reckless driving by the local county sheriff. Not long after, alone and defenseless Lisa is kidnapped by a band of sadists who plan to torture her as graphically as possible and record the entire gruesome act on film for profit. At the small cabin in the woods where they keep her captive, she meets her co-star for the snuff film: a masochist well-versed in acts of perversion and especially eager to torture Lisa. Desperate to save her life and her unborn child’s life, Lisa makes a deal with her captors to offer another innocent person’s life in place of her own, abandoning all morals in order to survive. == Background == In an interview with Bookgasm, author J.F. Gonzalez explained how his own incident of road rage inspired the initial concept of his novella, Maternal Instinct, which eventually became Survivor. He also further explains his objectives of such a hardcore and unrelenting piece of fiction by saying, “My original intention wasn’t to write something with a polarizing effect, but to simply disturb the hell out of the reader, period. At the time I started writing the short novel Maternal Instinct – which I later expanded into the novel Survivor – I had no idea how the novel was going to progress, or end, for that matter. The characters were telling me this story. I was appalled as anybody by what happened, but I also realized that if I opted out, if I forced certain plot points or motivations to go a certain way to a more safe and 'happy' way, that it would ring false.” == Critical reception == The response to J.F. Gonzalez’s Survivor has been mostly positive since its initial release in 2004. When Survivor was contracted and redistributed by Leisure Books in 2006, The New York Times reviewed the novel and praised it saying, “[Survivor] pushes your eyes off the page and then pulls them back, forcing the kind of visceral relationship between writer and reader that the best horror writing can produce.” == Publishing history == Survivor was originally published by Midnight Library, a small publishing house, in 2004. The novel’s success soon attracted the attention of Leisure Books and was acquired to be an installment in their Horror division of literature in 2006. J.F. Gonzalez, however, stressed his discontent at Leisure’s edition. Survivor was most recently published by Deadite Press in 2011 and is labeled on the gruesome cover of the publication as being, “The Author’s Preferred Edition.” ==References== Category:2000s horror novels Category:2004 American novels Category:American horror novels ","title":"Survivor (Gonzalez novel)"},{"id":"46353284","text":"The 1994–95 VfL Bochum season was the 57th season in club history. ==Review and events== On 6 November 1994 head coach Jürgen Gelsdorf was sacked.

His best known work is the novel Uncertain glory (recently translated into English). As editor, he founded, with Xavier Benguerel, Club Editor, the publisher house of The Time of the Doves from Mercè Rodoreda and Bearn o La sala de les nines from Villalonga, among other important works. He was a promoter of the journal Quaderns de l'exili (\\"Exile notebooks\\"). He was awarded the Creu de Sant Jordi in 1982. == Biography == Joan Sales i Vallès was born in November 19, 1912, at the Eixample district of Barcelona, in a family originally from Vallclara, in Conca de Barberà. His familiar surroundings progresses, at a political level, from traditionalism to the Catalan nationalism closer to Lliga Regionalista. When his father's business goes to ruin, the family is determined to remain at Vallclara. But Sales, who by the time has become bachelor in Lleida, move to Barcelona despite he is only seventeen. Joan Sales acted very young in opposition to the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. He was also one of the first Catalan language teachers of the official census of the Generalitat of Catalonia formed by Pompeu Fabra. He graduated with a degree in law at the University of Barcelona in 1932. He affiliated with Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, which will leave soon. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he graduated at the School of War and was appointed official. He felt sorrow about the anarchy in the rear and in his desire to help to maintain the power of the Republican Government of Generalitat he went to the fronts of Madrid and Aragon. In 1933, he married Maria Núria Folch, Catalan publisher, with whom he had a daughter the same year: Núria Sales Folch. He met the poet Màrius Torres, who was already ill of tuberculosiswith whom will share an intense friendship. They will keep an effusive correspondence until the death of Màrius, in 1942. From Màrius Torres he receives a deeply literary influence. In 1939, he went into exile in France and then, in 1940, in the Dominican Republic, and from there, to Mexico in 1942. He worked there as linotypist. In exile, he drove a deeply ideological journal, Quaderns de l'Exili (1943–1947). His text Els Òrsidesis a criticism to the intellectuals that do not assume the critical challenges of the country. From there, he edited with notes and studies, L'Atlàntida, Canigó, La nacionalitat catalana and the first edition of Poesies from Màrius Torres (1947). Once returned to Catalonia in 1948, he focused on publishing tasks, discovering essential authors to the modern Catalan literature (Màrius Torres, Llorenç Villalonga and Mercè Rodoreda). In 1955, he founded, with Xavier Benguerel and Joan Oliver, El Club dels Novel·listes, with which they wanted to expand the readership Catalan, developing a narrative and a more popular level language more accessible. Since its imprint, el Club Editor, he will offer to the public his work Uncertain glory (\\"Incerta glòria\\"), that do not appeared in definitive edition until 1971 and his epistolary war and exile Letters to Màrius Torres (1976). Other works include the book of poems Viatge d'un moribund (1952), his translations from Kazantzakis and Dostoyevski or the outline of a comic opera, music by Joan Altisent, En Tirant lo Blanc a Grècia. Sales was documentary and commentator of Historia de España and also of Història dels Catalans form Ferran Soldevila, and he wrote numerous works prologues for books from Joan Coromines, Mercè Rodoreda and Llorenç Villalonga. He directed the Diputació de Barcelona Office of Catalan until he retired (1982). Posthumously, Contes d'ahir i d'avui (1987) and his correspondence with Mercè Rodoreda (2008) were published. He died in Barcelona on November 12, 1983 and was buried in Siurana (Cornudella de Montsant, Priorat).

It depicts an elderly sailor sitting at a desk, with his daughter seated in a stool beside him. He stares out at the viewer, while she reads from a log-book. On the desk is a large chart depicting complex passageways between incompletely charted islands. Millais exhibited the painting with the subtitle \\"It might be done and England should do it\\", a line imagined to be spoken by the aged sailor. The title and subtitle refer to the repeated failure of British expeditions to find the Northwest Passage, a navigable passageway around the north of the American continent. These expeditions \\"became synonymous with failure, adversity and death, with men and ships battling against hopeless odds in a frozen wilderness.\\"Tate Gallery, The North-West Passage 1874 ==Background== The search for the northwest passage had been undertaken repeatedly since the voyages of Henry Hudson in the early 17th century. The most significant attempt was the 1845 expedition led by John Franklin, which had disappeared, apparently without trace. Subsequent expeditions had found evidence that Franklin's two ships had become stuck in ice, and that the crews had died over a number of years from various causes, some having made unsuccessful attempts to escape across the ice. These later expeditions were also unable to navigate a route between Canada and the Arctic. Millais had the idea for the painting when a new expedition to explore the passage, the British Arctic Expedition led by George Nares, was being prepared.James, Ian, \\"'The North-West Passage' by Sir John Millais\\", Polar Record, January 1986; 23 (142), pp. 81-4. ==Creation== Millais was keen to use Edward John Trelawny as the model for the figure of his old sailor. He had met him at the funeral of their mutual friend John Leech. Millais' wife Effie Gray persuaded Trelawny to sit for the picture by agreeing to attend a Turkish bath he was promoting at the time. The female figure was a professional model, Mrs Ellis, who was later used in another painting, Stitch, Stitch, Stitch (1876). The right side of the painting originally depicted two of the sailor's grandchildren, who were modelled by John and Alice Millais, two of Millais' own children. They were shown looking at a globe of the world. But after Millais completed the painting, he became unhappy with the figures of the children, thinking that they distracted the eye from the main figure. He cut out this section of the painting and replaced it with a screen, over which British naval flags are hung.Millais, John Guille, The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais, 1898, pp. 48-55. The chart depicted in the painting is of the northern coast of Canada, as mapped during the Robert McClure expeditions of 1848-53. It was designed by Edward Augustus Inglefield and printed in 1854. Millais may have intended to suggest that the old man was a veteran of one of McClure's expeditions. The painting in the background depicting an ice-trapped ship (partly hidden by the flag) resembles images of McClure's ship HMS Investigator, which was abandoned by McClure and his crew in 1853 after three years of being trapped. When he saw the painting at the Royal Academy exhibition, Trelawny, who was teetotal, was outraged by the fact that Millais had included a glass of grog and a lemon. According to Millais' son John Guille Millais, he complained to his friends in the Albany Club that \\"that fellow Millais has handed me down to posterity with a glass of rum-and-water in one hand and a lemon in the other\\". However, he eventually decided that Millais' Scottish wife Effie was probably to blame because \\"the Scotch are a nation of sots\\".Millais, John Guille, The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais, 1898, p. 390. ==Exhibition and provenance== The painting was first shown at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1874, at which it was highly praised by the art critics of the day. It was then shown at the International Exhibition in Paris in 1876. The painting was acquired by Henry Bolckow of Marton Hall, Middlesbrough for £4,930, from whose estate it was later bought by Henry Tate in 1888, who subsequently donated it to the National Gallery of British Art he had founded, later named after him as the Tate Gallery. When Tate bought the painting for 4,000 guineas there was apparently a \\"huge cheer\\" because it meant that it would form part of the national collection which Tate was planning.Albert Charles Robinson Carter, Let Me Tell You, Hutchinson & Company, 1940, p. 42. ==Influence== Albert Perry as Shotover and Elizabeth Risdon as Ellie Dunn in the original 1920 production of Heartbreak House The painting was hugely successful at the time, and was very widely circulated in reproductions. Millais' son says he once saw a reproduction in \\"the hut of a Hottentot shepherd\\" in South Africa. Along with Millais' earlier painting The Boyhood of Raleigh it came to symbolise Britain's self-image as a nation of heroic explorers. Millais received a letter from the explorer Sir George Nares in which he said that the painting had had a powerful effect on the spirit of the nation. The painting was quickly referenced in cartoons. In October 1874 Punch published a pastiche by John Tenniel portraying Disraeli as the old sailor and Britannia in the position of his daughter.Tenniel, John, engraved by Joseph Swain, Punch, or the London Charivari, December 5, 1874. A 1915 cartoon by Joseph Morewood Staniforth entitled \\"The Dardanelles Passage\\" was captioned \\"it might be done and England and France can do it\\", referring to the Gallipoli campaign, which was then just beginning. John Bull and Marianne replaced the old sailor and his daughter.\\"The Dardanelles Passage\\", Western Mail, 27 February 1915. George Bernard Shaw was inspired by the doleful imagery of failure and frustration in the work when he came to write his play Heartbreak House, which emphasises the pathos and impotence of its characters. The relationship between the main characters, Captain Shotover and Ellie Dunn, was based on the figures in the painting, and one scene partially reproduces the composition.Stanley Weintraub, Bernard Shaw on the London art scene, 1885-1950, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1989, p. 34. In his last completed play, Shakes versus Shav, Shaw depicts the same scene mimicking Millais' painting.John Anthony Bertolini, Shaw and Other Playwrights, Penn State Press, 1993, p. 119. ==References== Category:Paintings by John Everett Millais Category:1874 paintings Category:Books in art Category:Collection of the Tate galleries Category:Flags in art Category:Maps in art Category:Ships in art ","title":"The North-West Passage"},{"id":"46353403","text":"Sextus Julius C. f.

He attended elementary school between 1891 and 1894, and then embarked on a traineeship as a Machine Maker. At the same time he attended evening and weekend courses covering a range of subjects. Meanwhile, in 1892 he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD / Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands) and the newly formed German Metal Workers' Union. He was one of the founder members of the \\"German Transport Workers' League\\" in 1898, becoming a regional leader for Berlin in 1901 and, from 1903, General Secretary for Greater Berlin of the \\"German Trade, Transport and Traffic Workers' League\\", of which by 1907 he had become a full-time official. In 1907 he became a full-time official of the German Transport Workers' Union. There is a record of his having been a foundry worker with AEG and as a labourer in a linen factory, but he repeatedly lost his jobs because of his union activity. War broke out in August 1914, rapidly triggering a truce between the mainstream left-wing Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the political establishment. In the early months of the fighting Socialist politicians and trades unions were actively supportive of the war effort or else silent. The high-profile exception was Karl Liebknecht. Otto Franke, too, unhesitatingly opposed the war, and inevitably this brought him into contact with the pacifist Spartacus group developing from what had been the left wing of the SPD. Franke's opposition to the war was only intensified in 1915, when his brother was killed in the fighting. More generally, opposition to the war grew in Germany as the prospect of a rapid end to it receded. Otto Franke and Karl Liebknecht together organised a massive antiwar \\"May demonstration\\" in Berlin's Potsdamer Platz on 1 May 1916, for which together they had prepared the leaflets. Following this, in June 1916, Franke was arrested and held in investigative detention for five months, which he spent in the military prison at Moabit (Berlin). He was then sent to participate in the fighting on the Eastern Front. In Autumn 1917 he deserted and made his way back to Berlin where, as a deserter, he lived illegally, resuming his membership of the Spartacus League. In January 1918 Franke organised a strike by Berlin munitions workers, while building up a transport and courier network for the anti-war Spartacus League. After war ended, and during the confused revolutionary period that directly followed German military defeat, Otto Franke worked more closely than anyone else with Karl Liebknecht until the latter's assassination. Franke was also prominent at this time as a member of the Berlin Soldiers' and Workers' Councils. During the closing days of December 1918 he participated at the foundation of the German Communist Party, when he was appointed First Secretary of the Party's first Berlin District leadership team. Franke was instrumental in building the Berlin party's organisation. In 1921 he was sent south to Saxony where he took over the leadership of the Communist Party's East Saxony region. Two years later, in August 1923, he moved to Moscow where he took over the Information Department for Germany at the Comintern. Less than a year later, in May 1924, he returned to Berlin: here he was arrested shortly after his arrival. However, in October 1925 he was able to escape back to the Soviet Union. From 1928 he became a member of the Soviet Communist party. A so-called Hindenburg Amnesties enabled him to return to Germany later in 1928, and here, till 1933, he took charge of the Main Library and Archive of the Party Central Committee. The political backdrop changed in January 1933 when the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power and lost little time in moving to a system of one-party government in Germany. All political parties (other than the Nazi Party) were now illegal, but the new Chancellor had, in opposition, been particularly vitriolic about the Communist Party. Otto Franke was one of the organisers of the Communist Party's Ziegenhals Meeting in February 1933, following which he continued to work, now illegally, for the Communist Party in the Beeskow district. In July 1933 Franke was arrested, and the next few years were spent in concentration camps at Oranienburg, Sonnenburg and Lichtenburg. Released from the third of these in October 1936, he found work in Autobahn construction. In November 1937 he was arrested again. After his release in January 1938 he emigrated to Prague where he worked as a military trainer for the party. After German troops invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939 he had to emigrate again, and moved to London. Here he was one of many German political exiles to be identified by the British as an enemy alien, and in June 1940 he was interned. In March 1941 he was released, however, on account of illness. War ended in May 1945 and on 14 September 1946 Otto Franke returned to Berlin. His part of Berlin was now part of the Soviet occupation zone in what had been Germany. The entire Soviet administered area would become the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic, formally in October 1949, but already in April 1946 the ground was prepared for a return to one-party government, with the contentious merger of the KPD and more moderately left-wing SPD Franke became a member of the resulting Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) and took a job at the \\"Karl Mark\\" Party Academy in Liebenwalde. ==Recognition== As a veteran of the workers' movement, Otto Franke became, in 1953, one of the first recipients of his new country's Order of Karl Marx award. Shortly after this he died. His ashes were placed in the zone reserved for the remains of East Germany's national heroes in the Friedrichsfelde Cemetery. ==References== Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany members Category:Recipients of the Order of Karl Marx Category:1877 births Category:1953 deaths ","title":"Otto Franke (politician)"},{"id":"46353407","text":"Little Roaring Brook is a tributary of Roaring Brook in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately long and flows through Olyphant, Throop, and Dunmore. The watershed of the stream has an area of . It contains several watersheds: Dunmore Reservoir Number One, Marshwood Reservoir, and Dunmore Reservoir Number Three. Some strip mining has been done in the stream's vicinity and it has a high load of sediment. The surficial geology in the stream's vicinity consists of Wisconsinan Till, surface mining land, bedrock, urban land, and wetlands. ==Course== Little Roaring Brook begins at the Marshwood Reservoir in Olyphant. It flows west-southwest for several tenths of a mile, entering Throop and flowing into a valley. It then turns south before turning south-southwest and entering Dunmore. It then turns west-southwest for nearly a mile before entering Dunmore Reservoir Number One. From the southwestern edge of the reservoir, it flows west-northwest for several tenths of a mile, crossing Interstate 380. The stream then turns southeast and flows down a steep slope to its confluence with Roaring Brook. Little Roaring Brook joins Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth. Tributaries Little Roaring Brook has no named tributaries. However, it does have three unnamed tributaries. ==Hydrology== Little Roaring Brook has a high load of sediment. There is also trash and debris along it in some reaches. The peak annual discharge of Little Roaring Brook has a 10 percent chance of reaching 750 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 1720 cubic feet per second and 1 percent chance of reaching 2350 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 5150 cubic feet per second. ==Geography and geology== The elevation near the mouth of Little Roaring Brook is above sea level. The elevation near the stream's source is between above sea level. There is a waterfall known as Little Roaring Brook Falls in the watershed of Little Roaring Brook in Dunmore. The channel of the stream is an open concrete channel in some reaches. In other places, it has a natural shallow bank. The highly stony Norwich and Chippewa silt and loams are found along Little Roaring Brook. They occur there on 0 to 8 percent slopes. The surficial geology in the vicinity of the stream's lower reaches mainly includes urban land heavily disrupted by cut and fill, a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone, conglomeratic sandstone, and shale. Further upstream, there is no urban land, but the surficial geology still includes bedrock, as well as surface mining land. Near the headwaters, there is Wisconsinan Till, surface mining land, and a patch of wetland. Little Roaring Brook flows through eight pipes whose diameters range from . ==Watershed and biology== The watershed of Little Roaring Brook has an area of . The watershed is mostly in Dunmore and Throop, but small areas are in Olyphant and Roaring Brook Township. The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Olyphant. There are two reservoirs on Little Roaring Brook: the 24-acre Dunmore Reservoir Number One and the 40-acre Marshwood Reservoir. Additionally, the 9-acre Dunmore Reservoir Number Three is situated on an unnamed tributary of the stream. In the late 1970s, the Dunmore Number Three Dam was judged to be in fair condition. The Dunmore Number One Dam was judged to be in good condition around that time. The riparian area along Little Roaring Brook is forested. Major roads in the watershed include Interstate 84, Interstate 380, and US Route 6. Marshwood Road is situated to the north of the stream. There are several homes along this part of the road, but none are historic. Land uses in the watershed include neighborhood commercial. A 1908 report described the watershed as being sparsely populated with rugged terrain. There is a strip mined area along the stream in Throop. In the same borough, the stream is near a site with secondary woods in a disturbed area. ==History== Little Roaring Brook was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199058. The stream is also known as Little Roaring Creek. This name appears on Patton's Philadelphia and Suburbs Street and Road Map, which was published in 1984. A site along Little Roaring Brook has prehistoric archaeological significance. At least one of the reservoirs on Little Roaring Brook was planned as early as 1908. The purpose of this reservoir was to complete the Dunmore system. A reservoir on Little Roaring Brook was owned by the Dunmore Water Company in the early 1900s. The Pennsylvania Coal Company historically had land along the stream. A concrete culvert bridge carrying Interstate 84 over Little Roaring Brook was built in 1961 and repaired in 1996. It is and is located in Dunmore. A waste management system and flood control project on Little Roaring Brook and Roaring Brook was authorized in 1996 for a cost of $1,150,000. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that the borough of Dunmore include protection of Little Roaring Brook in their zoning plans. A greenway along the stream has been proposed. ==See also== *Rock Bottom Creek, next tributary of Roaring Brook going upstream *List of rivers of Pennsylvania *List of tributaries of the Lackawanna River ==References *Google Street View image of Little Roaring Brook Category:Rivers of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of Roaring Brook (Lackawanna River) Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Little Roaring Brook"},{"id":"46353440","text":"The Johnson Barn is a historic barn in rural Washington County, Arkansas, southwest of the city of Fayetteville.

It was released in 1982 by U.S. Games. It involves a player moving through a maze and avoiding enemies. ==Gameplay== The player moves downward through a continuously vertically-scrolling maze with vertical symmetry, trying to get as far as possible while avoiding enemies that move across the screen; if the player contacts a monster, they die and the game is over. The maze will continually scroll upwards on the screen, and while the player can move in any direction, this scrolling action may leave the player stuck in a dead-end; if the player's position scrolls off-screen, then the game is also over. The player can collect a \\"make-break\\" item, represented by a large dot, that can remove a wall space and allow the player to proceed out of a dead- end. In two-player mode, both players are in the maze at once. ==Legacy== A representation of the maze generation scheme for two rows of a typical maze from Entombed. The algorithm uses five neighboring squares (bold outline) that are either open (white) or a wall (grey) to generate the state of the next square (bold 0 or 1) in a semi-random manner. The mechanics of how Entombed generated its mazes have been the subject of academic research, as the maze data itself, if stored directly, was too large to fit within the hardware limitations of the console, even with the left/right symmetry of the mazes. Researchers evaluated the game's ROM and discovered that the mazes were generated on-the-fly by the game using the state of five adjacent squares of the maze (wall or open) already generated to determine the next part of the maze through a lookup table, including potentially a random state. Sometimes the table generates mazes that would be unsolvable without the \\"make-break\\" item. The researchers spoke to Sidley, who said the algorithm came from another unnamed programmer, but Sidley himself could not decipher why it worked. Sidley said to the researchers of this programmer, \\"He told me it came upon him when he was drunk and whacked out of his brain.\\" ==See also== *Maze generation algorithm ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Interview with Steven Boykey Sidley re: Entombed ==External links== *Entombed at Atari Mania *Entombed at AtariAge * Category:1982 video games Category:Atari 2600 games Category:Atari 2600-only games Category:Maze games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Zombie video games ","title":"Entombed (Atari 2600)"},{"id":"46353495","text":"Datuk Jimmy Wong Sze Phin () is a Malaysian politician who served as the State Assistant Minister to the Chief Minister of Sabah in the Sabah Heritage Party (WARISAN) administration under former Chief Minister Shafie Apdal from May 2018 to collapse of the WARISAN administration due to its defeat in the 2020 Sabah state election in September 2020.

Taylor served in the Oklahoma House of Representatives from 1984 to 1992. Before running for office, Taylor taught AP government at Norman High School from 1979 to 1984. While in the House, she was Chairman of the Education Committee and Appropriations Sub-Committee on Education. She was a principal author of numerous landmark education bills involving both Higher Education and Public Schools. She also authored legislation concerning health care for children and family leave. While in office she was an adjunct professor at Oklahoma Baptist University and the University of Oklahoma. After leaving office, Taylor was Vice President of Academic Affairs at the University Center of Tulsa (which later became Rogers State University) and upon retirement was designated the title of Distinguished Professor of political science at Rogers State University. ==Early life and education== Taylor was born in 1957 to parents Frank and JoAnne Miller in Norman, Oklahoma and is the oldest of five children. Her parents were also born in Norman, and the majority of her family lived in the area. During her childhood, Taylor enjoyed spending time at the library, the Museum of Natural History (in its original building before Taylor was able to author legislation that funded a new building for the museum), and her grandparents' farm. From the first to fifth grade, Taylor attended a private Catholic school, but finished her education through the Norman public school system and graduated from Norman High School. After graduating from high school, Taylor attended the University of Oklahoma and obtained her bachelor's in American History and went back later to get her teaching certificate. While attending OU she was a member of the marching band “The Pride of Oklahoma.” ==Career== After graduation, Taylor was offered a job as a teacher at Norman High School. She took over one of her favorite teacher's job as the AP government teacher at the high school. Mrs. Viola Smith, Taylor's predecessor, had timed her retirement so that Taylor would be able to assume her position when she left. While teaching at Norman, Taylor became involved with helping and volunteering on campaigns of pro-education candidates. She also lobbied at the capitol on behalf of education. Taylor taught at the high school from 1979 until 1984. In the summer of 1984, she was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to spend the summer studying politics & government in the Middle East. Around the same time, incumbent Cleta Deatherage decided not to run for reelection for State Representative in Taylor's district. Many encouraged Taylor to run for the seat and after discussing it over with the principal at Norman High School, she was given a leave of absence in order to campaign. Paula Roberts, also a teacher at Norman High School, served as campaign manager (and held the position for all four of Taylor's campaigns). Taylor's campaign was endorsed by the Oklahoma Education Association and many other groups Although she had to turn down the Fulbright Scholarship, she was rewarded by being elected in November. ==House of Representatives (1984-1992)== Education Legislation Running on a platform of education, Taylor was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1984. While she was in the House, Taylor was the primary author of legislation establishing state matching grants for private contributions to higher education institutions to endow professorships that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars being donated to Oklahoma institutions. Believing that those who excel in academic excellence should receive the same scholarship opportunities as those who score touchdowns on the football field, she authored what became known as the Academic Scholars Legislation which gave a full scholarship for tuition, fees, books along with room and board to students who obtained a certain score on the ACT, SAT or similar tests. She was also the primary co-author and floor manager of HB 1017, the landmark education funding and reform bill that brought Oklahoma out of the bottom of education funding while for the first time equalizing funding so that every child had the same amount of operating dollars following him or her regardless of which school was attended. The bill lowered class size, brought the greatest leap in teachers’ salaries in state history, and strengthened curriculum among other reforms. Additionally, Taylor successfully advocated for a statewide Higher Education bond issue that contained funding for a new building for the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. Taylor was the principal author of legislation impacting education in the area of environmental and geography education programs, scholarship and endowed chair programs, increased funding for higher education, training and standards for Boards of Regents, college internship programs, and multiple education reforms that increased funding for pre-K through high school. Additionally, Health Care legislation Concerned about Oklahoma's failure to provide adequate prenatal care to poor women, Taylor authored legislation creating the establishment of a statewide prenatal care program, as well as Soonercare, a health insurance program for children. She also authored legislation creating the state's first family leave program for state employees and authored legislation that helped to create SoonerStart, a collaborative multi-agency early intervention program for children with disabilities. Taylor's dedication to the public was proven through her efforts while she was in office. In her time at the House of Representatives, she was able to rise to leadership in numerous committees including Chairing the Education Committee and the Education Subcommittee of the Appropriations and Budget Committee. ==After Legislation== Taylor left the legislature in 1992 to begin her post-legislative career at the University Center of Tulsa, which later became Rogers University and is now Rogers State University. She also married and started a family with Stratton Taylor after her departure. The two moved to Claremore, OK, where Stratton lived. Since 2000 Dr. Taylor has taught political science at Rogers State University. In 2015, Taylor was selected as Teacher of the Year by the Oklahoma Political Science Association for her work at RSU. In addition to her role as a professor at the university, Dr. Taylor administered the President's Leadership Class and the Washington Center Internship Program, which places students in internships located in Washington D.C.

Ansah made his way through the club's youth system, making his debut for their under-18 side at the age of just 14 and later impressing in the NextGen Series youth competition. On 4 December 2012, with Arsenal already qualified for the next round of the competition, Ansah was named as a substitute for the club's Champions League group stage match against Olympiacos but remained on the bench during a 2–1 defeat. He suffered a tear of his ACL in July 2013 that ruled him out for eight months, the second time he had suffered the injury, but returned to the development squad in March 2014, scoring in a 5–3 win over West Ham United. At the end of the 2013–14 season, Ansah was released by Arsenal without making a first-team appearance. Charlton Athletic Ansah subsequently joined Football League Championship side Charlton Athletic on a two-year deal, working with under-21 development manager Jason Euell. In March 2015, he joined Football League Two side Plymouth Argyle until the end of the 2014–15 season, scoring on his debut for the club, the third goal in a 3–0 win over Cheltenham Town. He then scored Plymouth Argyle's first goal of their League 2 Play-off tie with Wycombe Wanderers at Home Park, his goal making the scoreline 3–1 in Wycombe's favour at the time. He made a total of 10 appearances for the club, scoring twice. In August 2015, Ansah returned to League Two, joining Newport County on an initial one-month loan deal, making his debut in a 3–2 defeat to Leyton Orient. At the end of that loan period he returned to Charlton before rejoining Newport County for a second loan on 9 October 2015. On 24 October 2015 he scored his first two goals for Newport in a 4–1 win over Bristol Rovers. He returned to Charlton when his loan ended on 12 December 2015. Woking On 3 August 2016, Ansah joined Surrey-based side Woking for the 2016–17 National League season. Three days later, Ansah made his Woking debut in a 3–1 home defeat against Lincoln City, playing the full 90 minutes. On 9 August 2016, Ansah scored his first Woking goal in a 2–2 draw with Solihull Moors, netting Woking's second. After suffering a long-term knee injury in October 2016, Ansah was forced out of the Woking team until March 2017. Returning in the Cards' 2–1 defeat against North Ferriby United, replacing Ismail Yakubu in the 73rd minute. On 23 May 2017, it was announced that Ansah would leave Woking upon the expiry of his current deal in June 2017. Hythe Town Following his release from Woking, Ansah had a spell in Sunday league football, before joining Isthmian League Division One South side, Hythe Town. He went onto score twice on his Hythe debut during their league tie against East Grinstead Town, which resulted in a 3–2 victory. By March 2018, Ansah registered his tenth and eleventh goals of the season in the space of three months, inspiring a two-goal comeback against Whyteleafe. Following the conclusion of the 2017–18 campaign, Ansah registered his tally to 20 goals, after netting thirteen times in ten consecutive games. On 6 June 2018, Ansah agreed a new one-year deal with Hythe. Herne Bay Despite interest from Football League and National League sides, Ansah opted to join fellow Isthmian League side, Herne Bay. ==International career== Ansah has represented England at both Under-16 and Under-17 level. In 2012, at the age of 18, Ansah was called up to the Ghana under-20 side for the first time but both Ansah and his father Andy blasted the Ghana Football Association stating that they had not been notified of the call-up and had discovered it after a family friend had messaged to congratulate him. Ansah later committed his international future to Ghana and, the following year, he was called up to the provisional under-20 training squad to train with a view to being included in the squad for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup but was later omitted from the final squad. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"3\\"Charlton Athletic 2014–15 Championship 0000000000 - 2015–16 Championship 0000000000 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Plymouth Argyle (loan) 2014–15 League Two 8100002Appearance(s) in Football League Trophy1102 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Newport County (loan) 2015–16 League Two 132200010162 - rowspan=\\"1\\"Woking 2016–17 National League 11100colspan=\\"2\\"—00111 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Hythe Town 2017–18 Isthmian League Division One South 1920colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—1920 - 2018–19 Isthmian League South East Division 362622colspan=\\"2\\"—4Two appearances and two goals in Alan Turvey Trophy, two appearances and one goal in FA Trophy34231 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total!!55!!46!!2!!2!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!4!!3!!61!!51 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Herne Bay 2019–20 Isthmian League South East Division 282433colspan=\\"2\\"—5Four appearances and one goal in Alan Turvey Trophy, one appearance in FA Trophy13728 - 2020–21 Isthmian League South East Division 0010colspan=\\"2\\"—0010 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total!!28!!24!!4!!3!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!5!!1!!38!!28 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Total !115!!75!!8!!5!!0!!0!!12!!5!!136!!84 } ==References * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Sidcup Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Newport County A.F.C. players Category:Woking F.C. players Category:Hythe Town F.C. players Category:Herne Bay F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Isthmian League players Category:Ghanaian footballers Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Zak Ansah"},{"id":"46353624","text":"Mat Vairo is an American actor.

The Protestant Action Society (PAS); Edinburgh's far-right Protestant grouping which had inspired a sectarian riot the previous year, won 31% of the vote and got 5 new members elected.Page 51, Protestant Political Parties: A Global Survey The PAS had won 24% in the previous years election.http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/gavin-bowd- reveals-some-uncomfortable-truths-in-fascist-scotland-1-2881250 In Glasgow in 1933 a similarly strong showing by that city's insurgent Protestant party had split the Moderate vote, allowing in a Labour council for the first time in Glasgow's history. In contrast, despite the PAS's strong showing in Edinburgh, the dominant Progressives enjoyed such overwhelming majority over Labour that the PAS could hardly dent it. Labour, in turn, were relegated to third place. Edinburgh Corporation at the time was made up of 71 members, of whom 69 were elected. Following the election the Corporation was composed of 46 Progressives/Moderates, 15 Labour, 8 Protestant Action, and 2 independents.

The Moline Swedish Lutheran Cemetery was established in Elroy, Texas in 1897. It was originally an annex to the Gethsemane Lutheran Church of Austin, Texas. The Swedish population began to move away from the area in the 1930s, and by the 1950s, the congregation was too small to sustain the church. The church was dismantled after closing in 1955. The remaining congregation became the charter members of the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Austin, TexasPitman, Suzanne & Ronnie. \\"Moline Swedish Lutheran Cemetery\\". Austin Genealogical Society, 2006. and many of its members became stewards of the site. ==Swedish settlement in Elroy, Texas== The Swedish migration to central Texas was largely fueled by the work of Swante Magnus Swenson who came to America in 1836. Swenson eventually settled in Austin, Texas and established numerous successful business endeavors with his uncle Swante Palm. After establishing the SMS Ranches, Swenson became one of the largest landowners in Texas and was encouraged by Samuel Houston to recruit more Swedish immigrants to come work the land holdings. Swenson traveled by ship back and forth to Sweden 16 times beginning in 1848, recruiting his countrymen to come and join his agricultural efforts in the central Texas region. In Elroy, Texas, roughly 70 families of Swedish immigrants established schools, farms, cemeteries, and three churches including the Moline Swedish Lutheran Church (1897), the Swedish Evangelical Free Church (1901), and the Swedish Baptist Church (1903). This \\"Swedish Pipeline,\\" which primarily ran from Småland to Galveston, slowed greatly by 1910 but the Swedish influence on the region is still visible today.Scott, Larry Emil. \\"The Swedish Texans\\". University of Texas Institute of Texan Cultures at San Antonio, 1990. ==Parsonage== In 1908, the women of the Moline Swedish Lutheran Church organized and raised funds to buy the lot next to the church and built a parsonage for the pastor and his family. The parsonage also served as a venue for weddings and community gatherings. This building is still standing near the cemetery. ==Friends of Moline Lutheran Cemetery== The Friends of Moline Lutheran Cemetery (FMLC) is a nonprofit organization which formed in 2012 to revitalize and maintain the cemetery. This organization works to protect the unique history contained within the Moline Swedish Lutheran Cemetery and raise funds to ensure its enduring accessibility to the public. A grant from the Swedish Council of America has helped fund the FMLC's goal to build a kiosk and information board to help visitors understand the history and geography of the cemetery. Other contributors to the restoration of this cemetery include the Burdine Johnson Foundation, the Gesthemane Lutheran Church and Prince of Peace Lutheran Church of Austin, the University of Texas at Austin School of Information, the Barbro Osher Pro Suecia Foundation, and the Swedish Women's Education Association. ==Adjoining cemetery== In 2013, the FMCL discovered an overgrown addition to the Moline Swedish Lutheran Cemetery which had been neglected since the 1960s.Mashhood, Farzad. \\"Local nonprofit tries to restore 106-year-old Swedish Cemetery in Elroy\\". Austin American Statesman, 2013. This Adjoining Cemetery contains the mostly unmarked resting places of domestic, farm, and cotton gin workers. The damaged, concrete graves were barely visible over the brush and vegetation, and the metal markers and wooden crosses were completely obscured. Research by the FMLC helped identify one name among the markers. Cruz Reynero was born in Mexico in 1914. He and five of his siblings came to Elroy to work at the Swedish Farmers' Cotton Gin. Reynero died at age 19 and was buried in the Adjoining Cemetery, his grave marked with a large, wooden cross. The cross was eventually lost to overgrowth during the cemetery's abandonment, but uncovered and restored by the FMLC in 2013. Another identifiable grave in the Adjoining Cemetery is the granite obelisk raised in memory of Alfonso Torres (1890-1911). Mariano and Delphina Torres, the parents of Alfonzo, came to the United States in 1875 and raised ten children. Alfonso and his siblings all died before age 25 with the exception of Rosendo Torres (1885-1964) who lived to be 79. The obelisk marking Alfonso's grave was broken into three pieces during the cemetery's abandonment and restored by the FMLC in 2013. ==References== Category:Lutheran cemeteries Category:Cemeteries in Texas ","title":"Moline Swedish Lutheran Cemetery"},{"id":"46353716","text":"Marcelino Iglesias Ricou (born 16 April 1951) is a Spanish politician and member of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party.

The name survives as an electoral ward of Haverfordwest. The Western Cleddau forms the parish's western boundary, and the Hiog, a tributary of the Cleddau, the eastern boundary. ==Name== The origin of the village's name is possibly linked to a family named Prendergast, whose earliest-known ancestor was Maurice, a Norman. The name may be Norman or Flemish; scholars differ, and there are arguments for either. ==History== Parish Prendergast (Prendergest) appears on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. The parish, originally placed in the ancient Hundred of Dungleddy by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542, and before that in the pre-Norman cantref of Deugleddyf, was considered a suburb of Haverfordwest as long ago as the mid-19th century, at which time it had 1,105 inhabitants, but was still referred to as a village. In 1872, the parish extended to , and in the 150 years between 1801 and 1951 the population almost doubled from 814 to 1,543. In 1831, agriculture was a minor industry, with most people employed in retail and handicrafts. Under the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832, the urban part of Prendergast33 householdersbecame part of Haverfordwest. Parish church The parish church of St David is a Grade II listed building, and has many memorials to distinguished local people. It was described in 1833 as \\"an ancient and venerable structure, in the early style of English architecture, and in good repair\\", but by 1872 was \\"in disrepair\\". It was rebuilt in the late 19th century, but retains its late-mediaeval tower. Chapel A Welsh-speaking Baptist Chapel was established in 1858 to serve north Pembrokeshire people settling in Haverfordwest. Welsh-only services ceased in 1880, and the chapel was enlarged in 188891. Prendergast Mill Listed bridge and ruined Prendergast Mill in 2007 About 1786, the 3-storey cotton millpossibly the only one in south Wales, or at least the largest, with 1,512 spindlesbegan an industrial complex on the Cleddau River. It was converted to a paper mill in 1816, establishing the paper-making industry in Haverfordwest, but by the end of the century was disused. In ruins by the 20th century, it was partially demolished in 1986. The bridge over the mill racenow no longer running was constructed in 1812, is a Grade II listed structure and is still in use. Rebecca riots With few turnpike tollgates in Pembrokeshire escaping from the Rebecca rioters of the early 1840s, Prendergast was no exception; on 6 April 1843, about 24 men destroyed the tollgate on the Fishguard road. In the spring of 1844, two men were convicted of unlawful assembly in the previous August, and sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment each. ==Education== A primary school was established in the village in 1876. Sir Thomas Picton School was established in 1954, and closed in 2018 as part of a school merger. ==Notable people== Maurice de Prendergast was a Norman knight (fl. 1169–1174) who participated in Norman invasion of Ireland, launched from Pembrokeshire.Expugnatio Hibernica:The Conquest of Ireland, p. 293, 294, 295, 296-97, 298, 299, 301, 302, 307, 308, 321, by Giraldus Cambrensis, ed. A.B. Scott and F. X. Martin, 1978. The Stepney family were prominent in Prendergast from the mid-1500s to mid-1700s. Their seat, Prendergast House, was in ruins by the late 18th century. ==Today== The present-day parish of Prendergast with Rudbaxton is in the Diocese of St Davids. Prendergast now includes the trading estates of Withybush, and Withybush General Hospital, as well as some new and older residential properties and a school, and is divided approximately north-south by a spur of the main A40 road into Haverfordwest town centre, and northeast-southwest by the B4329 road from Cardigan.Ordnance Survey Explorer Map OL36: South Pembrokeshire, 2009 There are several other listed buildings in the parish. ==References *Further historical information and sources on GENUKI Category:Haverfordwest Category:Villages in Pembrokeshire ","title":"Prendergast, Pembrokeshire"},{"id":"46353742","text":"Siege is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and HTTPS load testing and web server benchmarking utility developed by Jeffrey Fulmer.

Her novels are international bestsellers and have been translated into a number of languages. Her debut novel, The Dressmaker, was adapted into a film starring Kate Winslet in the lead role of Tilly Dunnage. Ham has written short stories for various Australian publications, including Meanjin, The Age, and The Bulletin. ==Early life== Ham was born and raised in Jerilderie, Australia. Talking about her childhood Ham said, \\"Being a farmer's daughter, I had a fabulous childhood – swimming in creeks and irrigation channels, riding a horse behind a slow moving flock of ewes, rousabouting, cutting wood and setting the fire after school every day in winter, learning to drive aged nine so I could help with Bathurst burr cutting and other slow-moving country driving tasks.\\" She attended Finley High School for two years. Ham's brothers still run the family farms in Jerilderie. Later she attended St Margaret's School, Melbourne, along with Sue Maslin and finished her secondary education in 1972. ==Stage and radio plays== After completing her secondary education, Ham travelled overseas and on her return took admission in Deakin University (then Victoria College). She completed a Bachelor of Education majoring in Drama and Literature in 1989. On the request of her friend, she started writing stage and radio plays. She wrote four plays but soon find out that \\"(she) didn't want to write plays because I didn't like the theatre thing\\". ==RMIT and accidental novelist== Ham has described herself as an \\"accidental novelist\\". In 1996, she enrolled in the writing programme of RMIT University but on her arrival she found that it was already full. As she was leaving, novelist Antoni Jach advised her to take a novel course instead. In novel-writing class, she got an assignment of \\"a 500-word synopsis of her book\\", which she recalled \\"I had an idea and started writing it. Then you had to hand in 3,000 words, and then you had to hand in 10,000 words, and I had 30,000 words. It was only three weeks before I realised that this was the best 'accident' that had ever occurred to me.\\" Ham completed this novel in three years. She graduated from RMIT with an Advanced Diploma of Arts in Professional Writing and Editing in 1996, and a Master of Arts in Creative Writing in 2007. ==The Dressmaker== On 1 January 2000, Ham's debut novel The Dressmaker was published by Duffy & Snellgrove. Film adaptation Ham initially sold the film rights of The Dressmaker in the mid 2000s and wrote a screenplay, but the project never took off. Producer Sue Maslin had been at school with Roaslie Ham and reconnected with the author after the initial project was shelved. Maslin optioned the rights of the novel in 2009 and brought Jocelyn Moorhouse on board to direct and write the screenplay. Kate Winslet and Judy Davis were cast in the roles of Myrtle \\"Tilly\\" and Molly Dunnage respectively in August 2013. Ham herself made an appearance as an extra. The film opened at the number 1 spot at the Australian and New Zealand box offices and became the second highest-grossing Australian film of 2015 and eleventh highest-grossing film of all time at the Australian box office. The film won multiple awards as well. ==Summer at Mount Hope== Ham released her sophomore novel Summer at Mount Hope in 2005. She also wrote the novel, like her debut The Dressmaker, while studying a creative writing course at RMIT University. The novel drew strong comparison to Jane Austen's works, The Sydney Morning Herald said in its review that \\"Ham tries hard to interject some social commentary into the story by including all these elements into her novel but Summer at Mount Hope is more unabashed romance set against a backdrop of grapes, dust and drought than a historical document. This is light summer reading; a period-drama with the requisite sunny, fluffy-cloud ending.\\" ==There Should be More Dancing== There Should be More Dancing is the third novel written by Ham, released in 2011. The novel revolves around a woman in her seventies, looking back at her life and reflecting on \\"what went wrong\\". The Sydney Morning Herald said that, \\"Ham's skill in disguising her informed eloquence on a serious subject behind sparkling, entertaining prose. Senior citizens will wave their walkers in relief and delight: help is at hand.\\" ==The Year of the Farmer== Released in 2018, ==Recurring themes and background setting == All of Ham's novels have been set in small communities of Australia. She has admitted that if she wrote an urban novel, her style of writing would be changed with the change in landscape, which she does not want to do. In all her novels, revenge, gossip, love, betrayal, small communities, isolation, treachery, manipulation and human nature are the common themes. ==Personal life== Ham worked as a nurse for 21 years until October 2005, when the nursing home she worked at closed down. She is also a part-time Literature teacher at Trinity College at the University of Melbourne, and RMIT University TAFE. Ham and her husband Ian McLay, a stage builder, live in Brunswick, Melbourne. ==Novels== *The Dressmaker (2000) *Summer at Mount Hope (2005) *There Should be More Dancing (2011) *The Year of the Farmer (2018) ==ReferencesCategory:1955 births Category:21st- century Australian novelists Category:21st-century Australian women writers Category:Australian dramatists and playwrights Category:Australian women novelists Category:Living people Category:RMIT University alumni Category:Writers from New South Wales ","title":"Rosalie Ham"},{"id":"46353865","text":"Max Hollein, former Director of Schirn Kunsthalle, Städel Museum and Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung, at the opening of the Monet exhibition in the Städel Museum in 2015.

He studied art history at the University of Vienna and business administration at the Vienna University of Economics. During this period, he also free-lanced for the business section of the national daily newspaper “Der Standard”. In 1995, following the successful completion of his studies with two master's degrees, one in art history and the other in business administration, he moved to New York City to take on the position of project director of exhibitions at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. From 1996 until the end of 2000, he worked closely with Guggenheim director Thomas Krens, initially as “Executive Assistant to the Director“ and, from 1998 onward, as “Chief of Staff and Manager of European Relations“ responsible for key projects such as the establishment of the exhibition halls “Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin” and “Guggenheim Las Vegas”.

The depth, quality and quantity of the programme has been accompanied by a significant increase in corporate funding. Among the highlights of the programme have been exhibitions such as “Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture”, “Henri Matisse: Drawing with Scissors”, “Yves Klein”, “The Naked Truth: Klimt, Schiele, Kokoschka and Other Scandals”, “Women Impressionists” and “Edvard Munch. The Modern Eye”.

Städel Museum At the Städel Museum, Max Hollein introduced a wide spectrum of new exhibition formats: from small “cabinet exhibitions” on such artists as Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Martin Kippenberger and others, to the “Constellations” series with works of contemporary art from the museum’s holdings. Under his direction, the Städel realised major exhibitions on the Old Masters, including “Cranach the Elder”, “The Master of Flémalle and Rogier van der Weyden” and “Botticelli” as well as significant retrospectives on modern masters such as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Max Beckmann. Under Max Hollein, special emphasis was also given to the development of the collection: between 2006 and 2012 more than 1,500 works were added to the collection. Among the most significant projects worthy of mention in this context was the major expansion of the Städel Museum completed in 2012 which doubled the institution’s gallery space and created a new wing for the presentation of art since 1945. Both the architecture as well as the significant collection development were hailed by the public and the media. More than 50 percent of the 52 million euro construction costs were raised through private sources in an unprecedented fundraising campaign. The Städel was honoured as “Museum of the Year 2012” by the German art critics association AICA in 2012.Aica, accessed on 8 April 2015 In the same year, the museum recorded its highest ever attendance numbers, with 447,395 visitors.

The various departments from Old Egypt and Antiquities, through Middle Ages, Renaissance, Baroque to Neoclassicism as well as the “studioli” on the top floor of the museum villa were newly installed under his tenure and reopened in 2008 with an entirely new colour and lighting concept. Funding for this major renovation came to a large extent from private and corporate sources. Exhibitions such as “Sahure – Death and Life of a Great Pharaoh”, “Gods in Colour ”, “Franz Xaver Messerschmidt” and “Jeff Koons: The Sculptor” were received with unprecedented success.

Hollein has successfully launched a contemporary art initiative, bringing the work of living artists into dialogue with the buildings and collections of the de Young Museum and Legion of Honor, with exhibitions by Urs Fischer and Sarah Lucas at the Legion of Honor and Carsten Nicolai and Leonardo Drew at the de Young museum. In January 2017, the institution announced a significant new addition to its collection of American art through the acquisition of 62 works by 22 contemporary African American artists, including Thornton Dial's Blood And Meat: Survival For the World (1992) and Lost Cows (2000–1), Joe Light's Dawn (1988), Jessie T.

Weinberg, Julián Zugazagoitia, Emilie Gordenker, Timothy Rub, and Taco Dibbits. In his new role, Hollein will report to Daniel H. Weiss, the president and chief executive of the Met. His appointment was supported by many in the art world; and criticized in three newspapers, The Guardian, The New York Times and The Observer for being the 10th white man appointed to the position at the Met, suggesting the institution's lack of diversity. Hollein shared his vision for the present and future role of encyclopedic museums, and outlined that he aims for The Met’s galleries and programming to present a range of perspectives on history and examine the intersection of cultures, rather than offer a singular, linear narrative. Hollein has also engaged in broader cultural debates as The Met’s Director, including penning an essay about the Museum’s leadership responsibilities in upholding the policies and practices for the acquisition of art and archaeological materials, and protecting cultural heritage around the globe. Early in his tenure, Hollein said he would focus on further injecting modern and contemporary art into The Met’s main Fifth Avenue building. He announced a comprehensive program to that effect, including site-specific commissions from contemporary artists Wangechi Mutu and Kent Monkman, as well as the debut presentation of a new video installation by contemporary artist Ragnar Kjartansson. The Museum also announced plans for a $70 million renovation of its galleries for the arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, as well as progress on previously announced plans to remodel its Modern Wing. In July 2019, the Museum reported that it had over 7 million visitors for a third year in a row. ==Other activities== Corporate boards * Deutsche Bank, Member of the Advisory Board (2006–2012)Members of the Advisory Board, 2006 Deutsche Bank.Members of the Advisory Board, 2012 Deutsche Bank.

One of the differences from the other species of Mandragora is that it has a stem, whereas they are stemless. Like all species of Mandragora, it contains tropane alkaloids, making it toxic. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine. ==Description== Mandragora caulescens is a perennial herbaceous plant with a thick root. There is considerable variability in the size and shape of its parts and in the colour of its flowers. Unlike other members of the genus Mandragora, it usually has a stem, long (sometimes up to ), making the plant as a whole usually tall. The leaves are mostly basal but are also found along the stem. They are up to long, including the stalk (petiole). The flowering period is from April or May to July or September, with fruits appearing until October. The flowers are borne singly on stalks (pedicels) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a lobed cup-shaped structure, often nearly as long as the petals. The petals are dark purple or yellow, similarly joined at the base with lobes about half their length of . The stamens are joined to the base of the petals, and vary considerably in length, with the anthers long. The fruit is a berry, greenish white to yellow in colour, up to across. The numerous seeds are yellow to light brown, long. ==Taxonomy== Mandragora caulescens was first described by Charles Baron Clarke in 1883. In 1978, division into four subspecies was proposed, but this has not been accepted by subsequent researchers. Mandragora tibetica, described in 1970, and Mandragora chinghaiensis, described in 1978, are also, , not considered to be sufficiently differentiated from M. caulescens, although the Flora of China says that \\"further study may lead to separation of independent taxa from the single species recognized here.\\" A molecular phylogenetic study found that M. caulescens (including M. chinghaiensis) is distinct from the remaining species within the genus, which form a separate clade. ==Distribution and habitat== Mandragora caulescens is a \\"Sino-Himalayan\\" species, native to Nepal, northern India (including Sikkim from where it was first described), Bhutan, Myanmar, and south-west China (south-east Qinghai, west Sichuan, east Xizang (Tibet), and north-west Yunnan). M. caulescens grows in open areas, such as grassland, moorland, pastures and stony slopes and screes, particularly among Rhododendron shrubs. It is found in the subalpine and alpine zones, at altitudes of . ==Toxicity and uses== All species of Mandragora contain highly biologically active alkaloids, tropane alkaloids in particular. The different parts of the plant contain different proportions and concentrations of alkaloids, with the roots generally having the highest concentration. Tropane alkaloids are potentially highly toxic. The roots of M. caulescens contain hyoscine and anisodamine, which are used medicinally in China. The dried roots of M. caulescens are used in Chinese herbal medicine, and in Yunnan and Xizang as a substitute for ginseng. ==References== Category:Solanoideae Category:Plants described in 1883 Category:Poisonous plants ","title":"Mandragora caulescens"},{"id":"46353950","text":"Labyrinths is a solo album by American jazz pianist Marilyn Crispell which was recorded live at the 1987 edition of the Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville and released on the Canadian Victo label.Marilyn Crispell Sessionography by Rick Lopez The CD edition adds a bonus track. ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Cook states \\"Labyrinths finds avant garde jazz pianist Marilyn Crispell balancing Cecil Taylor's cataclysmic and staunchly free piano style with her own melodic and spacious take on free improvisation.\\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz says that \\"What she creates here is logically formed, expressively coherent and quietly perfect.

Their style of hard rock takes its primary influence from classic rock and 90s grunge with elements of progressive rock and psychedelic rock. Rolling Stone has described the band as \\"a bit like an alternate universe where Janis Joplin fronted Led Zeppelin.\\" ==Biography== After forming in 2004 with Weaver on guitar, Mlny Parsonz on vocals and bass, and Jesse Stuber on drums, Royal Thunder self-released a self-titled EP in 2007, after which the band was signed to Relapse Records. Relapse released their first full-length album CVI in 2012, featuring new rhythm guitarist Josh Coleman. In a review of the album, AllMusic noted the band's unique sound combining the heavy side of 90s grunge, classic hard rock, and alternative rock. Stuber left the band and was replaced by Lee Smith, who had played on one track on CVI. Smith was soon replaced on drums by Evan DiPrima, and Coleman was replaced by guitarist Will Fiore, forming a lineup that would remain intact for the next six years. Royal Thunder released the album Crooked Doors in 2015. The album was themed around the breakup of the marriage between Parsonz and Weaver, with lyrics that critics compared to the Fleetwood Mac album Rumours. Some of the lyrics also described Parsonz's membership in a religious cult. Crooked Doors was noted as being more varied and progressive than its predecessor, while Parsonz's bluesy, waling voice and harrowing lyrics gained the attention of critics. The band's third album Wick was released in 2017 by Spinefarm Records. In a review of the album, Rolling Stone praised Parsonz for her \\"raspy, powerful wail [which] is one of the most moving voices in rock right now,\\" and noted that the band \\"has found its sound.\\" Classic Rock Magazine described the album as the band's most powerful yet, with \\"a shifting musical bedrock over which Parsonz... delivers the kind of vocals – sometimes armoured, sometimes vulnerable – that can emote, transport and illuminate in equal measure.\\" Drummer Evan DiPrima left the band on good terms in 2018 and was replaced by Kent Aberle. ==Discography== Studio albums *CVI (2012) *Crooked Doors (2015) *Wick (2017) EPs *Royal Thunder (2010) *CVI: A (2013) ==References * Category:American hard rock musical groups Category:Musical groups from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Musical groups established in 2004 Category:Atlanta Category:Musical quartets Category:2004 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Royal Thunder"},{"id":"46353964","text":"The Hole in the Horn Buck is officially listed as the second largest non- typical white-tailed deer of all time by the Boone and Crockett Club. The buck’s antlers score 328 2/8 non-typical points. The name of the buck derives from the mysterious hole in the buck’s right antler. It was later claimed by eyewitness, George Winters, to be caused from a piece of chain-link fence that pierced the antler shortly before it died. ==History== The Hole in the Horn buck was found dead along a railroad in Kent, Ohio in 1940. The buck was discovered by a group of railroad workers who had noticed the dead animal stuck under a nearby chain-link fence of the Ravenna Arsenal. The group of men freed the massive set of antlers. A shoulder mount of the buck was made by a local taxidermist and hung in the nearby Kent Canadian Club. It hung on the wall of the private hunting club for the next 40 years. The world-record class mount was virtually anonymous to the public and had never been officially scored until 1983. The antlers were scored for the first time on August 27, 1983 by Phil Wright, chairman of the Boone & Crockett Scoring Committee. The initial score came out to be 342 3/8 non-typical points. Based upon the initial score, North American Whitetail Magazine declared the buck as the new world-record in the December 1983 issue of their magazine. In 1986, the Hole in the Horn buck was re-measured by a judges’ panel of official Boone & Crockett scorers. The panel submitted a final score of 328 2/8, which placed it as the number two overall non-typical white-tailed deer, falling just short of the 333 7/8 measurement of the Missouri Monarch buck which was found in 1981 in St. Louis County, Missouri. The Hole in the Horn buck is one of the most famous bucks in the world due to its enormous size, mysterious hole in the right antler, and controversial score. The Hole in the Horn buck was part of the original Legendary Whitetails collection owned by Larry Huffman. Replica mounts of the Hole in the Horn buck exist in many outdoor retail stores, including Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops and also one hangs in the front office at Legendary Whitetails corporate headquarters. The original set of antlers was purchased with Larry’s entire collection of Legendary Whitetails by Bass Pro Shops in 2002. The mount now hangs in the King of Bucks collection in the American National Fish and Wildlife Museum in Springfield, Missouri. == See also == * James Jordan Buck * Boone and Crockett Club * White-tailed Deer * Deer hunting == External links == *Legendary Whitetails * Hole in the Horn Video * Mystery of the Hole in the Horn == References == Category:Deer hunting Category:Hunting records Category:Deer Category:Hunting ","title":"Hole in the Horn Buck"},{"id":"46353967","text":"William Fithian (April 7, 1799 – April 5, 1890) was an American physician and politician reputedly born in Cincinnati, Ohio.

A supporter of Abraham Lincoln, Fithian was appointed a Provost Marshal for the Civil War. ==Biography== William Fithian was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on April 7, 1799. One of America's Oldest Physicians, he trained as a printer, once typing a volume of enactments by the Ohio General Assembly. With the money made from that job, he studied medicine. After three years, he was awarded a diploma. Under the state laws at the time, this also entitled him to be an Associate Justice of the county court. In 1826, he decided to move west to Danville, Illinois, then a town of a few hundred people. He would remain in Danville until his death. Fithian became involved with the local Whig Party. He was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1834, serving a two-year term. In 1838, he successfully ran for the Illinois Senate and served a pair of four-year terms. While serving in the legislature, he was frequently consulted by other members for medical advice. Fithian hired Abraham Lincoln as an attorney six times. Lincoln also advised Fithian on real estate transactions in two Illinois counties. When the Republican Party was formed in 1856, Fithian was named a presidential elector. He campaigned on behalf of Lincoln for President in 1860. During the Civil War, Lincoln appointed Fithian the Provost Marshal of the 7th Congressional District of Illinois. He also served as a civilian doctor, working in the hospital in Leetown near the Battle of Pea Ridge. At the end of the conflict, he returned to the practice of medicine. Fithian married four times and had two surviving sons. He continued to practice medicine until about two years before his death at the age of 90 on April 5, 1890. Fithian's House in Danville was recognized with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 1975, and it is now the Vermilion County Museum.

The game was released on 19 February 2015 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. ==Gameplay== In the game players control, from a first person perspective, a robot with one wheel. They can throw balls at other players to knock them out or score points and catch them to eliminate the thrower; more points can be earned through creative or skillful hits such as ricocheting the ball. Players can also deflect balls with the one they are currently holding. Movement in the game is dependent on the player's momentum, with travel continuing in a direction even if the player isn't holding a directional key. The game has a Tron-like visual theme and disco music, and cosmetic items are available for customising the look of the player's robot. These items are tradeable for real currency on the Steam Workshop. The game has a number of different single and multiplayer modes and players are placed on leaderboards through playing. ==Development== Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball was developed by Erik Asmussen who began development in July 2013, starting with the game's movement mechanics, saying that he enjoyed playing with the skating-like movement before any other aspects of the game had been developed. The game was in a beta phase of development on Steam Early Access for a time before being released fully on 19 February 2015. Asmussen said that the Early Access period was important for the game's development, as he received feedback from players tweaking and testing the game's settings. He plans to include more features in the future, including a level editor and local multiplayer. ==Reception== Josiah Renaudin of GameSpot gave the game a rating of 6/10, saying it was fun to play and commenting positively on visual style and number of game modes available. However he said that he felt the game didn't provide much incentive for continuing to play and that it was hard to correctly predict a throw's trajectory. Thomas Ella of Hardcore Gamer rated the game 4/5, describing it as \\"one of the best, most fun, well-crafted multiplayer games available right now\\" but expressed disappointment at the low number of online players. ==References * Category:2015 video games Category:Dodgeball video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games ","title":"Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball"},{"id":"46354062","text":"Tim Wilson (born 12 May 1961) is an English animator and former politician.

A widespread search was promptly conducted in the Wokingham area, involving both police officers and British Army soldiers, but no trace of Tildesley was ever discovered. As part of the investigation, a national poster campaign was launched, with one displayed in every police station in the country. Tildesley's disappearance was publicised in the local Wokingham Times and also featured prominently in national newspapers. The Times, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror all covered the story, and the case appeared in ITV's Thames News. The disappearance was mentioned on the first ever episode of BBC Crimewatch UK in 1984 and a full reconstruction was aired on the same programme a year later. Despite a huge public response, however, these efforts brought little concrete evidence. In 1989, Tildesley's disappearance was linked to the Operation Orchid investigation into missing children. As part of this operation, in 1990, it emerged that on the night he disappeared, Tildesley had been abducted, drugged, tortured, raped and murdered by a London-based paedophile gang, led by Sidney Cooke. Another man named Leslie Bailey was charged with murder in 1991 and the following year was given two life sentences. He was murdered in prison in 1993.Operation Orchid (Aug '89 – Oct '92) A memorial service was held and a memorial bench was placed at the entrance to the fairground site. A headstone was also placed in a nearby burial ground. Tildesley's body has never been found and the murder is Wokingham's most notorious unsolved crime. Thames Valley Police initially thought his body was buried within a mile of Wellington Road in Wokingham, the location of the fair from which he was abducted, but they now believe that his body was probably buried in a shallow grave on abandoned farmland.Paedophile's confession opens missing Mark file (19.12.90) ==Background and disappearance== The location of Berkshire within the United Kingdom Mark Tildesley The entrance to Rose Court, off Rose Street, where the Tildesleys lived Mark Anthony Tildesley was born on 31 August 1976 in Berkshire to John Tildesley and Lavinia Rachel Gwladys Tildesley. Tildesley had a brother, Christopher, who was born in 1963, and a sister, Christina (born 1959), who had moved out of the family home to live in nearby Finchampstead with her husband, Ted, and their daughter, Mary, who was born in 1981. The Tildesleys lived at 1 Rose Court, off Rose Street, in Wokingham town centre. It was a combination of a small semi-detached cottage and an adjoining bungalow annexe (the bungalow annexe has since been demolished and re-built as a separate house called 1a Rose Court , leaving the original cottage as a mid-terrace). Tildesley was a Year 3 pupil of the Palmer C of E Junior School (renamed All Saints CE (Aided) Primary School in 2009) in Norreys Avenue in Wokingham. Half-term holiday On 25 May 1984, the Palmer Junior School had broken up for its summer half-term holiday. The Frank Ayers Fun Fair, which came to the Carnival Field off Wellington Road in Wokingham four times a year (now the site of the indoor swimming pool which opened in 1992 and now forms part of the Carnival Leisure Park),CARNIVAL POOL LEISURE Wokingham RG40 2AF had come again during that holiday week.How can they call this justice? (9.3.98) Tildesley was desperate to go but he did not have enough money to do so. His pocket money was only 30p a week, so he supplemented this by putting trolleys from Tesco in Denmark Street (now an Argos and a Cleaver restaurant)Former Tesco Denmark Street Wokingham site back to where they belonged, thus collecting their customers' abandoned 10p deposits.How can they call this justice? (9.3.98) Frank Ayers Fun Fair At the end of the week, on the afternoon of 1 June 1984, Tildesley had met a man outside the Candy Shop in Denmark Street (which has also since closed and which was located 20 yards up from the then Tesco site) who gave him a 50p coin to buy some sweets with. The shop assistant who had served Tildesley many times before, Margaret Hickman, thought it was odd as he usually only paid in 10p pieces. The man said that he was going to the fair later that day and that he would pay for him to go on the dodgems that evening.Death at the fair (23.10.92) After eating dinner, at just after 5:30 pm, Tildesley left his home at Number 1 Rose Court, off Rose Street, on his most treasured possession, a second-hand gold Raleigh Tomahawk bike, to make the half-a-mile journey to the fair, which would open at 6pm that evening. He promised to be back home by 7:30 pm, saying \\"Don't worry mum, I won't be late\\". On his way to the fair, he met with two of his friends who were in the town at the time. However, they wanted to go back home first and then go to the fair later so Tildesley decided to go to the fair alone immediately. This was the last time anyone who knew Tildesley well saw him alive. Reported missing At 7:30 pm, the time at which Tildesley had promised to return home, he had still not arrived. At 8:00 pm, his parents went down to the fair to find him. However, all they could find was his bike chained to railings near to the entrance of the Carnival Field where the fair was being held. Having spent an hour searching around the fairground site to no avail, Tildesley's parents returned home with his bike, to find his brother Christopher watching television but no trace of their missing son. At 10:00 pm, Lavinia Tildesley phoned the local police, to report Tildesley missing and to ask if they had heard anything, but they had not and they recommended she phone back in an hour. In the meantime, she phoned his sister Christina in Finchampstead, and Christina's husband Ted also went over to the Carnival Field to search for him without any success. ==Searches and public appeals== Initial search Thames Valley Police undertook an intensive and thorough search of the Wokingham area. This included using a helicopter, searching the Carnival Field site with loud hailer appeals, as well as searching nearby rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. Heat seeking equipment was also borrowed from the Metropolitan Police, which could detect dead bodies. Every worker and stall holder at the Frank Ayers Fun Fair was questioned the day after Tildesley went missing. Wokingham town centre's 29 streets, consisting of 960 shops, businesses and houses, had to be covered by officers on a door-to-door basis. On the following weekend of 9–10 June 1984, 15 policemen and two tracker dogs teamed up with 100 soldiers from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers training battalion in Arborfield Garrison to search the south side of Wokingham, from Barkham Road through to Amen Corner, which proved unproductive. Two weeks after the disappearance, Detective Superintendent Roger Nicklin had to concede that the police still had \\"absolutely no idea about Mark's disappearance\\". A train driver on the Guildford to Reading line reported seeing a fox carrying what looked like a child's arm in its mouth, but three weeks later this turned out to be animal bones. A strong smell of decomposed flesh was also reported in the nearby village of Crowthorne, but this turned out to be rotten sheep. National appeals In addition to a national poster campaign being launched, with every police station in the country displaying one, Tildesley's disappearance not only appeared in the regional Wokingham Times, but it was also featured heavily in national news coverage at the time. The Times, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror all wrote about the story, and the case was also covered in ITV's Thames News. On 7 June 1984, Tildesley's disappearance was mentioned on the first ever episode of the newly launched BBC television series Crimewatch UK, a programme which reconstructs major unsolved crimes with a view to gaining information from members of the public. These first appeals resulted in 400 calls being made to the police by members of the general public. Shortly after Tildesley's disappearance, several witnesses reported seeing a boy who fitted his description being dragged away forcefully against his will away from the fairground site by a Stooping Man between 7pm and 8pm that evening. Further sightings were at the nearby Cockpit Footpath on the corner of Denmark Street and Langborough Road as well as at Number 9 and Number 51 Langborough Road. There were also a number of conflicting sightings. A witness reported seeing a boy who looked like Tildesley sitting on the wall of the Waitrose car park in Rose Street with a bike similar to his at his side at 8:10pm on the evening of his disappearance. However, Tildesley's bike was actually found chained to railings at the entrance to the fairground site in Wellington Road half a mile away by his parents at exactly the same time. Reconstructions The day after the first Crimewatch UK broadcast, the police shot their first video reconstruction. A seven-year-old local boy dressed in clothes similar to those worn by Tildesley and was filmed around Rose Street including sitting on the wall of the Waitrose car park, and also at the fairground site as well. Whilst only a partial reconstruction, it did get a positive response. Two days before the first anniversary of Tildesley's disappearance, and with the Frank Ayers Fun Fair back on the Carnival Field in Wokingham, a second police reconstruction was filmed. These included shots in Rose Court, Rose Street, Broad Street, Denmark Street, the Carnival Field off Wellington Road and Langborough Road. Ten-year-old Paul Little played the part of Tildesley, whilst Peter Russell played the part of the Stooping Man. In the case's second appearance on the programme in just over a year, the footage was aired at 9:25pm on 13 June 1985 on Crimewatch UK. A full reconstruction of his last known moments was broadcast, in which Mrs Tildesley took part. Over 1,000 people called in with information, one of the highest volumes in Crimewatch UK history. Success of appeals Overall, the police received a huge public response with over 1,200 different individuals phoning in, who gave 2,500 potential leads, but little concrete evidence emerged. Crucially, Thames Valley Police never received any breakthroughs that would lead them to either Tildesley being found safe and well, or in the worst-case scenario, to the identity of the perpetrator(s) and/or the recovery of his body.Crimewatch UK BBC One London, 13 June 1985 21.25 Synopsis ==Investigations== Initial investigation The attic storeroom of the then Wokingham Police Station was the original Tildesley incident office Wokingham Baptist Church was used as a police meeting room during the Tildesley investigation The initial investigation was led by Detective Constable Geoff Gilbert. Coincidentally, Gilbert knew Tildesley personally through his mother's job at the local Wokingham Police Station. From the start, Wokingham police were unprepared for such a major task. Only four officers were assigned to the case, as Thames Valley Police were short-staffed with many colleagues sorting out the 1984–1985 miners' strike. As Wokingham Police Station was too small, the attic storeroom was used as the incident office. The police also promptly set up a mobile office on the fairground site. By the first Sunday following his disappearance, 3 June 1984, they had to use the Wokingham Baptist Church on Milton Road in Wokingham (immediately behind the police station) as a meeting room. The next day after that, Mrs Tildesley said in the Daily Express \\"I am sure somebody is holding him\\". However, Superintendent Alan Cussell conceded \\"Mark may have been murdered\\".Please don't harm our little boy Daily Express 4 June 1984 The police had to check that given the age difference between Tildesley and his brother and sister, that he was in fact Mrs Tildesley's son and not Christina's. DC Gilbert was summoned to do this task, which Mrs Tildesley described as \\"ridiculous\\". Tildesley's brother, Christopher, who had had an argument with him earlier on the day of his disappearance, was initially the prime suspect. However, it soon became clear that this could not be the case. On 7 June 1984, the day of the first Crimewatch UK appeal, two anonymous calls came in to say that they suspected a fairground worker called Martin Earley was responsible for Tildesley's disappearance. He had worked for Frank Ayers for eleven years and was at the Wokingham Fun Fair on the night Tildesley went missing. He was arrested and confessed to Tildesley's abduction, saying that he had raped and murdered him at his caravan nearby, which fitted in with what a hypnotist had said was likely to have happened to Tildesley. However, he changed his story so many times that it became unreliable and detectives worked out that they had in fact got the wrong man. After six weeks, the case became so big that Thames Valley Police had to move the incident office from Wokingham 20 miles up the M4 motorway to Sulhamstead near Newbury. On 16 August 1984, the Metropolitan Police called on another fairground worker, Sidney Cooke, at his home in London. One of his colleagues had alerted detectives at the Tildesley incident office about his suspicious behaviour towards young boys in the past. The police asked Cooke whether he was in Wokingham on the night Tildesley had vanished. He denied this and had an alibi. He claimed that he was working at a fair opposite West Hendon Police Station in London that night, and the fair owner, Rosie Gray, confirmed that Cooke was her employee. Cooke therefore remained on file but was eliminated as a suspect. By October 1984, with little new leads to go on, Thames Valley Police started to wind down their investigation into Tildesley's disappearance. Two-and-a-half years after this, on 29 April 1987, it emerged that there had been a number of attempted abductions of young children over the past six months in the Wokingham area. The police investigated whether these could be linked to Tildesley's disappearance, but this was eventually dismissed.TILDESLEY,Mark Operation Orchid In 1989, the Metropolitan Police established Operation Orchid, an enquiry into the disappearance of missing children. This was led by Detective Chief Superintendent Roger Stoodley. As part of this operation, in December 1990, they interviewed a convicted East London-based paedophile gang member called Leslie \\"Catweazle\\" Bailey, who had already been charged with two other murders, that of 14-year- old Jason Swift and six-year-old Barry Lewis, both of which occurred after Tildesley's disappearance. The police had obtained a hand-drawn paper map and a hand-written paper letter which had been given by Bailey to a fellow inmate at Wandsworth Prison. The map showed where Tildesley had been killed, and the letter, which had been written by a cell-mate, was addressed to Sidney Cooke, who was also another gang member, and who also knew about his murder. At this point, Bailey, who suffered from a mild learning disability which meant that he had limited understanding, confessed that his paedophile gang, whom the police had nicknamed the \\"Dirty Dozen\\", led by Cooke, from the Kingsmead Estate in Hackney, had abducted, drugged, tortured, raped and murdered Tildesley on the night he disappeared. It was at this point that the police realised that the Stooping Man who had been frequently described in connection with his disappearance was in fact Cooke. \\"Mark's party\\" On the night of Tildesley's disappearance, Bailey had been asked by another member of the gang, his lover Lennie Smith, to drive him from Hackney to Wokingham, as there would be a party (of child sex abuse) in a caravan owned by Cooke located near to a fair. Upon arriving in Wokingham, Smith went into the fair to find Cooke and they came back to Bailey's white Triumph 2000 car in Langborough Road, near to the fairground, with a young boy who was \\"dragging back\\", despite being enticed away from the fairground on the promise of a 50p bag of sweets. The young boy, Tildesley, had to be physically picked up and forced into the back of the car to get him in. With Bailey driving, Smith was in the front passenger seat, whilst Cooke was holding Tildesley back in the rear of the car. They then met a fourth man, a relative of Bailey's known as \\"Odd Bod\\", (who had a mental age of an eight-year-old), at Cooke's blue and white caravan, which had lace curtains. This was located a short drive away past the relocated Tesco in Finchampstead Road, on a field called \\"The Moors\\" on Evendons Lane, which is located in between Finchampstead and Barkham. After Cooke gave Tildesley a glass of milk laced with muscle relaxant, of which he only drank half; as he said it \\"tastes funny\\", the four men raped Tildesley, starting with Cooke and ending with Smith. After more muscle relaxant was applied directly down the boy's throat, the gang rape started again. Smith then forced a tablet into Tildesley's mouth before grabbing him by the throat. The party, referred to as \\"Mark's party\\" by Bailey, had already lasted for half an hour and Bailey stated he knew at this point that Tildesley was dead as he could not feel a pulse, but that Cooke had told him that he was fine and that he would take the boy home. This meant that it was likely that Tildesley was already dead before his parents even knew that he was missing. After the murder of Tildesley, Bailey drove Smith back to Hackney, arriving there after midnight. Before Bailey dropped Smith off at marshes, Smith said to Bailey that he would leave the disposal of the body to Cooke. Unfinished investigation The police received a Judge's Commendation for pursuing an honourable and sustained investigation which led to the eventual solving of the Tildesley case. However, the police admitted in public that the case had not been finished as Tildesley's body had not been found.BBC Crimewatch File – The Lost Boys – 1994 In 2007, Thames Valley Police set up the Dedicated Review Team to re-investigate unsolved murders and serious sexual assaults over the previous 50 years, which included Tildesley's murder, but nothing has come of it.Police to reopen unsolved murders and other crimes Wokingham Times 21 March 2007] Tildesley is the \\"Dirty Dozen\\" ring's first known murder victim. However, in 2015, following media and political pressure, the police re-opened the case of the 29 July 1981 murder of seven-year-old Vishal Mehrotra near East Putney tube station in London. The \\"Dirty Dozen\\" gang are being investigated in relation to this killing, which was more than three years earlier than the murder of Tildesley.Paedophile Sidney Cooke's potential links to murder of boy, 8, ignored by police Daily Express 30 May 2015 Also in 2015, former Chief Superintendent Roger Stoodley said he feared a \\"cover up\\" by the Metropolitan Police over the Tildesley murder case itself. He maintained that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Cooke over Tildesley's killing. Police started investigating Sidney Cooke's potential involvement with the unsolved murders of nine other boys in 2015. ==Legal proceedings== Sidney Cooke Sidney Charles Cooke was born on 18 April 1927. In 1984 his occupation was that of a fairground worker. Nicknamed \\"Hissing Sid\\", he was described by The Guardian newspaper in 1999 as \\"Britain's most notorious paedophile\\".Paul Kelso \\"Cooke admits years of child abuse\\", theguardian.com 6 October 1999 Cooke has never admitted playing any role in Tildesley's murder, despite a tiger key ring identical to the one owned by the boy being found in his repossessed dark coloured Jaguar XJ car in 1985, a year after Tildesley's disappearance. No charges were therefore brought against him as the Crown Prosecution Service felt that Bailey's confession was insufficient evidence for his case to result in a successful conviction. In addition, the Crown Prosecution Service also declined to prosecute Cooke for Tildesley's murder as he was already in prison for the manslaughter of Jason Swift. Leslie Bailey Leslie Patrick Bailey seemed to be the only one of the gang who would admit to the murder of Tildesley. Bailey suffered from a mild learning disability which meant that he had limited understanding. When he was sent to trial for Tildesley's killing, he was already in prison for the 1985 killing of Jason Swift. On 7 October 1993, Bailey was murdered by strangulation with a ligature in Whitemoor Prison in Cambridgeshire. The death was welcomed by the boy's parents. Mr Tildesley said he would like to shake the murderer's hand, whilst Mrs Tildesley opened a bottle of wine to celebrate. It later emerged that Bailey had been murdered by two other inmates.Panorama Defend the Children TX 11.05.98Inquiry as 'inhuman' child killer is found strangled in cell Lennie Smith Leonard William Gilchrist Smith was born on 23 August 1954. Smith has never admitted playing any role in Tildesley's murder. No charges were therefore brought against him as the Crown Prosecution Service felt that Bailey's confession was insufficient evidence for his case to result in a successful conviction. Smith died of AIDS in a secret unit in Nottingham Prison in 2006. Once again, Mrs Tildesley responded by celebrating the news.PLEA: 'TELL ME WHERE MARK'S BODY IS' Wokingham Times 5 July 2006 \\"Odd Bod\\" A fourth man, mentioned by Bailey as part of the Operation Orchid investigation as being partly responsible for Tildesley's murder, was a relative of him. He was referred to as \\"Odd Bod\\" throughout the investigation. However, as \\"Odd Bod\\" had a mental age of an eight-year-old, he could not have his name disclosed or be charged, put on trial or sentenced in connection with Tildesley's killing. No charges were therefore brought against him as the Crown Prosecution Service considered him to be too young for his case to result in a successful conviction. Murder charges On 18 October 1991, Bailey, \\"along with persons unknown\\", was charged with the murder of Tildesley. Trial The Tildesley family kept away from the majority of the trial at Reading Crown Court. Bailey stood alone in connection with Tildesley's killing. It was very unusual in that the judge not only named Cooke and Smith, but also described in court what he believed they had done to Tildesley, despite neither of them having ever been charged in relation to the case. Equally unusual was Bailey's instructions to his defence barrister to seek the maximum sentence possible, saying that he was \\"surprised and disappointed\\" and could not understand why Cooke and Smith were not in the dock with him. Sentences On 22 October 1992, Bailey pleaded guilty at Reading Crown Court to the lesser charge of manslaughter and one charge of \\"buggery\\" and received two life sentences on 9 December 1992. On hearing the verdict, Mrs Tildesley responded by calling for the re-introduction of the death penalty, saying \\"He should have been hanged\\". ==Body== Bailey claimed he did not know where Cooke had buried the body.Final tribute to murdered schoolboy Mark Tildesley Cooke has indicated he knows where the body is buried, but refuses to tell the police, or the boy's family, the exact location. Following the confession by Bailey to the murder, the police dug up \\"The Moors\\" field in Evendons Lane in March 1991, but they did not find anything. In May 1998, the police refused to re-question Cooke, in relation to Tildesley's murder, and also refused to dig up a nearby golf course to search for his remains.Cooke 'link' to unsolved death quashed In 2012, a fragment of human skull, discovered near Evendons Lane, was found not to be Tildesley's.Human skull found in Wokingham is not Mark Tildesley Tildesley's body has never been found and the murder is among Wokingham's most notorious crimes. Thames Valley Police initially thought his body was buried within a mile of Wellington Road in Wokingham, the location of the fair from which he was abducted, but they now believe that his body is buried in a shallow grave on abandoned farmland. In 2019 the Tildesley family made a last-ditch plea begging Cooke to end the family’s 35 year torment and reveal to police the whereabouts of his body before Cooke takes the secret of his whereabouts to his grave. ==Aftermath and memorials== Tildesley's bedroom The boy's parents kept his bedroom exactly how it was the day he went missing, until Mrs Tildesley moved to nearby Langley Common Road in Barkham (further away than Evendons Lane), shortly after Mr Tildesley's death in 2005. Memorial bench Shortly after the boy's disappearance, a public memorial, that of a jade-coloured bench, was erected exactly at the very spot where he was seen leaving the fairground by the general public. This can be seen directly to the right of the entrance to the Carnival Leisure Park on Wellington Road in Wokingham. A name plate on a plank of wood at the top of the bench reads \\"In Memory of MARK TILDESLEY\\".Panorama Defend the Children TX 11.05.98 When Mrs Tildesley died in 2011, a second name plate was put on the bench, with her name on it, on the plank of wood directly beneath the one with the boy's name plate on, in remembrance of her.Final tribute to murdered schoolboy Mark Tildesley Memorial service A memorial service was held on 30 January 1993 at the Rose Street Methodist Church (now the Wokingham Methodist Church) in Rose Street in Wokingham (next to what is now the small Marks & Spencer store which was a Waitrose at the time of both Tildesley's disappearance and murder in 1984 and the memorial service in 1993 and which is located on the other side of the road to the Tildesleys home in Rose Court). Headstone The Free Church Burial Ground is located adjacent to St Paul's Church in Reading Road in Wokingham A headstone to Tildesley was erected, on 30 January 1993, at the Free Church Burial Ground on Reading Road in Wokingham.

It is the home of the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team of Marquette University. Groundbreaking and construction began on June 18, 2016, and the arena received its certificate of occupancy on June 5, 2018. The arena opened on August 26, 2018. ==History== Despite being one of the premier NBA facilities when completed in 1988, the BMO Harris Bradley Center was one of the oldest active NBA arenas by the end of the Bucks' tenancy in 2018. Only Madison Square Garden in New York City and Oakland Arena in Oakland were older than the Bradley Center; however, both Madison Square Garden and Oracle Arena were substantially renovated during their lifetimes, with Oracle Arena being eventually replaced by the new Chase Center in San Francisco for the 2019-20 season. The funds for the building of the BMO Harris Bradley Center were donated by Jane Bradley Pettit and husband Lloyd Pettit without any provision for the building's long-term capital needs or annual operating expenses. Although the facility was self-sufficient, its tenants, such as the Bucks, were at a disadvantage compared with other NBA teams because of the arrangement. Former Bucks owner and former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl proposed building a new downtown arena to replace the Bradley Center. There was considerable discussion in the region about the idea of a publicly funded arena and ultimately no resolution was reached. In 2009, Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle included a provision in the state's capital budget seeking $5 million in state bonding support to renovate the Bradley Center. The Bradley Center's board of directors told state officials that the building needed $23 million in renovations, so they reportedly agreed to raise the remaining $18 million on their own. On September 18, 2013, then-deputy NBA commissioner Adam Silver toured the arena and said it was a few thousand square feet short of NBA standards, and also lacked numerous amenities. On April 16, 2014, Kohl announced an agreement to sell the franchise to New York City hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens. The deal included provisions for $100 million each from Kohl and the new ownership group, for a total of $200 million, toward the construction of a new downtown arena. Soon afterward, the NBA gave the Bucks an ultimatum—get a new arena, or be close to completing a new arena, by the start of the 2017–18 season. If not, the league would buy the franchise from Lasry and Edens and sell the Bucks to one of two prospecting ownership groups; one in Las Vegas and the other in Seattle, which would have meant the certain departure of the Bucks from Milwaukee. On July 15, 2015, the Wisconsin Senate approved funding for the new arena by a 21–10 margin, and on July 28, 2015, the Wisconsin State Assembly approved funding by a 52-34 margin. On August 12, 2015, Governor Scott Walker signed the arena spending plan at Wisconsin State Fair Park in West Allis, Wisconsin. The Milwaukee city council voted 12–3 on September 22, 2015, to approve the plan. The city's Plan Commission gave unanimous conditional approval to the Bucks' general development plans for land in the Park East Corridor on November 23, while acknowledging possible parking problems in the area. On April 13, 2016, the Bucks signed a 30-year lease to play in the new arena. In addition Marquette University has agreed to lease the arena for its home games, beginning in 2018. Unlike Marquette's previous agreement with the Bradley Center, the lease agreement with Fiserv ends in the spring of 2025, allowing Marquette the option to decide to pursue the building of its own smaller arena for lesser-attended match-ups, and to only utilize the Fiserv Forum for larger rivalry games. The official groundbreaking was during the 2nd annual Bucks Block Party on June 18, 2016. On May 2, 2017, Milwaukee Bucks President Peter Feigin stated that construction of the arena remained on schedule and on budget. Feigin's announcement was from the site of the new arena, after the first roof truss was installed and bolted into place. The roof was officially topped off on August 24, 2017. On August 26, 2018, Fiserv Forum was officially opened in a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the 4th annual Bucks Block Party. The first live event at Fiserv Forum was The Killers with Violent Femmes on September 4, 2018. The Bucks played their inaugural game at the Fiserv Forum during the preseason against the Chicago Bulls on October 3, 2018, a 116–82 Bucks victory. The Forum's regular-season home opener was played on October 19, 2018, against the Indiana Pacers. The Bucks won, 118–101. The Bucks' first season in the Forum was a great success, with the Bucks finishing the regular season with their first 60-win season since 1980–81. They also went 33–8 at the Forum, the second-best home record in the NBA. On April 14, 2019, the Forum hosted its first NBA playoff game, Game 1 of the first round between the Bucks and the Detroit Pistons. The Bucks won, 121–86. On December 22, 2019, the Bucks had their 50th consecutive sellout at the Forum, the longest such streak in franchise history, which started on November 16, 2018. On March 11, 2019, it was announced that the Fiserv Forum would host the 2020 Democratic National Convention from July 13–16, 2020. It was later postponed to August 17–20, 2020, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in the United States. On June 24, 2020, it was announced that the convention would be downsized and instead held at the nearby Wisconsin Center. On February 22, 2020, the Bucks set a new attendance record for the Forum, when 18,290 attended to watch the Bucks play the Philadelphia 76ers. The Bucks won 119–98. This record was broken less than a week later, on February 28, 2020, as 18,412 fans watched the Bucks face off against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Bucks won 133–86. Naming rights On July 26, 2018, the Bucks agreed to a 25-year naming rights deal with Fiserv, a financial services technology company based in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. After the official name was announced, fans nicknamed the building the \\"Four-One-Forum\\", a reference to the city's area code. Concerts and events ==Planning and design== The Milwaukee Bucks released the first images and details of their vision for the development of a new multi-purpose arena and sports and entertainment district to revitalize downtown Milwaukee on April 8, 2015. The images depicted early conceptual drawings of a new multi-purpose venue and entertainment district that will anchor a new development vision activated by sports, entertainment, residential and office uses. The site, which primarily sits between 4th Street and 6th Street from State Street to McKinley Avenue, will seamlessly link with active development on all sides, including Old World Third Street, Schlitz Park, The Brewery, the Milwaukee riverfront, Water Street and the Wisconsin Center. Populous and HNTB, two firms from Kansas City, lead the arena design team with participation from Milwaukee firm Eppstein Uhen Architects. The arena is intended to be the focal point of a \\"live block\\" zone that includes public space surrounded by both commercial and residential development. Initial renderings of the arena showed a transparent facade and a curved roof and side meant to evoke the water forms of nearby Lake Michigan and the Milwaukee River. \\"Herb Kohl Way\\" was unveiled on the plaza outside of Fiserv Forum on August 26, 2018 to pay tribute to the former Bucks owner for his contributions leading up to the building of the arena. The plaza is home to restaurants and a beer garden, where people can gather year-round to watch sporting events on a large, outdoor television. In May 2019, the Bucks announced Fiserv Forum is the central building in the 30-acre development district around the arena newly named \\"Deer District.\\" In February 2019, Johnson Controls unveiled a three-dimensional statue of their logo placed outside the Fiserv Forum, which can glow in multiple colors at night, and will specifically turn green after every Bucks victory. Inside Fiserv Forum Fiserv Forum holds 17,500 people and has fewer luxury suites, but more club seating than the BMO Harris Bradley Center. It also features a layout and equipment for an NHL/NCAA-regulation ice hockey rink and ice shows such as Disney on Ice, thus it still will be able to host the NCAA Frozen Four as the BMO Harris Bradley Center did in the past in 1993, 1997 and 2006. However, the American Hockey League's Milwaukee Admirals returned to the UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena in the 2016–17 season as they were not approached to play games in the arena. The Bucks are contractually bound not to recruit current tenants of the Panther Arena to move their events to the Fiserv Forum. Fiserv Forum has the largest symmetric scoreboard in the NBA. ==Further reading== * Review from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's art and architecture critic. ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I basketball arenas ==ReferencesConstruction cam Category:National Basketball Association venues Category:Basketball venues in Wisconsin Category:Marquette Golden Eagles basketball venues Category:Milwaukee Bucks venues Category:Sports venues in Milwaukee Category:Sports venues completed in 2018 Category:Populous buildings ","title":"Fiserv Forum"},{"id":"46354277","text":"María Luisa Carnelli (31 January 1898 - Buenos Aires, 4 May 1987) was an Argentine writer, poet, and journalist.

It was published by Kodansha in Evening magazine from April 2013 to August 2018, with its chapters compiled into fourteen tankōbon volumes. A live-action film adaptation was released in September 2018. In May 2017, Kodansha Comics announced the English-language digital release of Kasane. ==Characters== ;Kasane Fuchi :Played by: Kyoko Yoshine :An extremely ugly girl constantly tormented by bullies, in her youth, for her appearance and the fact that her mother was an incredible beauty. Despite her appearance she can act with amazing skill and grace. But due to the torment she faced as a child and her own sense of inferiority, she cannot act in front of anyone as herself. She received a tube of lipstick as a keepsake from her mother before she died. This tube has magic that allows Kasane to take whatever she wants if she kisses it while wearing the lipstick, usually the face of another person. While wearing another persons face, she loses her sense of inferiority and can act nearly flawlessly. ;Nina Tanzawa :Played by: Tao Tsuchiya :A beautiful woman, who desires to be a stage actress, but lacks talent as well as suffering from Sleeping Beauty syndrome. She agrees to give her face to Kasane, as long as she gets the credit for everything. However as time goes on, she begins to become dissatisfied with this relationship, sad and angry that her talent is not recognized. She eventually, sneaks on stage during a rehearsal instead of Kasane, but when her performance is declared completely different from \\"her\\" previous ones, she tries to commit suicide, but only lands up in a coma. Kasane keeps her body, at her home, alive, giving her the title of Kasane and taking Nina's name for her own. ;Kingo Habuta :Played by: Tadanobu Asano :Sukeyo and later Kasane's manager. He is one of the few people who knows the truth of Kasane's and Sukeyo's appearances and how they changed. He greatly admires both of their acting skills. He begins to help Kasane on the request of her mother before she passed away, and now he hopes to make Kasane into an actress as well known as Sukeyo, and hopefully even better. He was originally a director and he had cast Sukeyo. ;Sukeyo Fuchi :Played by: Rei Dan :Kasane's mother who died in the beginning of the story. She left Kasane a tube of lipstick, with odd properties, that allows Kasane to switch faces with another person, when she kisses them. She was a well-known actor, but it is eventually revealed that she, too used the lipstick, as Kasane presently does. ;Ichika Nishizawa :An Elementary-school classmate of Kasane. She was the leader of the bullies in elementary school. She attempted to mock her further by nominating Kasane as Cinderella for the class play and preventing her from practising with everyone else, but the plan backfired when Kasane practiced on her own, and still ended up shining in the first half of the performance. She later threatened Kasane to give up her position as Cinderella for the rest of the play, but Kasane switched faces with her, and locked her in the bathroom, passing herself off as Nishizawa for the remaining performance. After the play, she took Nishizawa to the roof, where she attempted to make peace with her, but failed. In the resulting scuffle, Kasane's cheek was sliced open, resulting in a permanent scar, while Nishizawa fell from the roof to her death. ;Iku Igarashi :The second person, Kasane switched faces with. She was a senior to Kasane, as well as the captain of the acting club. A kind, and loving girl, she attempted to befriend Kasane, by admitting that she too was bullied in her past, and that they were not very different. Her attempts failed when the other members of the club revealed to Kasane that Iku was bullied because of her beauty, as compared to Kasane's ugliness, and that the difference between them couldn't be wider. Hurt and feeling betrayed, Kasane confirmed the truth from Iku, and unable to hate Iku, she could only pity the Ugly girls who had once bullied Iku for being compared to her, just as she was. Kasane then drugged Iku, and took her place for her performance in a play, before returning her face to her and later telling Iku to stay away from her forever. ==Media== Manga Kasane is written and illustrated by Daruma Matsuura. The manga started in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Evening on April 23, 2013. It finished in the magazine on August 10, 2018.

It is a fermented food that has a sour flavor. It has a short shelf life, and is often eaten in raw form after the fermentation process has occurred. It is a popular Southeast Asian food, and different regions of Southeast Asia have various preferred flavors, including variations of sour and spicy. Naem is used as an ingredient in various dishes and is also served as a side dish. Naem contains 185 kilocalories per and contains a significant amount of protein, a moderate amount of fat, and minor carbohydrate content. Parasites and enteropathogenic bacteria have been found in samples of naem. Lactic acid formed during its fermentation inhibits the growth of Salmonella. Lactobacillus curvatus use in the product has been proven to prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria in naem. It is sometimes irradiated. The bacterial content in Thai sour pork products is regulated. ==Overview== Naem is a red-colored, semi-dry lactic-fermented pork sausage in Southeast Asian cuisine prepared using minced raw pork and pork skin, significant amounts of cooked sticky rice, chili peppers, garlic, sugar, salt and potassium nitrate. Minced beef is sometimes used in its preparation. After the mix is prepared, it is encased in banana leaves, synthetic sausage casings or tubular plastic bags and left to ferment for three to five days. Naem has a sour quality to it due to the fermentation, in which lactic acid bacteria and yeasts grow within the sausage. The lactic acid bacteria and yeasts expand by feeding upon the rice and sugar, and the use of salt prevents the meat from rotting. Naem typically has a short shelf life, which can be extended through refrigeration. The sausage can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to prepare. It is typically stored at room temperature, which gives it a shelf life of around one week. It is produced all over Southeast Asia in slight variations. Naem is often consumed raw, (after fermentation has occurred), and is often accompanied with shallot, ginger, bird's eye chili peppers and spring onions. It is used as an ingredient in various dishes such as naem fried with eggs, Naem khao and Naem phat wun sen sai khai, and is also consumed as a side dish and as a condiment. The cooking of naem significantly changes its flavor. ==Prominence== Naem has been described in Thailand as \\"one of the popular meat products of the country prepared from ground pork\\" and as \\"one of the most popular traditional Thai fermented meat products\\". ==Varieties== Naem mo in northern Thailand may be fermented in a clay pot.

Naem phat wun sen sai khai is a dish prepared with naem, glass noodles and eggs, among other ingredients such as spring onions and red pepper. Nam Khao is a salad dish in Lao cuisine prepared using Lao fermented pork sausage, rice, coconut, peanuts, mint, cilantro, fish sauce, and lemon juice. Naem and rice are formed into balls, deep-fried, and then served broken atop the various ingredients. Serenade, a restaurant in Bangkok, makes a dish called the \\"McNaem\\", which consists of a duck egg wrapped in naem that is fried and then served with risotto, slaw, shiitake mushrooms, herbs, and cooked sea scallops atop crushed garlic. There are many applications of sour pork with different flavors such as phat phet naem (), tom kha naem (), ho mok naem (), and naem priao wan ().

The novel, which was released on June 18, 2013, features a gay adolescent as its action- hero protagonist. A sequel to the novel has been released in 2014, Guardian. The novel utilizes a third-person, subjective narration structure that alternates between Knox Brindle and Sydney Carton. London states that he drew inspiration for Proxy from the 1987 book The Whipping Boy, \\"where the rich pay for the poor to take their punishments.\\" ==Plot== Setting The book is set in a distant post-cataclysmic future where civilization has evolved its technology so rapidly through unrestricted capitalism to bring about a world where nearly every conceivable service can be purchased. Society has developed into a rigid class system where the Upper City lives in the height of luxury while the Lower City lives in utter poverty. As a result of the Lower City being infinitely indebted to the Upper City super corporations, the middle class has been eliminated altogether. Because of this debt, Upper City citizens can purchase the debts of someone from the Lower City. The wealthy patron will pay for the poorer person's essential needs and in return they serve as proxies to be punished whenever the rich patron either breaks the law, or needs their body for health purposes - e.g. donate blood or organs. However this system is seen as unfair, as the Lower City citizens assume this debt at birth and have no other feasible way to repay the debt. In addition any contact between the proxies and the patrons is outlawed. This injustice has brought about the existence of \\"The Rebooters\\", a rebel organization set on destroying this system by introducing \\"Jubilation\\", an idea that would erase debts, currency credits, and all digital data and records. Full summary Protagonist Sydney \\"Syd\\" Carton is a 16-year-old boy that has been labeled as \\"Chapter 11\\" due to being homosexual. He serves as proxy for the rebellious Knox, whose behavior has resulted in repeated punishment throughout Syd's life. When Knox's actions result in the death of Marie Alvarez, an Upper City citizen, Syd is charged with vehicular manslaughter and is sentenced to a work prison. Knox also receives a blood transfusion from Sydney due to his injuries; accidentally transporting a mysterious \\"virus.\\" Through his education with Mr. Baram, Syd manages to flee his prison and escapes to the Lower City where he tries to get his best friend Egan to purchase a new identity through an Upper City contact. When this contact is revealed to be Knox, Syd decides to kidnap Knox as leverage for escape. The two go to Knox's house, where they eavesdrop and overhear shocking news from his father. Not only is Marie still alive, but her entire death was set up to give Knox a wake-up call. They also want Syd dead because his blood contains a virus that is capable of threatening the entire digital infrastructure of the Upper city wealth. The pair are almost caught by the Guardians but are rescued at the last moment by Marie, who is unhappy with the socioeconomic system and wants to change things by bringing Sydney to the Rebooters. Now a trio, they further discover that Knox's father wants to neutralize Baram because of his affiliation with the Rebooters. They manage to successfully warn Baram, who tells Syd that his virus would be successful in bringing about Jubilee. Unfortunately the group finds themselves surrounded by the Guardians, who threaten to kill Marie's proxy Beatrice if they do not surrender. Marie refuses and Beatrice is brutally murdered. Syd, Knox, and Marie escape via the sewers and emerge in an Upper City zoo. Just when it looks like they might be captured, the zoo animals are set free to cause a distraction. Egan also suddenly appears and murders an Upper City woman with a blaster, explaining that he is part of the Rebooters' mercenary crew and is here to bring him to their camp. The group sets out to reach the camp, which is located in a place called Old Detroit. On the way they discover to their horror that the mercenary group is actually not part of the Rebooters and was actually hired by Knox's father to kill Sydney and retrieve Marie and Knox. Egan is killed after the mercenaries double-cross him and Syd only survives because Marie manages to intervene. Syd then kills the mercenary leader and the group rides the mercenaries' horses out into the desert to resume their quest. Once in the wilderness they encounter Gordis, who saves them from the remaining mercenaries and then reveals that he is an agent of the Rebooters. With his help they manage to successfully reach Old Detroit, where they reunite with Baram, who reveals that the only way to enact Jubilee is to remove the virus from Syd and that doing so will kill him. Distraught, Syd and Knox try to flee the city but are met with a large force of Guardians storming Old Detroit in order to kill Syd and the Rebooters. Faced with this, Syd decides that he is willing to sacrifice himself and returns to upload the virus. Realizing that Syd's blood transfusion transmitted the virus to his body as well, Knox sacrifices himself in Syd's place. The novel ends with the patron paying back the proxy with his life while simultaneously enacting 'Jubilee' onto the world. ==Themes== Alex London talks about his novel's thematic attention in an interview - Proxy applies and integrates observations on society regarding debt, corporations, capitalism, progress in technology, social class, and human morality. ==Characters== Protagonist group * Sydney Allex Carton - 16 years old, dark skin color, gay sexual orientation, and lives in the Valve in the Lower city.

The term inner emigration was coined by Frank Thiess in his response to Thomas Mann's BBC broadcast on the subject of German guilt. The concept may apply more broadly to similar situations in which people feel dissociated from their country or surroundings. ==Origin of the concept== Delphine de Girardin, wrote in 1839 about French aristocracy during the July Monarchy: :Young people from the best circles of society, who bear the most famous names, display feverish activity heightened still further by their inner emigration and political aversions. They dance, they gallop, they waltz, the way they would fight if we had a war, the way they would love if people today still had poetry in their hearts. They do not attend the parties as court, ugh! There they would meet their lawyer or their banker; instead they prefer to go to the Musard, there they might at least meet their valet or their groom; wonderful! It is possible to dance in front of such people without compromising oneself. Living in exile in the United States in the 1940s, the German writer Thomas Mann was concerned with the issue of German responsibility for World War II and the Holocaust. He wrote several essays on the subject, including \\"Deutsche Schuld und Unschuld\\" (\\"German Guilt and Innocence\\") and \\"Über Schuld und Erziehung\\" (\\"On Guilt and Education\\"). After reading about the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps in 1945, Mann said in a German-language BBC broadcast: :Our disgrace lies before the world, in front of the foreign commissions before whom these incredible pictures are presented and who report home about this surpassing of all hideousness that men can imagine. \\"Our disgrace\\" German readers and listeners! For everything German, everyone that speaks German, writes German, has lived in Germany, has been implicated by this dishonorable unmasking. Frank Thiess argued that only those who had experienced life in Nazi Germany had a right to speak for Germans about their guilt, and that, if anything, the \\"innere Emigranten\\" ('inner emigrants') had shown more moral courage than those who had observed events from a safe remove. In response, Mann declared that all works published under Hitler stank of \\"Blut und Schande\\" ('blood and shame') and should be destroyed. As a result of this controversy, German literature of the period is still categorized in terms of the authors' moral status, rather than the political content or aesthetic value of their writings. ==Controversy== The moral issues surrounding inner emigration have long been a subject of debate. Some argue that certain writers who stayed behind in Germany criticized the Nazi regime in subtle ways, allegorically or by implication, while others contend that such criticisms were \\"so subtle that they are invisible\\". The debate is further complicated by the varying degrees to which different writers were under threat, and the varying strength and nature of their protests. Some writers who claimed to be inner emigrants appear to have done quite well for themselves during the war, while others saw their works banned or were imprisoned. At the 1998 Deutscher Historikertag Peter Schöttler, Götz Aly, and Michael Fahlbusch were involved in the debate concerning the role of German historians during the Third Reich. The trio challenged the defense of Theodor Schieder, Werner Conze and Karl-Dietrich Erdmann in terms of inner emigration arguing that they were more complicit with the Nazi regime than had been recognised by the next generation of German historians, many of whom were their students. ==Other uses== The concept may apply more broadly to include others, such as visual artists, as well as writers. It can also apply to a situation more generally or metaphorically to mean a mental dissociation from one's country or surroundings. For example, Anglo-Irish people whose loyalties lay with England rather than their native Ireland have been identified as inner emigrants, and to residents of a 1960s commune. ==See also== * German literature: Nazi Germany * German collective guilt ==NotesReferences== * * * ==Further reading== * Category:Historiography of Nazi Germany Category:Human migration Category:German literature ","title":"Inner emigration"},{"id":"46354692","text":"Franky De Gendt (born 27 June 1952) is a Belgian former professional racing cyclist.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lund. ==History== The presently visible church was preceded by a wooden stave church, built during the 11th century. The oldest parts of the presently visible Romanesque church date from about 1180. The twin tower, the nave and the choir form the oldest parts of the church. According to legend, the two towers were constructed by the wife of a local knight. The story goes that the knight went away to fight in a war while his wife was pregnant, and asked his servants to build a tower to the church in case she gave birth to a son. When he returned from the war and saw the two towers, he realised that she had given birth to twins. In reality, twin western towers are not an unknown element in Romanesque architecture, although not known from any other parish church in Scania. While it is unknown who built the church and why, the presence of the twin towers thus do denote high ambitions. From the extensive use of finely cut and worked granite, scholars have deduced that the workers building the church probably came from Jutland, where similar granite churches exist. During the 15th century, the vaults in the choir were decorated with murals. During the late Middle Ages the nave was also vaulted; but when the church was enlarged towards the north in 1770, these vaults were destroyed. The southern transept was added roughly a hundred years later. ==Architecture== Medieval murals in the choir As mentioned above, the church consists of a broad western tower with two spires, which is broader than the original nave. In front of the south-western portal is a Romanesque porch with two pillars supporting a roof; this canopy is unparalleled in Swedish church architecture. Traces of masonry found next to the apse indicate that there may have been smaller towers on either side of the apse as well, an arrangement known from Danish Romanesque churches. The church has two transepts, a central nave and a choir with an apse. The exterior of the church is today whitewashed. Internally, the church is characterised by a radical renovation carried out in 1882 by architect Helgo Zettervall in a medievalist fashion. This was reinforced by another, similarly medievalist renovation two decades later. In the choir, the aforementioned paintings are however truly medieval, dating from the 15th century. They depict a motif which is unusual for such church murals in present-day Sweden: scenes from the Last Judgment as interpreted in the Golden Legend. Among the church fittings, the baptismal font is the oldest. Made of granite, it is contemporary with the church and similar to fonts in Jutland. The font is decorated with sculpted stone lions, in Romanesque style. Of later date but also medieval is a painted wooden statue depicting Saint Peter. It dates from the end of the 15th century and made in northern Germany. The altarpiece, made of oak wood, dates from the 17th century. The church also contains two carved wooden memorial shields, so-called epitaphs, from the 17th and 18th centuries respectively. ==References * Category:Churches in Skåne County Category:Churches in the Diocese of Lund Category:Churches converted from the Roman Catholic Church to the Church of Sweden Category:Romanesque architecture in Sweden Category:Church frescos in Sweden ","title":"Färlöv Church"},{"id":"46354758","text":"The Los Angeles World Affairs Council (LAWAC), the Los Angeles office within the national network of World Affairs Councils of America, is a non-profit, non-partisan organization which arranges speaker events,\\"‘If we work and build together,’ a more sustainable world will be a safer world, Ban says in California\\".

(1949). The organization of behavior. New York, USA: Wiley. This capacity of using awareness to do so is based on the assumption that the brain and the mind are closely connected that one does not change without the other.Siegel, D.J. (2001). The developing mind. New York, USA: WW Norton & Co. The phrase \\"I think therefore I am\\" is not just a famous proclamation in the eyes of neuroscience. It has been evidenced that mental activity, such as fleeting thoughts and feelings can create new neural structure in the brain and thus shape a person's reality.LeDoux, J.E. (1995). Synaptic self: how our brains become who we are. New York, USA: Penguin. In this manner, it is possible to make use of the brain's neuroplasticity to re-wire/change one's brain and life for the better by consciously activating happy, tranquil and loving mental states. ==Background: Brain-evolution link== The experience of happiness and well-being is a universal pursuit, but often a struggle to achieve. One explanation for this is that happiness is not the brain's default and normal state of mind. Evolutionary psychologists claim suffering is. Suffering in the form of everyday stress, hurt, anger, loneliness, worry and disappointment experienced by the layperson is thought to be the side effect of strategies that helped human ancestors survive and pass on their genes throughout evolution.Craig, A.D. (2011). Significance of the insula for the evolution of human awareness of feelings from the body. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 12(25), 72-82. In this manner, the neural networks in the human brain have evolved to create pain and suffering when the evolutionary instincts cannot keep up with the outside world. This happens for example when; the brain attempts to separate the body and the self from a world where everything is connected. Consequently, the weaknesses of an individual's body become personal weaknesses, and the individual suffers as a result of negative self-image, illness and aging. Another survival strategy embedded in the neural networks of the brain is the tendency to approach pleasure and avoid pain, which is why humans suffer when they experience mental states with a negative feeling tone. ==Bias== Due to the strong impact of evolution on the human brain, what the modern man is left with is a negativity bias, which colours the manner in which humans perceive and interpret events within the environment. This bias is the reason for why the mind in particular, scans for, remembers and reacts to unpleasant experiences and why emotions such as worry, anxiety and fear of anticipated negative outcomes often follows. However, the negativity bias does not correspond with reality, as humans are most often not in danger. Even so, the brain simulates worst-case scenarios and creates additional worry and fear over events that most likely never will occur. Consequently, this process strengthens these neural structures and humans suffer even more.Hanson, R. (2009). Buddha's brain. The practical neuroscience of happiness, love and wisdom. Oakland, USA: New Harbinger Publications Inc. ==Self-transformation through meditation== The nervous system The neuroplasticity of the brain allows re-wiring of default neural pathways through conscious acts performed by the individual. As the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for stress-related hormones that activate mental states such as anxiety, irritation, stress and melancholy that make individuals unhappy, action must be taken by the individual to activate the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The PNS can on the contrary, end suffering created by the SNS as it produces feelings of relaxation, contentment and reflective insight that are necessary for the conscious re-wiring of the default neural networks that constantly scans for threats.Harrington, R. (2013). Stress, health and well-being. Thriving in the 21st century. Belmont, USA: Cengage Learning. Meditation One powerful way of activating the PNS is by using the mind-body connection through meditation. Meditation is often equated with mindfulness. Both concepts refer to the act of consciously using one's attention to be aware of what occurs moment-to-moment in one's outer and inner environment with a non-judgemental attitude. Attention resembles a spotlight; whatever it casts light on will flow into the mind and shape the brain. By developing control of attention through meditation the individual will consequently have the agency to choose what mental activity that should shape the brain, and thus, the experienced reality. In this manner, it is possible to transform the brain's default negative neural structure that leads to suffering.Kabat-Zinn, J. (1994). Wherever you go there you are. Mindfulness meditation for everyday life. New York, USA: Hyperion. Techniques to control attention The practice of meditation can include a wide range of techniques that aim to activate the PNS through sustained conscious attention and concentration. However, the ability to restrain attention is a challenging and unnatural pursuit for the brain, as it constantly attempts to update the individual's awareness with new information.Buschman, T., & Miller, E. (2007). Top-down versus bottom-up control of attention in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Science, 315,1860-1862. There are methods that can be used to develop greater control of attention:Hanson, R. (2009). Buddha's brain. The practical neuroscience of happiness, love and wisdom. Oakland, USA: New Harbinger Publications Inc. • Setting an objective to be mindful – at the start of an activity that requires concentration, establishing a deliberate objective to remain focused, such as \\"I am going to let my mind be steady.\\" • Remaining awake and alert to the environment - the brain cannot pay attention when sleep-deprived. For example, sitting up in a straight posture helps as this sends information to the reticular formation, which is involved in consciousness, telling it to stay vigilant to environmental stimuli. Another technique is taking deep breaths. This increases oxygen in the brain, which keeps it awake. • Silencing the mind. When the mind is silenced, there are fewer things to distract attention. For example, by creating an awareness of the whole body. Involved in this process is the right hemisphere, which represents whole-body processing. By initiating activities as such that the right hemisphere specializes in, the verbal babble of the left hemisphere is silenced. Physical and Psychological Health Benefits As the PNS is activated through meditation, it not only quiets the SNS, which is responsible for a majority of the psychological suffering that humans experience on a daily basis. The activation and alteration of brain structure has also been related to a number of physical and psychological health benefits: • A resilient affective style and increased mood. The absence of stress hormones in SNS activation allows for prefrontal activation and regulation of the amygdala, both of which are necessary for the experience of these states. • Strengthening of the immune system as a result of an increase in antibodies. This is the result of activation of the left-sided anterior through meditation practice.Davidson, R.J., Kabat-Zinn, J., Schumacher, M., Rosenkranz, D., Muller, S.D., Santorelli, F...(2003). Alterations in brain and immune function produced by mindfulness meditation. Psychosomatic Medicine, 65, 564-570. • Increase in empathy and compassion. The cultivation of positive affect through mental training stimulates the activation of the anterior cingulate cortices that have been previously linked to empathic responses to another person's pain. ==References== Category:Behavioral neuroscience ","title":"Self-transforming brain"},{"id":"46354936","text":"Pyon Kwang-sun is a North Korean artistic gymnast who competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Warwick Village is just outside the Watterson Expressway and part of the City of St. Matthews, Its boundaries are roughly New La Grange Rd, Washburn Ave, and Columbia Ave. Many of Warwick Village's streets are surrounded by Warwick Park also known as Warwick-Villa Park Playground. Warwick Village is also known through history as Warwick Villa, Warwich Villa, Warwick and Warrick Village. ==Geography== Warwick Village is located at (38.25995, -85.61764). ==History== Warwick Villa Subdivision was claimed to be the first subdivision in Kentucky. Warwick Village extends from LaGrange Road, running back Washburn Avenue, across the L. & N. Railroad tracks, including now what is known as Fountain Avenue. Before the turn of the century, with the train stop linking west Lyndon to Louisville, George R. Washburn tried to develop his 50 acres near the tracks into Warwick Villa -- \\"the beautiful little suburb on the high tide of prosperity.\\" But the panic of 1893 caused financial problems and few houses were built. George R. Washburn enlisted a developer by the name of Colonel Hunter to build Warwick Village on the land mostly owned by the Washburn family. It failed to grow much for at that time, it was too far removed from the city. Before the interurban started, the railroad, running parallel to the Vine Crest Avenue, was the only means of transportation to Louisville. It is said that a path of octagonal stones of different color extended from Warwick Villa all the way to LaGrange Road. Washburn sold the original lots just west of Lyndon in 1928 to Henry Holzheimer Sr., who successfully developed a Warwick Villa subdivision in St. Matthews. The property had been in the Washburn family since 1815, according to county historic records. The two- story framed Washburn House, built in the 1830s, is still on Fountain Avenue, surrounded by newer homes. Warwick Villa Hotel was located near Washburn Avenue and fronted the railroad tracks. The hotel had social prominence into the 1900s as a summer hotel. People came from Louisville and other points in Kentucky by train, to enjoy the country air and the delicious meals for which the hotel was famous. The frame hotel contained 20 rooms and according to Mr. Fred Boss, it was destroyed by fire and not rebuilt. Across the road from the Warwick Villa interurban station on LaGrange Road located the Indian Mineral Wells, operated by Colonel Harris, who sold and distributed mineral water into the late 1940s. Another mineral well with pump was located in the front yard of the Robinson's grocery at the corner of Lyndon Lane and Vine Crest Avenue, next to the railroad. LaGrange Road was also known as Zimmerman Lane and the grave marker of one of the family was familiar to residents of this area. It was in a curve of the road adjoining the Mineral Wells site. The stone was knocked down and destroyed and the remains were removed and buried elsewhere when LaGrange Road was made a 4-Lane Highway. ==Demographics== There are roughly 350 households in Warwick Village. ==Real estate== Warwick Village is known for its attractive, charming 1.5 story Cape Cod homes. St Matthews, along with Warwick Village are made of smaller, single family, cottage-like houses on tree-lined streets full of character and quirks. Homes in the village for sale can range in price from $115,000 to $260,000, with an average size of homes running 650 to 1800 sq. ft. ==Warwick Park== Rededicated in May 2007 after an extensive upgrade, this 8.4 acre park offers amenities such as treed picnic areas, a large pavilion, basketball courts, two baseball diamonds, grills, water fountains, and Port-A-Pot restrooms are on site. There is an asphalt walking track around the perimeter of the park making 2.3 laps equal to one mile, and an up-to-date play area recommended for children 4–12 years with swing and bench seating for adults. The center of the park is an open space suitable for flying kites, tossing discs or as utilized during the spring and fall seasons for numerous soccer practices and games by local schools and athletic groups. A walk in only entrance is located off Virginia Avenue along with free parking areas available at the entrances off of Columbia, Kentucky and Washburn Avenue. Warwick Park is designed to be enjoyed by all aged groups, the pavilion and baseball diamond can be reserved at no cost. ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Louisville, Kentucky ","title":"Warwick Village, St. Matthews, Kentucky"},{"id":"46355037","text":"Peter Crossley-Holland Peter Crossley-Holland (born 28 January 1916, London; died 27 April 2001, London) was a composer and ethnomusicologist. He wrote several books on the music of Tibetan Buddhism and composed music in ethnic styles including Celtic. == Early life and education == Crossley-Holland attended Abbotsholme School. Although he was a keen pianist, he studied medicine not music at St John's College, Oxford, when he matriculated in 1933. However, his composition \\"Fantasy Quintet\\" for piano and strings enjoyed a professional performance in Sheffield by George Linstead. Further his \\"Violin Sonata\\" and \\"Suite No. 1 for strings\\", both composed in 1938, won him a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music, where he was taught by John Ireland. He later he returned to Oxford for a B. Mus. degree. His graduating piece was in the celtic style, \\"A Song of Saint Columba.\\" == Career == From 1948, he was a producer for the BBC Radio classical music station called the Third Programme, until he moved to Germany from 1964 to 1966 where he was Assistant Director of the Institute for Musical Research in Berlin. After teaching assignments in Illinois and Hawaii universities, he was appointed Professor of Music (Ethnomusicology) at UCLA in 1969. He retired in 1983 and moved to Wales. == Compositions== In 1983, Robert Stevenson of UCLA listed 92 performed compositions by Crossley-Holland in \\"Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology, Volume IV: Essays in Honour of Peter Crossley-Holland on his Sixty-Fifth Birthday\\": * 1933–1937 (14 works) * 1938–1943 (15) * 1943–1947 (16) * 1948–1960 (49) After the publication of this Festschrift and his retirement from UCLA, he completed and performed an additional 16 works.  Symphony in D  The symphony was composed over the period 1988 to 1994. It was recorded by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Martin Yates. Writing for AllMusic, James Leonard criticised it saying \\"...though well-composed and effectively orchestrated, lacks drive and cogency. Each movement rolls forward without going anywhere in particular...\\" Greenfield and Layton, writing in The Penguin Guide, were kinder, noting \\"...the ideas unfolding inevitably and organically. The idiom is distinctly diatonic but there is a real sense of purpose. He writes well for the orchestra and always holds the listener.\\" == Personal life == He married Joan Mary Cowper in 1939. They had two children, Kevin and Sally. He set some of his son's poems to music; his final work, the song \\"The Philosopher Bird\\" has words by his son Kevin and is dedicated to his daughter Sally. He and his wife were divorced in 1970. He subsequently married Dr. Nicole Crossley-Holland (née Marzac), a French medieval historian who has taught at Aberystwyth University since 1985.

It tells the story of a contract killer who has one day to assassinate a reclusive writer. ==Plot== On his birthday, Schneider, a contract killer disguised as a handyman reluctantly takes on the easy task of killing Bax, a novelist who has a substance-abuse problem that could do him in before his rival contract arrives. Mertens, Schneider's boss orders him to grab his rifle and get to work. He insists the job to be done today, adding, “Ramon Bax is a child killer”. Bax who is a total mess is also a pro-hitman under Mertens and forgets he was supposed to kill Schneider that day because, according to Mertens, “Schneider is a child killer”. Bax also has to deal with his younger lover, Nadine and his lecherous father, Gerard. But he is confident because his adversary plays by certain rules and won’t strike when Francisca, his adult depressed daughter is nearby. Both Schneider and Bax know they are being played, but since it is a contract they have a certain obligation. Schneider uses an escort whom he has saved from a pimp to do cover work for him. Francisca who is depressed and frustrated that no one is there to help her, kills her grandfather Gerard when he tries to molest her and hides his body in a nearby swamp. Francisca comes to know her father is a hitman rather than a novelist, and she tries to help him to finish Schneider. Meanwhile, Schneider picks up Mertens and props him as a target for Bax. Bax kills Mertens mistakenly. Bax prepares to leave the house since the client is dead and the contract is no longer valid; he considers this to be valid, in principle, for his colleague Schneider as well. But Schneider considers Bax to be a threat, kills him and hunts down Francisca as she is a witness to his crime. Francisca appears naked before Schneider near the swamp where she killed her grandfather. Schneider leaves her and joins with his family for his birthday celebration. Francisca appears to be disoriented or free from her problems naked in the swamp. ==Cast== * Tom Dewispelaere as Schneider * Alex van Warmerdam as Ramon Bax * Maria Kraakman as Francisca * Annet Malherbe as Gina * Gene Bervoets as Mertens * Eva van de Wijdeven as Nadine * Pierre Bokma as Bolek * Henri Garcin as Gerard * Loes Haverkort as Lucy ==Production== The film was co-produced through Graniet Film and Belgium's Czar TV in collaboration with the broadcast association VARA.

What happened next is unclear, but Mansikka and Pemba Sherpa descended ahead of the rest of the group and somehow became separated from them. They were not seen again until their bodies were seen by other team members the following day, at an altitude of around . It was apparent they had died from a fall. Because both climbers fell together, there was speculation they were roped together at the time. However, the Finnish magazine, Retki, later claimed this was not the case. An article a few days after his death stated that Mansikka had urged the other climbers on when they considered turning back short of the summit. It went on to say Mansikka had started his descent alone, but that Pemba Sherpa later caught up with him. On 28 March Mansikka's friend and climbing partner Phil Crampton organised a rescue mission to try and recover the bodies using helicopter and longline technique, but this was aborted when it was felt the lives of the rescuers were being put in too much danger. Both bodies remain on the mountain where they fell. ==References== Category:Finnish mountain climbers Category:Summiters of Mount Everest Category:1978 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Mountaineering deaths ","title":"Samuli Mansikka"},{"id":"46355112","text":"Panulirus echinatus, the brown spiny lobster, is a species of spiny lobster that lives on rocky reefs in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean and central Atlantic Islands. ==Description== Like other spiny lobsters, Panulirus echinatus has no pincer-like chelae on its front walking legs. It differs from related species by having just two large spines on the antennular plate, just in front of the carapace, and the exopod of the third feeding appendage is reduced and bears no flagellum. The basic colour is brown with large white rounded spots. The antennules and limbs are brown and have longitudinal white or yellow markings. The average size varies over different parts of its range, with males growing to a carapace length of about and females . Males are in general more numerous, larger and heavier than females but this may be because of behavioural differences, with females feeding less during the breeding season. ==Distribution and habitat== Panulirus echinatus is found off the coasts of northern Brazil and on the Atlantic Islands of Cape Verde, Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha and the Canary Islands. Its depth range is about though it is seldom deeper than . It lives on rocks and among boulders, hiding in cracks and fissures during the day. ==Biology== Panulirus echinatus is a nocturnal generalist feeder and opportunistic browser. Examination of the stomach contents of animals caught on the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago show that the largest dietary item is fish, although it is not clear whether this is caught by the animal as prey or is the result of scavenging activity. Crustaceans formed part of the diet as did the green alga Caulerpa racemosa which is common in the study area. Another item consumed was calcareous algae scraped off the rock surface and this is likely to be an important source of calcium for the formation of the hard shell. Rock fragments found in the stomach are likely to have been ingested accidentally. Females carry their egg mass around on their abdomens, under their tails, for several months until the eggs hatch. During this period the females are likely to hide away more in crevices and spend less time feeding. Males do not change their feeding behaviour during the breeding season. Little is known of the larval development of this species but the larvae are planktonic. A late-stage phyllosoma larva taken in mid-ocean has been shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis to belong to this species. ==Status== Panulirus echinatus has a wide distribution and seems to be very common within that range. It is harvested in most of the areas in which it is found and in Saint Helena and the Cape Verde Islands is fished commercially. The population trend is unclear but because of the fishing pressure throughout its range, the population is likely to have been reduced over the years. However, because of the high fecundity of the female, this spiny lobster is likely to be resilient and not suffer local extinctions. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". ==References== Category:Achelata Category:Edible crustaceans Category:Crustaceans described in 1869 ","title":"Panulirus echinatus"},{"id":"46355119","text":"Solomon Samson (1888–1957) was an educator, civil servant and politician in Newfoundland.

There is also a chapel of the rosary. The other chapel was dedicated in 1679 to John the Baptist now dedicated to Sainte-Anne. This chapel holds the shield of the Goudelins. ==The tomb of Abbé Le Teurnier== Yann Larhantec's sculpture of Bernard François Marie Le Teurnier This is located by the small south east door. This famous priest had been born in Guervenan in Plougonven in 1783 and died there in 1883. The statue adorning the tomb is the work of Yann Larhantec. The statue depicts Le Teurnier giving a speech and standing by a chair with bas-relief carvings of the \\"taolennou\\". The taolennou was a painted teaching device famously used by Michel Le Nobletz. ==Gallery of images== File:Plougonven (29) Enclos paroissial 01.JPGView of church and calvary File:Plougonven 18 Eglise paroissiale Statue de saint Yves.JPGStatue of Saint Yves in Plougonven church File:Plougonven 4 Le calvaire vue d'ensemble.JPGThe famous calvary at Plougonven File:Plougonven 16 Eglise paroissiale bannière de procession.JPGProcessional banner File:Plougonben esglesia 7381 resize.jpgTwo gargoyles at Plougonven File:Plougonben esglesia 7385 resize.jpgStoup outside the church File:Plougonven 10 Le clocher de l'église paroissiale.JPGThe bell tower at Plougonven File:Plougonven 12 Egise paroissiale statue de Saint- Herbot.JPGStatue of Saint Herbot File:Plougonven 13 Eglise paroissiale Statue de saint Jean discalceat.JPGSaint Jean Discalceat.

On June 23, 2015, exactEarth filed a Preliminary Prospectus with Canadian Securities Administrators, announcing their intentions to launch an IPO. However, on November 5, 2015, exactEarth's largest shareholder, COM DEV, announced plans for an acquisition by Honeywell with exactEarth spinning out into its own publicly traded company. exactEarth's prospectus was abandoned. COM DEV shareholders approved the acquisition on January 21, 2016, with each COM DEV shareholder receiving 0.1977 exactEarth stock for every COM DEV stock held. Final court approval of the acquisition came on January 25, 2016. On February 9, 2016, exactEarth became a publicly traded company, trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol of XCT. ==Satellites== As of October 2015, exactEarth operates a satellite constellation consisting of 9 satellites. On June 8, 2015, exactEarth announced a partnership with Harris Corporation to build 58 AIS detecting payloads to be launched on board the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation.

RedBrick named their line \\"Earthdawn Classic\\" to differentiate it from Living Room Games' edition and to show that they were staying closer to the art styles and setting of the original FASA line than Living Room Games had. RedBrick's line kicked off with the Earthdawn Player's Companion (2005). In 2005 and 2006, Earthdawn had two companies simultaneously publishing \\"official\\" material - but RedBrick was soon the only publisher of the game. In 2007, Holistic Design licensed Fading Suns to RedBrick Limited. RedBrick promised new supplements using the original Victory Point System, plus the eventual release of the third edition of the game, and began with a few PDF adventures published in 2007. RedBrick published their classic edition of Earthdawn through 2009, then published a third edition (2009) which they distributed through the Flaming Cobra program at Mongoose Publishing. RedBrick Limited – who had published on their own for years – brought several of their publications to Mongoose, beginning with their third edition release of the classic Earthdawn game (2009).

The campaign involved a variety of policies, including greater freedoms being granted to Islamist groups, greater resources being put into religious programmes, increased use of Islamic punishments, and a more general greater emphasis being put on Islam in all sectors of Iraqi life. The campaign was conducted under the supervision of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who would later become Saddam Hussein's successor as leader of the Ba'ath party. Douri used the campaign to promote his Naqshbandi Sufi order, which would later form the nucleus of the Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order. ==Prelude and the campaign== The takbir was added to Iraq's flag during the Gulf War, in part to bolster the Iraqi government's Islamist credentials. Whilst the Ba'athist leadership traditionally viewed Islamists as backwards, treating them with suspicion, towards the end of the 1980s the Iraqi government began to make overtures towards the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as other Sunni and Shiite Islamist groups. Other initial signs of this turn to Islamism were Saddam's claim that Ba'ath party founder Michel Aflaq had converted to Islam on his deathbed, and also the adding of the takbir to the Iraqi flag in 1991. One interpretation states that such a repudiation of Ba'athism's traditionally secularist stance was driven possibly not by a genuine shift in Saddam Hussein's political convictions, but rather a politically calculated move in order to reduce the risk of an Islamist uprising against the Baathist State. The campaign was formally announced by Saddam in mid-June 1993, with the initial stages focusing on the closing of much of Baghdad's nightlife. Saddam banned the sale of alcohol in public places, public consumption became punishable with imprisonment. Women were persecuted and executed by beheading, ostensibly in the name of combating prostitution. The study of the Qu'ran became a core subject in the national educational curriculum, and a greater emphasis was put on the more general studying of Islam. Behind closed doors Saddam began to advocate the creation of a pan-Islamic state, so long as such a project began with unification of the Arab world; the original position of Hassan al-Banna and the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Al-Rahman Mosque Along with these efforts the government, already financially stretched due to sanctions, refocused resources into the construction and maintenance of mosques, for instance Baghdad's Umm al-Qura Mosque, and the expansive and unfinished Al-Rahman mosque. The government also made use of stricter punishments for crimes, most notably in the increased usage of amputation as a punishment, which was used for crimes such as desertion and certain forms of corruption and thievery. In the last two years of Saddam's rule, a campaign of beheadings was carried out by Saddam's Presidential paramilitary force, the Fedayeen Saddam. This campaign targeted women accused of prostitution, and according to contemporary reports by human rights groups killed more than 200 people. Dr. Samuel Helfont, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, says that while \\"the Faith Campaign is normally portrayed in ideological terms—as the regime shifting away from secular nationalism toward a more religious outlook\\" in actual fact, \\"Iraq’s internal archives show that the campaign had much more to do with the regime’s institutional capacity to incorporate its views on religion into its policies without empowering hostile elements of the Iraqi religious landscape.\\" Helfont concludes, \\"thus the Faith Campaign should really not be seen as an ideological shift toward Islamism, as many have seen it. It was, in fact, an attempt by the regime to fight the rising tide of Islamism in the region\\", though he noted that Iraqi society over the course of the 1990s became more religiously radicalized regardless of the regime's actions. ==Internal dissent== The campaign did not have complete support from the Ba'athist leadership, and Saddam Hussein is sometimes cited as the only major Ba'athist leader to have supported it. In contrast the former Prime Minister Sa'dun Hammadi, and former Intelligence Director Barzan Ibrahim al- Tikriti, were noted opponents of the campaign. Barzan in particular was fearful that the Islamist groups Saddam wished to placate would eventually seek to replace him and establish themselves in his place, and argued that in the meantime any alliance with Salafists would alienate both Iraqi Shiites and also other Arab states in the region. One of the few noted public opponents of the plan was Saddam's son Uday Hussein. His Babil newspaper criticized the program, arguing that the campaign would undermine Iraq's religiously pluralistic society, and encourage sectarian division, thereby undermining Iraq. The paper argued that Saddam's attempt to gain the support of Islamic fundamentalists was ultimately doomed to fail, as such groups would accept nothing less than strict Islamic law. The paper also published letters critical of the government and security services' tolerance for Iraq's growing Salafist movements. At another point, Babil however joined in railing against the Shi'ites, even referring to them as rafidah, a hateful epithet normally used by ultraconservative Salafis only. ==Consequences== By the late 1990s, the growth of Salafism in Iraq had seen not just regime allies benefit, but also groups opposed to the Ba'athist government. This manifested itself in the late 90s in the form of a low level terrorist campaign, including the kind of car bombings and assassinations that would later characterize the Iraqi insurgency. Part of the campaign had included attempting to infiltrate many mosques and Islamic organisations with security officials, however, many of these individuals themselves became persuaded by Salafist teachings of the groups they had initially been sent to infiltrate. Following the fall of the Ba'athist government as a result of the Invasion of Iraq, many former members of the security agencies, now imbibed with a more Ba'athist-Salafist ideology, went on to form various insurgent groups which would place a key role in the post-invasion insurgency, with people like Abdullah al-Janabi being key examples of former security officials turned Salafist insurgents. Ultimately a significant number of these individuals would later go on to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ==References== Bibliography * * Category:1990s in Iraq Category:History of the Ba'ath Party Category:Islamism in Iraq Category:Islamization ","title":"Faith campaign"},{"id":"46355357","text":"The 2015 British Superbike Championship season was the 28th British Superbike Championship season.

After a hiatus of nearly 20 years, Raymond Burr reprised his role as Los Angeles defense attorney Mason in 26 of the television films. Following Burr's death in 1993, Paul Sorvino and Hal Holbrook starred in the remaining four television films that aired from 1993 to 1995, playing lawyers Anthony Caruso and \\"Wild Bill\\" McKenzie respectively. ==Production== Development The original Perry Mason television series was broadcast on CBS television from 1957 to 1966. Raymond Burr starred as Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer Perry Mason, a character created by American author and attorney Erle Stanley Gardner. Television producer Dean Hargrove resurrected the Perry Mason character in a series of television films for NBC beginning in 1985. Casting Dean Hargrove was able to bring back the two then-surviving major stars, Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale, reprising their roles as Mason and his private secretary Della Street. In the first telefilm, Perry Mason Returns, Mason resigns his position as an appellate court judge to defend Street on a murder charge. William Katt, Hale's own son, was cast as private investigator Paul Drake, Jr., the son of original series’ private investigator Paul Drake. William Hopper, who played Drake, died in 1970; his photograph appears on Paul Drake Jr.'s desk. Katt appeared in the first nine movies. In the later TV movies, Mason utilizes the services of Ken Malansky (William R. Moses), an attorney who works with him as a private investigator. Malansky's character is introduced in The Case of the Lethal Lesson (1989), as a law student who is defended by Mason on a murder charge. Among the few actors to appear in major recurring roles were David Ogden Stiers as District Attorney Michael Reston (1986–1988), James McEachin as police Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Ed Brock (1986-1995), and Alexandra Paul as Ken Malansky's girlfriend Amy Hastings (1989). Filming Budgeted at $3 million, Perry Mason Returns was filmed in Toronto, standing in for Los Angeles to save production costs. Because of lower production costs, many of the later TV movies were filmed and set in Denver, Colorado rather than Mason's traditional locale of Los Angeles. Although located in Colorado, a courtroom wall shown at the end of the opening title sequence bears a Seal of Los Angeles County, California plaque. Music Fred Steiner's theme music was re-recorded by composer Dick DeBenedictis; Steiner himself arranged the theme at DeBenedictis's request.Bond, Jeff (1999). The Music of Star Trek. Los Angeles: Lone Eagle Publishing Company. . After Burr's death A total of 30 movies were made between 1985 and 1995, with Burr starring in 26. After Burr died in 1993, Paul Sorvino and Hal Holbrook starred in the final four telefilms from 1993 to 1995. These four films were presented as A Perry Mason Mystery, with Sorvino starring as Anthony Caruso in the first film and Holbrook starring as Bill \\"Wild Bill\\" McKenzie in the remaining three. Their characters are introduced as both lawyers and close friends of Mason, who is ostensibly out of town. Both Barbara Hale and William R. Moses reprised their roles for all four films, although in the final film in 1995, Hale contributed only a small cameo with Holland Taylor substituting for her. Hale said that continuing the series was suggested by Burr. \\"Raymond was so concerned that the crew keep working—we'd been with same crew for six years. He felt we must keep going as long as the audience was as kind to us as they are. It's the show that will keep going, but not the character. I do think it's a sweet memorial.\\" ==Television films== Raymond Burr films A Perry Mason Mystery ==Reception== Perry Mason Returns, the first television film in the series, was the second-highest-rated TV movie in American television during the 1985–86 season.

The theme park opened in 1949 on the site of the former Anchor Gardens next to Britannia Pier. The park is famous locally and across the country for the Snails and Tyrolean Tubs rides designed and manufactured by engineering entrepreneur Horace Cole and the family-owned engineering business. The Tyrolean Tubs is notable as the only Virginia Reel roller coaster (albeit in miniature form) in operation in the world. Joyland is renowned for its heritage rides, which have remained unchanged through generations of patrons, allowing parents to share the rides remembered from their childhood with their children. The biggest change to the park occurred in 1984 when the main centerpiece of the park (a 1950s Noah's Ark ride) was removed and replaced with a space shuttle attraction called the \\"Space Base\\" and then again in 1996 when the centrepiece was demolished and replaced by a spooky themed roller coaster twisting around the peak of the mountain while various fiberglass toy figurines adorn the side of the large green mountain. ==Current rides and attractions== , Joyland hosts the following rides: * Snails (1949) *: A unique snail ride designed by Horace Cole travelling through the park with various scenic elements such as garden gnomes, Frogs, A pond and much more. * Tyrolean Tubs (1949) Joyland's Tyrolean Tubs *: Circular \\"Tubs\\" wind their way through mountainous scenery spinning and changing direction unexpectedly throughout the duration of the ride before returning to the station. Designed by Horace Cole. * Jet Cars (mid-1970s) *: Six jet cars travel on a circular track through the inside of the mountain. * Neptune's Kingdom (mid-1970s) *: A themed ride whereby the rider travels through the inside of the \\"Mountain\\" in a seahorse car through sea and water related scenery. * Pirate Ship (1986) *: A pirate ship swings up and down entertaining children and adults. * Major Orbit (1989) *: A circular space-themed children's ride which spins and tilts upward. * Junior Ferris Wheel (c. 1990) *: A small Ferris wheel looking over Great Yarmouth Beach. * Skydiver (c. 1990) *: An enclosed ride spins riders up in the air imitating that of a skydiver. * Spook Express (1996) *: A children's rollercoaster travelling around the summit of the \\"Mountain\\", Curving inwards through a dark cave where spooky sound effects play in the darkness. ==Gallery== File:Neptunes Kingdom Joyland Great Yarmouth.jpgSeahorses at Neptunes Kingdom Joyland Great Yarmouth ==See also== * List of British Theme Parks == References == Category:Amusement parks in England Category:Tourist attractions in Norfolk Category:Great Yarmouth ","title":"Joyland (Great Yarmouth)"},{"id":"46355508","text":"Jes Wilhelm Schlaikjer (1897-1982) was an American artist, most known for his recruitment and war bonds posters during World War II. ==Early life== Schlaikjer was born during a storm at sea on the maiden voyage of the SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse. His parents, Erich Hansen Schlaikjer and Clara Ryser, were emigrating from Germany to New York. Supposedly they, at first, named their son, Wilhelm Parker Schlaikjer, after the ship and the ship's American pilot, William Parker. His father was a successful salesman of drug remedies. Erich and Clara were married in Germany in 1896. The Schlaikjer family lived in Ohio and Johnstown City, Kentucky before settling down on a farm in Carter township, Tripp County, South Dakota in 1907. Jes Wilhelm was the firstborn of five children: Arthur, Oscar, Hugo, and Erich. From an early age, Schlaikjer enjoyed drawing and was known for his talent in school. At first, he enjoyed painting the horses he saw roaming the plains. His cartoons were featured in a local newspaper in Carter, South Dakota when he was 13 years old. Later in his teen years, Schlaikjer worked for a Chicago newspaper as an artist and cartoonist. In 1916, he graduated from Winner High School. ==Military and education== After graduating from high school, Schlaikjer enlisted in the Army. During World War I, he served in the Signal Corps of the Army 1st Division in France as a telegrapher. After some time he \\"rose in rank\\" to Chief Receiving Officer at the Layfayette Radio Station in Paris. This was the \\"main continental communication link for the Allied forces.\\" When the war was over, Schlaikjer decided to stay in France. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Lyons. On June 3, 1920, he returned to his parents' farm in South Dakota. During this time he worked as a telegrapher for the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincey railroad line.

It aims at providing the fundamental abstractions for dealing with concurrency, distribution, interaction, decentralization, reactivity, autonomy and dynamic reconfiguration.Rodriguez, S., Gaud, N., & Galland, S. (2014). SARL: a general-purpose agent-oriented programming language. In The 2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology. Warsaw, Poland: IEEE Computer Society Press. SARL is platform-independent and agent’s architecture-agnostic. It provides a set of agent-oriented first-class abstractions directly at the language level (see the section on the concepts). Nevertheless, it supports the integration and the mapping of concepts provided by other agent-oriented metamodels. SARL itself exploits this extension mechanism for defining its own extensions (organizational, event-driven, etc.). An important feature of the SARL programming language is its native support for \\"holonic multiagent systems,\\" and \\"recursive agents\\" (also called \\"holons\\"). == Overview == The metamodel of SARL is based on four main concepts: Agent, Capacity, Space and Skill. The core metamodel of SARL is presented in Figure 1, and the main concepts are colored in light blue. Each of them are detailed in the following sections, as well as the corresponding piece of SARL code to illustrate their practical use. Figure 1: The concepts of the SARL programming language. In SARL, a Multiagent System (MAS) is a collection of Agents interacting together in shared distributed Spaces. Each agent has a collection of Capacities describing what it is able to perform, its personal competences.Rodriguez S., Gaud N., Hilaire V., Galland S., & Koukam K. (2006). An analysis and design concept for self-organization in holonic multi-agent systems. In the International Workshop on Engineering Self-Organizing Applications (ESOA’06), pages 62–75. Springer- Verlag.Cossentino M., Gaud N., Hilaire V., Galland S. & Koukam K. 2010. ASPECS: an agent-oriented software process for engineering complex systems - how to design agent societies under a holonic perspective. In Int. Journal on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, 2(2):260–304, March 2010. doi: 10.1007/s10458-009-9099-4. Each Capacity may then be realized/implemented by various Skills. For understanding the relationship between the concepts of Capacity and Skill, a parallel can be drawn with concepts of Interface and their implementation classes in object-oriented languages. To implement specific architectures (like BDI, reasoning, reactive, hybrid, etc.) developers should develop their own capacities and skills providing the agents with new exploitable features. Despite its open nature, SARL imposes some fundamental principles to be respected by the various Virtual Machines (VM) that wants to support it. First of all, the implementation of Space must be fully distributed and the execution layer must be abstracted from agents. SARL encourages a massively parallel execution of Agents and Behaviors. SARL is fully interoperable with Java to easily reuse all the contributions provided by the Java community, but also to facilitate the integration and evolution of legacy systems. One of the key principles governing SARL consists in not imposing a predefined way for Agents to interact within a Space. Similarly, the way to identify agents is dependent on the type of Space considered. This allows to define different types of interaction mechanisms and models on Spaces. The metamodel and the syntax of the SARL programming language have been inspired by the languages like Scala, Clojure, and Ruby. The SARL tools have been developed on top of Xtext, that enables to easily build domain- specific languages that are directly integrated into the Eclipse framework. The complete definition of the SARL syntax is available on GitHub. == Concepts == The SARL programming language is based on an agent-oriented metamodel based on the following concepts.  Emotional software agents  An agent is an autonomous entity having a set of skills to realize the capacities it exhibits. An agent has a set of built-in capacities considered essential to respect the commonly accepted competences of agents, such autonomy, reactivity, proactivity and social capacities. Among these built-in capacities (BIC), is the \\"behaviors\\" capacity that determines its global conduct. An agent has also a default behavior directly described within its definition. A Behavior maps a collection of perceptions represented by Events to a sequence of Actions. An Event is the specification of some occurrence in a Space that may potentially trigger effects by a listener (e.g. agent, behavior, etc.). These language does not imposes a specific agent’s control loop. The programmer is free to implement any control or authority protocol for their own application scenario, except for the initialization and destruction events. Indeed, when agents are created, the virtual machine that is executing the emotional software program is in charge of creating the agent instances, and installing the skills associated to the built-in capacities into the agent. Then, when the agent is ready to begin its execution, it fires the Initialize event. When the agent has decided to stop its own execution, the virtual machine fires the Destroy event to enable the agent to release any resource it may still hold.  Capacity and Skill  An Action is a specification of a transformation of a part of the designed system or its environment. This transformation guarantees resulting properties if the system before the transformation satisfies a set of constraints. An action is defined in terms of pre- and post-conditions. A Capacity is the specification of a collection of actions. This specification makes no assumptions about its implementation. It could be used to specify what an agent can do, what a behavior requires for its execution. A Skill is a possible implementation of a capacity fulfilling all the constraints of this specification. An agent can dynamically evolve by learning/acquiring new Capacities, but it can also dynamically change the Skill associated to a given capacity. Acquiring new capacities also enables an agent to get access to new behaviors requiring these capacities. This provides agents with a self-adaptation mechanism that allow them to dynamically change their architecture according to their current needs and goals.  Context and Space  A Context defines the perimeter/boundary of a sub-system, and gathers a collection of Spaces. In each context, there is at least one particular Space called Default Space to which all agents in this context belong. This ensures the existence of a common shared Space to all agents in the same context. Each agent can then create specific public or private spaces to achieve its personal goals. Since their creation, agents are incorporated into a context called the Default Context. The notion of Context makes complete sense when agents are considered composed or holonic (see below). A Space is the support of the interaction between agents respecting the rules defined in a Space Specification. A Space Specification defines the rules (including action and perception) for interacting within a given set of Spaces respecting this specification.  Recursive Agent or Emotional software agent  Agents can be composed of other agents to define hierarchical multiagent systems. Each agent defines its own Context, called the Inner Context, and it is part of one or more External Contexts. == Example: Exchanging messages between two agents == For illustrating the syntax of the SARL language, the Ping-Pong scheme is coded below. The agent A is sending a message PING to the agent B for determining if it is still alive. The agent B is replying with a PONG message. First, the two messages must be defined as events (without attribute): event PING event PONG The agent A is defined with agent A { uses DefaultContextInteraction, Logging on Initialize { emit(new Ping) } on Pong { println(\\"Agent \\" + occurrence.source + \\" is alive.\\") } } In the previous code, the keyword uses enables the agent to use previously-defined capacities: the capacity to interact with other agents inside the default context (DefaultContextInteraction), and the capacity to log messages (Logging). The on keyword permits to define the actions when an occurrence of the specified event is received by the agent A. When the agent A receives the Initialize event, it emits a Ping event to all the existing agents. When the agent A receives the Pong event, it logs a message with the identity of the event's emitter inside. The agent B is defined with agent B { uses DefaultContextInteraction, Logging on Ping { println(\\"Agent \\" + occurrence.source + \\" wants to know if I'm alive.) emit(new Pong, Scopes addresses(occurrence.source)) } } When the agent B receives the Ping message, it logs a message and reply with a Pong message. For avoiding a broadcast of the Pong message, the receiver of this message is restricted with the scope corresponding to the address of the Ping's emitter. == Janus Platform: a SARL Run-time Environment == SARL language specifies a set of concepts and their relations. However, the SARL language does not impose a particular execution infrastructure for being platform-independent. Nevertheless, the Janus Project provides the infrastructure for running SARL agents. Janus is an open-source multi-agent platform fully implemented in Java 1.7. It implements all required infrastructure to execute a MAS programmed in the SARL language. The major assumption made at the SARL language level are supported by this run-time environment: fully distributed, parallel execution of agent’s behaviors. Additionally, the Janus platform provides the tools for helping the programmer to deploy its MAS with the automatic discovery of Janus kernels, for instance. Technically, the Janus platform follows the best practices in current software development, such as Inversion of Control, and profits from new technologies like Distributed Data Structures (In-Memory Data Grid like Hazelcast). == References == * == External links == * SARL Official site Category:Agent- based programming languages Category:Multi-agent systems ","title":"SARL language"},{"id":"46355771","text":"The American Writers Museum is a museum of American Literature and writing that opened in Chicago in May 2017.

Drown ran in 2018 for election as Arkansas secretary of state. ==Background== Drown is named for his grandfather, R. Trevor Drown, I (born c. 1922). He received a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish from Arkansas Tech University in Russellville, his original home city. Drown served in the United States Army and is a serving member of the Special Forces, popularly called the Green Berets. Drown also served in the United States Air National Guard, and was a commissioned officer in the United States Air Force Reserve, dates of service not available. Drown's current military assignment is Master Sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group, Airborne (Mississippi National Guard) as a Special Forces Operations Sergeant (Military Occupational Speciality, 18Z4P) and has additional Special Forces MOS's, 18B Special Forces Weapons Sergeant and 18F Special Forces Intelligence Sergeant. In 2007, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Global War on Terror, Drown was deployed as part of a Special Forces A Team operating out Forward Operating Base Robinson in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. In 2015, Master Sergeant Drown was called to active duty and deployed to Juba, South Sudan on individual special assignment. Drown returned to the United States in July 2016 and ordered off of active duty in August 2016. A small businessman, he was also formerly employed as a driver for United Parcel Service. Drown and his wife, Kara, have two children, Ayden and Ella. Drown is a member of the Missionary Baptist denomination. He previously lived in Russellville, and London in Pope County and Dardanelle in Yell County. ==Political life== In 2010, Drown was the first candidate in 40 years to secure the certified 10,000 signatures required to be on the ballot as an independent (no party affiliation) candidate for the United States Senate from Arkansas. He finished third in the balloting with 25,234 votes (3.2 percent). Victory went to John Boozman, the Republican nominee and an outgoing member of the United States House of Representatives from Arkansas's 3rd congressional district. Boozman unseated the Democratic incumbent Blanche Lincoln. Drown joined the Republican Party to contest the District 68 state House seat vacated by the term-limited Republican Robert E. Dale. To gain the Republican nomination, he first handily defeated in the May 20 primary election two intra-party rivals, Zachary Tyler Sellers and Ingram Philips. Drown then won handily in the November 4 general election over the Democrat Tachany Evans, 9,847 votes (77.9 percent) to 2,222 (22.1 percent). Drown is assigned to the House committees on: (1) Judiciary, (2) State Agencies, and (3) Joint Committee on Energy. In February 2015, Drown joined dozens of his fellow Republicans and two Democrats in co-sponsoring legislation submitted by Representative Lane Jean of Magnolia, to reduce unemployment compensation benefits. The measure was promptly signed into law by Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. In the 2015 legislative session, Drown opposed the efforts of Republican House member Nate Bell of Mena and African- American Democrat Charles Blake of Little Rock to sever Martin Luther King Day and the Robert E. Lee holiday, which were both observed in Arkansas on the third Monday of January. Only two citizens spoke in a public hearing on the Blake-Bell measure; twenty-four signed to speak in opposition. Alabama and Mississippi also observe a combined King-Lee Day. Representative Drown said, \\"I keep hearing the federal government talk about how we need to be more like Europe. Well, this is the state of Arkansas. This is what our heritage is.\\" In 2017, Arkansas passed legislation separating the holidays; Drown was recorded as non-voting when the 2017 bill came before the house. Drown ran unopposed in the general election held on November 8, 2016. Drown ran for election as Arkansas secretary of state in 2018 but was defeated by John Thurston in the Republican primary. ==References * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:Arkansas Tech University alumni Category:Baptists from Arkansas Category:Businesspeople from Arkansas Category:Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives Category:People from Pope County, Arkansas Category:People from Russellville, Arkansas Category:United States Air Force officers Category:United States Army officers Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Arkansas Independents ","title":"Trevor Drown"},{"id":"46355889","text":"Hashem Akbari (born 13 August 1949) is an Iranian-American professor of Building, Civil, and Environmental Engineering at Concordia University.

Back on Earth after one thousand years the Poet discovers the street he's lived on and shot himself at, \\"by the door of the beloved,\\" bears his name. This detail acquired a sinister overtone after Mayakovsky committed suicide in 1930, troubled love life cited as one of the reasons. According to biographer A. Mikhaylov, the poem's protagonist is an oversensitive young man who suffers from social injustice and longs for social upheaval. The hero is a bizarre hybrid of a lofty neo-romantic superman and a real-life Mayakovsky, the former fighting the universal evils, the latter getting bogged down into petty everyday conflicts. At the crux of the poem lies the idea of futility of man's aspirations, both personal and social, due to the baseness of human nature and the power of money ruling the world. ==Premiere== In December 1917 Mayakovsky moved to Moscow from Petrograd and settled in the San-Remo hotel. He recited his new work several times, most famously at the Poetic Tournament which took place in late January 1918 at the poet Mikhail Tsetlin's house and featured the stars of the \\"two generations of Russian poetry,\\" including Konstantin Balmont, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Andrey Bely, Yurgis Baltrushaitis, Marina Tsvetayeva, David Burlyuk, Vasily Kamensky, Ilya Ehrenburg, Vladislav Khodasevich, Boris Pasternak, Alexey Tolstoy, Pavel Antokolsky, Vera Inber. This potentially conflicting meeting had an unexpected outcome: Mayakovsky's rendition was praised almost unanimously by the poets of the older generation, while Burlyuk was overly aggressive and apparently jealous. Particularly impressed was Andrey Bely, who declared that it was beyond his comprehension how such profoundly powerful, deep poem could have been created here in Russia, and that it was \\"way ahead now of the whole world literature.\\" According to Nikolai Aseev, Bely's impassioned \\"speech itself became a revelation for many and caused an ovation.\\" == References == Category:1918 poems Category:Poetry by Vladimir Mayakovsky ","title":"The Man (poem)"},{"id":"46355939","text":"Hannah Dorothy Burdon (1800–1877) was an English writer of novels.

An academy graduate of French club Paris Saint-Germain, Augustin made his senior debut in 2015 and made 31 appearances for the club, scoring two goals, and won eight national honours. In 2017, he joined RB Leipzig for a €13 million fee. Augustin has also represented France at various youth levels and was part of the U19 squad which won the European Under-19 Championship in 2016. His performances throughout the tournament earned him the Golden Boot and Player of the Tournament awards. ==Club career== Paris Saint-Germain Augustin was first called up for a professional match for Paris Saint-Germain on 5 October 2014, remaining unused in a 1–1 home draw with Monaco. He made his professional debut on 8 April 2015 in the 2014–15 Coupe de France semi-finals against Saint-Étienne at the Parc des Princes, replacing Javier Pastore after 88 minutes in a 4–1 home win. He played in PSG's 2–0 victory over Lyon on 1 August in the 2015 Trophée des Champions at the Stade Saputo in Montreal, replacing Edinson Cavani after 63 minutes. Six days later he made his Ligue 1 debut, replacing Lucas Moura for the final minute of a 1–0 win at Lille. On 16 August, he was given a first start, in a 2–0 win over Gazélec Ajaccio at the Parc des Princes. In all competitions, Augustin made 17 appearances across the season, scoring once in a 4–1 home win over Troyes four minutes after coming on for Edinson Cavani on 28 November. On 19 November 2016, Augustin made his first start of the season, providing the assist for Ángel Di María in the 13th minute in a 2–0 Ligue 1 home win against Nantes. He made 13 official appearances over the campaign, and scored the last goal of a 6–0 win at Caen on 16 September. At PSG, Augustin scored 2 goals in 23 league games and was mainly used as back up to main Strikers Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani. RB Leipzig On 6 July 2017, RB Leipzig completed the €13 million signing of Augustin on a five-year deal, after being signed by Head Coach Ralph Hasenhüttl He made his Bundesliga debut on 19 August, replacing Konrad Laimer for the final 14 minutes of a 2–0 loss at Schalke. On 16 September, he scored his first goal for his new team, in a 2–2 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach at the Red Bull Arena. Augustin scored a match-winning penalty away to Borussia Dortmund on 14 October, becoming the first team of the season to win at the Westfalenstadion. Three days later, he scored his first Champions League goal in a 3–2 home win over Porto in the group stage, Leipzig's first win in the competition. He scored against Borussia Dortmund on 3 March 2018 to help earn Leipzig a 1–1 draw. On 12 April 2018, Augustin scored in the Europa League quarter final defeat to Marseille in a 5–2 defeat, which saw Leipzig eliminated 5–3 on aggregate. He scored 12 goals in all competitions and gained 6 assists in 37 appearances during the 2017–18 RB Leipzig season, with Augustin competing with the likes of Timo Werner and Yussuf Poulsen for starting places. In September 2018, Augustin was disciplined by the club for using his mobile phone in the pre-match build up against RB Salzburg in a 3–2 defeat in the Europa League. In November 2018, he scored in the Europa League in a 2–1 defeat against Celtic. He was linked with a £37 million transfer to Premier League side Everton in December 2018, however remained at Leipzig. He scored 8 goals in 30 appearances during the 2018–19 RB Leipzig season helping RB Leipzig finish 3rd in Bundesliga under Head Coach Ralf Rangnick. Monaco (loan) On 1 September 2019, Augustin joined Monaco on a season-long loan deal including an optional buyout clause. He made his debut for the club on 15 September in a 3–4 loss against Marseille in Ligue 1. He scored his first goal for the club on 30 October 2019, scoring a powerful right footed volley against Marseille in a 2–1 victory in the Coupe de la Ligue. However, Augustin found himself competing for limited striking places with Wissam Ben Yedder, Islam Slimani, Stevan Jovetić and Keita Baldé. On 27 January 2020, RB Leipzig and Augustin agreed to cut his loan spell at Monaco short in order to secure his move to Leeds United on the same day.  Leeds United (loan)  On 27 January 2020, Augustin joined EFL Championship side Leeds United on loan until the end of the season, with the club reportedly having the option to sign him permanently for £17.7 millon. It was revealed that Augustin turned down a late offer from Premier League side Manchester United to sign for Leeds. Augustin revealed that working with Leeds' head coach Marcelo Bielsa was a big factor in his decision to sign for the club. Augustin made his debut for Leeds on 8 February 2020, coming on as a 71st minute substitute for Patrick Bamford in a 2–0 defeat to Nottingham Forest. After three substitute appearances for Leeds, each one replacing Bamford with 15-20 minutes to play, Augustin suffered a muscular injury in late February, which ruled him out for the next three games.. He eventually left Leeds at the end of his loan deal, having only played 48 minutes of football for Leeds. Ex-Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford revealed that the lack of playing time, and the reason for not extending the loan deal in light of the delayed season end, was down to Augustin not following instructions from management, and not putting in the required work. It was later reported that Leeds had the obligation to complete a permanent transfer of Augustin due to a clause on Leeds achieving promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2019-20 season, however Leeds claimed \\"extenuating circumstances\\" surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic \\"nullify the deal\\". RB Leipzig threatened legal action over failure to complete the deal, claiming \\"The legal situation is clear\\". Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa however was quoted as saying it was \\"convenient\\" for Augustin to return to RB Leipzig. The disagreement lies with the date specified in the contract by which point Leeds should have been promoted. If Leeds had been promoted by 30 June, the clause was legally activated, however with Leeds still having 6 games to play by this date, Augustin's loan period ended and he was released by the club. Leeds sealed promotion on 17 July therefore not meeting the required clause date. Leipzig however argue that under the \\"spirit of the rules\\", the transfer should have taken place, as football contracts specify 30 June as the \\"end of a season\\", thus the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic should be taken into account. Leipzig have stated they will pursue the case via FIFA, however FIFA had not heard from the club as of 10 October 2020. Nantes On 6 October 2020, Nantes announced the signing of Augustin on a two-year deal, being signed as a free-agent, with both RB Leipzig and Leeds providing written permission, and relinquishing any claim to Augustin's registration. ==International career== Augustin is eligible for selection in both the France and Haiti national football teams. He played for the France under-19s in qualification for the 2016 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. There he scored five goals in six games, including a first-half hat-trick in a 9–0 win over Gibraltar in Dax on 9 October 2015. He was the top scorer with six goals and Player of the Tournament at the finals in Germany in July 2016. He scored in all three group matches, including a hat-trick in a 5–1 win over the Netherlands. In the final at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, he opened a 4–0 win over Italy. He finished top scorer for France in the tournament ahead of strike partner Kylian Mbappe. Augustin was chosen for the under-20 team at the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup in South Korea. He scored four goals in as many games, including a penalty in the 2–1 quarter-final elimination by Italy on 1 June. In a group game against Vietnam, he scored twice in a 4–0 victory after missing a penalty by attempting a Panenka. In September 2018, France national under-21 football team Head Coach Sylvain Ripoll proclaimed that Augustin rejected a call up to the under-21 team due to muscle fatigue, the dispute with the Head Coach led to his 'non selection' for the national team, Augustin revealed in December 2019 that he had spoken to Ripoll and was available for selection for the national team and was hoping to make the France national football team squad for the 2020 Summer Olympics in the summer of 2020. ==Style of play== Augustin plays as a striker capable of playing anywhere across the forward line, with Bundesliga describing Augustin as 'powerful, quick, direct and capable of making things happen outside, as well as inside, the box.' His former RB Leipzig Head Coach Ralph Hasenhüttl said of Augustin 'He's the full package. He's going to be a really important player'. in 2016, Augustin was listed by Barcelona forward Lionel Messi as a wonderkid in a list of his top 9 future prospects in football. == Career statistics == {   center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\" Club !rowspan=\\"2\\" Season !colspan=\\"3\\" League !colspan=\\"2\\" Cup !colspan=\\"2\\" League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\" Continental !colspan=\\"2\\" Other !colspan=\\"2\\" Total - !

She was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. She has contributed significantly to the creation and performance of Indigenous theatre in Canada. ==Early life== Nolan was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, to an Algonquin mother and an Irish immigrant father. Nolan was raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba and attended the University of Manitoba where she graduated with a B.A. Nolan's commitment to Indigenous and feminist live art is attributed to the first time she saw a Native character on stage during Royal Winnipeg Ballet's adaptation of The Ecstasy of Rita Joe. ==Career== Nolan launched her career as a playwright at the Winnipeg Fringe Festival in 1990 where her play Blade premiered. It was later remounted at both the Best of the Fringe (1990) and Women in View Festival (1992). She has worked at various theatre companies throughout Canada including Agassiz Theatre, the Manitoba Theatre Centre, Nakai Theatre in Whitehorse, Native Earth Performing Arts. As a director, Nolan has contributed significantly to the development of Aboriginal theatre. She has directed plays by George Ryga (The Ecstasy of Rita Joe), Turtle Gals Performance Ensemble (The Only Good Indian) and Marie Clements (Tombs of the Vanishing Indian and The Unnatural and Accidental Women), Kenneth T Williams (Café Daughter and In Care), Melanie J. Murray (A Very Polite Genocide). From 1998 until 2001, Nolan was also president of the Playwright's Union of Canada (now called the Playwrights Guild of Canada). She was artistic director of Native Earth from 2003 to 2010. She was president of Indigenous Performing Arts Alliance, and has served on the boards of the Saskatchewan Arts Alliance and the Saskatchewan Association of Theatre Professionalshttps://sasktheatreprofessionals.ca/board-members/. Nolan is an Artistic Associate at Signal Theatre and co-director with Michael Greyeyes of a dance opera (Bearing) at the 2017 Luminato Festival. She also directed (Nôhkom) with Signal Theatre. In 2017 she was awarded an Honorary Lifetime Membership to the Canadian Association of Theatre Research. ==Writer- in-Residence== Nolan has been a writer-in-residence at several institutions including Brandon University (1996). During this term as writer-in-residence, Nolan wrote Annie Mae's Movement. She was also playwright-in-residence at the National Arts Centre and resident at Mount Royal College in 2009. In 2011 she began a nine-month term as writer-in-residence at the Saskatoon Library and playwright-in-residence at the University of Regina. ==Plays== *A Marginal Man *Annie Mae's Movement *Blade *Child *Job's Wife *Shakedown Shakespeare *The Unplugging *Donne In *Owen (radio play) *Toronto Rex *Ham and the Ram *Prophecy *Alaska *from thine eyes *Henry IV Pt 1: (adaptation) *Hilda Blake (libretto) *The Birds: (adaptation) * Scattering Jake *Finish Line * Video * What Befalls The Earth == Editor== Performing Indigeneity: with Ric Knowles, Playwrights Canada Press, 2016 Beyond The Pale: Refractions: Solo with Donna- Michelle St. Bernard, Playwrights Canada Press ==Culture Studies== Medicine Shows: Indigenous Performance Culture, Playwrights Canada Press, 2016 ==Director== * Bearing co-director with Michael Greyeyes, dramaturge, Signal Theatre: Luminato 2017 * Map Of The Land, Map Of The Stars Gwaandak Theatre, 2017 *The Piano Teacher Arts Club, Vancouver, BC 2017 *In Care by Kenneth T.

Then the following are equivalent: The assumption that “A is a Noetherian ring” is used to invoke the Artin–Rees lemma and can be weakened; see == Proof == Following SGA 1, Exposé IV, we first prove a few lemmas, which are interesting themselves. (See also this blog post by Akhil Mathew for a proof of a special case.) Proof: The equivalence of the first two can be seen by studying the Tor spectral sequence. Here is a direct proof: if 1. is valid and N \\\\hookrightarrow N' is an injection of B-modules with cokernel C, then, as A-modules, :\\\\operatorname{Tor}^A_1(C, M) = 0 \\\\to N \\\\otimes_A M \\\\to N' \\\\otimes_A M. Since N \\\\otimes_A M \\\\simeq N \\\\otimes_B (B \\\\otimes_A N) and the same for N', this proves 2. Conversely, considering 0 \\\\to R \\\\to F \\\\to X \\\\to 0 where F is B-free, we get: :\\\\operatorname{Tor}^A_1(F, M) = 0 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Tor}^A_1(X, M) \\\\to R \\\\otimes_A M \\\\to F \\\\otimes_A M. Here, the last map is injective by flatness and that gives us 1. To see the \\"Moreover\\" part, if 1. is valid, then \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^A(I^n X/I^{n+1}X, M) = 0 and so :\\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^A(I^{n+1} X, M) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^A(I^n X, M) \\\\to 0. By descending induction, this implies 3. The converse is trivial. \\\\square Proof: The assumption implies that I^n \\\\otimes M = I^n M and so, since tensor product commutes with base extension, :\\\\operatorname{gr}_I(A) \\\\otimes_{A_0} M_0 = \\\\oplus_0^{\\\\infty} (I^n)_0 \\\\otimes_{A_0} M_0 = \\\\oplus_0^{\\\\infty} (I^n \\\\otimes_A M)_0 = \\\\oplus_0^{\\\\infty} (I^n M)_0 = \\\\operatorname{gr}_I M. For the second part, let \\\\alpha_i denote the exact sequence 0 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^A(A/I^i, M) \\\\to I^i \\\\otimes M \\\\to I^i M \\\\to 0 and \\\\gamma_i: 0 \\\\to 0 \\\\to I^i/I^{i+1} \\\\otimes M \\\\overset{\\\\simeq} \\\\to I^i M/I^{i+1} M \\\\to 0. Consider the exact sequence of complexes: :\\\\alpha_{i+1} \\\\to \\\\alpha_i \\\\to \\\\gamma_i. Then \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^A(A/I^i, M) = 0, i > 0 (it is so for large i and then use descending induction). 3. of Lemma 1 then implies that M is flat. \\\\square Proof of the main statement. 2\\\\. \\\\Rightarrow 1.: If I is nilpotent, then, by Lemma 1, \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^A(-, M) = 0 and M is flat over A. Thus, assume that the first assumption is valid. Let \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\subset A be an ideal and we shall show \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\otimes M \\\\to M is injective. For an integer k > 0, consider the exact sequence :0 \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{a}/(I^k \\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{a}) \\\\to A/I^k \\\\to A/(\\\\mathfrak{a} + I^k) \\\\to 0. Since \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^A(A/(\\\\mathfrak{a} + I^k), M) = 0 by Lemma 1 (note I^k kills A/(\\\\mathfrak{a} + I^k)), tensoring the above with M, we get: :0 \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{a}/(I^k \\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{a}) \\\\otimes M \\\\to A/I^k \\\\otimes M = M/I^k M. Tensoring M with 0 \\\\to I^k \\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{a}/(I^k \\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{a}) \\\\to 0, we also have: :(I^k \\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{a}) \\\\otimes M \\\\overset{f}\\\\to \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\otimes M \\\\overset{g}\\\\to \\\\mathfrak{a}/(I^k \\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{a}) \\\\otimes M \\\\to 0. We combine the two to get the exact sequence: :(I^k \\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{a}) \\\\otimes M \\\\overset{f}\\\\to \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\otimes M \\\\overset{g'}\\\\to M/I^k M. Now, if x is in the kernel of \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\otimes M \\\\to M, then, a fortiori, x is in \\\\operatorname{ker}(g') = \\\\operatorname{im}(f) = (I^k \\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{a}) \\\\otimes M. By the Artin–Rees lemma, given n > 0, we can find k > 0 such that I^k \\\\cap \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\subset I^n \\\\mathfrak{a}. Since \\\\cap_{n \\\\ge 1} I^n(\\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\otimes M) = 0, we conclude x = 0. 1\\\\. \\\\Rightarrow 4. follows from Lemma 2. 4\\\\. \\\\Rightarrow 3.: Since (A_n)_0 = A_0, the condition 4. is still valid with M, A replaced by M_n, A_n. Then Lemma 2 says that M_n is flat over A_n. 3\\\\. \\\\Rightarrow 2. Tensoring 0 \\\\to I \\\\to A \\\\to A/I \\\\to 0 with M, we see \\\\operatorname{Tor}_1^A(A/I, M) is the kernel of I \\\\otimes M \\\\to M. Thus, the implication is established by an argument similar to that of 2\\\\. \\\\Rightarrow 1.\\\\square == Application: characterization of an étale morphism == The local criterion can be used to prove the following: \\\\to \\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{O}_{x, X}} is an isomorphism.}} Proof: Assume that \\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{O}_{y, Y}} \\\\to \\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{O}_{x, X}} is an isomorphism and we show f is étale. First, since \\\\mathcal{O}_x \\\\to \\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{O}_x} is faithfully flat (in particular is a pure subring), we have: :\\\\mathfrak{m}_y \\\\mathcal{O}_x = \\\\mathfrak{m}_y \\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{O}_x} \\\\cap \\\\mathcal{O}_x = \\\\widehat{\\\\mathfrak{m}_y} \\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{O}_x} \\\\cap \\\\mathcal{O}_x = \\\\widehat{\\\\mathfrak{m}_x} \\\\cap \\\\mathcal{O}_x = \\\\mathfrak{m}_x. Hence, f is unramified (separability is trivial). Now, that \\\\mathcal{O}_y \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_x is flat follows from (1) the assumption that the induced map on completion is flat and (2) the fact that flatness descends under faithfully flat base change (it shouldn’t be hard to make sense of (2)). Next, we show the converse: by the local criterion, for each n, the natural map \\\\mathfrak{m}_y^n/\\\\mathfrak{m}_y^{n+1} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{m}_x^n/\\\\mathfrak{m}_x^{n+1} is an isomorphism. By induction and the five lemma, this implies \\\\mathcal{O}_y/\\\\mathfrak{m}_y^n \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_x/\\\\mathfrak{m}_x^n is an isomorphism for each n. Passing to limit, we get the asserted isomorphism. \\\\square Mumford’s Red Book gives an extrinsic proof of the above fact (Ch. III, § 5, Theorem 3). == Miracle flatness theorem == B.

He went on to co-found the Burgess Company and the Manufacturers Aircraft Association. He was the Vice President and a director of Curtiss Aeroplane & Motor Company and a director of Curtiss-Wright Corporation. ==Biography== Russell was born on July 17, 1878 in Mansfield, Ohio, to Reverend Frank Russell, Congregationalist minister and descendant of Reverend Noadiah Russell, and Aurelia Squire Henry Russell. He was graduated from Yale in 1900, and married Marietta Ford on December 31, 1902. He joined the Laurentide Paper Company of Quebec as Manager of Sales, but came to be recognized for ability in manufacturing management. He was recruited to be president of Automatic Hook & Eye Company, one of the predecessor companies of Talon Zipper, in Hoboken, New Jersey and held patents for processes in the manufacture of the zipper. In 1908, the Wright brothers demonstrated their aeroplane in a flight over New York harbor. Russell witnessed the demonstration from the roof of his factory and sought to meet them. His cousin, Russell F. Alger, son of Russell A. Alger, a backer of the Packard Motor Company and of the Wrights, arranged the introduction. Russell joined the newly formed Wright Brothers Aeroplane Company as General Manager in 1910. Russell sold the first military aircraft to the US Army, and donated the prior experimental model which is now at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. In 1911, Russell joined in the formation of the Burgess Company, which had been manufacturing aircraft under license from Wright. Burgess was acquired by Curtiss in 1914 and Russell became the Vice President - General Manager, and a director of the Curtiss Aeroplane & Motor Co. Under his direction the company developed many of the most successful military planes of the time, which included the NC-4 flying boat and racing planes flown by Jimmy Doolittle and Major Al Williams. Curtiss-Wright was formed in 1929 by the merger of the two formerly rival companies and Russell became a director of the combined enterprise, as well as president of Curtiss Asset Corporation and Curtiss- Caproni, Inc. Some sources credit Russell with pioneering the designs for US fighter aircraft of World War II. In 1931, Russell moved to his farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania in active retirement until his death there in 1948. He was a director of the Budd Company and focused his efforts on applying aircraft streamlining concepts to trains. In 1917, Russell participated in the formation of the Manufacturers Aircraft Association and was elected its secretary and later its president, which he remained until his death. The industry association was created to mediate patent disputes between aircraft and component manufacturers that had been hampering American military preparedness during World War I. He was also a member of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics. Russell served as president of the Montauk Club and vice-commodore of the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club on Long Island. He died at his home in Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania on August 4, 1947. ==See also== *Wright Brothers patent war ==References== * Aviation & Aeronautical Engineering, Volume 3.

The broad roles eVP24 performs involve the formation of fully functional and infectious viral particles, promotion of filamentous nucleocapsid formation, mediation of host responses to infection, and suppression of the host innate immune system. It has been noted that eVP24 function can overlap with that of two other viral proteins; eVP40 matrix protein which functions in virus budding, and eVP35 which is also associated with immune suppression. ==History==  Research  The first recorded human outbreak of Ebola virus disease was in 1976 and since then, there has been considerable effort to define the progression of the disease and the virus responsible. The history of Ebola virus characterization is rather short as most research on the mechanisms employed by the virus have occurred in the last two decades. This is due to the intensive biohazard containment required for laboratory studies of the virus and the difficulty in obtaining samples for study, particularly in common outbreak regions. The isolation of viral cDNAs has allowed research into viral gene products to progress. The genome of the Ebola virus was found to encode seven proteins: glycoprotein; nucleoprotein; matrix proteins, VP40 and VP24; nonstructural proteins, VP30 and VP35; and viral polymerase. The functions of the viral proteins remained the last to be well investigated. In particular, eVP24 remained the least studied for some time.  Characterization  eVP24 was initially described as a matrix protein that had similar properties and functions of eVP40. eVP24 was found to have characteristics of typical viral matrix proteins, such as a strong association with lipid bilayers and the ability to oligomerize to form tetramers. Like eVP40, eVP24 was found to be essential in virion assembly and budding. Later research indicated that the expression of eVP24 was required to switch from viral transcription and replication to virion assembly. A new role for eVP24 was found when its expression was monitored in rodent species where changes in eVP24 seemed to be responsible for enhancing virulence, indicating that adaption of Ebola in animal models occurs through mutations in eVP24. Additionally, eVP24 inhibits interferon signaling by competitively binding to karyopherins which blocks phosphorylated STAT1 nuclear import. In 2014, it was found that this mechanism interferes with the cells response to viral infection, which suppressed the innate immune response, allowing the virus to proliferate in the body. == Function == eVP24 disrupts the signaling pathway of STAT1. The STAT1 protein is phosphorylated by interferons in response to viral infection causing it to express a non-classical nuclear localization signal and bind to the importin protein karyopherin-α (KPNA). Once bound to KPNA, STAT1 is transported to the nucleus where it stimulates gene transcription in response to viral infection. Classical nuclear localization signals are bound by arms 2-4 or by 6-8 of KPNA while non-classical nuclear localization signals are bound by KPNA 1, 5 and 6 in arms 8-10 allowing non classical signals to be transported at the same time as classical signals, providing faster signaling of certain signals. The eVP24 protein operates by binding to KPNA preventing the binding of STAT1. As a result, STAT1 is not able to elicit an immune response, however nuclear import is able to proceed as normal which may be important for viral replication. This means that eVP24 prevents the activation of an immune response against the Ebola virus without sacrificing its ability to have viral components transported to the nucleus or the target cell. eVP24 provides Ebola with an advantages over other viruses which disrupt STAT1 because unlike most other viruses, eVP24 uses mimicry of the STAT1 protein. This makes it very unlikely for the host to develop an adaptation as mutations in KPNA which prevent eVP24 binding are also likely to prevent STAT1 signalling. ==Mechanism== eVP24 prevents the function of KPNA by binding in a region which overlaps with the binding region of STAT1. This is accomplished by the high binding affinity between KNPA and eVP24. These proteins have very high complementarity in the binding interface, similar to the complementarity shown between antibodies and antigens. In addition, the binding interface is large; over 2000 angstroms squared of solvent accessible surface is buried by the binding. Overall binding takes place with very little conformational change in either protein. There are three clusters of residues on eVP24 which form contacts to KPNA. These are located at residue positions 115 to 140, 184 to 186, and 201 to 207. Mutation of any single residue does not significantly reduce the binding of eVP24 to KPNA which demonstrates the robust mechanism of the viral protein. KPNA proteins have 10 armadillo repeats each consisting of three alpha helices which determine their binding specificity, the second helix from ARM 9 and 10 form a hydrophobic core with helix 6 of eVP24 adding to the stability of the complex. The binding sites for eVP24 and STAT1 have been shown to overlap. Mutation in any one of four residues in KPNA at positions 434, 474, 477 or 484 prevent binding to STAT1. Similarly, the mutations in residues 474, 477 or 484 of KPNA reduce the binding of eVP24. Additionally and critically, the binding of eVP24 does not prevent the binding of cargo proteins with classical nuclear localization signals as, like STAT1, eVP24 causes very little conformational changes in KPNA. == Effects on symptom progression == eVP24 acts as an antagonist to PY-STAT1 on KPNA. With eVP24 being transported to the nucleus instead of STAT1, the interferon-stimulated genes IFN-α/IFN-β and IFN-γ are disrupted and the cell does not enter an antiviral state. STAT1 has been shown to regulate the expression of certain immunoglobulins. More specifically, class switching from the predominant IgM to IgG2a was not present in STAT1-deficient cells. IgG2a plays a critical role in protection against pathogens and therefore without it, the cell is more susceptible to said pathogen. STAT1 has also been shown to regulate cell death by the inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. STAT1 also induces the expression of procaspases, which are important factors in apoptosis signaling. When nuclear transport of STAT1 is inhibited pro-apoptotic signalling is disrupted, leading to decreased cell death. ==Current and future research== The evasion of the host cell immune system is key in to the rapid replication and dispersion through the body by the Ebola virus. Current research is exploring how eVP24 enables this phenomenon to occur. The discovery of STAT1 nuclear import disruption by eVP24 binding to KPNA has already provided scientists with one mechanism for the inhibition of the immune response in the cell. Other current Ebola research is focused on developing treatments or vaccines against the virus. Early investigations into potential vaccines showed that in mice models, the highest levels of protection occurred after vaccination with viral-like particles expressing eVP24. However, at that time the role of eVP24 was still largely unknown. In the wake of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the largest and deadliest outbreak to date, there has been a considerable increase in research focused on developing a vaccine for Ebola. == References == Category:Viral structural proteins ","title":"Ebola viral protein 24"},{"id":"46356633","text":"Amphiaspidoidei is a taxon of extinct amphiaspidid heterostracan agnathans whose fossils are restricted to Lower Devonian marine strata of Siberia near the Taimyr Peninsula.

One of her daughters, Nouf bint Nayef (born 1984), is the wife of Mohammad bin Abdullah, one of late King Abdullah's sons. His son, Nawwaf, was detained along with his older half-brother Mohammed bin Nayef and his uncle Ahmed bin Abdulaziz in early March 2020. In August 2020 although not announced officially some Twitter accounts reported that Prince Nawwaf was released. Controversy Maha acquired a luxurious property in Sweetwater Club Blvd., known as \\"Millionaires Row\\" in Sweetwater Club, Seminole County, Florida, for $2 million, and she spent another $4 million on improvements, including having a guesthouse and prayer chapel constructed. The house was fitted with an elaborate security system and an arsenal. She made news in 1995 when she became embroiled in a scandal for beating a servant who was suspected of stealing $200,000 in cash and jewellery from her. The servant would not press charges, but the princess abandoned her multimillion-dollar property with the windows open to the elements and never returned to the country. In 2009, Maha spent $20 million during an epic shopping spree in high-end Parisian boutiques, habitually walking out of the door after staff had been given an embossed card marked \\"Payment to Follow\\". She lived in various top hotels in Paris, including the Crillon, which remained a long-time creditor; she then moved to the luxury Georges V hotel, owned by her nephew, Prince Alwaleed. Shops she patronised report that her payment history had always been excellent, but that her staff started shrugging off payment all of a sudden. She has since been pursued by some 30 Parisian retailers for 15 million Euro worth of merchandise. Casualwear retailer Key Largo finally secured payment after obtaining a court order to seize goods from her Georges V hotel suite. Bailiffs were met by the Saudi consul, who issued a guaranteed payment for $125,000 in the presence of a chief of police. Those debts were said to have been eventually settled through the Saudi embassy. The negative publicity of her Parisian stay incurred the wrath of King Abdullah, who grounded her on her return from Paris. Nevertheless, she once again escaped back to Paris from Saudi in December 2011. Media reported that she and her entourage, occupying 41 rooms at the Shangri-La Hotel in the 16th Arrondissement in Paris where they had been staying since 23 December 2011, tried to sneak out of the hotel at 3:30 am of 31 May 2012 without paying the $7 million bill. Police were called, but Maha claimed diplomatic immunity. In the meantime pending resolution, she decamped to the Royal Monceau Hotel owned by a friend, the Emir of Qatar. In March 2013, creditors obtained a court order from a judge in Nanterre, and two storage units containing Maha's purchases from 2012 were seized, to be auctioned off to satisfy creditors. Maha was barred from leaving Saudi Arabia after the latest spending spree. In early 2018 Maha and her daughter, Nouf bint Nayef, caused another legal case due to their harsh acts towards an Eritrean nanny both in Saudi Arabia and in Virginia, USA. ==References== Maha Maha Category:Living people Maha Maha Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Maha bint Mohammed Al Sudairi"},{"id":"46356647","text":"Zosne cachita is a species of longhorn beetle in the tribe Saperdini in the genus Zosne that was discovered by Heller in 1922. ==References== Category:Saperdini Category:Beetles described in 1922 ","title":"Zosne cachita"},{"id":"46356653","text":"Barbara Denise Craig (née Chapman; 22 October 1915 – 25 January 2005) was a British archaeologist, classicist, and academic, specialising in classical pottery. From 1967 to 1980, she was Principal of Somerville College, Oxford. ==Early life== Barbara Denise Chapman was born on 22 October 1915 in Calcutta, British Raj. Her father was librarian of the Imperial Library of Calcutta (now the National Library of India). In 1920, she moved to London, England, with her mother and siblings; her father remained in India. She was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls, an independent school in Acton, London. Having won a scholarship to the University of Oxford, and under the influence of her uncle R. W. Chapman, she matriculated into Somerville College, Oxford in 1934 to study classics. During her degree, she specialised in ancient history and classical archaeology. One of her lecturers was H. T. Wade Gery, who encouraged her interest in ancient history rather than Latin or Greek. She graduated in 1938 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, having gained first class honours in both Mods and Greats. ==Career== Craig's early career suggested a future in academia. After her double first, she was awarded the Craven fellowship and the Goldsmith's senior studentship to fund further study. She then travelled to Italy to undertake research and further study at the British School in Rome. There, she studied the historical background to Greek lyric poetry and the ancient history of Sicily. She spent some time travelling alone in Sicily looking at ancient sites. Having moved away from the regular tourist sites, she found herself in the interior of the island where a large number of Italy's arms factories were based. Unable to convince a police officer that an attractive, young woman with binoculars was not spying in the factories, she was arrested. Luckily for her, the local police chief believed her account of being a tourist and scholar with a passion for birdwatching, and she was released. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, she had to return to the United Kingdom. For a year, she worked as a temporary civil servant in the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of Labour. She then had the opportunity to return to academia. Between 1940 and 1942, she was the assistant to the Professor of Greek at the University of Aberdeen. She then once became a civil servant: she was assistant principal of the Ministry of Home Security and the Ministry of Production. By the end of the war, she held the position of principal. In 1945, her husband joined the British Council, an organisation that promotes British interests abroad through international education and other opportunities. This was the beginning of two decades spent in various foreign countries, with Barbara acting as hostess at any official occasion. However, she did have time to continue her own interests, in addition to supporting her husband. From 1951 to 1956, while the couple were based in Iraq, she was involved in Max Mallowan's excavation at Nimrud. In 1954, she was elected to the Katharine and Leonard Woolley Fellowship in Archaeology at Somerville College, Oxford, her alma mater. This gave her the funding to carry out research on the relations between Ancient Greece and the Ancient Near East. From 1956, she was involved in excavations at Mycenae under Sir Alan Wace, then under Lord William Taylour. As she was not a trained field archaeologist, her main contributions were the classification of pottery. She was greatly skilled at this and became an expert in Mycenaean pottery. In 1965, the couple finally returned to the United Kingdom and set up a permanent home in London. She continued her involvement in archaeological excavations at Mycenae and in Laconia, Greece, during the summer months. In February 1966, she was elected Principal of Somerville College, Oxford. She took up the appointment in October 1967, succeeding Dame Janet Vaughan. Under her leadership, the college doubled in size and rose to the top of the Norrington Table, the annual ranking of colleges by degree classification. The college celebrated its centenary in 1979, and she used the opportunity to fund raise. She retired in 1980 and was appointed an honorary fellow of Somerville College. ==Personal life== She met her future husband, James Craig, when they were both at the British School at Rome in 1938; she was studying and he was the BSR's secretary and librarian. They married in 1942. A serious road accident in 1986 left her husband disabled and using a wheelchair. She cared for him until his death in 1989. They did not have any children. She was a Christian and a practising Anglican. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:2005 deaths Category:British archaeologists Category:Principals of Somerville College, Oxford Category:Scientists from Kolkata Category:British people of colonial India Category:People educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls Category:Alumni of Somerville College, Oxford Category:British classical scholars Category:Women classical scholars Category:Classical scholars of the University of Oxford Category:Classical archaeologists Category:Academics of the University of Aberdeen Category:British Anglicans Category:Women scientists from West Bengal Category:British women archaeologists Category:20th-century archaeologists Category:20th-century women writers ","title":"Barbara Craig"},{"id":"46356656","text":"Ben Cherski (October 29, 1929 - May 19, 2017) was a Canadian ice hockey player.

The Knights were members of the East Division of the American Athletic Conference (The American), defending conference co-champions, and played their home games at Bright House Networks Stadium on UCF's main campus in Orlando, Florida. The Knights were led by head coach George O'Leary, who was in his 12th and final season with the team. After starting the season 0–6, O'Leary resigned as UCF's interim athletic director, a position he had held since June when Todd Stansbury left for the same position at Oregon State. Following UCF's 59–10 defeat by Houston on homecoming, dropping the Knights to an 0–8 record, O'Leary resigned as head football coach. Quarterbacks coach Danny Barrett served as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. The 2015 season was UCF's third in the American Athletic Conference, and the first year the conference split into two divisions. This was the Knights' first season since 2011 in which they would fail to be eligible for postseason play. This campaign marks UCF's third winless season in program history (along with the 1982 and 2004 seasons). Coming just two years after the banner BCS-bowl- winning 2013 season that saw them finish in the top 10 nationally, and a year after winning the conference for the second straight year, the 2015 was not just a failure, but a shocking one. In the aftermath, UCF finally moved on from the O'Leary era and hired renowned offensive coordinator Scott Frost from the Oregon Ducks to be their head coach. After a 6–7 2016 bounce-back campaign, the Knights would go undefeated in 2017 and win the Peach bowl, completing a turnaround from 0–12 to 13–0 in just two years. ==Personnel== Head Coach George O'Leary Coaching staff { class=\\"toccolours\\"  left\\" -  colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"background-color: #000000; color: white; text-align: center; ;border:2px solid #BD9B60;\\"2015 UCF Knights coaching staff -  valign = \\"top\\"  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Head Coaches * Head Coach – George O'Leary (resigned after 8 games), Danny Barrett Offensive Coaches * Offensive Coordinator/Running Backs – Brent Key * Quarterbacks – Danny Barrett * Wide Receivers – Sean Beckton * Offensive Line – Allen Mogridge * Tight Ends/H-Backs – Keegan Kennedy * Graduate Assistants – Rob Calabrese and Josh Linam * Offensive Quality Control – Sean Fitzgerald Defensive Coaches * Defensive Coordinator/Linebackers – Chuck Bresnahan * Safeties – Andrew Thacker * Cornerbacks – Travis Fisher * Defensive Line – Lorenzo Costantini * Graduate Assistant – Patrick Bastien and Zach Crespo * Defensive Quality Control – Mike Sims-Walker  width = \\"35\\"  valign = \\"top\\"  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Special Teams * Special Teams Coordinator – Keegan Kennedy Administrative Staff * Athletic Director (A.D.) – George O'Leary (resigned after 6 games), Brad Stricklin * Assistant A.D. for Football Operations – Marty O'Leary * Director of Player Development – Kristy Belden * Director of Player Personnel – Mike Buscemi * Recruiting Assistant – Ryan Callaghan * Special Assistant to Head Coach – Manny Messeguer } Roster { class=\\"toccolours\\"  left;\\" - ! colspan=\\"9\\" style=\\"background-color: #000000; color: white; text-align: center; ;border:2px solid #BD9B60;\\"2015 UCF Knights roster -  style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Quarterbacks *8 Tyler Harris – Redshirt Freshman *9 Bo Schneider – Freshman *12 Sean Pratt – Sophomore *13 Justin Holman – Junior Halfbacks *17 Cedric Thompson – Redshirt Senior *31 Gary Demarest – Redshirt Freshman *32 Mario Mathis – Redshirt Sophomore *39 Joseph Puopolo – Redshirt Senior *40 Chris Larsen – Redshirt Freshman *42 Justin Rae – Redshirt Freshman *43 Aaron Cochran – Freshman Fullbacks *44 Mark Messeguer – Redshirt Freshman Running backs *7 Dontravious Wilson – Junior *27 Taj McGowan – Freshman *28 William Stanback – Junior *29 CJ Jones – Redshirt Freshman *37 Michael Willett – Redshirt Sophomore *45 Daron Humphrey – Redshirt Junior Wide Receivers *2 Nick Patti – Redshirt Junior *5 Jordan Franks – Sophomore *6 Tristan Payton – Freshman *10 Kyle Coltrain – Redshirt Sophomore *12 Blake Tiralosi – Redshirt Junior *14 Pete DiNovo – Redshirt Sophomore *20 Taylor Oldham – Redshirt Junior *21 Jamari Fye – Redshirt Sophomore *23 Adrian Gordon – Redshirt Sophomore *25 Tristan Reaves – Redshirt Freshman *26 Trace Ryan – Redshirt Freshman *80 Tre'Quan Smith – Redshirt Freshman *81 Chris Johnson – Redshirt Sophomore *82 D'erren Wilson – Freshman *83 Cam Stewart – Freshman *86 Michael Colubiale – Redshirt Sophomore *88 Jordan Akins – Sophomore *89 Hayden Jones – Redshirt Junior width=\\"25\\"  style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Tight Ends *46 Zack Laurinaitis – Redshirt Freshman *49 Joe Turk – Freshman *84 Michael Campbell – Redshirt Junior *87 Cal Bloom – Redshirt Junior Offensive Line *55 Joey Grant – Graduate Student *61 Tarik Cook – Redshirt Senior *62 Micah Anderson – Redshirt Junior *63 Nick George – Redshirt Freshman *66 Aaron Evans – Redshirt Sophomore *67 Jared Warren – Redshirt Sophomore *68 Charles Sprenkel – Redshirt Sophomore *70 Luke Palmer – Redshirt Freshman *71 Chester Brown – Redshirt Junior *72 Tyler Hudanick – Freshman *73 Jason Rae – Junior *74 Jake Brown – Freshman *75 Tate Hernly – Redshirt Sophomore *76 Colby Watson – Junior *78 Wyatt Miller – Redshirt Freshman *79 Chavis Dickey – Sophomore Linebackers *16 Mark Rucker – Redshirt Junior *34 Justin McDonald – Junior *40 Chequan Burkett – Redshirt Sophomore *41 Demeitre Brim – Redshirt Junior *50 Domenic Spencer – Senior *51 Errol Clarke – Redshirt Junior *52 Maurice Russell – Redshirt Junior *53 Quintin Hampton – Freshman *54 Alex Hunt – Redshirt Sophomore *56 Pat Jasinski – Freshman *57 Neal Nelson – Freshman *58 Marcus Foster – Freshman width=\\"25\\"  style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Defensive Line *49 Seyvon Lowry – Redshirt Sophomore *59 Monte Taylor – Junior *69 Thomas Niles – Redshirt Senior *90 Lance McDowdell – Senior *91 Joey Connors – Redshirt Freshman *92 Luke Adams – Redshirt Junior *93 Tony Guerad – Redshirt Sophomore *94 Demetris Anderson – Redshirt Senior *95 Jamiyus Pittman – Sophomore *96 A.J.

The 2015 schedule is the first for the conference under a new permanent system developed to address expanded membership and the creation of divisions. UCF will face eight conference opponents: Cincinnati, UConn, East Carolina, Houston, South Florida, Temple, Tulane, and Tulsa. The Knights will also play four non-conference games: Florida International (C-USA), Furman (FCS), South Carolina (SEC), and Stanford (Pac-12). :Source: ==Game summaries== FIU This was the fourth meeting between UCF and the FIU Golden Panthers, with the series tied 2–2. The Knights won the previous meeting, a 38–0 shutout at FIU in 2013. FIU got onboard first with a field goal. UCF then responded with two touchdowns by Jordan Akins to take a 14–3 lead at halftime. In the second half, the Knights were plagued with defensive struggles which allowed FIU to take the lead 15–14. UCF then set up within field goal distance with thirty-seconds left; however, Matthew Wright's field goal was blocked and FIU ran out the clock. The loss was UCF's first to a Florida opponent since September 17, 2011, UCF's first meeting with FIU, as well as UCF's first home opener loss since 2007 to Texas. The loss also marks UCF's first home loss since September 28, 2013 to South Carolina, as well as UCF's first Thursday night loss since November 3, 2011 against Tulsa. Stanford This was the first meeting between UCF and the Stanford Cardinal. The trip represented the longest travel for any FBS team during the 2015 season, at 2,427 miles. The loss also results in UCF's second consecutive season starting with an 0–2 record. Furman This was the second meeting between UCF and the Furman Paladins, with the Paladins winning a 1984 game, 42–6. This was QB Bo Schneider's first career start, going 7-for-11 for 63 yards. UCF initially took a 12–0 lead, which included the first sacks of the season for defense, one of those resulting in a safety. After getting a turnover on downs, Furman scored a touchdown with 1:10 remaining in the half. At the third quarter, Tyler Harris started as QB. A few minutes into the 3rd quarter, Furman scored a 61-yard touchdown which gave them the lead 13–12. Towards the end of the quarter, UCF kicked a field goal to retake the lead 15–13. Furman responded with a 55-yard field goal to retake the lead 16–15. With forty-nine seconds remaining, QB Tyler Harris threw an interception which sealed the victory for the Paladins. The game marked the Knights first loss to an FCS team since ascending to Division I-A (FBS) in 1996 (20–1), as well as their first 0–3 start since 2004. South Carolina This was the fifth meeting between UCF and the South Carolina Gamecocks. With the loss, UCF remains winless against South Carolina. After falling behind 5–0, Bo Schneider, in his second career start, led the Knights to fourteen unanswered points to take a 14–5 lead with five minutes remaining in the second quarter. After entering halftime with a six-point lead, UCF was held scoreless in the second half. USC QB Lorenzo Nunez threw for two scores, Pharoh Cooper had two touchdowns, one rushing and one receiving, and K Elliott Fry had a field goal to give the Gamecocks a 31–14 win. The loss dropped the Knights to 0–4, the first time the team has started the season winless through four games since 2004, when UCF went 0–11. Tulane The game marked the seventh meeting between UCF and the Tulane Green Wave. UCF holds a 5–2 advantage against Tulane, losing for the first time in the series since 2006. The loss marks the first time UCF lost their first conference game of the season since 2009 when they fell to Southern Miss. After going ahead 7–0 with a pass from Bo Schneider to Jordan Franks, Tulane scored 24 unanswered points taking a 24–10 halftime lead. By the end of the 3rd quarter, Tulane took a 38–10 lead. Additionally, Bo Schneider was sacked 7 times for a total of 45 yards, one of those resulting in a fumble, and threw 3 interceptions, each resulting in Tulane touchdowns. Tyler Harris entered after the beginning of the 4th quarter and scored 3 touchdowns on all of his drives, each connecting to D'erren Wilson, who finished the game with 7 receptions, 114 yards, and 3 touchdowns. UConn This was the third meeting between UCF and the UConn Huskies. UCF beat UConn in 2013 62–17 in Orlando, while in 2014, UConn upset UCF 37–29 in East Hartford. As of the start of the 2015 season, the 2014 meeting was the only conference loss for UCF since joining The American. QB Justin Holman returned for the Knights after a three-game absence following his injury against Stanford. On the first drive, Holman led the Knights seventy-three yards but UCF had to settle for a 19-yard field goal from Matthew Wright. Afterwards the Huskies dominated the Knights both defensively and offensively and scored forty unanswered points to score their second consecutive victory over UCF. Through six games, the Knights were outscored 70–3 in the third quarter. 3 turnovers doomed the Knights, including Hayden Jones accidentally stepping out of his end zone on a kickoff return and going back in to take a knee that ended up giving UConn a safety in the 1st quarter. This loss broke UCF's thirteen game home conference win streak dating back to November 25, 2011 against UTEP. This was also the lowest home attendance for a UCF game since November 25, 2011 against UTEP with an average of 26,669 fans. The 40–13 loss became the largest loss deficit in Bright House Networks Stadium history at this point, as well as the largest home loss deficit for UCF since they fell to Pittsburgh 52–7 in 2006 in the Citrus Bowl. The Knights are one of five winless teams remaining following week seven. Two days after the game, George O'Leary announced that he was stepping down as the interim director of athletics. Temple This will be the third meeting between UCF and the Temple Owls. UCF holds a 2–0 advantage, with their first victory involving a one-handed catch by JJ Worton in the final minutes of the 4th quarter, which to this day remains one of the best catches in college football. UCF then beat Temple 34–14 in Orlando in 2014, their last meeting. At the beginning of the second quarter, Temple got on top 14–3. Later on in the second quarter, UCF recorded their first interception of the season as Shaquill Griffin caught a pass by P.J. Walker and returned it for an 81-yard touchdown. At halftime, UCF trailed Temple 14–13 after a field goal by Matthew Wright. UCF then took the lead in the third quarter after another Matthew Wright field goal, 16–14. Temple, however, pulled away with two touchdowns both with 2-point conversions. 2 interceptions by Holman in the second half as well as penalties from offense ended UCF's quest for bowl eligibility for the first time since 2011. Houston This was the seventh meeting between UCF and the Houston Cougars. UCF had won the previous four games, with the two most recent victories from defensive plays, both from Brandon Alexander. The Knights had a promising opening drive, which ended on an 85-yard fumble return for Houston to take a 7–0 lead. Afterwards, Holman connected with Tristan Payton for a 46-yard touchdown, the first of Payton's career, to tie the game 7–7. After taking a 10–7 lead in the second quarter the Knights allowed 52 unanswered points. The 49-point loss is the largest home-loss in UCF history, and the 59-points allowed is the fourth-most in program history. Following the loss, UCF head football coach George O'Leary resigned. Cincinnati This was the first meeting between UCF and the Cincinnati Bearcats. In a disastrous first game as interim head coach, Danny Barrett's team struggled offensively and defensively against his alma mater, the Cincinnati Bearcats. Cincinnati QB Gunner Kiel managed to complete all 15 of his passes for 319 yards and 5 TDs, as defense struggled tremendously despite the second interception of the season by Shaquill Griffin. Field goals were also a struggle for UCF this game, as the Knight's two field goal attempts were all missed. CJ Jones managed to score the only points for UCF in the 4th quarter to avoid the shutout. Tulsa This was the ninth meeting between UCF and the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. Tulsa holds a 5–3 advantage, but UCF won the most recent one in 2014 with a 31–7 blowout. UCF has yet to defeat Tulsa at H.A. Chapman Stadium. During the first quarter, Holman threw an underthrown deep pass to Tre'Quan Smith, who turned around and leaped over a Tulsa defensive back to catch the ball in midair. However, UCF trailed at halftime 24–3. UCF came alive in the third quarter and scored 2 touchdowns as well as a field goal to only trail 24–20 by the beginning of the 4th quarter, one of the touchdowns being the first of Taj McGowan's career. Additionally, defense recorded two interceptions by Brendin Straubel and Chequan Burkett, as well as a fumble forced by Tre Neal on a Tulsa kickoff return. UCF's offense ended up scoring on all of those opportunities. Despite this, Tulsa ended up pulling away with a 45–30 victory, which included a pick-six. As of this week, UCF is one of two winless teams, the other one being the Kansas Jayhawks. East Carolina This was the fourteenth meeting between UCF and the East Carolina Pirates. East Carolina has a 10–4 advantage, UCF had won the last two games, the most recent being in 2014 with a Hail Mary pass in the final seconds from Justin Holman to Breshad Perriman, 32–30. UCF's first drive ended on a Tre'Quan Smith TD while Jordan Franks caught a 44-yard pass beforehand. That was the last time the Knights scored. Plagued by turnovers and injuries, including one to starting QB Justin Holman, UCF lost 44–7 to East Carolina. South Florida This was the seventh meeting between UCF and the South Florida Bulls in the War On I–4. USF has a 5–2 advantage. UCF had won the last two, with the most recent giving the USF Bulls their first home shutout in school history as well as UCF's first victory at Raymond James Stadium, 16–0. This was the first game since 1995 that UCF wore both black jerseys and black pants. Similar to the last game, UCF ended up scoring only on their first drive, which was a field goal by Matthew Wright. UCF then allowed 44 unanswered points by the Bulls, which gave UCF their first loss to USF since 2008, as well as their first conference loss in the series. This was the 12th loss of the season, which made UCF finish winless for the third time in their history. UCF was not alone, as the Kansas Jayhawks finished their season 0–12 as well, both teams being the only FBS teams to go winless. ==References== UCF Knights Category:UCF Knights football seasons UCF Knights football team Category:College football winless seasons ","title":"2015 UCF Knights football team"},{"id":"46356733","text":"Life reconstruction of Hibernaspis macrolepis Hibernaspidoidei is a taxon of extinct amphiaspidid heterostracan agnathans whose fossils are restricted to Lower Devonian marine strata of Siberia near the Taimyr Peninsula. In life, hibernaspid amphiaspidids are thought to be benthic animals that lived most of their lives mostly buried in the sediment of a series of hypersaline lagoons. All amphiaspids are easily distinguished from other heterostracans in that all of the plates of the cephalothorax armor are fused into a single, muff-like unit, so that the forebody of the living animal would have looked like a potpie or a hot waterbottle with a pair of small, or degenerated eyes, a pair of branchial openings for exhaling, and, in the case of hibernaspids, a simple, slit-like mouth at the anterior end of a tube-like head. ==Taxonomy== Hibernaspidoidei contains three families.  Hibernaspididae  This family is monotypic, containing only the genus Hibernaspis.  Eglonaspididae  This is a diverse family that contains five monotypic genera, including Eglonaspis, Gerronaspis, Lecaniaspis, Empedaspis, and Pelurgaspis.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they get caught in an Asgardian fight. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Shalisha Francis and directed by John Terlesky. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. Jamie Alexander and Maximiliano Hernández appear as Sif and Jasper Sitwell, respectively, also reprising their roles from the films. The former does so in a tie-in with Thor: The Dark World, the latter in set up for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. \\"Yes Men\\" originally aired on ABC on March 11, 2014, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 5.99 million viewers. ==Plot== The Asgardian Lorelei enslaves a biker gang and begins to form an army. S.H.I.E.L.D. detects the opening of the bifröst in California and Coulson's team travel there, meeting Sif, who has been dispatched by 'Odin' (Loki in disguise) to recapture Lorelei. She enlists their help, explaining that Lorelei escaped imprisonment during Malekith's attack on Asgard, detailing Lorelei's abilities and showing them a device designed to prevent her to speak. Six hundred years earlier Lorelei almost seized the kingdom with an army of Asgardian men. The team trace Lorelei to the biker gang's bar, and a fight ensues between Sif and Lorelei, while the team fights Lorelei's men. The device to inhibit Lorelei's voice is damaged, and she enchants Ward and escapes to Las Vegas with him. Fitz attempts to repair the voice inhibitor while Skye tracks Ward and Lorelei, and the team head to Las Vegas to find them. However Lorelei and Ward instead hijack the Bus, and Lorelei enchants Fitz, who had succeeded in repairing the voice inhibitor; using it as bait, Fitz is able to trap Sif in the cell. May confronts Lorelei, who reveals that Ward is in love with Skye, and orders Ward to kill May. Sif is able to trick Lorelei into entering the cell and defeats her in a fight; Lorelei's power fails as soon as the device is attached to her neck, freeing Ward and Fitz. Sif takes Lorelei back to Asgard, while May ends her relationship with Ward. Coulson informs Skye of the GH325's alien origins; they decide to keep it secret from the others until they have answers from Nick Fury, and pursue the Clairvoyant in the meantime. May eavesdrops using a listening device, and then makes a call on a secret secure line, telling an unidentified person that 'Coulson knows'. ==Production== Development In March 2014, Marvel revealed that the fifteenth episode would be titled \\"Yes Men\\", and would be written by Shalisha Francis, with John Terlesky directing. Casting In February 2014, Jamie Alexander was revealed to be reprising her role of Sif from Thor and Thor: The Dark World in the episode, with executive producer Jed Whedon saying, \\"We always have our radar up for ways to tie our series into the Marvel films and bringing in an Asgardian really cements that connection.\\" In March 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, respectively.

Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins With the appearance of Asgardians Sif and Lorelei, the former mentions that the latter escaped prison during the Dark Elf attack, as depicted in Thor: The Dark World. Hernández reprises his role from the films, and talks to Coulson about the whereabouts of S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, who appears in Captain America: The Winter Soldier alongside Hernández's Sitwell. The episode also introduces the motorcycle gang Dogs of Hell, whose New York chapter is later seen in the second season of Daredevil. ==Release== Broadcast \\"Yes Men\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on March 11, 2014.

The medley was also released as the B-side of Wings' No. 1 single \\"With a Little Luck\\". Both \\"Backwards Traveller\\" and \\"Cuff Link\\" were recorded in October 1977 and completed in January 1978. By this point in the London Town recording sessions, guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Joe English had left the band, so the songs were recorded by only McCartney, Linda McCartney and Denny Laine. ==Backwards Traveller== \\"Backwards Traveller\\" is only a little more than a minute long. It is a \\"mid-tempo rocker\\" in the key of C major. The song consists of a verse followed by two repetitions of the refrain. The lyrics are about the singer going back in time while \\"sailing songs\\" and \\"wailing on the moon.\\" Paul McCartney plays drums, bass guitar, acoustic guitar and keyboards. According to music professor Vincent Benitez, the organ arrangement with its repeating chords gives the song a \\"retrospective, 1960s-style sound\\". Rolling Stone Magazine critic Janet Maslin praises the beginning of \\"Backwards Traveller\\" as \\"brilliant, jolting hard-rock\\" but laments that it ends quickly as if no one could be bothered to complete it. Author Howard Sounes also complains that the song sounds \\"half-finished\\". Chip Madinger and Mark Easter likewise believe that the song had more potential than its ultimate fate as the prelude to \\"Cuff Link\\". Author John Blaney describes \\"Backwards Traveller\\" as \\"a typical McCartney pot-boiler\\". Music critic Tom Waseleski describes it as \\"a swinging little rocker.\\" A demo version of \\"Backwards Traveler\\" featuring drums, drum machine, keyboard and vocals has been released on several bootleg albums. Neil Hamburger covered \\"Backwards Traveler\\" on his 2019 Drag City album Still Dwelling, in an ambitious version with a more expansive arrangement by Erik Paparozzi, current bass player in Denny Laine's band. ==Cuff Link== \\"Cuff Link\\" is an instrumental in the key of D minor. Its original title was \\"Off the Cuff Link\\". Perhaps the most interesting feature of \\"Cuff Link\\" is the use of a Moog synthesizer to sound like a sitar. Blaney describes the song as \\"uninspired\\". Benitez considers it \\"unimaginative\\".

In life, siberaspids are thought to be benthic animals that lived most of their lives mostly buried in the sediment of a series of hypersaline lagoons. As with all amphiaspids, siberiaspids are easily distinguished from other heterostracans in that all of the plates of the cephalothorax armor are fused into a single, muff-like unit, so that the forebody of the living animal would have looked like a flattened potpie or a hot waterbottle with a pair of small, or degenerated eyes sometimes flanked by preorbital openings, a pair of branchial openings for exhaling, and a simple, slit-like, or tube-like mouth. ==Taxonomy== Siberaspidoidei contains two families, Siberaspididae, and Tuxeraspididae.  Siberaspididae  This family contains two monotypic genera, Siberaspis, and Argyriaspis.  Tuxeraspididae  This family contains three monotypic genera, Tuxeraspis, Litotaspis, and Dotaspis. Tuxeraspis and Litoaspis are known primarily from fragments and portions of the head-region, while Dotaspis is known from a mostly intact headshield. These fragments, together with the anatomy of Dotaspis suggest the animals had large, flattened, circular cephalothoracic armor.Новицкая ЛИ (1986), \\"Древнейшие бесчелюстные СССР: Гетеростраки: Циaтacпиды, Aмфиacпиды, Птepacпиды.\\" Труды ПИН 219: 159c.

They share these resources and training materials through worldwide ministry trips and speaking engagements in almost every state in the U.S. and numerous other nations. On October 12, 2014, several reports were filed on ripoffscams.com by former associates of the Hiramines, accusing them of running a Christian cult, subscribing to bizarre spiritual practices, and breaking labor laws by not paying their staff or interns. The organization also bends international business laws in their overseas operations, utilizing free labor from \\"advocates\\" and selling resources in Singapore without paying taxes. ==History== In 2003, Julie Hiramine founded Generations of Virtue in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Its original scope was to teach sexual integrity to families, but they have evolved to educate on a myriad of other topics related to sexual purity including interpreting media, cultural parenting, safe technology use, practically equipping youth for success, strategic family development, and raising generations of virtue.http://lamplighterbooks.com/?cat=4 GOV is a 501c3 non-profit organization. Through the years, the organization has worked with several worldwide organizations including Charisma House Media, the Tween Gospel Alliance, Every Nation churches, World Changers' Summit, Hearts at Home, MOPS, and the International Children's Ministry Network. In 2003, Generations of Virtue was invited to the New York State Homeschool Convention. From there, they began working with moms' groups, the homeschool arena, and churches in the U.S. Over the years, Generations of Virtue has broadened its reach to public, private, and international schools and hundreds of church networks throughout the world. Generations of Virtue has ministered in numerous denominations and church movements, including the Methodist, Anglican, Baptist, Assemblies of God, Evangelical Free Church, Nondenominational, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Mennonite, Pentecostal, Calvary Chapel, Full Gospel Assembly, and Vineyard. Hiramine has written for Charisma Magazine and Charisma Publishing published her debut book in 2012. Hiramine is also a Director for the organization True Value of a Woman,True Value of a Woman Board of Directors and frequently speaks at parenting and family conferences around the world. After their initial success, Generations of Virtue went nearly bankrupt after a series of allegations that they operated as a cult, complete with \\"volunteer\\" staff who did everything from run the ministry to homeschooling, cooking and cleaning for the Hiramines. ==Operations== Generations of Virtue instructs leaders, educators and parents to be effective within their individual areas of influence. They accomplish this goal through strategic partnerships with key organizations both in the United States and internationally. GOV has released several book series, including Teknon and the Champion Warriors and Beautifully Made. In 2005, GOV introduced purity rings to their product line. In 2007, GOV started an internship program for youth ages 16–21. During the same year, they launched their international speaking tours.BP This Week: Protecting Purity at Break Point; published February 1, 2013; retrieved April 20, 2015 In 2011, Culture Shock was published by Standard Publishing. Both the leader's guide and student's guide have been distributed to over 4,000 people worldwide. In 2012, Generations of Virtue's DVD curriculum, Raising a Pure Generation, was released, although sales fell flat as consumer reviews were critical. ==Cult Accusations== After the initial scam report claiming Julie Hiramine and her husband Kay were little more than cult leaders illegally working a series of underage women (a manipulative form of \\"volunteering\\"), Generations of Virtue was dropped from all of their USA engagements. Since then, nearly all of their work has been done outside the country, but with only the Hiramine's children and a network of overseas volunteers as staff. On October 26 2015, an article published on The Intercept, alleges Kay Hiramine was secretly working for the government, in a Christian cover-up that put legitimate humanitarian workers lives at risk https://theintercept.com/2015/10/26/pentagon-missionary-spies- christian-ngo-front-for-north-korea-espionage/ https://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/generations-of-virtue/generations-of- virtue-kay-hiramine-cult-abuse-mind-control-monument-colorado-1191069 . ==Singapore Advocates== Generations of Virtue utilizes the volunteer workforce of a modest network of Singaporean moms (\\"advocates\\"). While these women initially volunteered, many of them have privately expressed they do not feel they can stop serving without being ostracized by others in their community who boast deep loyalty to the organization's founders. Many of them are afraid to speak up about the lack of financial transparency, and the expectation they should be giving their limited resources of time and money with nothing in return. While the Singapore advocates are mostly locals, several have included American citizens who have slowly shed ties due to the possibility of indictment by the authorities related to illegal import and sales. Illegal sales are book and material sales typically following workshops hosted by both the Hiramine's and the Singapore advocates, and yet sales tax has never been paid, or an officially business license issued, causing some to speculate the delay in government investigation is related to one advocate's https://www.facebook.com/carol.loi.puiwan ties to the government. Despite this, many state it is only a matter of time before the authorities step in and back-taxes are required. https://www.facebook.com/GenerationsOfVirtueAsia https://www.facebook.com/GenerationsOfVirtueAsia/photos/a.423542634406766/2775124692581870 . ==References *https://christandpopculture.com/when- serving-the-government-gets-in-the-way-of-serving-god/ *https://theintercept.com/2015/10/26/pentagon-missionary-spies-christian-ngo- front-for-north-korea-espionage/ *https://ripoffscams.com/reports- filed/generations-of-virtue/rochester-new-york/generations-of-virtue-kay-and- julie-hiramine-the-history-of-gov-as-told-by-one-who-was-there-monument- colorado/842176/ *Generations of Virtue Official Website * * Red Cross Category:Organizations established in 2003 Category:Evangelicalism in Colorado Category:Organizations based in Colorado Springs, Colorado Category:Religion in Colorado Springs, Colorado Category:Christian charities based in the United States Category:Christian organizations established in the 20th century ","title":"Generations of Virtue"},{"id":"46356840","text":"Li Jia may refer to: *Li Jia (born 1961), male Chinese politician, Deputy Communist Party Secretary of Inner Mongolia *Li Jia (born 1964), male Chinese politician, former Communist Party Secretary of Zhuhai *Li Jia (born 1966), female Chinese politician, former Party Secretary of Ziyang, Sichuan *Li Jia (table tennis), (born 1981) female table tennis player, peak of career from 2000 to 2003 *Li Kezhu (李柯竺), born Li Jia, Chinese actress who appeared in The Park (2007 film) ","title":"Li Jia"},{"id":"46356847","text":"728B Naval Air Squadron (728B NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1945 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"728B Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46356875","text":"728C Naval Air Squadron (728C NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1958 Category:1958 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"728C Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46356877","text":"The Nakpil-Bautista House (Tagalog, Bahay Nakpil-Bautista) is one of the old houses found in the district of Quiapo, Manila. It was built in 1914 by Arcadio Arellano. The two-house originally sits on two lots, having a total area of 500 square meters.Nakpil-Bautista Foundation Inc. Obusan T., Santos- Viola M. P. 2014 Brochure The National Historical Commission of the Philippines declared the house as a cultural property on August 25, 2011.http://bahaynakpil.org/bahay-nakpil-bautista-receives-support/comment- page-1/,Bahay Nakpil-Bautista website Today, the house is a museum showcasing items of the Katipunan, paintings, among others. ==History== Arcadio Arellano built the house for Dr. Ariston Bautista and his wife, Perona Nakpil, which survives on 432 Barbosa Street (now A. Bautista Street), Quiapo, two blocks away from the Enriquez house.http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/91445/remembering- physician-and-patriot-ariston-bautista, Philippine Daily Inquirer Built in 1914, the house is typical of its period: in the lower storey, thin, narrow, brick walls pressed together by wooden studs; upstairs, rooms aired by large calados and shaded by sufficient media aguas. ==Architecture== Postcard showing the floor plans of the house The lot measures 500 square meters and had 2 storeys, with wood and stone as primary construction materials. The ground floor consists of the '‘zaguan’’ (parking area for horse-drawn carriage), ‘’cuarto’’ (bedroom), ‘’sala’’ (living room), patio, and the ‘’plateria’’ (area for designing jewelry). The upper floor contains the ‘’ante sala’’ (anteroom), ‘’sala’’, patio, ‘’comedor’’ (dining room), ‘’azotea’’, ‘’cuarto’’, ‘’oficina’’, and ‘’cocina’’ (kitchen). The second floor was built with wood to resist earthquakes. The house is a Bahay na bato and had two entrances, a street door and a large iron gate, typical of many Manila houses of the period. The large iron gate leads to the estero behind. The lower story is in the wood-and-stone style post-1880. Rodrigo Perez III (also known as Dom Bernardo, OSB), architect and scholar, says that, in many Filipino houses whether in the Cordillera or in the lowland countryside, “space is surrounded by space.” In a lecture at Nakpil-Bautista house in 1999, he showed how Arellano’s creation manifests this idea. Going up the main stairway the visitor arrives at hall, the caida, with doors on all four sides leading to the surrounding rooms, the dining room, the living room, and two suites of bedrooms. Two sets of doors slide Japanese-style to open, vistas extending from street to estero. It does not have ornate decorative details. Its inspiration is the Vienna Secession, a style not well known in the Philippines during this time.http://bahaynakpil.org/home/,Bahay Nakpil-Bautista website Viennese artists of the 1890s reacted to the fashionable revival of historic styles by creating a style with a contemporary character. The Secession was thus the same as art nouveau. After Dr. Ariston Bautista and his wife, Petrona Nakpil the painter, received a gift of Secession furniture, they designed their entire house around the furniture motifs. Window grilles overlooking the estero have vertical floral stems with flowers sized to small squares, while grilles facing the street display abstract interpretation of lyres. The upper exterior wall is simply decorated with a band of square insets. On the tracery of the interior ransom walls are abstract interpretations of the kiyapo plant. The upper storey has a museum honouring both the Nakpils and two ancestors who played a role in the Katipunan, Julio Nakpil and his wife Gregoria de Jesus. After the house was finished, Dr. Bautista designed new furniture with the same motifs and had them executed by his Pampango carpenter in residence. The original furniture was divided among the heirs in the 1970s. Some of the present pieces were commissioned to suit the museum’s purposes. National historical marker ==Historical significance== Key figures in Philippine history had lived in the Nakpil-Bautista House. Among them are Dr. Ariston Bautista, one of the first professors in the University of the Philippines College of Medicine, also invented a medicine to combat cholera. Gregoria de Jesus, widow of Andres Bonifacio; later married to Julio Nakpil, who was the brother of Petrona, Juan Nakpil, a National Artist for Architecture, and Angel Nakpil.

It is an intrinsic property of the species. The SI unit of molar attenuation coefficient is the square metre per mole (), but in practice, quantities are usually expressed in terms of M−1⋅cm−1 or L⋅mol−1⋅cm−1 (the latter two units are both equal to ). In older literature, the cm2/mol is sometimes used; 1 M−1⋅cm−1 equals 1000 cm2/mol. The molar attenuation coefficient is also known as the molar extinction coefficient and molar absorptivity, but the use of these alternative terms has been discouraged by the IUPAC. ==Beer–Lambert law== The absorbance of a material that has only one attenuating species also depends on the pathlength and the concentration of the species, according to the Beer–Lambert law :A = \\\\varepsilon c\\\\ell, where *ε is the molar attenuation coefficient of that material; *c is the molar concentration of those species; *ℓ is the pathlength. Different disciplines have different conventions as to whether absorbance is decadic (10-based) or Napierian (e-based), i.e., defined with respect to the transmission via common logarithm (log10) or a natural logarithm (ln). The molar attenuation coefficient is usually decadic. When ambiguity exists, it is best to indicate which one applies. When there are N attenuation species in a solution, the overall absorbance is the sum of the absorbances for each individual species i: :A = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^N A_i = \\\\ell \\\\sum_{i = 1}^N \\\\varepsilon_i c_i. The composition of a mixture of N attenuating species can be found by measuring the absorbance at N wavelengths (the values of the molar coefficient of attenuation for each species at these wavelengths must also be known). The wavelengths chosen are usually the wavelengths of maximum absorption (absorbance maxima) for the individual species. None of the wavelengths must be an isosbestic point for a pair of species. The set of the following simultaneous equations can be solved to find the concentrations of each attenuating species: :\\\\begin{cases} A(\\\\lambda_1) = \\\\ell\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\varepsilon_i(\\\\lambda_1) c_i,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ldots\\\\\\\\\\\\ A(\\\\lambda_N) = \\\\ell\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\varepsilon_i(\\\\lambda_N) c_i.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} The molar attenuation coefficient (in units of cm2) is directly related to the attenuation cross section via the Avogadro constant NA: :\\\\sigma = \\\\ln(10) \\\\frac{10^3}{N_\\\\text{A}} \\\\varepsilon \\\\approx 3.823 532 16 \\\\times 10^{-21}\\\\,\\\\varepsilon. ==Mass attenuation coefficient== The mass attenuation coefficient is equal to the molar attenuation coefficient divided by the molar mass. ==Proteins== In biochemistry, the molar attenuation coefficient of a protein at depends almost exclusively on the number of aromatic residues, particularly tryptophan, and can be predicted from the sequence of amino acids. Similarly, the extinction coefficient of nucleic acids at 260 nm can be predicted given the nucleotide sequence. If the molar attenuation coefficient is known, it can be used to determine the concentration of a protein in solution. ==References *Nikon MicroscopyU: Introduction to Fluorescent Proteins includes a table of molar attenuation coefficient of fluorescent proteins.

Paleontologicheskii Zhurnal.(3): 112-116 The animal had small, possibly degenerate eyes that were flanked laterally by a small, crescent-shaped branchial opening. The small eyes, in turn, laterally flank a small, slit-shaped mouth at the center of the anterior-most end of the cephalothorax. The external surface of the armor has a unique micro- ornamentation of a pattern of star-like shapes. == References == Category:Amphiaspidida Category:Devonian jawless fish Category:Early Devonian fish Category:Cyathaspidiformes genera Category:Fauna of Siberia Category:Fossils of Russia Category:Early Devonian first appearances Category:Devonian extinctions Category:Fossil taxa described in 1989 ","title":"Amphoraspis"},{"id":"46357220","text":"Melaleuca lateralis is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a showy shrub, well suited to horticulture, distinguished by its very small leaves and small clusters of pink flowers along the older stems.Melaleuca lateralis fruit == Description == Melaleuca lateralis is a bushy shrub growing to about tall. Except on the youngest growth, the leaves and branches are glabrous. The leaves are arranged alternately around the stem and are long and wide, linear to narrow oval in shape, roughly semi-circular in cross section and usually have a blunt end. This species flowers profusely with deep pink flowers in clusters along the stems. The clusters contain between 4 and 15 individual flowers and are up to in diameter. The petals are long and fall off soon after the flower opens. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 4 to 12 stamens. Flowering occurs in early spring and is followed by the fruit which are woody capsules long in loose clusters along the stem. ==Taxonomy and naming== This species was first described in 1852 by the Russian botanist Nikolai Turczaninow in Bulletin de la classe physico-mathématique de l'Académie Impériale des sciences de Saint-Petersburg. The specific epithet (lateralis) is \\"in reference to the inflorescence being inserted on the branchlets and branches below the leaves\\". ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca lateralis occurs in and between the Stirling Range and Lake King districts in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy gravel on floodplains. ==Conservation status== Melaleuca lateralis is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==References== lateralis Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1852 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Taxa named by Nikolai Turczaninow ","title":"Melaleuca lateralis"},{"id":"46357224","text":"Epocilla aurantiaca is a species of jumping spider found from India to Malaysia. ==References Further reading == Proszynski, J.

Gill, ca. 1849 George Morphett (21 May 1811 – 1893) was a settler in the colony of South Australia, and younger brother of John Morphett. ==History== Morphett was born in London to solicitor Nathaniel Morphett and his wife Mary, née Gliddon, of \\"Cummins\\", Ide, Devon. He travelled to Egypt in 1833 to meet up with his brother John. Together they toured Egypt and Italy before returning to England. He married Ann Hitchcock in 1835. When the Secondary Towns Association was formed in London in October 1838 for the purpose of establishing sites for secondary towns in the colony of South Australia, Morphett was appointed its Secretary. He emigrated to South Australia, arriving at Holdfast Bay on 12 December 1840 on the Brightman. In January–February 1841, accompanied by John Hill, he explored the arid plains due north of Morgan on behalf of the Association, searching for a reported fertile region, but found only hardship and disappointment. On 2 March 1841 Morphett was sworn in as a barrister and solicitor in the Supreme Court of South Australia.Southern Australian newspaper, 5 March 1841, p 3. He lived at North Adelaide, set up a legal practice in the city and returned to England. He returned to South Australia in 1846 on the barque Enmore with his wife and three children. A daughter was born during the voyage on 7 January 1846. James Philcox, land speculator, was on the same ship, also a return journey. He was involved in a large number of profitable transactions in the land speculation frenzy that the orderly Adelaide real estate market had become. One was the sale to a consortium of Jewish businessmen, including Morris Lyon Marks, of a block on Rundle Street for their synagogue. One of his last transactions was the sale, to wealthy Rundle Street draper George Hunt, of a block on Magill Road which became the site for his mansion, \\"Tranmere House\\", built in 1898. Morphett was named in an article in the Adelaide Times in December 1856, along with his friend James Philcox, John Grainger, Edmund Trimmer, and George Aston condemning certain land speculators for underhand practices, including conspiring to purchase government land at less than market prices. They were referred to as \\"land sharks\\" in the article. Morphett was appointed a director of the South Australian Marine & Fire & Life Assurance Company, the Bank of South Australia and several mining companies. In March 1860 he was elected to the district of West Torrens as a member of the South Australian House of Assembly.Statistical Record of the Legislature, 1836 to 2007 , Parliament of South Australia, pg.50 He was a conscientious and able member, a supporter of Robert Torrens's Real Property Act, but left the colony for London on the Orient on 31 October 1860 and never returned.

Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead: The Story of the National Lampoon is a 2015 American documentary film directed by Douglas Tirola. The film is about National Lampoon magazine, and how the magazine and its empire of spin-offs changed the course of comedy and humor.https://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/how-the-national-lampoon- changed-american-comedy-then-died/Content?oid=3029487 ==Synopsis== The film features new interviews with National Lampoon staff members and other notable figures who were fans of the magazine, as well as much never-before seen archival material and illustrations from the magazine, many of which have been animated. The film was shown at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City on 16 April. The premiere was at the IFC Center in Greenwich Village, New York City, on the evening of September 25, 2015. The title of the film is very similar to the title of a 2010 book about National Lampoon: Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead: The Writers and Artists who made National Lampoon Insanely Great by Rick Meyerowitz. The film refers to some of the same material, and features work from some of the same contributors, but the film is not actually based on the book. ==Poster== Both of the two posters for the film were drawn by Rick Meyerowitz. One is deliberately reminiscent of the original poster that Meyerowitz drew for the 1978 comedy Animal House, more correctly known as National Lampoon's Animal House, starring John Belushi. In the new film poster, instead of the fictional Delta Tau Chi House, the building portrayed is the National Lampoon magazine's headquarters, which were at 635 Madison Avenue in Manhattan. Another poster shows Rick Meyerowitz's piece, \\"Mona Gorilla\\", a parody of the Mona Lisa. Alternate advertising artwork features a reproduction of the famous but controversial cover of the January 1973 \\"Death\\" issue of the National Lampoon. Retaining the photo of the man holding a gun to a dog's head, the words \\"Buy This Magazine\\" in the original caption \\"If You Don't Buy This Magazine, We'll Kill This Dog\\" has been changed to \\"See This Documentary\\". The cover is also referenced in the above-mentioned poster by an illustration of the dog. However, in this case, the dog is holding a gun to its own head while holding a sign saying \\"At the end of my trope\\", a pun on the saying \\"At the end of my rope\\". ==Cast== The film is \\"bursting with glimpses of the magazine's contents\\". The film also features numerous new interviews, including those with Chevy Chase, John Landis, Judd Apatow, Kevin Bacon, Tim Matheson, John Goodman, Billy Bob Thornton, Meat Loaf, Christopher Buckley, Henry Beard, Matty Simmons, Tony Hendra, P. J. O'Rourke, Chris Miller, Anne Beatts, Mike Reiss, Sean Kelly, Brian McConnachie, Michael Gross, Janis Hirsch, Chris Cerf, Peter Kleinman, Judith Belushi Pisano, Rick Meyerowitz, Ivan Reitman, Bruce McCall, Al Jean, Beverly D'Angelo, Ed Subitzky, Sam Gross, Jerry Taylor, and many others, as well as archival footage of staffers and Lampoon performers, including John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Doug Kenney and Michael O'Donoghue. ==Reception== Ben Kenigsberg of Variety reviewed the film positively, calling it \\"generous and briskly entertaining\\" and \\"a real non-fiction crowdpleaser\\". He also commented that director Douglas Tirola \\"pulls it off with style [...] skillfully presenting a huge amount of material, including animations rendered after the style of Lampoon artwork.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"a lively, very entertaining look at the Lampoons unlikely empire\\". Paula Bernstein of Indiewire interviewed the director, Douglas Tirola, who commented, \\"What I liked about the Lampoon was there was no 'going too far'.\\" ==See also== *A Futile and Stupid Gesture ==ReferencesCategory:2015 films Category:2015 documentary films Category:American films Category:American documentary films Category:English-language films Category:National Lampoon films Category:Documentary films about comedy and comedians Category:Documentary films about the media ","title":"Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead (film)"},{"id":"46357315","text":"Thomas Washburne (c. 1963 - ) is a Republican member of the Indiana House of Representatives, representing the 64th District since 2013.

Senate Bill 385, which passed the Senate and has moved on to the House, would allow for defendants to receive the death penalty or a conviction of life without parole if they are charged of committing murder on a school grounds or in a place of religious worship. Washburne, who is a strong supporter of capital punishment, says that both of those situations warrant being added to the list of aggravators, which already includes defendants charged with dismembering a body.

All 35 seats in the Regional Assembly were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in twelve other autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. The People's Coalition, an electoral alliance made up of the People's Alliance (AP), the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the Liberal Union (UL) which fielded incumbent president José Antonio Rodríguez Martínez as its candidate, won the election with an unexpected absolute majority of seats in spite of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) having won the October 1982 general election in the region. The PSOE came second with 15 seats, its defeat mainly attributed to independent mayor of Santander Juan Hormaechea's personal appeal in the concurrent local elections securing an insurmountable lead of 22,000 votes in favour of the Coalition in the capital city of Cantabria. The Regionalist Party of Cantabria (PRC) entered the Assembly with 2 seats. The former ruling party of Spain, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD), had chosen to dissolve itself in February 1983 and did not contest the election as a result. While the election result would allow the Coalition's candidate, José Antonio Rodríguez, to get elected as regional president, a series of political discrepancies and a crisis between AP and PDP would lead to his resignation on 2 March 1984, being replaced by AP's Ángel Díaz de Entresotos until the end of the legislature. ==Overview== Electoral system The Regional Assembly of Cantabria was the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Cantabria, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the regional Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president. Transitory Provision First of the Statute established a specific electoral procedure for the first election to the Regional Assembly of Cantabria, to be supplemented by the provisions within Royal Decree-Law 20/1977, of 18 March, and its related regulations. Voting for the Regional Assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in Cantabria and in full enjoyment of their civil and political rights. The 35 members of the Regional Assembly of Cantabria were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Election date The Regional Council of Cantabria was required to call an election to the Regional Assembly of Cantabria within from 1 February to 31 May 1983. On 7 March 1983, it was confirmed that the first election to the Regional Assembly of Cantabria would be held on Sunday, 8 May, together with regional elections for twelve other autonomous communities as well as nationwide local elections, with the election decree being published in the Official State Gazette on 10 March. ==Background== The procedure for the approval of a regional statute of autonomy for Cantabria started after the Provincial Council of Santander, as well as more than two-thirds of the local councils in the province, voted for applying for autonomy as a single-province autonomous community out of historical reasons through the \\"slow-track\\" procedure set down under Article 143 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978. Cantabria was among the few regions not to have a pre-autonomic regime approved, together with La Rioja and Madrid. Negotiations for the drafting of a Statute ensued between the parties with parliamentary representation in the province—the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD), the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the Regionalist Party of Cantabria (PRC)—amid discussion on whether the province was to be integrated, either at the time or in the future, within the autonomous community of Castile and León (as the province of Santander had been part of the historical region of Old Castile). The regional Statute, which would establish the territory of the province as a single electoral constituency instead of the judicial districts which had been considered during the drafting process, was finally approved on 15 December 1981, coming into force on 31 January 1982. Both the PSOE and the UCD saw internal party crises develop within their respective parties in the years preceding the regional election. The PSOE had seen a regional leadership lasting only nine months as a result of the resignation of party's secretary general Pilar Quintanal in August 1980, who had been elected to the post in November 1979, being replaced by Congress deputy Jaime Blanco. The UCD crisis, which had initially started as an extension of the ongoing hardships within the national party with some members breaking away from the party's discipline, came further aggravated over the issue of the appointment of the new autonomous institutions as supporters of the incumbent president of the Regional Council, José Antonio Rodríguez Martínez, refused to support the party's official candidates, Leandro Valle as Rodríguez Martínez's successor and Justo de las Cuevas as Speaker of the Regional Assembly (the latter involved in a financial scandal). 8 UCD deputies rebelled on the party's discipline and allied with the PSOE, the PRC and the split Democratic Action Party (PAD) to have dissident UCD's Isaac Aja elected as the Assembly's Speaker, while maintaining Rodríguez Martínez in his post. All rebels, including Aja and Rodríguez Martínez, were subsequently expelled from the party, and the government formation delayed until April 1982, with the UCD subsequently dissolving local party groupings and sanctioning any party member who had shown support for the rebels. Later, the formation of the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) by former prime minister Adolfo Suárez had a severe impact in the UCD regional as its leadership joined the new party. ==Parliamentary status== The composition of the provisional Regional Assembly was determined by the provisions of Transitory Provision Fourth of the Statute, which established that its members be the elected deputies and senators for Cantabria in the Cortes Generales as well as the members of the Provincial Council of the then province of Santander. As a result, the composition of the provisional Regional Assembly of Cantabria upon its constitution in February 1982 was established as indicated below: {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:right;\\" + Parliamentary composition in February 1982 - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"100\\" Parties ! colspan=\\"2\\" Cortes Generales ! rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"35\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" Seats - ! width=\\"35\\" ! width=\\"35\\" ! width=\\"35\\" Total ! width=\\"35\\" +/− -  width=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" UCD  2  3  16  21  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" PSOE  2  1  8  11  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" PRC  0  0  1  1  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" PAD  1  0  0  1  n/a - style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\"  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Total  5  4  25  34  n/a } The 1982 Spanish general election resulted in changes in the composition of the provisional regional assembly, in accordance with the new seat distribution of Cortes Generales members in the region.

Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within fifteen days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one-thousandth of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election—with a compulsory minimum of 500 signatures—disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. A minimum of three deputies was required for the constitution of parliamentary groups in the Regional Assembly of Cantabria. Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which contested the election: {  style=\\"line-height:1.35em; font-size:95%; text-align:left;\\" - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Candidacy !

Subsequent attempts to seek electoral allies ahead of the incoming 1983 local and regional elections, mainly the conservative People's Alliance (AP) and the Christian democratic People's Democratic Party (PDP), had limited success due to concerns from both AP and UCD over such an alliance policy: AP strongly rejected any agreement that implied any sort of global coalition with UCD due to the party's ongoing decomposition, and prospects about a possible PDP–UCD merger did not come into fruition because of the latter's reluctance to dilute its brand within another party. By the time the UCD's executive had voted for the liquidation of the party's mounting debts and its subsequent dissolution on 18 February 1983, electoral alliances with the AP–PDP coalition had only been agreed in some provinces of the Basque Country and Galicia. Together with AP, the PDP had agreed to maintain their general election alliance—now rebranded as the People's Coalition—for the May local and regional elections, with the inclusion of the Liberal Union (UL), a political party created in January 1983 out of independents from the AP–PDP coalition in an attempt to appeal to former UCD liberal voters. The Coalition had seen its numbers soar from late February as a result of many former members from the UCD's Christian democratic wing joining the PDP. Even before the dissolution of the UCD, several of its former members in Cantabria, such as Mayor of Santander Juan Hormaechea, had already announced their integration within AP–PDP lists as early as January 1983. ==Opinion polls== he tables below lists opinion polling results in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication.

If unsuccessful, a new ballot would be held 48 hours later requiring only of a simple majority—more affirmative than negative votes—to succeed. If the proposed candidate was not elected, successive proposals were to be transacted under the same procedure. In the event of the investiture process failing to elect a regional president within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Regional Assembly was to be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called, with elected deputies merely serving out what remained of their four- year terms. In an investiture session held on 14 June 1983, José Antonio Rodríguez Martínez was re-elected as president of the Regional Council with an absolute majority of votes. {  center; font-size:95%;\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" Investiture José A.

Rodríguez and AP deputies within the People's Coalition had been forced to forcefully cohabitate throughout the first months of the legislature, until Rodríguez's dismissal of AP regional minister for Public Works Francisco Ignacio de Cáceres without prior consultation with the party's leadership resulted in the AP losing confidence in the regional president and in a breakup of the collaboration and the near- split of the AP–PDP alliance, as the later chose to side with Rodríguez. AP demanded Rodríguez Martínez to hand over his post, which the later refused, amid accusations of \\"irresponsability\\" and of political meddling to coherce local mayors into supporting the regional president. Manuel Fraga's party subsequently threatened to bring Rodríguez down through a motion of no confidence which, nonetheless, required the votes from the PDP deputies that still supported the President. The personal intervention in the crisis of AP and PDP leaders, Manuel Fraga and Óscar Alzaga, in an effort to prevent it from escalating further and disrupting the nationwide alliance between both parties, eventually led to Rodríguez Martínez accepting to resign the post of regional president while retaining his seat in the Regional Assembly and abandoning the People's Coalition group, leaving the new government in a parliamentary minority. AP member Ángel Díaz de Entresotos was nominated by the Regional Assembly to replace Rodríguez Martínez, but the infighting within the parties forming the regional government would dominate the Cantabrian political landscape in the ensuing months. {  style=\\"text- align:center; font-size:95%;\\" -  colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" Investiture Ángel Díaz de Entresotos (AP) - ! colspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"150px\\" Ballot → ! 16 March 1984 ! 18 March 1984 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Required majority →  18 out of 35  Simple - ! width=\\"1px\\" style=\\"background:green;\\"  align=\\"left\\"   - ! style=\\"background:red;\\"  align=\\"left\\"   - ! style=\\"background:gray;\\"  align=\\"left\\"   - ! style=\\"background:black;\\"  align=\\"left\\" Absentees   -  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"4\\" Sources } ==NotesReferences== ;Opinion poll sources ;Other Category:1983 in Cantabria Cantabria Category:Elections in Cantabria Category:May 1983 events in Europe ","title":"1983 Cantabrian regional election"},{"id":"46357384","text":"Sycon faulkneri is a species of calcareous sponge belonging to the family Sycettidae.

The letter is traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle, sent from Nicopolis of Macedonia (Roman province), addressed to Titus in Crete.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.King James Version subscription after Titus 3:15 states \\"It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.\\" There are charges that it is the work of an anonymous follower, after Paul's death in the first century AD. This chapter contains the greetings and instructions for Titus on dealing with deceivers. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 16 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Papyrus 32 (~AD 200; extant verses 11–15) * Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) * Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) * Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 3–16) * Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 1–3, 10–11) * Codex Claromontanus (~550) * Codex Coislinianus (~550; extant verses 1–3, 15–16) ==Opening Greeting (1:1–4)== The opening of the epistle to Titus is Paul's longest and most intricate, exceeding the openings of most other Pauline epistles. Verse 1–3 : Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness, in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began, but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior; NKJV Paul includes in this opening a summary of the gospel message, expounding the God's plan of salvation punctuated by the assertion that 'God never lies'. Verse 4 :To Titus, a true son in our common faith: ::Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. NKJV * \\"A true son\\" (NKJV; KJV: mine own son\\"; Greek: , gnēsiō teknō): Also \\"my genuine child\\" (as in 1 Timothy 1:2), that is, \\"converted by my instrumentality\\" (; ). * \\"In our common faith\\" (NKJV; KJV: \\"After the common faith\\"; Greek: ·; kata koinēn pistin): Paul treated Titus as \\"a genuine son\\" in virtue of \\"the faith common to all the people of God\\", a common brotherhood of Gentiles as well as Jews, thus embracing Titus who is a Gentile (; ). * \\"Grace, mercy, and peace\\" (Greek: ; , , ): The word \\"mercy\\" is omitted in some of the oldest manuscripts. But one of the best and oldest manuscripts supports it (see 1 Timothy 1:2; 2 Timothy 1:2). There are many similarities of phrase in all 'Pastoral Epistles' (that is Epistles to Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy).A. R. Faussett, The Pastoral Epistles of Paul the Apostle to Timothy and Titus. Commentary by A. R. Faussett. In: A Commentary, Critical, Practical, and Explanatory on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset and David Brown [1882]. ==The appointment of church officers (1:5–9)== The instructions for Titus run parallel to those for Timothy in 1 Timothy 3, but with some significant variations based on the distinct situation in Crete. Verse 5 : For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you— NKJV *\\"Crete\\": an island in the Mediterranean which was mentioned in Acts 27, when Paul's ship sailed past on his way to Rome). ==Instructions on Dealing with Deceivers (1:10–16)== Verse 12 : One of them, a prophet of their own, said, \\"Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.\\" NKJV * \\"One of them, a prophet of their own\\": refers to Epimenides, who wrote the cited words in one of his poems. Paul called him \\"one of them\\" (one of the Cretans), since Epimenides was a Cretian by birth, of the city of Gnossus, and according to a legend was sent by his father to his sheep in the field, when he at noon turned aside into a cave, and slept 57 years.Laert. l. 1. Vita Epimenidis. The designation as a \\"prophet\\" is because in Crete there were prophets of Jupiter,Alex. ab Alex. Genial. Dier, l. 4. c. 17. and Epimenides might be one of them, but the word 'prophets' can also refer to the priests among other cults, for examples, Baal's priests were called the prophets of Baal, and the prophets of the groves (). Epimenides was thought to be inspired by the gods in writing his poems that he is called by Apuleius,Florida, sect. 15. a famous fortune teller; and is said by Laertius to be very skilful in divination, and to have foretold many things which came to pass; also by the Grecians were supposed to be very dear to the gods; likewise, Balaam, the soothsayer and diviner, is called a prophet (). Add to this, that the passage next cited stands in a poem of this writer, entitled, \\"Concerning Oracles\\"; and it is easy to observe, that poets in common were usually called \\"vates\\", or prophets; so that the apostle speaks here with great propriety. * \\"Cretans are always liars\\": Epimenides wrote of the living of the inhabitants of the Crete as a sin common to human nature, that lying was \\"always\\" a governing vice among them, for instances, for saying that Jupiter's sepulchre was with them, when it was the sepulchre of Minos his son, which they had fraudulently obliterated; and for whichHymn. l. in Jovem, v. 8. Callimachus charges them with lying, and uses these very words of Epimenides; though he assigns a different reason from that now given, which is, that Jupiter died not, but always exists, and therefore his sepulchre could not be with them, but more than that, seemingly the Cretians regard lying as their national sin;Alex. ab Alex. l. 4. c. 13. and beside Epimenides, also said by others. Crete is, by Ovid,De Arte Amandi, l. 1. called \\"mendax Creta\\", lying Crete. Hence, with the Grecians, to \\"cretize\\", is proverbially used for to lie; this is a sin, than which nothing makes a man more like the devil, or more infamous among men, or more abominable to God. The Ethiopian version, instead of Cretes, or Cretians, reads \\"hypocrites\\". * \\"Evil beasts\\": are meant beasts of prey, savage and mischievous ones (; ), to distinguish them from other beasts, as sheep, and the like. Perhaps Crete might abound with such evil beasts; for the Cretans are said to excel in hunting; and to these they themselves are compared, by one of their own prophets, for their cruelty, and savage disposition: so cruel persecutors are compared to beasts, () and the false teachers, who were cruel, if not to the bodies, yet to the souls of men, whom they poisoned and destroyed. * \\"Lazy gluttons\\" (NKJV; KJV: \\"slow bellies\\"): This expression by Epimenides is partly for the intemperance, gluttony and drunkenness of the Cretans, whose god was their belly, not the Lord Jesus, and partly for their laziness, eating other people's bread without working. ==See also== * Crete * Elder (Christianity) * Saint Titus * Related Bible parts: 1 Timothy 3 ==ReferencesSources== * * * ==External links== * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 01 ","title":"Titus 1"},{"id":"46357440","text":"The Mono Polys were an English indie pop band, formed in Colchester in 2012 by vocalist and guitarist Tom Knights and keyboardist Josh Harrison. The band was later expanded to include brothers Luke Vosper on bass and Isaac Vosper on drums. Knights and Harrison had previously been a member of Red Fentre, who had performed at a Sixth Form College battle of the bands competition at Colchester Arts Centre, and later changed their name to Broken Bottles. The band were supported and managed by Mark Pearman, a TV Executive at Sky Sports whose daughter introduced Knights in early 2012. It was announced on the band's Facebook page on 11 January 2015 that founder Josh Harrison was leaving the band to \\"pursue other musical interests\\". Knights had begun another project initially under the name Hostage, which then became Obsess in December 2014 and by January 2016, Knights had formed a new band 'Lunar Quiet' in Brighton and was also being advised by former Food Records executive and Blur manager David Balfe as to his future plans regarding his work. Knights committed suicide following \\"mental health issues that he could no longer cope with\\", in Brighton on 22 October 2016, aged 22. A cassette single by 'Lunar Quiet' titled Cold Spell was released posthumously in memory of Knights and also included a fanzine and A4 poster. A memorial gig took place on 14 December 2016 at the Green Door Store venue in Brighton, with the likes of local bands Morning Smoke, Beachtape and Eyesaw performing and attendees asked to make a donation to Colchester Samaritans. ==History== Pavilion (2012) Knights and Harrison had collaborated prior to the formation of The Mono Polys as part of Colchester-based four-piece Red Fenetre. Following their departure from the band, they formed The Mono Polys in February 2012 at Colchester 6th form college, releasing their debut EP Life the next month. Between April and September 2012, Knights and Harrison toured parts of East Anglia, supporting The Libertines drummer Gary Powell before returning to Essex to record their debut album, Pavilion. The download version of the album, released on 31 November 2012, featured an acoustic version of \\"Summertime\\" produced by Joel Stoker of The Rifles. The rest of the album was produced by the band's manager. Blossom (2013) After receiving airplay on BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 6 Music, Luke and Isaac Vosper joined the band in early 2013. As a four- piece, the band then embarked on a 5-month tour, supporting Tom Hingley (Inspiral Carpets). In an interview with Darkus Magazine, Luke Vosper explained: \\"I met Josh at college and we got talking about music. He mentioned that his band was looking for a bassist, so he and Tom came round to try a few ideas out. Things didn’t really click at first so we got my little brother Isaac in to play drums and straight away it worked. We then had 2 weeks to learn a 17 song set for our first 4 piece gig.\\" 2013 ended with the band supporting Carl Barât alongside Reverend and The Makers and The Rifles at London's Vibe Bar for New Year's Eve. Joel Stoker later returned to help the band produce their second EP, Blossom, which was released 25 January 2014 and received its debut airplay on Soccer AM. The EP was received well abroad and benefited from BBC Radio airplay in England. In the Netherlands, 'Insomnia' reached #1 in the Free 40 Alternative Chart in March. Identity (2014–present) The band began recording tracks for a new EP in August 2014, and were soon after featured in Loaded magazine. Although they expected to have a third EP ready by the end of the year, with the departure of Harrison, the release was delayed until 2015. In April 2015, the band announced on Facebook their plans to release Identity in May, along with two London tour dates and a slot at The Alternative Escape Festival, part of The Great Escape Festival. During the Mono Polys short existence, they played approx 80 gigs around the country including Exeter, Cardiff, Bristol, Poole, Brighton, Birmingham, Stoke, Manchester, Nottingham and London and had national radio airplay on BBC Radio. The band's manager had described their sound as \\"suicide pop\\", with the band joking that the third EP would be titled \\"The Twenty Guilty Pleasures of Suicide Pop\\". ==Discography== Studio albums *Pavilion (31 November 2012, INC-JEN Records) EPs *Life (12 March 2012, INC-JEN Records) *Blossom (25 January 2014, INC-JEN Records) *Identity (30 May 2015, INC-JEN Records) ==References== Category:British indie pop groups Category:Musical groups established in 2012 Category:Musical groups from Essex ","title":"The Mono Polys"},{"id":"46357457","text":"Black Jack is an unincorporated community in Douglas County, Kansas, United States ==History== The Battle of Black Jack was fought near Black Jack Creek in 1856.

Therefore, in Amin's film, the terminally ill, moody old man, Hussein is a tribute to her own father; fighting with his elder sister and great-nephew, until his gentler side shows. ==Plot== Director Ayten Amin has created a film that falls somewhere in between a drama and a comedy, which offers a glimpse into the lifestyle and culture of everyday Egypt. By following the characters through times of illness, intimacy, joy, and death, Amin has created a film that truly engages her audience. The main character, Hussein (Khaled Abol Naga), is a cranky architect who suffers from a terminal illness (that is never explicitly mentioned in the film). Unable to connect emotionally with people, Hussein enjoys a life in solitary, living in his family’s old home. He takes pleasure in an occasional visit from his nurse, Hanaa (Heba Yousry) or lover, Sanna (Arwa Gouda). When Hussein’s sister, Nadra (Lebleba) and great-nephew Seif (Omar El Ghandour), move in with him, he becomes uncomfortable because he is forced to change his lifestyle. Hussein is now compelled to start thinking about someone other than himself. Throughout the film, audience sees Hussein struggle with taking medication and having severe reactions to this medication which helps the audience know he is suffering from a deadly illness. Nadra and Seif are there to take care of Hussein by keeping up the house, helping him take medication, offering Hussein company, and keeping a watchful eye on him. Hussein hasn’t been into his office for work (architecture) in over a month, implying his deterioration. Hussein warms up to Seif and Seif’s friend, Aya (Sally Abed), because of forced close-encounters. He becomes fond of Seif, his friends, and his garage band, eventually joining in and showing the young-ins “what real music is.” The film ends with a scene of Hussein, Seif, and Aya getting into an old car and driving into the city; revealing Hussein’s change of heart and his coming to terms with his own death. ==Cast== * Khaled Abol Naga as Hussein * Lebleba as Nadra * Arwa Gouda as Sanaa * Omar El Ghandour as Seif * Heba Yousry as Hanaa * Khairy Beshara as The General * Sally Abed as Aya * Youssra El Hawary as Ehsan * Emad Maher as Hamdy * Amgad Riad as Heidar * Sedky Sakhr as Salah ==Reception== Villa 69 has received a generally warm reception as a film which is complex and watchable, but perhaps too difficult a project for its young director Ayten Amin. It received a public score of 7.2/10 on IMDB. Screen Daily's Mark Adams saw the film as both \\"impressively nuanced and dynamic,\\" but also lacking consistency and focus. Thoraia Abou Bakr was generally happy with the performance, especially as the film could serve as a realistic window into Egyptian society for Westerners. She thought that Abol Naga gave a \\"convincing\\" performance, but also recognizes that \\"the first hour seems to stretch out mercilessly.\\" Jenifer Evans wrote a much harsher critique for Mada Masr, describing how the film seemed aimless, and needed \\"a tough edit.\\" ==Soundtrack== https://soundcloud.com/object-obscure/sets/villa-69-soundtrack == Awards == {  - !

This chapter describes the qualities of members of the community and doctrinal statements regarding the death of Christ in relation to the removal of sin. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 15 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 32 (~AD 200; extant verses 3-8) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant verses 4-6, 14-15) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) *Codex Coislinianus (~550; extant verses 1–5) ==Membership of the Community (2:1–10)== This section contains the injunction to Titus to teach the sound doctrine to the community with a list of qualities and duties for the members. ==Doctrinal statements (2:11–15)== The doctrinal statements in this part is typical of Paul's teaching which links the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ to the hope and expectation of his second coming. Verse 11 : For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, NKJV * \\"The grace of God that brings salvation\\": This \\"grace of God\\" does not mean God's free love, for though that it is the source of salvation, is not made manifest to all men, but only to the Lord's own people. Neither does it mean the grace of God within the hearts of believers, for though salvation is strictly connected with it, and it powerfully influences the lives of the partakers of it, yet it has not appeared to all men. This grace of God is intended the doctrine of grace, the Gospel, because it is a declaration of the grace of God, and of salvation by it: and in the hand of the Spirit, it is the means of conveying grace and implanting into the heart (cf. ; ; which is called the 'Gospel of salvation', the good word or good news of salvation; it shows men the way of salvation; it gives an account of the Savior himself, the great God, fit to be a Savior and he is the only Savior. Some read this clause, \\"that brings salvation to all men\\", supported by the Syriac version, which renders it \\"that quickeneth\\" or \\"saveth all\\"; Arabic version is also the same. * \\"Has appeared to all men\\": indicates that it has been hidden, in the shadows of the ceremonial law of the Old Testament, and it was entirely hidden from the Gentiles, was not known as it is now. The Gospel had been like a candle lighted up in one part of the world, that is, only in Judea, but now it shines out and appears to all sorts of people, rich and poor, bond and free, masters and servants; which sense well agrees with the context (; ; ; ), because the Gospel was now preached to every creature under heaven, or to the whole creation and had reached the hearts of all people, including those who sat in darkness, and in the shadow of death; namely, to the Gentiles, pursuant to the commission in (). Verse 15 :Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. :Let no one despise you. NKJV This summary command to Titus contains previously mentioned three didactic terms: # \\"speak/teach\\" (in 2:1) about \\"these things\\", referring to the matters in the preceding paragraphs (2:1–14) # \\"exhort/encourage\\" (in 2:6) # \\"rebuke/reproof\\" (in 1:13) recalling 'the job description of the overseer' (1:9) which Titus must do himself. *\\"Let no one despise you\\": is an indirect command in the third person to strengthen Titus, which is similar in form and content to for Timothy.

Kennedy was a television special featuring the First Lady of the United States, Jacqueline Kennedy, on a tour of the recently renovated White House. It was broadcast on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1962, on both CBS and NBC, and broadcast four days later on ABC. The program was the first ever First Lady televised tour of the White House, and has since been considered the first prime-time documentary specifically designed to appeal to a female audience. The program showed Kennedy on a tour of the house with the CBS News correspondent Charles Collingwood. The videotaped tour was the first glimpse the American public had had of the $2 million restoration of the White House that Kennedy had helped direct in the first year of her husband's presidency. The program was viewed by 80 million viewers and globally syndicated to 50 countries, including Russia and China. Kennedy's notes for the televised tour were among her personal papers that were publicly released by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in 2012. The papers showed that Kennedy made sure that the names of individual donors who had contributed to the costs of the renovation were included in the script. ==Background== Kennedy had been the First Lady of the United States since her husband's inauguration in January 1961 and had engaged in a well publicized restoration and redecoration of the president's official residence, the White House, in the first year of her husband's presidency. Kennedy had been approached by various television networks to broadcast the restored White House and it was subsequently agreed that the three major American networks (CBS, NBC and ABC) would jointly fund and broadcast the resultant documentary. The finished documentary was produced by Perry Wolff and directed by the feature film director Franklin J. Schaffner. The orchestra conductor Alfredo Antonini served as the program's musical director.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207800/?ref_=nm_flmg_msdp_14. Cutaway segments for the film were shot in advance and Kennedy's parts were taped in an eight-hour recording session. of equipment were required for the film, placed in the White House by 54 technicians. ==Aftermath== The success of the film led to other documentaries aimed at a female audience including The World of Sophia Loren and The World of Jacqueline Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor in London, all of which drew significant numbers of viewers. The success of the film of Kennedy's White House tour has been analyzed from a feminist film perspective, as it appealed to \\"women's fantasies about living a more public life while largely maintaining their conventional feminine attributes\\" as television could allow the female viewer to \\"fantasize about situations and identities which are not part of one's everyday existence\\", anticipating the new possibilities for women in the latter part of the 1960s. The success of the program inspired Grace Kelly, by then Princess of Monaco, to make a filmed tour called A Look at Monaco. Kennedy and Perry Sidney Wolff co-authored a book with the same title, based on the documentary film, published by Doubleday in 1962. The film won Schaffner the Directorial Achievement Award for 1962 from the Directors Guild of America, and Schaffner and Kennedy were both recipients of the Trustee's Award from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for their work on the film. Schaffner would later be asked by President Kennedy to look at the lighting and acoustics in the State Department's Auditorium, the site of his press conferences, and was asked to help prepare Kennedy for his address to the nation at the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis. ==ReferencesCategory:1962 documentary films Category:1962 in American television Category:1962 television specials Category:American Broadcasting Company television specials Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:CBS television specials Category:NBC television specials Category:Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Category:White House Category:Films directed by Franklin J.

The letter is traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle, sent from Nicopolis of Macedonia (Roman province), addressed to Titus in Crete.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.King James Version subscription after Titus 3:15 states \\"It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.\\" There are charges that it is the work of an anonymous follower, after Paul's death in the first century AD. This chapter contains Paul's instruction for the church as a community with responsibilities in the public realm, towards the government and also towards individuals, concluded with some personal requests for Titus before the final benediction. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 15 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Sinaiticus (AD 330-360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; complete) *Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 8-9) *Codex Claromontanus (c. 550) *Codex Coislinianus (c. 550; extant verses 13-15, with unique endnotes) ==Living as the Church in the World (3:1–8)== This section addresses the responsibilities of the church as a community in the larger society, from consideration for rulers/authorities to a larger concern for \\"all people\\" (cf. ; ). Verse 8 :This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. KJV *\\"This is a faithful saying\\" (, ): is a formula assuming 'general acceptance' and is stated 5 times in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 1:15; 3:1; 4:9; 2 Timothy 2:11; Titus 3:8). ==Disciplining the Opponents in the Church (3:9–11)== This part concerns relationships between Titus and some members in the community who 'indulge in controversy and argument', with an instruction that Titus should ignore them to their own condemnation. Verse 9 :But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and useless. NKJV Paul lists four 'deceptively dangerous things' to be avoided (or \\"shunned\\"): *\\"Foolish disputes\\": or \\"foolish controversies\\" () for frivolous and incompetent theological inquiries which produce no worthwhile results (cf. ) *\\"Genealogies\\": likely refers to 'a Jewish type of interpretation' based on the Old Testament or extracanonical biblical heroes accounts and 'speculation based on family trees' (cf. ) *\\"Contentions, and strivings\\": or \\"arguments, dissensions, quarrels\\" (cf. ) depicting the 'chaos produced by controversies and speculative debates'. ==Final Remarks and Farewell (3:12–15)== The last section of the epistle contains some personal details from Paul regarding some co-workers with a final instruction to 'maintain good works' (verse 14) before the closing benediction. The form is a kind of travelogue, which is not unusual as Paul also mentioned his travel plans in other epistles (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). Verse 12 The central thermae of Nicopolis. :When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. NKJV *\\"Tychicus\\": from the province of Asia, traveled with Paul on his third missionary journey (Acts 20:4; ; ; ), but nothing is known about Artemas. *\\"Come to me at Nicopolis\\": Artemas and Tychicus are sent to 'fill in for Titus', showing Paul's concern for the succession in ministry. As soon as relief has arrived, Titus was to go to Nicopolis, where Paul planned to stay throughout the winter. *\\"Nicopolis\\" (\\"city of victory\\"; known as 'Nicopolos in Epirus'Tacitus, Annals 2.53; apud Collins 2002, p=372 or 'Nicopolis of Achaia'Ptolemy, Geography 3.13; apud Collins 2002, p=372): There are several imperial settlements with this name to commemorate a military victory, but this particular city was buildt on the isthmus of the Bay of Actium, across from the southern tip of the Italian peninsula, to commemorate the naval victory of Augustus over Mark Antony in 31 BCE. The port city was 'a natural site of maritime transportation between Achaia and Italy, a commercial center and the site of quadrennial athletic games', as well as 'a natural place for a person to pass the winter here before a sea voyage in the early spring' when travel conditions became better (cf. ; ). Verse 13 :Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with haste, that they may lack nothing. NKJV *\\"Apollos\\": is known from ; ; and ; , as an Alexandrian who was versed in the Scriptures, catechized by Aquila and Priscilla in the ways of the Lord. In one occasion, Paul tried to send Apollos to visit the Corinthian community again, but Apollos was reluctant to go (). *\\"Zenas the lawyer\\": is unknown, and does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament. The name is a contraction of Zēnodōros (\\"gift of Zeus\\"). According to the Greek menologies, Zenas was the first bishop of Diospolis of Lydda in Palestine, and according to tradition, wrote a letter to Titus. *\\"Sent... on their journey with haste\\": is translated from Greek: , , meaning \\"earnestly equip\\",Greek Text Analysis on Titus 3:13. Biblehub.com recalling the words in the previous verse: ' (\\"I shall send\\" or \\"delegate\\") and ' (\\"be diligent\\" or \\"make every effort\\"). The compound form in this verse has the meaning of both \\"send on one's way\\" and \\"prepare for a journey\\" by providing food, money, means of travel, companions or anything else required for the trip. *\\"That they may lack nothing\\" (Greek: , ): can be paraphrased as \\"[make sure] that they lack nothing that they need\\" which in combination with the word propemson (cf. ; ; ) can form a translation: \\"Get Zenas the lawyer and Apollos ready and send them on their way\\". Verse 14 :And let our people also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful. NKJV * \\"Our people (NKJV; KJV: \\"ours\\"; Greek ): in a narrow epistolary context can be about Zenas and Apollos. *\\"Good works\\" (Greek ): can be rendered \\"good deeds\\" or \\"honest trades\\", as in 'honest lawful employment of life' as a good work, or also 'a secularized euphemism for the proclamation of the gospel in word and in work'. Jewish teachings also stateT. Bab. Beracot, fol. 32. 2. & Gloss. apud Gill on Titus 3:14 ::\\"there are four things which a man should constantly attend to with all his might, and they are these; the law, \\"good works\\", prayer, and \\"the way of the earth\\", or \\"business\\"; if a tradesman, to his trade; if a merchant, to his merchandise; if a man of war to war.\\" *\\"That they may not be unfruitful\\": or \\"so that they are not ineffective\\" (Greek: a-karpoi, literally means \\"without fruit\\"), in the good works and in the knowledge of Christ, for good works are fruits of righteousness (fruit of the Spirit), because without them are like trees without fruit, which is useless and unprofitable. The imagery of growth and fruit (karpos) is often used in the early church in its kerygmatic discourse, and evokes the positive effect of the gospel proclamation (cf. ; ; ). Verse 15 :All who are with me greet you. :Greet those who love us in the faith. :Grace be with you all. Amen. NKJV *\\"Grace be with you all\\": is a benediction to end the letter, with the difference to other benedictions in and (cf. ) only in the addition of \\"all\\" (cf. ) which extends the blessing to the churches that Titus was caring at the time. ==Subscription== A subscription or 'codicil' appeared at the end of the Epistle of Titus, first in the Codex Coislinianus (6th century) and later in most manuscripts of Byzantine tradition, stating: :The epistle was written by Paul the Apostle to Titus the first bishop of the Church of the Cretans upon whom hands had been laid, from Nicopolis to Macedonia.

She was first encouraged by her mother to learn guitar as practical means for achieving a sustainable career as a musician. Her first songs, written soon after picking up the guitar at age 9, took influence from the classic singer-songwriter records of her parents and the mystique of the rugged desert landscape around her. Day is of Swedish descent. ==Career== 2009–2012: Powered by Love and Cynics vs. Dreamers In 2009, Day self- released her debut album Powered by Love.

The Pro-Hadi Forces recaptured the Abyan Governorate on 11 August, after launching an offensive on pro-Houthi forces in early August. ==The campaign== On 26 March, the 15th Armored Brigade, based in Lawdar, announced their support to the Houthis. In turn, the 111th Infantry Brigade, based in the Ahwar District, joined forces with pro-Hadi troops five days later. In addition, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) pledged to fight alongside pro-Hadi forces against the Houthis but clarified they were not loyal to Hadi. On 27 March, Houthi and allied army forces seized the city of Shuqrah on the Arabian Sea. The takeover gave them control of all land entries to Aden and completed their encirclement of the city where a battle was underway. However, warplanes from the Saudi-led coalition began to bedevil the Houthis as they moved their heavy armour and vehicles toward Aden, with airstrikes halting a convoy from Shuqrah early on 28 March. On 29 March, pro- Houthi troops captured Zinjibar, the provincial capital and a center for pro- Hadi forces in the governorate. 20 people were killed during the takeover. Heavy clashes took place between tribal fighters and Houthi-allied soldiers occupying a military camp and adjacent football field in the city, which was bombed twice by the Coalition. On 3 April, Houthi forces entered the districts of Jaar, Lawdar and Shuqrah. Pro-Hadi military sources claimed that the 111th Infantry Brigade had cut off supplies to the Houthis and their allies on 7 April, but a source in the pro-Houthi 15th Armored Brigade said they had supplies still coming from the Al Bayda Governorate to the north. Sustained fighting took place during the day in Lawdar, while pro-Hadi forces reportedly besieged the base of the pro-Houthi army brigade. On 25 April, at least 29 pro-Houthi fighters were killed in attacks throughout the province, according to an official.63 killed, dozens wounded in fighting, airstrikes in southern Yemen On 8 August, Pro-Hadi forces launched an offensive to retake the city of Zinjibar from Houthi militias after the pro-government forces retook Jaʿār and Lawdar.

It has been hypothesized that the knee prospect of the cosmic ray spectrum can be explained by the theoretical maximum energy that a supernova can accelerate particles to according to Fermi acceleration. The measurements are accomplished using a timing-based charge detector and transition radiation detector sent to an altitude of at least 34 km (21 mi) with aid of a high-altitude balloon. After launching from McMurdo Station in Antarctica, the balloon will stay aloft for 60–100 days gathering data on charges and energies of the unimpeded cosmic rays that strike the detectors. == Expected outcomes == One of the advantages of this type of experiment is that it is possible to identify the original particle that would have caused the air shower detected by ground-based detectors. Maximum detectable energy level is determined by duration of the flight and size of the detector; a difficult barrier to get around for experiments of this type. An accurate measurement of the composition of cosmic rays is necessary in order to understand the origins of the cosmic rays found above the \\"knee\\" at 1015 eV. To date, the CREAM balloon experiments have accumulated a total of 161 days of exposure, longer than any other single balloon-borne experiment. CREAM III takes flight in Antarctica == Experimental goals == * Can the \\"knee\\" be explained by maximum acceleration due to supernovae? * Have the composition of cosmic rays changed over time? * Are multiple mechanisms responsible for the production of cosmic rays? == Construction == Instrumentation of CREAM II. In order to answer these questions, it is of particular interest to investigate cosmic rays in the 1012 to 1015 eV region due to several theories predicting a change in elemental composition just below the knee. To determine the elemental spectrum of cosmic rays, CREAM uses a silicon charge detector, timing charge detector, and scintillating fiber hodoscopes to detect the charge of incident particles up to that of iron (Z = 26). Energies are measured with a transition radiation detector (TRD), along with an ionization calorimeter. Because all detectors are in close proximity of each other, it is a prime concern to minimize the interaction between showers produced in the calorimeter, and the charge-measuring instruments. To dampen this effect, CREAM uses a larger number of pixels with a smaller area, along with a very fast readout time to differentiate between events caused by the primary particle and events caused by back-scattering from the calorimeter. The relatively low density of the TRD allows for a larger detector geometry to detect particles with a lower flux. By measuring the Lorentz factor γ, combined with knowledge of the particle's charge, it is possible to calibrate the detector with various cosmic rays of charge ±1 (electrons, pions, muons, etc.). Because of the relatively low geomagnetic cutoff energy for cosmic rays near the South Pole, a cherenkov detector is placed between modules of the TRD to act as a veto for these low-energy particles. For power, the system includes batteries for energy storage, along with a solar array rated to sustain the mission for 100 days. Altogether, the instrument is expected to draw only 380 watts from a 28-volt supply, thanks to a very careful choice of energy-efficient electronics. In near-vacuum conditions, significant precautions must be taken against coronal discharges between unshielded electronics operating at as low as 100 volts. This is mitigated by encasing all relevant electronics in a lightweight dielectric compound, such as plaster. The instrument must be able to operate in a wide range of temperatures, as the high albedo of Antarctica can cause very high temperatures, while periods of darkness will result in very low temperatures. Excluding the ballast, total weight of the instrument must not exceed to reach the desired altitude. Retrieval is done by separating the instrument from the balloon after a sufficient amount of exposure, and a parachute opens to somewhat slow the descent of the instrument. Although the experiment is designed to meet the structural requirements of the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility, it is inevitable that some damage will be incurred to replaceable parts of the instrument. The main priority is data retrieval; all other systems are considered secondary at this point. ==CREAM Flights== {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:left;\\" +CREAM Flights (Launch history) - center; background:#BBB;\\" Year Start Date (UTC) End Date (UTC) Flight Reference - 2004 style=\\"text- align:right; nowrap;\\" December 16, 2004 right; nowrap;\\" January 27, 2005 CREAM I  - 2005 right; nowrap;\\" December 15, 2005 right; nowrap;\\" January 13, 2006 CREAM II  - 2007 right; nowrap;\\" December 18, 2007 right; nowrap;\\" January 17, 2008 CREAM III  - 2008 right; nowrap;\\" December 18, 2008 style=\\"text- align:right; nowrap;\\" January 07, 2009 CREAM IV  - 2009 style=\\"text- align:right; nowrap;\\" December 01, 2009 right; nowrap;\\" January 08, 2010 CREAM V  - 2010 right; nowrap;\\" December 21, 2010 right; nowrap;\\" December 26, 2010 CREAM VI  - 2016 right; nowrap;\\" November 28, 2016  BACCUS  - 2017 colspan=\\"2\\" ISS-CREAM  }  ISS-CREAM  Pronounced \\"ice-cream\\", ISS-CREAM is the next generation version of the CREAM balloon experiments that was sent to the International Space Station on August 14, 2017 with the CRS-12 mission, and will be installed permanently to the station. Located at an altitude of 410 km, 10 times higher than previous balloon flights, ISS-CREAM will be able to take data almost non-stop during its three-year mission. Because of the extreme altitude, there is no atmosphere for incident particles to scatter off of before reaching the detector.

The star of the event is a cat named Frankie. The cat sings a lullaby-style song of moderate tempo. Some of the cats fall off the stands because of their affection for the singer. In a house in the vicinity, a white cat watches the performance through an open window. Lying in bed only a few feet away is Farmer Al Falfa who is the cat's master. The man, not liking the song, gets up and closes the window. The white cat, however, heads to the living room downstairs, and turns on a radio before she selects a station that plays the song. Al Falfa rushes to the living room, turns off the radio, and places the white cat outside. Without her master knowing, the white cat reenters the house through an open window, and hides under a chair. As Al Falfa is heading back to the bedroom, a pack of mice gather at the living room, and play the cat's song on the radio. The man returns downstairs, sweeps away the mice and smashes the radio. Al Falfa is back in his bedroom trying to sleep. However, he can still hear the cat's live performance, so he leaves the house with a rifle, aims his weapon, and pulls the trigger. Unfortunately, the gun does not fire, so he resorts to picking up a red stone which he hurls. The cat is struck head on, and falls unconsciousness. The cats, who are most shocked, rush to check on their idol. Enraged, they begin to chase and throw stuff at the man. After a chase, Al Falfa makes it safely home. To prevent the angry cats from breaking in, he seals every door and window with lumber, only for the white cat to come out from behind the chair along with three kittens who resemble the singer cat. The three kittens, in their squeaky voices, sing the singer's song.

The offensive was also launched during a previously started AQAP offensive. ==The campaign== On 29 March 2015, fighting centered in the oil-rich Usaylan region. 38 were killed in fighting between the Houthis and Sunni tribesmen. Tribal sources confirmed the death toll, and claimed only eight of them were from their side, with the other 30 either Houthis or their allies from the Yemeni military. The tribesmen were also reinforced by weapons received via 200 vehicles from tribes in the nearby province of Abyan. After the fighting, Houthi positions were hit by Coalition air-strikes. On 1 April, fighting at a major army base left 35 Houthi and allied army fighters, along with 20 tribesmen, dead. On 6 April, the Houthis were reported to be negotiating with local tribes for safe transit to Ataq, the provincial capital. However, additional fighting on the same day killed two Houthi fighters, while another eight were killed in an airstrike. Two days later, 10 Houthis, three Houthi-allied soldiers and three tribesmen were killed in further clashes. On 9 April, air-strikes hit the Houthi-held Muhra base, outside Ataq, after which the Houthis and their allies seized government and police installations in the city. Soon, hundreds of armed tribesmen mobilised on the outskirts of Ataq to attack the Houthis. Still, the Houthi capture of the provincial capital was reportedly facilitated by local tribal chiefs and security officials. On 10 April, 25 Houthi fighters were killed in a suicide car-bomb attack, carried out by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), on their security post in the Bayhan region. As is the case in the neighboring Abyan Governorate, it was reported that AQAP fighters were ordered to fight alongside pro-Hadi forces against the Houthis. On 13 April, pro-Hadi tribal militia took control of two military bases belonging to units that were guarding oil facilities in the Belhaf area. 15 soldiers stationed at one base were killed.

In 1989 the PP would demand Hormaechea's resignation, but he would continue in a government formed by independents. In December 1990, he will be forced out by a no-confidence motion supported by PP, PSOE, PRC and CDS, which would result in a coalition government headed by Socialist Jaime Blanco being formed until the 1991 election. ==Overview== Electoral system The Regional Assembly of Cantabria was the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Cantabria, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Cantabrian Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a President of the Regional Deputation. Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in Cantabria and in full enjoyment of their political rights. The 39 members of the Regional Assembly of Cantabria were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 5 percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. The electoral law provided that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electors registered in Cantabria. Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called. Election date The term of the Regional Assembly of Cantabria expired four years after the date of its previous election. Election day was to take place between the thirtieth and the sixtieth day from the date of expiry of parliament. The previous election was held on 8 May 1983, which meant that the legislature's term would have expired on 8 May 1987. The election was required to take place no later than the sixtieth day from the date of expiry of parliament, setting the latest possible election date for the Parliament on Sunday, 7 July 1987. The Regional Assembly of Cantabria could not be dissolved before the date of expiry of parliament except in the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot. In such a case, the Regional Assembly was to be automatically dissolved and a snap election called, with elected deputies merely serving out what remained of their four-year terms. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 20 seats were required for an absolute majority in the Regional Assembly of Cantabria. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text- align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" !

Myrmarachne exasperans mimics the ichneumonid wasp in both appearance and behaviour, flicking its front legs and abdomen up and down to mimic the movement of the wasps antennae and wings. == Nest == Myrmarachne exasperans nests can be found under medium and large leaves, particularly Heliconia, Ficus, Asplenium nidus and Hibiscus. Unlike nests built by other species of Myrmarachne that comprise solely of silk, M. exasperans decorates the outer layer of its nest with detritus. == Further reading == *Proszynski, J. (1997).

The founders and investor-owners of the hospital include Richard Kanyerezi, Jack Luyombya, Edward Kigonya, Nelson Senkatuka, John Nsibambi, James Batwala, Leo Kibirango and Ntwatwa Kyagulanyi. They pooled resources, including taking out personal loans and mortgages to fund the opening of the hospital in 2007. The hospital provides full laboratory services. It still is undergoing expansion to provide more specialty services and increase its bed capacity. Kampala Hospital is one of five upscale, tertiary hospitals in the city of Kampala that provide quality healthcare at a price; the others being Case Medical Centre on Buganda Road, International Hospital Kampala in Namuwongo, Nakasero Hospital on Akii Bua Road and Paragon Hospital in Bugoloobi. ==Services offered== The services offered at KHL include the following: ==Specialties== , the following specialty services are available at KHL.

He started his music career as Little Cedric, in 1983, with the release of, I'm Alright Now, by Atlanta International Records. The next two albums, 1984's Jesus Saves and 1985's God's Blessing, were released by AIR Gospel, and they both achieved placements upon the Billboard Gospel Albums chart. Although Hailey is best known as the lead singer of Jodeci and second-lead singer of K-Ci & JoJo, he participated on different solo projects as K-Ci, most notably his cover of Bobby Womack's \\"If You Think You're Lonely Now\\" in 1994. ==Early life== Hailey was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Anita and Cliff Hailey both of whom were gospel singers. For a time, the Hailey family lived in Baltimore, MD where they performed gospel music. The family would later return to Charlotte when Cedric was a teen. He would eventually go on to attend Garinger High School. ==Music career== Along with younger brother, Joel (known professionally as \\"JoJo\\") and his father, Hailey recorded three gospel albums as \\"Little Cedric and the Hailey Singers\\" beginning with the 1983 release I'm Alright Now by Atlanta International Records, Gospel. Though the album failed to place on any Billboard magazine charts, the next two releases, 1984's Jesus Saves and God's Blessing in 1985, both placed upon the Billboard Gospel Albums chart; the former at No. 4 and the latter at No. 22. Cedric and Joel's gospel singing eventually connected them with the DeGrate brothers, Donald \\"DeVante Swing\\" DeGrate and Dalvin DeGrate, with whom they formed the R&B; group Jodeci. As lead vocalist for the group, Hailey and Jodeci would release three multi-platinum albums between 1991 and 1995. In 1996, the group announced a hiatus from recording and releasing music. Hailey continued to record with his brother as the duo K-Ci & JoJo, releasing five albums between 1997 and 2013. As K-Ci, his cover of Bobby Womack's \\"If You Think You're Lonely Now\\" was featured on the soundtrack to the 1994 film, Jason's Lyric. It was released as a single and peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Personal life== Hailey dated fellow R&B; singer and then label-mate Mary J. Blige from 1992 till 1997.

In 1992 the left-handed bassist moved to New York City, where he recorded his first album as a leader in 1993, with the American tenor saxophone player Don Braden as co-leader, with sidemen trumpeter Tom Harrell, pianist, Cyrus Chestnut and Carl Allen on drums. A second album of a very similar group was released in 1996. After this he played and recorded with several groups: a trio (the Intercontinental Jazz Trio, with Shingo Okudaira and Tim Armacost) and groups that almost always included Don Braden. Additionally Randy Brecker and Chris Potter were playing in his bands. In the past years he started working with larger (big)-bands: the Groningen Art Ensemble (with in addition to Braden included among others Brian Lynch and trombonist Conrad Herwig) and the Joris Teepe Big Band. Many songs he plays and records are original compositions, but he also arranges other people’s material. He arranged the music of Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn and John Coltrane. In recent years he has also written for larger ensembles and even symphonic orchestras. Teepe is also actively working as a sideman, arranger, and producer for other musicians. He collaborated with among others Joey Berkley, Ron Jackson, Darrell Grant, Antonio Ciacca, Mathilde Santing, Deborah Brown, Fay Claassen and was a long time member of the Rashied Ali Band. Furthermore Teepe is active in jazz- education: he is head of the jazz department at the Prins Claus Conservatory in Groningen and teaches bass at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.

WC-1 has two separate roles in the cell. First, it is the primary photoreceptor for Neurospora and the founding member of the class of principle blue light photoreceptors in all of the fungi. Second, it is necessary for regulating circadian rhythms in FRQ. It is a key component of a circadian molecular pathway that regulates many behavioral activities, including conidiation. WC-1 and WC-2, an interacting partner of WC-1, comprise the White Collar Complex (WCC) that is involved in the Neurospora circadian clock. WCC is a complex of nuclear transcription factor proteins, and contains transcriptional activation domains, PAS domains, and zinc finger DNA-binding domains (GATA). WC-1 and WC-2 heterodimerize through their PAS domains to form the White Collar Complex (WCC). == Discovery == The Neurospora circadian clock was discovered in 1959, when Pittendrigh et al. first described timing patterns in the asexual development of spores. They noticed that in the region of the growing front, mycelia laid down between the late night to early morning formed aerial hyphae, whereas those laid down at other times did not. This aerial growth pattern at subjective circadian times served as tentative support for the presence of circadian oscillators. White Collar-1 was described in the 1960s by geneticists who saw a strain of Neurospora which the mycelia were albino, but the conidia were normally pigmented. The mutant gene was designated white collar (wc), for the white coloration of the mycelia below the pigmented conidia on agar slants. The gene wc-1 was classified during the mapping of the chromosomal loci of Neurospora crassa (1982 by Perkins et al.). == Protein structure == WC-1 and WC-2 are transcription factors encoded by the genes wc-1 and wc-2. Zinc finger DNA-binding domains (GATA) allow WC-1 and WC-2 to bind to DNA and act as transcription factors. Both WC-1 and WC-2 have PAS domains that allow them to bind to other proteins. WC-1 and WC-2 typically heterodimerize in vivo to form the White Collar Complex (WCC), which acts as a transcription factor complex. In vitro, WC-1 can also homodimerize with itself and heterodimerize with other PAS proteins. Protein sequencing has revealed WC-1 to also contain a LOV domain, a chromophore-binding peptide region. This binding site is highly conserved, and is sequentially similar to the chromophore-binding domains of phototropins in plants. WC-1 and WC-2 bind to the promoter elements of the genes that they transcriptionally activate. == Function in the circadian clock ==  Photoreception  WC-1 has been shown to be a blue-light photoreceptor, and is a necessary component of the Neurospora light-induced response pathway. Genetic screens of light-insensitive Neurospora mutant strains have repeatedly demonstrated abnormalities in the wc-1 gene. In functional Neurospora, the WC-1 LOV domain binds to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore, which is responsible for the conversion of light to mechanical energy. FAD displays maximum absorption of light at 450 nm, thus explaining WC-1's maximal sensitivity to blue light. Light-induced responses are completely eliminated in WC-1 LOV knockout Neurospora mutants, although WC-1's transcription activation role persists in the dark. WC-1 is widely conserved among fungi where it appears to be the principle blue light photoreceptor for the entire kingdom.  Circadian regulation  Simplified Representation of Neurospora Circadian Clock. WC-1 and WC-2 (WCC) act as positive activators of frq transcription. FRQ protein binds to an RNA helicase, FRH, and to CK1 forming a complex. This complex interacts with WCC, promoting phosphorylation of WCC. Phosphorylation stabilizes WCC and promotes its export to the cytoplasm, effectively down-regulating frq transcription. The White Collar Complex (WCC), the heterodimer of WC-1 and WC-2, acts as a positive element in the circadian clock. WCC serves as an activator of frq gene transcription by binding to two DNA promotor elements in the nucleus: the Clock box (C box) and the Proximal Light-Response Element (PLRE). PLRE is required for maximal light induction, while the C box is required for both maximal light induction and maintaining circadian rhythmicity in constant darkness. In addition, light-activated WCC is shown to induce the transcription of VIVID, a small flavin-binding blue- light photoreceptor that is required for adaptation to light-induced responses in the transcription of light-induced genes, including wc-1 and frq. VIVID is a negative regulator of light responses, although its mechanism is not yet known. As part of the transcription-translation negative feedback-loop (TTFL), FRQ protein enters the nucleus and interacts with FRQ-interacting RNA Helicase (FRH) to promote the repression of WCC activity. This FRQ–FRH complex is suggested to recruit protein kinases such as casein kinase (CK I) and CK II to phosphorylate WCC. The phosphorylation of the WCC stabilizes WCC, preventing it from binding and activating frq transcription. Protein phosphatases PP2A and PP4 are known to counterbalance kinase activity and support the reactivation and nuclear entry of WCC. FRQ has also been shown to interact with WC-2 in vitro, and a partial loss-of-function allele of wc-2 yields Neurospora with a long period length and altered temperature compensation, which is a key characteristic of circadian pacemakers. Only WC-1 is required for transient light-induction, but both WC-1 and WC-2 are required for the circadian clock to run. Because the core of the clock is based on a rhythmic expression of frq, the acute light-induction pathway provides a direct way to reset the clock. Mammalian clocks can be reset through a similar mechanism, via the light-induction of the mammalian per genes within the SCN. Several WC-1 mutants are known. The rhy-2 mutation was localized to the polyglutamine region of the WC-1 gene product. The rhy-2 mutant is arrhythmic with regard to conidiation in constant darkness, but rhythmic in a light-dark cycle. Rhy-2 is also only weakly sensitive to light, suggesting that the polyglutamine region may be essential for both clock function and light sensing in Neurospora. == See also == *Frequency gene *LOV domain *Oscillating gene *PAS domain == References == Category:Circadian rhythm Category:Fungal proteins ","title":"White Collar-1"},{"id":"46357967","text":"Sitayeb Mohamed Nazim Belguendouz (born April 29, 1991) is a Canadian soccer midfielder who plays for AS Blainville and the Canada national futsal team.

He was born in Welland, Ontario, and had worked for 9 years at Standard Oil's Acme Refinery in Buffalo, New York. The company was organized with a Province of Ontario Charter dated October 17, 1906, and its first office building was located at the corner of King and Yonge Streets in Toronto.Canada's Early Oil Industry - A Brief History, Petroleum History Society, Archives Newsletter June 2000. Retrieved 2015-04-07 In 1908, with 8 shareholders, B/A built Canada's third refinery on 3 acres on the eastern waterfront in Toronto. The company refined imported crude oil and its main product was kerosene; a then- useless by-product was gasoline, which was dumped into a swamp. B/A acquired a Dominion Charter which allowed it to expand eastward into Quebec as well as west into other provinces. Expansion was swift, with the refinery expanding to 40 acres and crude oil production was up to 32,000 barrels per month. Most of the product was hauled on horse-drawn wagons and in wooden barrels by rail. In 1920 B/A purchased the Winnipeg Oil Company and established regional headquarters in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The company was by then marketing a variety of products, including gasoline, motor oil, benzene, anti-freeze, and others under a variety of brands, both in-house and from other companies. In 1924 B/A entered the U.S. as a producing company with the formation of the Toronto Pipeline Company. In 1925 B/A formed the British-American Oil Producing Company in Delaware to develop producing oil fields which were then being discovered in Oklahoma. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of B/A with operations confined to the United States. In 1922 Ellsworth, together with several partners, established the Clear Vision Pump Company Limited (CVPC) which amongst other products, was the first pump that provided a visual check of the gasoline being dispensed.

I wonder how much better Space Infantry would have been had it had an outside and objective editor: then it might have been usable. As it is, I imagine that Space Infantry could be made into a workable roleplaying system where the gamemaster willing to use it as a base and do most of the design work himself.

All 39 seats in the Regional Assembly were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in 12 other autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) under incumbent President Jaime Blanco went on to win its first and only regional election in Cantabria. Juan Hormaechea's Union for the Progress of Cantabria (UPCA), a split from the People's Party (PP), won 15 seats and 33% of the vote, with the PP vote collapsing to 6 seats and 14% of the vote as a result. The Regionalist Party of Cantabria (PRC) suffered from the UPCA's surge and returned to its 1983 results, while the Democratic and Social Centre did not reach the required 5% threshold and was expelled from parliament. Juan Hormaechea managed to get re-elected as regional President thanks to a UPCA-PP agreement. He had been forced to resign in late 1990, after a no-confidence motion was passed against him by an alliance of PSOE, PP, PRC and CDS. ==Overview== Background The 1987 election had seen AP candidate Juan Hormaechea win the election with 19 out of 39 seats, 1 short for the absolute majority. Hormaechea, who had been Mayor of Santander between 1974 and 1987 and stood as an independent within AP, was elected as President of Cantabria thanks to the abstention vote of the CDS two deputies. However, from the beginning Hormaechea's tenure as regional President was controversial. Shortly after being elected, in August 1987, Hormaechea announced \\"difficulties\\" in forming a regional government, claiming pressures from AP to force him to name prominent party members as regional ministers, accusing AP of \\"seeking to create wealth for themselves instead of wanting to serve the region\\" and threatening to resign from his office. The government crisis was temporarily solved with the naming of three independents and four AP members as regional ministers. Hormaechea would star another incidents throughout the legislature, including insults to other parties' deputies, accusations to the Assembly Speaker Eduardo Obregón (PSOE) of official misconduct (which resulted in a legal complaint against Hormaechea), as well as accusations from the three opposition parties (PSOE, PRC and CDS) of a continued disregard for the regional chamber. Hormaechea was also accused of political misconduct, such as extorting other deputies in exchange of their votes, bribing MPs from other parties, as well as influence peddling favoring family members and physically attacking a PSOE senator. Further, in late 1989, a controversy arose after Hormaechea declared he was not supporting the People's Party, successor party to AP, for that year's general election. From that point, the deteriorating relationship between the PP and Hormaechea as a result of the latter's personalism and marginalization of the party's structure in the region triggered a political crisis. Hormaechea's insults to party leaders in late 1990 motivated the PP's decision not to choose him as candidate for the incoming 1991 election, as well as the party presenting a motion of censure on Hormaechea to remove him from the regional government, with the support from the PSOE, PRC and CDS, electing PSOE leader Jaime Blanco as the head of a coalition administration for the remainder of the legislature. This caused a split within the regional PP, with 12 deputies supporting Hormaechea and 7 supporting the no-confidence motion against him. Hormaechea's grouping went on to form a separate party, the Union for the Progress of Cantabria (UPCA), to stand for the 1991 election. Electoral system The Regional Assembly of Cantabria was the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Cantabria, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Cantabrian Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a President of the Regional Deputation. Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in Cantabria and in full enjoyment of their political rights. The 39 members of the Regional Assembly of Cantabria were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 5 percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. The electoral law provided that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electors registered in Cantabria. Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called. Election date The term of the Regional Assembly of Cantabria expired four years after the date of its previous election. Legal amendments earlier in 1991 established that elections to the Regional Assembly were to be fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 10 June 1987, setting the election date for the Parliament on Sunday, 26 May 1991. The Regional Assembly of Cantabria could not be dissolved before the date of expiry of parliament except in the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot. In such a case, the Regional Assembly was to be automatically dissolved and a snap election called, with elected deputies merely serving out what remained of their four- year terms. ==Election campaign== The unveiling of irregularities within the finances of Hormaechea's government conducted by Blanco's coalition government marked the electoral campaign into the 1991 election. Hormaechea's management of the regional budget had left a public debt worth of 80,000 million pesetas, while auditors discovered expenditures during the 1987-1990 period that were difficult to justify, with evidence pointing to embezzlement during Hormaechea's tenure. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) tried to benefit from the split in the centre-right vote, with former Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra asking conservative voters to vote the PSOE \\"for this time\\", reminding the chaotic political situation of the community as a result of the infighting between former President Juan Hormaechea and the People's Party leadership. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 20 seats were required for an absolute majority in the Regional Assembly of Cantabria. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text- align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" !

He concludes: \\"I endeavoured to like this game. Honest. I looked for nice things to say about it, but I couldn't really find any. I can see the intentions behind it, and the designer ought to be commended for his perseverance - few people could ever manage anything like this without being a professional games company. The box makes it sound all very wonderful, but it doesn't seem to amount to much when you've read it - a sort of third-rate Ringworld, actually. Worth buying if you're a rabid Chalker fan, hopelessly rich, or 90% insane.\\" ==Reviews== *Different Worlds #42 (May/June, 1986) ==References== Category:Role-playing games based on novels Category:Role- playing games introduced in 1985 Category:Science fiction role-playing games ","title":"Midnight at the Well of Souls Role-Playing System"},{"id":"46358021","text":"right Simian Conquest is a role-playing game published by Avant-Garde Simulations Perspectives in 1978. ==Description== Simian Conquest is a science fiction role-playing system.

The mission experienced delays in weeks leading up to launch on August 18, 2017 on an Atlas V 401 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. ==Social Media== As Space Apps is a global event, there is a very active social media element to the event. Participants can form teams virtually, collaborating even if they aren't sharing a physical space and never meet face to face. #SpaceApps is used on Twitter and many other platforms. Each challenge is also assigned its own hashtag Sharing of live streaming at the events has been organized some years. Hackpads for the challenges allow participants to ask questions of the experts and also coordinate virtual collaboration. Google Hangouts have also been coordinated with astronauts on the International Space Station and as a method of subject matter experts sharing expertise with participants. ==Yuri's Night== In 2014–2015, Space Apps planned the weekend to occur over Yuri's Night, April 12, when people around the world have parties and events to celebrate achievements in human spaceflight. ==Global Collaborators== Current *NASA *SecondMuse *Booz Allen Hamilton *Mindgrub Past (Government) *JAXA *United States Department of State *National Science Foundation *US Embassy in Jakarta *Australian Space Policy Unit *Technology Strategy Board *British Atmospheric Data Centre *White House Office of Science and Technology Policy *European Space Agency *Environmental Protection Agency Past (Outside of Government) *Geeks Without Bounds *Ustream *GitHub *Urban Engine *Random Hacks of Kindness *Yahoo!

It was first identified in Arabidopsis thaliana in 1993. CCA1 interacts with LHY and TOC1 to form the core of the oscillator system. CCA1 expression peaks at dawn. Loss of CCA1 function leads to a shortened period in the expression of many other genes.Green, RM. \\"Loss of the circadian clock-associated protein 1 in Arabidopsis results in altered clock- regulated gene expression.\\" Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. Vol. 96. (1999) ==Discovery== CCA1 was first identified in Arabidopsis thaliana by Elaine Tobin’s lab in UCLA in 1993.Kenigsbuch, David, and Elaine M. Tobin. \\" A Region of the Arabidopsis Lhcb1*3 Promoter That Binds to CA-1 Activity 1s Essential for High Expression and Phytochrome Regulation\\" Plant Physiol. Vol. 108. (1995): 1023-1027. Tobin’s lab was studying promoter fragments that contribute to light regulation of light-harvesting Chlorophyll A/B Binding Protein (LHCB), and noticed DNA-binding activity that had affinity for a specific light-responsive fragment of the LHCB promoter. This DNA-binding activity was designated as CA-1 because the binding is mostly to cytosine and adenine-rich sequences.Salomé, Patrice, and Robertson McClung. \\"The Arabidopsis thaliana Clock\\" JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS Vol. Vol. 19 No. 5. (2004): 425-435. They found that this binding activity is necessary for phytochrome response. They later found the gene responsible for this activity by screening the Arabidopsis expression library. CCA1 referred to the CA-1 clone, and now designated the gene responsible for this DNA binding activity. The evolution of circadian clocks in land plants is not understood, because circadian rhythms have received little attention in plants other than angiosperms.Okada, Ryo, and Robertson McClung. \\"Functional characterization of CCA1/LHY homolog genes, PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b, in the moss Physcomitrella patens\\" The Plant Journal Vol. 60. (2009): 551–563. ==Function== CCA1 is part of a negative autoregulatory feedback loop that is coordinated with the daily environmental changes. Repressed in the dark by other proteins, CCA1’s expression is activated when light is sensed by the phytochrome in the plant. After translation, the CCA1 protein needs to be phosphorylated by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2). This phosphorylation is necessary for the protein to form a homodimer and to bind to its target promoters. Hyperphosphorylation, due to the overexpression of CK2, will lead to altered circadian rhythms in the mutants where CCA1 showed shorter mRNA circadian oscillation than in wild-type plants.Xavier, Daniel, and Shoji Sugano. \\"CK2 phosphorylation of CCA1 is necessary for its circadian oscillator function in Arabidopsis\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Vol. 101. 3292-3297 CK2 overexpression is significant in demonstrating CCA1 is part of the clock. The protein motif CCA1 uses to bind to its target DNA sequences is its Myb-like domain. CCA1 only has one Myb domain, whereas other plant and mammalian proteins could have multiple Myb domains. The presence of only one Myb domain in CCA1 shows its importance influence in the circadian clock. LUX is also an important Myb transcription factor that is necessary for CCA/LHY transcription. This can also help account for problems in the repressilator model described below.Samuel P. Hazen, Thomas F. Schultz, Jose L. Pruneda-Paz, Justin O. Borevitz, Joseph R. Ecker, and Steve A. Kay. LUX ARRHYTHMO encodes a Myb domain protein essential for circadian rhythms. PNAS 2005 102 (29) 10387-10392; published ahead of print July 8, 2005, doi:10.1073/pnas.0503029102 CCA1 is also unusual in that it has the ability to bind to asymmetric DNA sequences. CCA1 acts to suppress the expression of the DNA sequence it binds to. The stability of CCA1 protein is not affected by light or dark. It is regulated by its proteasome. Inhibiting proteasome function leads to a circadian rhythm with a longer period.Kangisser, Shlomit, Esther Yakir, and Rachel M. Green. \\"Proteasomal regulation of the CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) stability is part of the complex control of CCA1\\" Plant Signaling & Behavior Vol. Volume 8, Issue 3. (2013) ==CCA1 and the Arabidopsis circadian oscillator== The Arabidopsis central oscillator contains several proteins that reciprocally repress genes encoding each other to achieve a negative feedback loop necessary to generate circadian rhythms controlling many clock outputs.Hemmes, H., and R., Jang. \\"Circadian Clock Regulates Dynamic Chromatin Modifications Associated with Arabidopsis CCA1/LHY and TOC1 Transcriptional Rhythms\\" Plant and Cell Physiology Vol. 53(12). (2016–2029) CCA1 is a key component of this oscillator. Light induces its transcription, and mRNA levels peak at dawn along with Late Elongated Hypocotyl (LHY). CCA1 and LHY associate to inhibit transcription of the Evening Complex (EC) proteins: ELF4, ELF3 and LUX, which suppresses their accumulation until dusk when LHY and CCA1 protein levels are at their lowest. The EC inhibits transcription PRR9 and TOC1 at night.Seaton, Daniel D., Robert W. Smith, Young Hun Song, Dana R. MacGregor, Kelly Stewart, Gavin Steel, Julia Foreman, Steven Penfield, Takato Imaizumi, Andrew J. Millar, and Karen J. Halliday. \\"Linked Circadian Outputs Control Elongation Growth and Flowering in Response to Photoperiod and Temperature.\\" Molecular Systems Biology. BlackWell Publishing Ltd, n.d. Web. 22 Apr. 2015. These, along with the remaining PRR proteins PRR7 and PRR5 are involved in suppressing CCA1 and LHY levels, which increase during the night.\\"Mapping the Core of the Arabidopsis Circadian Clock Defines the Network Structure of the Oscillator.\\" Mapping the Core of the Arabidopsis Circadian Clock Defines the Network Structure of the Oscillator. W. Huang. Science. Vol. 336 no. 6077 pp. 75-79 CCA1 is further involved in maintaining this loop by inhibiting its own expression. ==Homologs== Paralogs LHY (late elongated hypocotyl) also has a Myb domain and functions early in the morning. Both LHY and CCA1 have similar patterns of expression, which could be induced by light.Lu, S. X. , and S. M., Andronis. \\"CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL Function Synergistically in the Circadian Clock of Arabidopsis\\" Plant Physiology Vol. 150. (2009): 834–843. Single loss of function mutants in both genes result in seemingly identical phenotypes. But LHY cannot fully rescue the rhythm when CCA1 is absent, indicating that they may only be partially functionally redundant. Under constant light conditions, cca1 and lhy double loss of function mutants fail to maintain rhythms in clock controlled RNAs. Orthologs The circadian oscillator in rice is similar to the Arabidopsis model, and researchers have used this model as a blueprint for understand the rice oscillator. OsLHY in rice serves a similar function as CCA1/LHY and is thus an ortholog of the gene in rice. OsPRR1 in rice is also an ortholog of TOC1. PpCCA1a and PpCCA1b are orthologs of CCA1 and LHy in the moss Physcomitrella patens. They show rhythms with a period of 1 day like their angiosperm homologs in 24-hour light-dark cycles or constant darkness. However these genes show arrhythmicity in constant light conditions, in contrast to CCA1:LHY. ==Mutants== Mutants such as cca1-1 plants, which lack CCA1 protein, show short period phenotypes for the expression of several genes when assayed under constant light conditions. They also have a period 3 hours shorter than that of the wild-type plant, which demonstrates that expression of LHY, its homolog, cannot fully compensate for the loss of the function of CCA1. Plants that have lost function of LHY and CCA1 (lhy;cca1) lost the ability to stably maintain circadian rhythm and other output phenomena. In one study, lhy;cca1 show photoperiod- insensitive early flowering under long- day (16 hours of light/ 8 hours of dark) conditions and short day (8 hours of light, 16 hours of dark conditions), and arrhythmicity under constant light conditions.Aihara, Kohei, and Satoshi Naramoto. \\"Increase in vascular pattern complexity caused by mutations in LHY and CCA1 in Arabidopsis thaliana under continuous light\\" Plant Biotechnology Vol. 31. (2014): 43-47 However they retain some circadian function in light/dark cycles, showing that Arabidopsis circadian clock is not completely dependent on CCA1 and LHY activity.Alabadi, David, and Marcelo J. Yanovsky. \\"Critical Role for CCA1 and LHY in Maintaining Circadian Rhythmicity in Arabidopsis\\" Current Biology Vol. 12(9). (2002): 757–761 Plants with non- functioning LHY and CCA1 show a wavy leaf phenotype in constant light conditions. Mutants also have increased vascular pattern complexity in their leaves, with more areoles, branch points and free ends than wild-type Arabidopsis. == See also == * TOC1 * Steve Kay * Arabidopsis * Oscillating gene * Circadian Rhythm == References == Category:Plant genes ","title":"Circadian Clock Associated 1"},{"id":"46358127","text":"Greta Valenti is an American business woman and artist.

The team is owned by Virginia (Ginny) Byrd and her sons David and Jonathan Byrd II. ==Early history (1982–2001)== Jonathan Byrd's Racing was created in 1982 by business owner Jonathan Byrd and initially ran Pro Stock with driver Jim Begley. Later, they won a few USAC Midget car championships with Rich Vogler. The team first entered the Indianapolis 500 in 1985 with Vogler. Vogler ran for the Byrd team at Indianapolis from 1985-1990, with a best finish of eighth in 1989. The death of team manager Andy Kenopensky from cancer caused the team to be merged with Hemelgarn Racing. Stan Fox replaced drivers Rich Vogler and Billy Vukovich III, who both died in sprint car accidents before racing at the 1991 Indianapolis 500. Fox would finish eighth in 1991. Gordon Johncock came out of retirement to qualify Stan Fox's backup car, fell ill before the race due to the flu and an allergic reaction, but was able to compete and finish sixth. Buddy Lazier would also race for the team, finishing thirty-third. Stan Fox and Gordon Johncock returned as drivers for the 1992 Indianapolis 500. Scott Brayton drove for Dick Simon and Byrd at the 1993 Indianapolis 500 and finished sixth. Byrd joined with A. J. Foyt Enterprises to field cars at the 1994 Indianapolis 500 for Double Duty driver John Andretti, who finished tenth. Davy Jones drove for the Jonathan Byrd and Dick Simon in the 1995 Indianapolis 500. The team won the Dura-Lube 200 with Arie Luyendyk at Phoenix International Raceway in 1996. While partnering with Treadway Racing in 1996, Arie Luyendyk broke the track record for Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Luyendyk suffered from two failed engines, switching to a backup car, and his initial pole time disqualified due to the car being underweight by seven pounds before setting the record. Mike Groff drove for Clayton Cunningham and Byrd in the 1996–97 Indy Racing League season. Byrd-Cunningham driver John Paul Jr. won in the 1998 Lone Star 500 at Texas Motor Speedway. Jonathan Byrd's Racing suspended operations after the 1999 Indianapolis 500. This was due to sponsorship issues and the VisionAire 500K. Byrd completed regularly until the 2001 Indianapolis 500 with Jaques Lazier as that year's driver. Jonathan Byrd had a stroke in 2004 after heart surgery, suffered paralysis on his right side, and died in 2009 from cardiac arrest. ==Byrd Brothers (2005)== Byrd Brothers completed at the 2005 Indianapolis 500 with Buddy Lazier as driver in a partnership with Panther Racing. David and Jonathan, Byrd's sons, organized the team and worked with PR/sponsors. Lazier suffered an accident due to a suspension failure on Carb Day, but after significant repairs would finish fifth in the 500. ==Reformation (2014–2016, 2018–2019)== The team announced plans to return at the 2015 Indianapolis 500 with driver Bryan Clauson and support from KVSH Racing. Jonathan Byrd's Racing was originally intended to return at the 2016 Indianapolis 500, but plans were moved forward a year. Bryan Clauson would qualify in last position (33rd) for the 2015 Indianapolis 500, beating Buddy Lazier. Due to driver changes by other teams, Clauson would start 30th, and wrecked in Turn 4 on Lap 61 finishing 31st. Jonathan Byrd's Racing attempted the 2016 Indianapolis 500 with returning driver Bryan Clauson and support from Dale Coyne Racing. He qualified 28th, would lead laps 97-99, and finished 23rd completing 198 laps. Clauson was the first driver racing for Byrd to lead laps in the Indianapolis 500, and finished the most 500 laps in his career. The team was unsure if they would continue racing due to the death of Clauson in August 2016, and did not enter the 2017 Indianapolis 500. Belardi Auto Racing partnered with Byrd, Baldwin Brothers Racing, and driver Chris Windom to enter the 2018 Indy Lights Freedom 100. Windom wrecked his car in testing and could not compete in the race. Byrd with driver James Davison entered the 2018 Indianapolis 500. The team partnership included A. J. Foyt Enterprises, Belardi Auto Racing, and Hollinger MotorSport (Brad Hollinger). Davison wrecked on Fast Friday, but the team repaired the car for Saturday qualifying, and almost didn't make the race. They would qualify 19th for race, but finish 33rd after wrecking in turns 3 and 4 on lap 47 due to car issues. Byrd joined with Belardi Auto Racing, Dale Coyne Racing and Hollinger MotorSport (Brad Hollinger) to enter driver James Davison in the 2019 Indianapolis 500. Belardi Auto Racing partnered with Byrd and driver Chris Windom to enter the 2019 Indy Lights Freedom 100. Windom raced in the Freedom 100 and was involved in a serious accident, despite having a serious sprint car accident the day before. Davison would quality 15th for the Indianapolis 500, have an incident on pit line, and finish 12th. Byrd was not going to field an entry in the 2020 Indianapolis 500 due to financial issues, but later joined with Belardi Auto Racing, Dale Coyne Racing, and Rick Ware Racing to enter driver James Davison. Davison qualified 27th, but due to a brake and wheel fire finished 33rd. ==Racing results== Complete IndyCar results (key) {  center; font-size:85%\\" ! Year ! Chassis ! Engine !

In February 2015, Henderson joined dozens of his fellow Republicans to support House Bill 1228, sponsored by Bob Ballinger of Carroll County, which sought to prohibit government from imposing a burden on the free exercise of religion. The measure passed the House, seventy-two to twenty. One of the opponents, Democratic Representative Camille Bennett, a former city attorney for Lonoke, Arkansas, called for a reworking of the legislation. Bennett claimed the Ballinger bill would establish a \\"type of religious litmus test\\" which could impact nearly any law under consideration by the legislature.

He died following brain surgery at age 32.Lyn Osborn at Solarguard.com ==Early life== Clois Lyn Osborn was born January 21, 1926 in Wichita Falls, Texas. At age 3, his family moved to Michigan, living in Muskegon and Lincoln Park. At age 10, his mother enrolled him and his sister in a community theater group, which started his interest in performing. He played clarinet, flute and piccolo in the high school band. In 1943 after graduating from Lincoln Park High School, where he was known by the family nickname \\"Buddy\\", Lyn joined the navy. He served as an aerial gunner and radar operator, and flew on Grumman Avengers. The war ended before he went into combat ==Space Patrol== After the navy, Lyn held several jobs before hitchhiking to California, where he did more of the same. He enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse on the G.I. Bill for 3 years, and appeared in 15 plays there. Ten days before graduation, he got his big break cast as \\"Cadet Happy\\" on Space Patrol. The series began as a daily live 15 minute show broadcast from Los Angeles. Soon, half-hour weekly shows were added. There was also a live radio version that ran from 1952 to 1955. The television series ran until 1955, after nearly 1,200 episodes were produced.Space Patrol at Solarguard.com ==Later roles and death== After Space Patrol, he appeared in several TV and film projects, such as The Amazing Colossal Man, The Adventures of Jim Bowie and Rod Serling's acclaimed Requiem for a Heavyweight episode of Playhouse 90. On December 21st, 1954, Lyn appeared as himself and in character as Space Patrol's Cadet Happy on the daytime talk show, \\"The Betty White Show\\". His most memorable appearance was in 1957's Invasion of the Saucer Men, playing the role of Artie, also the narrator of the film. He died following an operation for a brain tumor at UCLA Medical Center, August 30, 1958 at the age of 32.

Prior to this, she came to the attention of notable Mexican tenor Ramón Vargas, who helped her get a scholarship, and then won Mexico's Carlo Morelli national singing competition in 2005, which earned her a debut at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. Since winning the Operalia competition, Katzarava has performed in Europe, where she currently lives, Asia and the Americas. She currently trains with soprano Mirella Freni. ==Life== Born and raised in Mexico City, Katzarava's full name is María Alejandra Katzarava Hernández. She comes from a family of musicians and doctors, the granddaughter of a professional baritone and the daughter of professional violinists. Her father, Archil Katzarava, is from Georgia and her mother, Velia Hernández, Mexican. While pregnant with Maria, her mother attended all the concerts of Mexico's national orchestra, Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional, of which she was a violinist along with her husband. At age three, her father began to teach her to play the violin, and later she began to learn piano along with her older sister Lela. At age eight she had her first concert as a violinist with the Orquestra Juvenil de la Escuela Nacional de Música. Katzarava continued to study the violin for 20 years, but in 2013, gave up the instrument because of the demands of her singing career, as she played only for her own pleasure. She continues to play the piano as part of her singing practice. In her childhood and adolescence she did not have many friends, as her violin studies and her studies at the Liceo Franco Mexicano school took up all of her time. Katzarava states that this prepared her for later life on the road. She says that she has been very sure of herself since she was a child and never thinks about failure when she is on the stage. She learned to overcome stagefright with her first rehearsal thinking of a stage appearance as a party. Despite the time spent in her childhood in music, Katzarava wanted to be a doctor growing up and began to prepare herself for this career in high school, but that changed when she began to study singing. She had always liked to sing as a child and one of her idols was singer Ana Torroja of the pop group Mecano. Her interest in operatic singing was initially sparked by seeing her first opera, La bohème, at age 12, after which she asked her mother for singing lessons. However, she had to wait three years for her voice to mature, and age at 15 began studying under Veracruz soprano Rosario Andrade. She maintained her interest during these three years because she felt she could not express herself sufficiently with the violin, she was intrigued by the development of her own voice and opera attracted her because of the acting component. When she sang her first aria, she fell in love with the “gymnastics” of it. At age 17, she began to study with Maritza Alemán at the Escuela Superior de Música and later with baritone Gabriel Mijares and American maestro James Demster. Her parents have been supportive of her career, which has taken her out of Mexico to live since 2008. She currently lives in Barcelona. Katzarava spends most of her time traveling, but she does not complain as her career allows her to visit many countries. In addition to Spanish, she speaks Georgian, English, French, Italian and Russian. During the off-season she likes to travel, go to the theater, see her friends and family and likes just to spend time at home. She also likes to camp, mountain bike, swim and go to the gym. She originally performed under the name of María Alejandres but returned to her real last name in 2014. ==Career== Katzarava first major recognition of her talent was being named Revelación Juvenil at the Carlo Morelli National Singing Competition in 2002. In 2004, she debuted with the opera La Serva Padrona with the Chihuahua Symphony Orchestra and with the Oaxaca Chamber Orchestra. That same year, she placed first at the Maritza Alemán Competition and was a finalist at the Francisco Viñas International Competition. Her first major break also came in 2004, when she was granted an audition organized by magazine Pro Ópera. There her voice sufficiently impressed tenor Ramón Vargas to not only offer a scholarship, but an offer to mentor her himself. In 2005 Katzarava returned to the Carlo Morelli competition, the most important singing competition in Mexico. This time, she placed first, which earned her the opportunity to have her debut at age 21 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, performing as Stephano in Romeo and Juliet with established artists Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón. She later returned to Bellas Artes for its 80th anniversary celebration. Her first international break came in 2007, when Plácido Domingo heard her at a gala in Acapulco and invited her to audition in Los Angeles. In 2008, she was accepted as a resident into the Domingo-Thorton Young Artist Program of the Los Angeles Opera, to study and work with Gabriel Mijares and Luisa Besrokova. This was followed by her participation in the 2008 Operalia competition in Canada, where she won first place in the opera and operetta category, competing against 1,000 other participants from 200 countries. She became only the third Mexican to win this competition along with tenor Rolando Villazón and Arturo Chacón Cruz, and it brought her international attention and standing. Other awards that Katzarava has earned include the Carlo Bergonzi Prize, the Francisco Viñas international competition, the Oscar Della Lirica at the Arena di Verona in 2012, and she was named best singer by the Miami Life Awards. Katzarava has performed in Europe, Asia and the Americas. In 2009, she debuted in Europe performing the role of Juliet in France. Since then she was performed in various Italian venues, such as the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, the Genoa Theater and is one of the few Mexican singers to have appeared at La Scala in Milan. She has performed at Royal Opera House in London, and in 2013, she made the Teatro Alla Scala Tournée in Verdi's Rigoletto. She made her debut at Teatro Manzoni, Bologna under baton of Michele Mariotti singing \\" Vier letzte Lieder \\" which had a huge success. Katzarava frequently performs in her native Mexico, as she states that she needs to come home regularly. Here she has performed with Orquestra Sinfónica de Minería in Morelia, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Festival Cultural de Zacatecas and has appeared at the Festival Internacional Cervantino on various occasions since 2007. Later on, Maria Katzarava sang the first Violetta of her career at the Grand Théâtre de Genève in 2013, for which she earned critical acclaim. In the spring of 2013 she returned to the Florida Grand Opera for their production of La traviata. During the 2012/13 season Katzarava also made her debut at the Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari as Isabella in Daniel Auber's rarely performed piece La muette de Portici. In July 2013 she debuted at the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari singing her first Suzel in Mascagni's L'amico Fritz. She also joined the Teatro alla Scala on their tour to Japan where she sang Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto. Engagements for the 2013/2014 season included debuts in roles like Nedda in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci at the Fondazione Sinfonica Petruzzelli in Bari; Manon in Massenet's opera at Palacio de Bellas Artes; Liù in Puccini's Turandot at Teatro Lirico di Cagliari and Mimì in Puccini's La bohème. ==Artistry== Katzarava has performed solo, accompanied by pianists, in operas and accompanied by symphony and chamber orchestras such as the Los Angeles Opera company, Orchestra del Teatro Comunale di Bologna, Sinfónica del Teatro Petruzzelli and the Orquestra del Teatro de Bellas Artes among others. She has performed with other singers such as tenor Francisco Araiza. She currently performs with Ramón Vargas, Plácido Domingo, Andrea Bocelli, Rolando Villazón, Piotr Beczala, Leonardo Capalbo among others. She says her main model is soprano Mirella Freni. In her opinion, because opera must compete with more popular forms of entertainment, singers must break the stereotype of rotund performers and for this reason, she works to maintain her figure as a way to make her work as an artist more appealing. During the Operalia competition in Canada, Opera Canada had this to say about her performance: ==References * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican people of Georgian descent Category:Mexican operatic sopranos Category:Singers from Mexico City Category:21st-century Mexican singers Category:21st-century women singers ","title":"Maria Katzarava"},{"id":"46358388","text":"Media is a ghost town in Douglas County, in the U.S. state of Kansas. ==History== The first settlement at Media was made in 1878.

The regular season started in July 2013 and finished in May 2014. The Oberliga is organised in fourteen regional divisions with the league champions promoted to the level above, the Regionalligas while the relegated teams drop down to the Verbandsligas and Landesligas. ==Overview== The fourteen Oberligas in Germany in 2013–14 The 2013–14 season saw 245 clubs compete in fourteen Oberliga divisions. Of the fourteen league champions eight were promoted to the Regionalliga while four declined promotion. One club, Bremer SV, missed out on promotion in the play- off round while Arminia Bielefeld II was ineligible for promotion because the first team of the club was relegated to the 3. Liga and reserve teams of 3. Liga clubs can not play in the Regionalliga. Two of the league champions who declined promotion, BC Aichach and TGM SV Jügesheim, completely withdrew from the Oberliga to compete at a lower level in 2014–15. Of the fourteen league champions VfB Lübeck was arguably the most outstanding, winning 31 of their 34 season games and drawing the other three, thereby remaining undefeated all season. BFC Dynamo was the only other undefeated team, winning 27 and also drawing three. Lübeck also had the best defence, conceding only 17 goals all season and the second-best attack with 116 goals scored, four less than Bremer SV. PSV Wesel-Lackhausen had the worst defence of all Oberliga clubs, conceding 130 goals. While no club went winless all season a number achieved only two wins all season. Four Oberliga runners-up and one third placed team were also promoted to the Regionalliga. FC Nöttingen and FT Braunschweig did so after success in a promotion round while SV Rödinghausen was automatically promoted as the Oberliga Westfalen runners-up and VfR Garching and FC Kray took up the promotion spot their league champions had declined. No club was promoted from the Bremen-Liga, Oberliga Hamburg and Hessenliga. At the other end of the table, 38 clubs were relegated from the Oberligas while six voluntarily withdrew to compete at a lower level. Four more teams, all reserve sides, were completely withdrawn from competition. All up, 48 clubs dropped out of the league. The most goals scored by any player in the Oberligas were by Iranian-German Iman Bi-Ria who scored 48 goals for Bremer SV in the Bremen- Liga.Weltfussball.de German football results and tables ==2013–14 season== The 2013–14 league champions, promoted and relegated teams, the league strength (S), the top scorer and the number of goals they scored:Amateurligen kicker.de – Tables and results of the German amateur leagues, accessed: 10 April 2015Oberliga Fussballdaten.de, – Tables and results of the Oberligas, accessed: 10 April 2015 {  - align=\\"center\\" dfdfdf\\"  Oberliga  Champions  Promoted  Relegated  S  Topscorer  Goals -align=\\"center\\"  Oberliga Baden-Württemberg2013–14 Oberliga Baden-Württemberg Weltfussball.de, accessed: 11 April 20152013–14 Oberliga Baden-Württemberg kicker.de, accessed: 11 April 20152013–14 season  FC Astoria Walldorf  FC Astoria WalldorfFC Nöttingen  TSV Grunbach†1\\\\.

R. Rahman, to the 2015 Indian Tamil film of the same name written and directed by Mani Ratnam. The soundtrack album consists of nine tracks each in original Tamil and Telugu version of the albums with one track \\"Maula Wa Sallim\\" being common to both. Majority of the tracks for the original version were penned by Vairamuthu. The lyrics to the Telugu version were written by Sirivennela Sitaramasastri.The lyrics to its Hindi version songs in its Hindi remake OK Jaanu is by Gulzar The songs are fusion of contemporary music with carnatic music as well as pure classical Indian music based songs in the genres—carnatic and Hindustani. The original score was produced by ensemble Qutb-e-Kripa along with Rahman. The score utilises the songs and re-performed carnatic compositions of musicians Tyagaraja and Annamacharya. The male version of \\"Mental Manadhil\\" was the released as the first single from the soundtrack album. The soundtrack album was released on the midnight of 3 April 2015 by Sony Music India. Upon release, the soundtrack album garnered positive reviews from the music critics who praised the fusion of classical and contemporary genres, sync of songs with film narration and the production quality. The soundtrack album was awarded as the \\"Best Tamil Album of the Year\\" in 2015 by Apple Music. ==Development== In October 2014, it was announced that music director A. R. Rahman and lyricist Vairamuthu will compose the soundtrack in Tamil. Later, Sirivennela Sitaramasastri was opted to write lyrics for the Telugu version. In December 2014, Rahman announced that his son A. R. Ameen will be recording a song for the soundtrack. Mani Ratnam wanted an original soundtrack from Rahman that was contemporary as well as trendy. Rahman took inputs from the story and gave it a musical form. In an interview with The Hindu, lyricist Vairamuthu revealed few track names and the sounds associated with them. He called the track \\"Paranthu Sella Vaa\\" anthemic and the track \\"Naane Varugiren\\" as youthful. According to Rahman, the film's subject was \\"youthful\\" and he tried to bring that kind of feel in the songs as well. He described the tracks as 'adventurous'. Since Leela Samson plays the role of a retired old Carnatic singer in the film, there is a tinge of Carnatic music in the film. Additional compositions to the film score were done by Qutb-e-Kripa, an ensemble of musicians from A. R. Rahman's own music institute KM Music Conservatory. Rahman along with his singers have sung Carnatic compositions of musicians Tyagaraja and Annamacharya for the film score. In an interview with Deccan Chronicle, Rahman mentioned that his request to Mani Ratnam, a complete song was dropped after filming because of the explicit lyrical content. == Composition == The first song composed for the film was \\"Mental Manadhil\\", which Rahman called a \\"light-hearted\\" song. For immediate filming requirements, he had co-written the track with Ratnam during Vairamuthu's absence. Rahman recalled that while writing Mental Manadhil, both he and Ratnam wanted an interesting invention of new words or phrases for the song. During their jamming sessions—Rahman was saying 'Laka Laka' to rhyme with 'Mana Mana... Manadhil...' Ratnam said 'mental' and they decided to coin 'mental' and 'manadhil' together and thus hook words were framed. Later, they interchanged a few Tamil words with their English translations. The song puts forth the desires of a young heart. The song has staccato musical articulation with upbeats. \\"Malargal Kaettaen\\" was produced next, for which the lyrics were written first. It is a Carnatic keerthanai which incorporates sounds of Tanpura kanjira and flute. The track is based on raga Bihag. Briefing on the song \\"Naane Varugiren\\", Rahman stated, \\"Sometimes, you have to compromise words for the sound — the sound is very important, it de-clutters from the words. People don’t have as much bandwidth as before; we have to catch their attention immediately.\\" Vairamuthu wrote an antara for the track, which, according to Rahman, had \\"very complicated words\\". Instead, Rahman and he came up with repetitive lyrics. The song is based on raag Darbari Kanada. The tune construction of the song with sangathis are complex and forced. The song expresses the glib of surrendering to love. According to Rahman, the song \\"Aye Sinamika\\" took the longest time to get completed. It was a \\"soft song\\" that Ratnam wanted to be more energetic, on the lines of \\"Endrendrum Punnagai\\" (from Alaipayuthey) with more indipop sound to it. Although the lyrics for the song were written by Vairamuthu, Ratnam and Rahman again contributed two self- coined terms to the song: \\"Sinamika\\" and \\"Anadhika\\". The words in the song were almost incidental — the words are sounds just like the other sounds, from the instruments. In the track, almost an entire minute is filled with variations on just three words- 'Nee' 'Ennai' 'Neengaathe'. The track has more guitar sounds. Regarding \\"Kaara Attakkaara\\", which was one of the first songs to be composed, Rahman told that it was planned to be a very unconventional composition. After incorporating various ideas into the song, the original track length was 15 minutes. Later, Rahman cut it down to nearly 6 minutes. Singer Darshana recorded her parts for the song in January 2015. The lines first rehearsed were used in the trailer. She recorded for twenty minutes. Four days later, she was called in the studio to record the same rap that was sung by Aaryan Dinesh Kanagaratnam. \\"Parandhu Sellu Vaa\\" was composed using the iPad app \\"Loopy\\", which creates loops, since Ratnam wanted it to feature minimal orchestration. It is a slow, sensuous track. When the phrase \\"Nanaindhu Kollava\\" appears at the middle of the song, the minimal violin based orchestration begins and runs until the end of the track. The song has sixty odd non-repeating words. \\"Theera Ulaa\\" was composed after Rahman had seen the entire film. Singer Darshana's lines were in the classical Indian music genre. Rahman wanted her to sing with the feel of 'contentment' as if 'floating in air'. In parts, the track is laid with twangs of classical instruments. The arrangement of the track is fast-paced with all the three singers' voices vocoded. The song starts off with a lot of auto-tune but diminshes when the female vocals begin, blending of classical music. ==Critical reception == Srinivas Ramanujan, who wrote for The Hindu, called the album \\"classical yet cool\\" and went on to add, \\"This album is ample proof that the Mani Ratnam-A.R.Rahman-Vairamuthu combination is still the best in the business. The musical assortment that is Oh Kadhal Kanmani is delicious to the ear!\\" Nivedita Mishra for Hindustan Times showed wonder, \\"How A.R. Rahman and Mani Ratnam make magical music\\", whereas while reviewing the music in the film, critic Haricharan Pudipedi stated, \\"Rahman's music, needless to say, is soul-stirring, if not as standalone soundtrack but it works so well in the movie.\\" Behindwoods called the album, \\"Classy and contemporary all the way\\", giving the album 3.75 stars out of 5. Writing for The New Indian Express, Vipin Nair noted, \\"Mani Ratnam still does manage to turn A R Rahman into his inventive best! The inventiveness here may not go down well in every case, but this will still remain a brilliant soundtrack.\\" He rated the album 9 on a scale of 10. Indo-Asian News Service heaped praise on the song \\"Naane Varugiraen\\", writing that it was \\"one such song to which Rahman gives his pure touch with tunes that can only come from his soul\\" and that Rahman \\"creates magic\\" with that song, going on to call it \\"undoubtedly the best of the lot with \\"Paranthu Sella Vaa\\" and \\"Aye Sinamika\\" blessed by Karthik's voice following closely\\". Critics of BollywoodLife called the music by A. R. Rahman a big hit and commendable job done for background score. M. Suganth for The Times of India wrote, \\"A. R. Rahman's hip songs and background score, keeps the scenes throbbing in the film.\\" Critic S. Saraswathi, in her review for Rediff noted, \\"A R Rahman has outdone himself once again. Both the background music and the songs are exhilarating and perfectly in sync with the narrative.\\" Anupama Subramaniam of Deccan Chronicle opined that Ratnam and Rahman had created magical musical. She went on to add, \\"The songs ARR’s songs which are already chartbusters elevate the entire proceedings.\\" Kavitha Muralidharan for India Today summarized, \\"Needless to speak of the tracks that A R Rahman has come up with for his mentor. From peppy to mellifluous, Rahman has belted out numbers that makes OKK a complete if not perfect romance.\\" Writing for Gulf News, critic Mythily Ramachandran praised the style of the song \\"Parandhu Sella Vaa\\"-its introduction and the way the song is carried on using loopy app. She called Rahman's music magical. R. S. Prakash of Bangalore Mirror wrote, \\"Rahman's background score is top-notch, especially in the romantic sequences.\\" Shankar of Oneindia Tamil noted that the soundtrack brings a feel of happiness to the heart, rewarding the album with 3.5 stars out of 5. Sify's critic Siddharth wrote, \\"OK Kanmani is an album that has tracks that didn’t amalgamate imaginations. Being a return to roots romance movie for Mani Ratnam, the songs were expected to be simple. But ARR has delivered some of the most complex tracks in recent times and relieves himself out of his recent debacles. It is not Rahman’s best but even a half blazing ARR is miles ahead of the rest.\\" However the critic at Sify, reviewing music of the film stated, \\"A R Rahman's alluring music elevates the energy to the different level. Rahman has given his career best work to Ratnam.\\" Anamika Nair based at DNA India wrote, \\"The legendary duo Rahman-Ratnam...come together once again and created this magic number.\\" Baradwaj Rangan opined, \\"Nice-ish. That’s the word I have right now for O Kadhal Kanmani. It didn’t make me wince the way the soundtracks for Lingaa and Kochadaiiyaan did. It didn’t activate every single one of my pleasure centres the way the soundtrack for I did. It’s somewhere in the middle.\\" However, he praised the production quality of the soundtrack album. ==Track listing== Original Telugu ==Chart performance== center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2015) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\" Indian Music Charts 1 - Sri Lankan Music Charts 67 } center\\" - !

She was the granddaughter of Raja Bharmal, whose daughter Jodha Bai had been married to Akbar the Great in 1562, and by him was the mother of Jahangir. She became the mother of Salim's eldest son Khusrau Mirza after which she was given the title of Shah Begum by Salim. ==Marriage== At the age of fifteen, Salim was betrothed to his cousin, Man Bai. The marriage settlement was fixed at two crores of tankas. Akbar himself, accompanied by all his nobles, went to the Raja's mansion and on 13 February 1585, celebrated the wedding in the presence of Muslim qazis, but with certain characteristic Hindu ceremonies. The dowry bestowed by Bhagwant Das included a hundred elephants, several strings of horses, jewels, numerous and diverse golden vessels set with precious stones, utensils of gold and silver, and all sorts of riches, the quantity of which is beyond all computation. The imperial nobles were presented with Persian, Turkish, and Arabian horses, with golden saddles. Along with the bride were given a number of male and female slaves, of Indian, Abyssinian and Circassian origin. As the Imperial procession returned along highways covered with rare and choice cloth, the Emperor scattered over the bridal litter gold and jewels in careless profusion. The couple's first child was a daughter named Sultan- un-Nissa Begum, who was born on 25 April 1586 and died on 5 September 1646. She lived for sixty years but played no part in history. The couple's second child was a son named Khusrau Mirza, who was born on 16 August 1587. On his birth, Man Bai was given the title of \\"Shah Begum\\" meaning \\"The royal lady\\". She was described to be a very beautiful woman. With her fidelity and sincere devotion to Jahangir, she won a special place in his heart. She was a neurotic woman, quick to take offence over imagined insults, for which there was plenty of scope for the Rajput princess in Jahangir's polygamous and predominantly Muslim household. \\"The lady [Shah Begum] was ever ambitious of an ascendancy over the other inmates of the harem, and grew violent at the slightest opposition of her will\\" said Inayatullah. \\"From time to time her mind wandered, and her father and brothers all agreed in telling me she was insane,\\" writes Jahangir. Shah Begum constantly advised Khusrau to be loyal to his father. When she saw that it was of no use, she decided to take her own life which was an integral part of Rajput nature. ==Death== Shah Begum died on 16 May 1604. With her mind of in a state of imbalance she ate a lot of opium and died thereafter. She was incapable of tolerating the misconduct of her son and brother toward Jahangir, and despaired her life in a circumstantial trauma. Shah Begum's tomb is located in Khusrau Bagh, Allahabad. Aqa Reza, the principal artist at Allahabad court was charged with the responsibility for constructing her tomb. It was completed in 1606-7. ==In popular culture== Neetha Shetty portrayed Shah Begum in EPIC channel's critically acclaimed historical drama Siyaasat (based on the Twentieth Wife). ==See also== *Amber *Jahangir *Khusrau Mirza ==ReferencesSources== * ==External links== * Category:1570s births Category:1604 deaths Category:Indian female royalty Category:Mughal nobility Category:People from Agra Category:Women of the Mughal Empire Category:Indian Hindus Category:People from Jaipur Category:Indian queen consorts Category:16th-century Indian women ","title":"Shah Begum (wife of Jahangir)"},{"id":"46358894","text":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems is a bimonthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society.

Her family was well known within the Italian unification movement, where they supported Giuseppe Garibaldi. Alma Dolens married a lawyer from Milan, who was supportive of her work. == Work == Alma Dolens was the president of the Lombardy Committee for Woman Suffrage and Workers' Rights. She spoke at national peace conferences in 1909 and 1910, cementing her role within the otherwise male-dominated Italian peace movement. She believed that women were necessary for social progress, and that the lack of women within the Italian peace movement and within politics as a whole was detrimental. She believed strongly in creating bonds between the Italian peace movement and the trade unions. She created the Società per la pace femminile (Women's Society for Peace), and traveled throughout central Italy to create local committees within it. She worked with the metalworkers' union to create the Associazione nazionale pro arbitrate e disarmo (Workers' Society for Arbitration and Disarmament) in Milan, which had around 700 members by the early 1910s. The 1911 Italo-Turkish War ended the peace movement, splitting it between those who felt that they should support the war, and those who did not. Alma Dolens fell in the latter category, campaigning publicly against the war and appealing to groups within the United States and Switzerland for financial support to allow the pacifists to reform. She continued to work throughout 1911 and 1912, but the Italian pacifist movement eventually fell apart completely, and Alma Dolens was banned from speaking publicly in Italy for those two years. She turned her attentions elsewhere, writing about living conditions for the lower class in Italian cities. At a peace conference in Budapest in 1913, Alma Dolens met and befriended Rosika Schwimmer, another pacifist and suffragist. She also returned to speaking at party events in 1913, sometimes alongside Margherita Sarfatti. In 1914, Alma Dolens went to meetings about the impending war in Europe that had been organized by the International Peace Bureau and by The Hague. She and Rosalia Gwiss-Adami were the Italian pacifists' delegates to the 31 July conference in Brussels, a conference that served as one last attempt at avoiding the war. Throughout the war, she performed relief work for families who had been driven out of their homes by the war within Austria- Hungary. After the end of the Italo-Turkish War, she traveled through Belgium to lecture. Seeing the destruction from the war reaffirmed her beliefs in pacifism, and she said in one of her lectures \\"the enemy is not at the border; it is all around us: it is poverty, tuberculosis, unemployment. The cure for these diseases is the end of formidable and costly weaponry.\\" She insisted the countries should be required by law to arbitrate during war. After the Second World War she went to live in the home of a socialist friend, Gilberto Gilioli and his wife Myrthe Ripamonti, where she died in 1948. ==See also== * List of peace activists * List of suffragists and suffragettes == References == Category:1876 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Italian anti-war activists Category:Italian feminists Category:Italian journalists Category:Italian pacifists Category:Italian suffragists Category:Italian women writers Category:People from Umbria ","title":"Alma Dolens"},{"id":"46358953","text":"Tim McClellan is an American entrepreneur and master craftsman, best known for his work in sustainable furniture design.

At the age of 14, he won his school's home- ec prize for his sewing and cooking skills as well as the AG Mechanic award for welding. In 1985, McClellan's family moved to Maryland where he graduated from Winston Churchill High School in 1987. He was accepted into an honors program at the University of Maryland but decided not to attend college after attending freshman orientation. ==Career== McClellan founded Western Heritage Furniture in Seattle in 1991. He began by making furniture from salvaged wood that he reclaimed from slash-and-burn piles. After founding the company, McClellan made a bet with his girlfriend that he could build a lodgepole bed that she wanted for less than the $1,200 retail price. The bed that he completed turned into requests for more beds which led to him being commissioned to furnish entire homes out of reclaimed wood.

McClellan was the winner of the challenge, but later disqualified after his winning design was found to resemble another piece of furniture from another designer. McClellan denied copying the design while admitting similarities of the pieces. McClellan was a fan favorite on the show and after his disqualification his fans criticized HGTV on social media for its handling of the show. The show became the most watched show in HGTV history and McClellan later appeared on an episode of Ellen where she informed McClellan that she did not believe that he intentionally copied the design. McClellan is the founder of Cowboy Customs Speed Shop, an automobile shop that customizes classic vehicles with materials such as saddle leather, copper, silver, and historic barnwood. McClellan's customizations include fabricating the world's only 1940 4-door 4x4 deluxe pick-up.

The film stars Reese Mishler, Pfeifer Brown, Ryan Shoos and Cassidy Gifford-Weirda . The Gallows was released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema on July 10, 2015. It was largely disliked by critics and audiences but grossed $43 million worldwide against a $100,000 budget. A sequel, The Gallows Act II, was released in October 2019. ==Plot== On October 29, 1993, Beatrice High School student Charlie Grimille is accidentally hanged and killed after a prop malfunction during a presentation of the play The Gallows. His parents, along with the whole audience, witness the tragic event. Twenty years later, on October 28, 2013, the school attempts to put on a new performance of The Gallows. Reese Houser is excited, as this gives him a chance to grow closer to his crush Pfeifer Ross. His friend Ryan Shoos comes up with the idea to vandalize the set. That night, Reese, Ryan, and Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy Spilker sneak into the school and begin to dismantle the set, only to hear Pfeifer in the hallway. They try to leave but find that they have been locked inside, and there is no cell phone reception. Disturbed, Cassidy admits the trio's real reason for being in the school at this time, which angers Pfeifer. The group see the set reassembled and find news coverage of Charlie's death that includes an interview with his girlfriend Alexis. They discover that Charlie was not supposed to have performed that day, and was only on stage because he was the understudy for the main actor, Reese's father Rick. The group becomes separated. Alone, Ryan sees various things, such as a hidden room with a mattress and bed frame, and a body hanging. When the group is reunited, Cassidy is yanked into the air by seemingly nothing, leaving her with burns on her neck that look like rope burns. They return to the stage, where Pfeifer points out an air conditioning duct they can escape through. Ryan is thrown off the ladder by an unseen force, and his leg is broken. The group becomes locked out of the stage where Ryan lays helpless. They eventually get back, finding only Ryan's phone. The audience then sees footage from the phone. Ryan sees a figure holding a noose. He is then pulled away by the neck by a fly rig. As the night progresses, Cassidy is killed by Charlie dressed as the Hangman, a character from The Gallows. Reese and Pfeifer end up on the stage, where the spirit begins to choke her. Realizing Charlie wants them to act out the final scene (in which Reese and Charlie's characters are hanged), Reese and Pfeifer reenact the scene. However, when Reese puts the noose around his neck, he is hanged and killed by Charlie. Once he is dead, Pfeifer and Charlie, now appearing as an adult, both bow, and Alexis, who was watching the performance, gives a standing ovation. The police enter the house where Pfeifer and Alexis are living and watching footage of Charlie’s death, showing that Pfeifer is the daughter of Charlie and Alexis. When they attempt to question them about Charlie, Pfeifer warns, \\"You shouldn’t say that name.\\" The officer witnesses his partner being dragged by a noose, killing him. Charlie then attacks and kills the policeman, as the screen cuts to black. ==Cast== * Reese Mishler as Reese Houser * Pfeifer Brown as Pfeifer Ross * Ryan Shoos as Ryan Shoos * Cassidy Gifford-Weirda as Cassidy Spilker * Price T.

On December 10, 2014, it was announced the film would be released on July 10, 2015, in the United States. Though the film is set in Lofing's hometown of Beatrice, Nebraska, all of the scenes in the theatrical version of the film were shot in Fresno, California. Several scenes in the first cut of the film were shot in Beatrice, but those scenes were dropped when Blumhouse Productions picked up the film. Those scenes were featured in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of The Gallows. The actors performed their own stunts, and no major CGI was used in the film, Lofing said. ==Release== Box office The Gallows grossed $22.7 million in North America and $20.2 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $43 million, against a budget of $100,000. The Gallows opened on July 10, 2015, simultaneously with animated film Minions and the sci-fi drama Self/less. The film grossed $900,000 during its Thursday night showings, and $4.5 million on its opening day. The film opened at number five at the box office in its opening weekend, with $9.8 million. Critical response According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 15% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 115 reviews, with an average rating of 3.15/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Narratively contrived and visually a mess, The Gallows sends viewers on a shaky tumble to the bottom of the found-footage horror barrel.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns and normalizes scores of critic reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". According to CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of \\"C\\" on an A+ to F scale. Geoff Berkshire of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying \\"The Gallows isn't without a certain amount of atmosphere, it simply feels borrowed wholesale. That would matter less with a better script, but the four main characters are paper-thin even by genre norms.\\" Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film one out of four stars, saying \\"The plot is a collection of contrivances (Oh no, the lights all went out! My cell phone won't work! I'm running for my life, I'd better keep filming!) and the scares are simple, sudden, stupid shocks.\\" Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C, saying \\"This is another found-footage movie that, with a little art direction and some actual cinematography, could easily have been a decent little terrorizer. Instead, it comes mostly unglued thanks to its hacky gimmick.\\" Bruce Demara of the Toronto Star gave the film two out of four stars, saying \\"Despite its initial promise and some decent scares - you're in for a sharp and sudden drop in satisfaction in the final throes.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of four stars, saying \\"The filmmakers needed to set themselves free even more than the characters, but they never find the path out. They probably never realized they were trapped.\\" Simon Abrams of The Village Voice gave the film a negative review, saying \\"The Gallows is only good enough to make you wish its creators did something novel with its formulaic style, plot, and characterizations.\\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said, \\"The Gallows starts with a decent if improbable premise, and it ends with a pretty good jolt. But in between, the film sure wears out the already tired found-footage device.\\" Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film a negative review, saying \\"The Gallows is one lazy film. There's no real effort or inventiveness here, whether we're talking about the character names, the jokes, the set pieces, or the predictable plot twist.\\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"In a quick 80 minutes, we get the back story, we meet the four core characters (all of the young actors do fine work), get the wits scared out of us about a half-dozen times and wind up with a VERY creepy ending.\\" Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail gave the film one out of four stars, saying \\"As the latest entry in the tired \\"found footage\\" horror subgenre, this on-the-cheap film has never met a cliché it didn't embrace like sweet death itself.\\" A.A. Dowd of The A.V.

They start by arresting Vanchat when he was selling Chitauri metal to Emily Deville. His Chitauri metal is a match to the type used in the Centipede serum, so S.H.I.E.L.D. believe he can lead them to Edison Po and Raina. Hand is infuriated when Skye hacks S.H.I.E.L.D.'s databases to trace Vanchat's finances, and decides to eject Skye from the Bus after increasing the security on her internet blocker bracelet. Ward, Fitz and Simmons provide Skye with a satellite phone and help her evade other agents to go off the grid. When she is unable to gain access to a computer system without it being remotely shut down by S.H.I.E.L.D., she poses as an agent to blackmail corrupt businessman Lloyd Rathman into helping her. Po has taken Coulson to an abandoned town and interrogates him using a mind probe to try to discover the circumstances of his resurrection following the Battle of New York, claiming the Clairvoyant cannot 'see' what happened. Po's efforts are futile and the Clairvoyant kills him, putting Raina in charge instead. Raina treats Coulson with kindness, convincing him that he also wants to know how he was revived, and mentioning his father's death during his youth, and his relationship with the cellist, both of which the Clairvoyant knew about; she also reveals that she allowed the probe to be used on her. Coulson eventually lets her use the machine on him, reawakening traumatic buried memories. Vanchat's information sends Hand's team in the wrong direction, but Skye traces Raina's purchases and learns where she is, before regrouping with May, Ward, Fitz and Simmons to go to the town. While May and Ward defeat the Centipede soldiers guarding the town, Skye rescues Coulson, and Raina is arrested. Coulson removes Skye's blocker device by way of thanks, and informs the team that their new mission is to track down the Clairvoyant. He later meets with Streiten, one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. doctors who operated on him, and Streiten confirms that Coulson's reawakened memories are real: Coulson was dead for days rather than minutes, and was kept alive by machines which directly stimulated his brain with electricity, until a means of fully healing him could be found. His memories were altered so he believed he had a pleasant recovery in Tahiti. In an end tag, Mike Peterson, still alive but severely burned and minus his right leg, awakens in a basement and realizes that he has received an eye implant, through which the Clairvoyant begins to issue instructions to him. ==Production== Development and writing In December 2014, Marvel revealed that the eleventh episode would be titled \\"The Magical Place\\", and would be written by Paul Zbyszewski and Brent Fletcher, with Kevin Hooks directing. Fletcher was excited to pair Phil Coulson with Raina in the episode, since she had become a \\"different [type of] villain\\" for the series. The episode's ending, in which Coulson visualizes his brain being reconstructed, was one of the early conceptualizations for the series from showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell. Casting In December 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, respectively. It was also revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include Saffron Burrows as Agent Victoria Hand, Ron Glass as Dr. Streiten, Ruth Negga as Raina, Rob Huebel as Lloyd Rathman, Aiden Turner as Vanchat, Felisha Terrell as Emily Deville, Cullen Douglas as Po. Burrows, Glass, Negga, and Douglas reprise their roles from earlier in the series. J. August Richards also appears, reprising his role of Mike Peterson. Though Turner is introduced here as Vanchat, the character had been mentioned previously in the season, including in \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Eye Spy\\". Filming and visual effect Filming occurred from November 7 to 18, 2013. A scenic ghost town was made to look like a 1950s nuclear testing ground for the location where Coulson is held, while a small grass hut was constructed surrounded by green screen to represent Coulson's memory of Tahiti. When Coulson is being operated on, Gregg wore a green screen cap to allow the visual effects of his exposed brain to be added. Visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack also digitally extended the operating room set and added the robot arm performing the surgery. Kolpack's vision for the robot arm was a mix between Edward Scissorhands (1990) and a black widow spider with \\"needles moving at a high rate of speed\\". Small bolts of electricity were also added each time the arm touched Coulson's brain to represent neurological activity.

To increase the electronic conductivity of cathode, sulfur is usually mixed with carbon to form a cathode composite. Magnesium sulfur battery is an emerging energy storage technology and now is still in the stage of research. It is of great interest since in theory the Mg/S chemistry can provide 1722 Wh/kg energy density with an voltage at ~1.7 V. Magnesium is abundant, non-toxic and doesn't degrade in air. Most importantly, magnesium does not form dendrites during deposition/stripping process, which is attributed to be the main cause for the safety issue in lithium ion battery and rechargeable lithium battery. A first review on Mg-S batteries has been published in MRS Communications == Research ==  Toyota  In 2011 Toyota Motor announced a research project in this area, and in the same year they reported a new electrolyte that is chemically compatible with sulfur. The electrolyte was prepared as a Lewis acid-base complex from the Hauser base (HMDS)MgCl, introduced by C. Liebenow et al. in 2000 and AlCl3, conceptionally similar to Aurbach´s binuclear electrolyte complex from 2001. Although the complex had to be refined by recrystallization and only THF could be used as solvent, a discharge voltage of 1 V was obtained over two cycles, demonstrating the principle feasibility. Currently, efforts on rechargeable magnesium battery research are known to be underway at Apple, Toyota, and Pellion Technologies, as well as in several universities.  Helmholtz-Institute Ulm and KIT  In 2013 researchers announced a new electrolyte and accompanying magnesium-based batteries. The electrolyte is more stable and works well with various solvents and at high concentrations. It supports sulfur cathodes. Two commercial chemicals, a magnesium amide and aluminum chloride were mixed in a solvent, the product can then be used directly as an electrolyte. In 2015 a Mg rechargeable battery was presented built with a graphene–sulfur nanocomposite cathode, a Mg–carbon composite anode and a non-nucleophilic Mg-based complex in tetraglyme solvent as the electrolyte. The graphene–sulfur nanocomposites were prepared with a combination of thermal and chemical precipitation. The Mg/S cell delivers 448 mA h g−1 and 236 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The graphene–sulfur composite cathode, with a high surface area, porous morphology and oxygen functional groups, along with a non-nucleophilic Mg electrolyte, gives improved performance. Recently, a new class of sulfur-compatible and Cl-free electrolytes was introduced. It is based on a weakly coordinated Mg salt with big anions (fluorinated alkoxyborate) which can be prepared by a simple reaction and used in-situ.  University of Maryland  In 2015, a team at University of Maryland discovered that Li ion additive can enhance the reversibility of the electrochemical reaction in a Mg/S battery. The Mg/S cell delivers ~1000 mAh/g capacity for 30 cycles with two discharge plateau at 1.75V and 1.0V. The obtainable energy density of the cell at material level is 874 Wh/kg, about half of its theoretical value. In 2017, the same team successfully increases the cycling stability of a Mg/S cell to 110 cycles, by suppressing the dissolution of polysulfide with a concentrated electrolyte, a major reason for the loss of active material and capacity fading in Mg/S batteries. They also demonstrate that the MgTFSI2-MgCl2-DME electrolyte is compatible with sulfur cathode. Unlike the complex electrolytes made through Lewis acid-base reaction or the electrolytes using Mg salts with big anions, this electrolyte can be simply made by blending dried MgTFSI2, MgCl2 with DME. This facile synthesis procedure enables this electrolyte to be a convenient platform for the community to further study the Mg/S chemistry. == References == Category:Rechargeable batteries Category:Magnesium Category:Sulfur ","title":"Magnesium sulfur battery"},{"id":"46359156","text":"Wolf Warrior () is a 2015 Chinese 3D war action film directed by Wu Jing.

Min Deng re-hires Tom Cat and his group to assassinate Leng Feng, but warns them not to underestimate the strength and resolve of the People's Liberation Army. The Wolf Warriors participate in a training exercise in a remote and uninhabited forested region on China's southern border. During the exercise, Tom Cat and his mercenaries ambush a Wolf Warrior squad, killing one of Leng Feng's comrades. Leng Feng and PLA helicopters pursue Tom Cat but he escapes, using graphite-powder weapons to deny airspace to PLA air support. Without quick-reaction air support to call on, PLA commanders cancel the training exercise and send a combined force of the Wolf Warriors and People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces into the forest to apprehend Tom Cat and his mercenaries. While re-arming from helicopter-delivered supply drops, the Wolf Warriors are inspired by a speech from their commanders to defend the honour of China and avenge the death of their comrade. The combined infantry force move into the forest but are delayed by multiple traps set by Tom Cat and pinned down by sniper fire from Assassin, Tom Cat's elite marksman. Leng Feng and the other soldiers cut down a tree with sheer firepower to create cover and Leng Feng sprints into the forest alone to flank Assassin, dodging his fire and managing to engage and kill him at point-blank range. Meanwhile the rest of the PLA force engages Tom Cat's other mercenaries, who stage a fighting retreat but are eventually overwhelmed and killed one by one. At base, Long Xiaoyun and the other PLA commanders deduce that Ming Deng himself is also in the training area to take possession of a smuggled cache of biotechnology, which could allow the creation of a genetic weapon that could target Chinese people exclusively. Leng Feng again pursues Tom Cat through the forest, who delays him with multiple traps including a land mine, which Leng Feng triggers but escapes from by digging a pit under the mine and jumping away from the blast. He eventually catches Tom Cat just before the marker delineating China's southern border. Both fighters empty their weapons at each other before engaging in close-quarters combat. Leng Feng, wounded and exhausted from the previous fights, is nearly defeated, but manages to kill Tom Cat with his own knife after Tom Cat mocks Leng Feng's patriotism. Medical personnel from a PLA relief force arrive, but Leng Feng recognises the wrist tattoo of the medic that approaches him and realizes that they are Min Deng's men in PLA uniforms. He grabs a rifle and attacks them, eventually holding Min Deng himself at bayonet point on the very edge of the Chinese border. Min Deng's massive paramilitary force approaches from the other side of the border, but so do the rest of the Wolf Warriors and PLA soldiers. Min Deng's force retreats. After the action, Commander Long Xiaoyun agrees to accompany Leng Feng for a drink. ==Cast== *Wu Jing as Leng Feng, a marksman in the People's Liberation Army who was initially court martialled and reprimanded for failing to obey a direct order during an operation.

In order to portray more realistic combat scenes, the movie used five missiles (each at a value of one million yuan), more than 30,000 rounds of ammunition, and a variety of Chinese active military aircraft, including the Chengdu J-10, Harbin Z-9, and CAIC Z-10. In one large battle scene, 32 active tanks appeared in the same shot, including a Type 96 tank. In order to prepare for the film, with the support of Chinese PLA Nanjing Military Region, Wu Jing trained for 18 months at a camp in Nanjing Military Region. On the first day of shooting, it was the hottest summer in Nanjing's history. The temperature was up to 49.8 °C, making 5 extra actors suffer from shock. Most of the film was made on location in Jiangsu province, at sites including Nanjing and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. ==Box office== As of 25 May 2015, it has earned US$89.11 million in China. In China, it opened on 2 April 2015, earning US$33.32 million in its 4-day opening weekend topping the Chinese box office. In its second weekend, it fell to number two, earning US$36.19 million (behind Furious 7). ==Awards== {  - ! Date !! Award !! Category !! Recipient(s) and nominee(s) !!Result!!

His younger brother, Walter D'Arcy Cresswell, also known as an author in later life, was born in 1896. Douglas Cresswell was educated at Robin Hood Bay in Port Underwood in the Marlborough Sounds, and later (1908–12) at Christ's College in Christchurch. After finishing school he travelled abroad. Cresswell later served as a lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, Canterbury Regiment, New Zealand Expeditionary Force in France during World War I, and thus was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. After the war he farmed on the plains near Ashburton for about ten years. He married artist Frances Edith \\"Fanny\\" Buss in 1932. She was born in 1910. They had four children. From the 1930s, Cresswell became well known for his talks on radio covering topics including pioneer settlers, farming and industry, and he wrote many books, particularly about 19th century European settlement in New Zealand. Cresswell was the Christchurch secretary of the Democratic Labour Party (DLP), formed by John A. Lee following (Lee's) expulsion from the Labour Party. At the 1943 general election, Cresswell was the DLP's candidate in the Timaru electorate, polling third behind the Labour and National candidates. In later life he lived in Governors Bay where a road - Cresswell Avenue - is named after him. He died at Governors Bay in 1960, and Fanny died in 1986.

In the same year, he became an assistant of Bernhard Fischer at the Senckenberg Institute of Pathology at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt, where he worked for the next 14 years. He earned his Habilitation in 1923, became an associate professor in 1926 and a full professor in 1927. After his dismissal due to being Jewish in 1933, he emigrated to Zurich, Switzerland, where he founded the Advisory Office for German Scientists to help other refugees find new employment, notably establishing contacts with Turkish universities. Together with Albert Malche, Schwartz convinced the Turkish government to appoint the persecuted German professors for the free positions in the higher education. Finally, contracts up until five years were signed. Over time around 150 academics immigrated to Turkey while most of them were from the economic, finance, law or medical fields. Social sciences played a less important role. He later became director of the Department of Pathology at the University of Istanbul. From 1953 he worked as a pathologist at the Warren State Hospital in Pennsylvania and chaired a research department there.

He finished tied for second in the 1899 U.S. Open and finished tenth in 1900. ==Early life== Fitzjohn was born on 2 June 1878 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was the son of George Fitzjohn, a former sergeant in the Edinburgh City Police, and his wife Grace Willonghby. Valentine attended Gullane school and at the age of 12 years was a licensed caddie at North Berwick. By 1880 the family had moved to Musselburgh where their father took up a post as clubmaster and steward to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. Fitzjohn had three brothers, Herbert, Frederick and Edward \\"Ned\\", who were also professional golfers. In 1894 he and Ed emigrated to the United States and by 1896 had been appointed as the first golf professional at Otsego Golf Club at Springfield Center, New York, and remained there until 1899. By October 1900, Fitzjohn was the superintendent of the Van Cortlandt Park links in Brooklyn. ==Golf career== On 29 September 1897 he played an exhibition match against John Shippen at Ardsley Golf Club and won easily. An article at the time published in The New York Times described Shippen as \\"the colored lad\\". In October 1900 Fitzjohn and John Reid, Jr. took on Harry Vardon in a match at Albany, New York. During most of his 1900 exhibition tour, Vardon played alone against the best ball of what were usually the two best players at each club where he played matches. A cold rain pelted the players and spectators during the event which Vardon won by the score of 2 up. Fitzjohn's driving off the tee was described as unusually low, with a long run on it, and those shots captured the gallery, although his short game \\"was not quite up to the mark ...\\". By 1901 Fitzjohn was the professional at the Mohawk Golf Club in Schenectady, New York, having prior been engaged at the Otsego Golf Club. In July 1904 he was the professional at the Hillendale Golf Club in Phoenix, Maryland, and posted a course record of 71 on a course in Stamford, Connecticut, and won his match against Dr. Frederick Schavoir. In 1930, Fitzjohn was living in Greenwich, Connecticut. 1899 U.S. Open The 1899 U.S. Open was the fifth U.S. Open. The golf tournament was held 14–15 September 1899, at Baltimore Country Club. Scottish golfer Willie Smith of the Midlothian Country Club, Chicago, recorded a record 11-stroke victory for his first U.S. Open title. Fitzjohn, George Low, and Bert Way finished tied for second. Each player was awarded $125 in prize money. Fitzjohn had rounds of 85-80-79-82=326. 1900 U.S. Open Fitzjohn placed tenth in the 1900 U.S. Open, held 4–5 October 1900, at Chicago Golf Club in Wheaton, Illinois. He carded rounds of 84-83-89-82=338 but failed to win any prize money, nor did the ninth-place finisher, Stewart Gardner. 1901 U.S. Open Fitzjohn also competed in the 1901 U.S. Open held at the Myopia Hunt Club near Boston. He had a T12 finish in the tournament. The Myopia golf course, designed by Herbert Leeds, was difficult to score on. No player entered in the tournament managed to break 80 in any round. ==Death and legacy== Fitzjohn died in 1934 in Greenwich, Connecticut. He is best remembered for having two top-10 finishes in the U.S. Open, including a fine T2 finish in the 1899 U.S. Open. ==Results in major championships== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1899 !1900 !1901 - align=leftU.S. Open style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T2 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"10 T12 } Note: Fitzjohn played only in the U.S. Open. \\"T\\" indicates a tie for a place Yellow background for top-10 ==References== Category:Scottish male golfers Category:Scottish emigrants to the United States Category:Golfers from Edinburgh Category:1878 births Category:1934 deaths ","title":"Val Fitzjohn"},{"id":"46359463","text":"The 2015 Las Vegas mayoral election took place on April 7, 2015, to elect the Mayor of Las Vegas, Nevada.

Gullane finished in eighth place in the 1899 U.S. Open, held 14–15 September 1899, at Baltimore Country Club in Baltimore, Maryland. ==Early life== Henry Gullane was born on 19 May 1874 at 4 Market Place, North Berwick, Scotland, to James Gullane, a fisherman, and his wife Janet Gullane née Taylor. Harry and his brother Andrew were granted their professional tickets on the West Links in April 1893. Gullane played in the Open Championship at Muirfield in 1896. This was the last Open that Old Tom Morris played in at the age of 75. Gullane emigrated to America, sailing from Liverpool on the SS Rhynland of the Red Star Line and arrived in Philadelphia on 20 January 1897. In 1898 he was appointed assistant pro and greenkeeper at the Philadelphia Country Club, where he also held the course record of 77 strokes. ==Golf career== Gullane won the first professional golf tournament in the Philadelphia area, played in 1898 at the Huntingdon Valley Country Club. There were ten entries and the club provided a free lunch for the contestants. They played the nine-hole course four times each day to make it a 72-hole tournament. He had the winning score of 319 while Willie Anderson finished twelve strokes back in second place and Jimmy Campbell completed the North Berwick trio, finishing third. The purse totaled $150 and the winner received $100. 1899 U.S. Open His best finish in the U.S. Open Championship was eighth place at Baltimore Country Club in 1899 when he received $25 in prize money. The day before the championship they held a driving contest and Gullane finished second with a drive of 264 yards 2 feet 9 inches. Willie Hoare had the winning drive which was 269 yards 7 feet 6 inches. The big drives were long by 19th century standards as the gutta-percha ball was still in use at that time. In 1900 Gullane was the professional at the Philadelphia Cricket Club (Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania). In April that year he partnered Willie Thompson of the Huntingdon Valley Country Club in an exhibition match against Harry Vardon at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. It was reported in The New York Times that Gullane outdrove Vardon by 10 to 15 yards. Vardon, however, won the match. Gullane entered the 1900 U.S. Open from Pittsburgh where he laid out the course for Pittsburgh Golf Club (Pennsylvania). Golf course designs Gullane was the first pro to be appointed to the nine-hole St. David's Golf Club in Wayne, Pennsylvania. He supervised the extension of that course to 18 holes which was completed in April 1899. Also that year Gullane laid out a nine-hole course at West Chester Golf and Country Club, Pennsylvania. In 1899 Gullane set a new course record at Cape May Golf Club (NJ) and in 1900 at Catasauqua Golf Club (PA). In 1908 The American Golfer magazine compiled a composite golf course taken from the best 18 holes in the USA. Among them were the 7th and 16th holes at St. David's, laid out by Gullane and the only course to have two holes featured. In 1914, when Ben Sayers visited his son George at Merion Cricket Club in Philadelphia, he played the course at St. David's every day. The nine-hole course at West Chester Golf and Country Club in Pennsylvania also remains as a testimony to Gullane's short life. ==Death== In 1901, Gullane returned to North Berwick permanently and five years later he married a local girl, Margaret Brown, and was back teaching on the West Links with his brother Andrew. In 1907, Henry and Margaret lived in a row of cottages at 5 Law Road and following a domestic argument Gullane struck his wife to the floor. Thinking he had killed her, Henry climbed North Berwick Law and in a state of remorse threw himself off the quarry, plunging 70 feet to his death. He was 32 years old and his wife Margaret survived the tragedy. ==References== Category:Scottish male golfers Category:Suicides in Scotland Category:Suicides by jumping in the United Kingdom Category:People from North Berwick Category:1874 births Category:1907 deaths ","title":"Henry Gullane"},{"id":"46359503","text":"Harald Welzer (born 27 July 1958, Hannover) is a German social psychologist.

Dunn was born in Blackheath, London, England in about 1864. His best U.S. Open finish was second in the 1895 U.S. Open. He took home $100 as his share of the purse. His best known golf course designs are those found at the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club and the Apawamis Club. ==Early life== Dunn was born circa 1864 at Blackheath, London, England, the son of Willie Dunn Sr. At age 13, Dunn learned the art of making golf clubs while apprenticed under his older brother, Tom Dunn, who was the professional at London Scottish Golf Club on Wimbledon Common, where he had his home. By 1871 he had joined his father at Leith Links. ==Golf career== Dunn plied his trade while professional at Westward Ho! from 1886–88 before traveling to Biarritz, France, where he instructed wealthy patrons on the fine art of swinging a golf club. It was in Biarritz where Dunn first made the acquaintance of the American millionaire William K. Vanderbilt. After arriving in the United States in 1893—a trip that was sponsored by Vanderbilt—Dunn spent the summer giving golf lessons at the Newport Golf Club in Rhode Island. After spending the winter back in his regular position at Biarritz, he made a return voyage to America. Golf was beginning to gain in popularity at this time and Dunn found ripe pickings in golf-related work and settled in the U.S. permanently. His first professional position was at the Ardsley Country Club, Ardsley, New York, where he designed the course and settled down to a club- making business in 1896. He was joined by his nephew, John Duncan Dunn, who emigrated from England where he had been engaged with the firm of Dunn Brothers. The clubs the Dunns produced provided an interesting mix of traditional Scottish values and modern ingenuity. Early clubs from the Ardsley days were imported from Scotland and assembled in New York. Some of these irons bear a small eagle mark, a reference to his new home and were possibly forged by Robert Condie. Others were simply marked \\"Dunn Selected\\" in either script or block letters and dated from 1897–1903. ==Patents and golf club designs== One of Willie's first American patents (though it appears to have been applied for but never finally granted) was his \\"indestructible driver\\". Its head was a wood block encased in an aluminium shell, the wood being exposed at the face and on top. In the early 1900s, Willie experimented with plastic-like substances, finally patenting several types of drivers and putters. The substance was known as pyralin and came in black and white versions. Clubs included standard drivers, duplex drivers and mallet putters and for manufacturing purposes the patents were assigned to the Kempshall Manufacturing Co. in Arlington, New Jersey. ==Playing career== 1895 U.S. Open The 1895 U.S. Open was the first U.S. Open, held on Friday, 4 October, at Newport Golf Club in Newport, Rhode Island. Horace Rawlins won the inaugural U.S. Open title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Willie Dunn.

In America Jones took a job as the head professional at Myopia Hunt Club until 1912. He would put his \\"home course advantage\\" to good use when the USGA selected Myopia to host four U.S. Opens between 1898 and 1908. ==Golf career== 1898 U.S. Open Jones tied for eighth place in the 1898 U.S. Open, held at Myopia Hunt Club in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. His scores of 83-84-90-90=347 put him in a tie with three other players, one of which was Herbert Leeds, the designer of the course. The other two players tied on 347 were Robert McAndrews and Bernard Nicholls. None of the four players won any prize money. Fred Herd (brother of Sandy Herd) won the event—his only major championship victory—by 7 shots from Alex Smith. 1908 U.S. Open The 1908 U.S. Open—once again contested at the Myopia Hunt Club—featured strong winds in the first two rounds that plagued many of the players, but Jones managed his game well under the difficult circumstances. His score of 162 after the conclusion of the second round put him in second place alone, trailing Willie Smith (who was on 159) by only 3 strokes. Jones posted rounds of 81-81-87-82=331 and finished in fifth place, winning $70 in prize money. Fred McLeod won the tournament in a playoff over Smith. At the age of 50 Jones played in the qualifying round of the 1913 Open Championship at his original home club, Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake. He played on the third day of qualifying, scored 80 and 79 and missed the qualifying mark by two strokes.

The U.S. Open was played at the Myopia Hunt Club four times, in 1898, 1901, 1905, and 1908. ==Early life== Leeds was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 30, 1855. He graduated from Harvard University where, in addition to completing his Bachelor of Arts studies in 1877, he played baseball. Leeds was born into a wealthy family and was a life- long sportsman, being adroit at both sailing and golf.Harvard class of 1877, stands back row far left. Future major league pitcher Jim Tyng stands back row second from right. It was no accident that he played so well at Myopia Hunt Club—he designed the course himself in 1894 and worked there for 30 years. And he would go on to build several other layouts in his career as a golf course architect. He also designed the private Bass Rocks Golf Club in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and the Kebo Valley Club in Bar Harbor, Maine. Also appearing on his dossier is the Palmetto Golf Club in Aiken, South Carolina, completed in 1895. He was a member of the USGA executive committee in 1905. ==Myopia Hunt Club== His course at Myopia Hunt Club measured 6,335 yards and within the confines of the course Leeds made certain that pars would not be easy, let alone birdies. Golfers were challenged with myriad features on the course such as tall mounds, numerous deep sand traps, long blind carries, deep swales, and extremely quick greens. For good measure Leeds added multi-tiered greens and deep gnarly rough. To further menace the players' wayward shots he added a pond and a paddock. The golf course was so difficult that in the 1901 U.S. Open not a single professional in the field was able to break 80 in any round. Willie Anderson's 331 for four rounds is a record that has stood for 114 years and counting and remains the highest winning score ever in the U.S. Open. ==Death== Leeds died on September 29, 1930, at the age of 75. ==References== Category:American male golfers Category:Amateur golfers Category:Golf course architects Category:Harvard Crimson baseball players Category:Sportspeople from Boston Category:1855 births Category:1930 deaths ","title":"Herbert Leeds"},{"id":"46359697","text":"Robert G.

Tucker placed seventh in the 1896 U.S. Open, held 18 July at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York. Although a fine golfer, the bulk of his career would not be spent as a tournament player but rather as a golf course architect. ==Early life== Tucker was born in England on 15 August 1872. He was the son of William Henry Tucker and Katherine Dunn who had married in Scotland earlier in 1872.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XYW3-FPV Katherine was daughter of Willie Dunn, Sr. and the sister of Tom Dunn and Willie Dunn. William Henry Tucker was a gardener from Devon.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q27Q-BT28https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QN6N-HN2https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X9XF-3VH After being widowed, Katherine also emigrated to the United States and lived with Tucker. She was still alive in 1930.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X4G4-1T3 Tucker had three younger brothers, Samuel, John and Thomas, who also emigrated to the United States.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MMF9-NXP His brother John Dunn Tucker was the first professional at Pinehurst and designed the second nine holes of the number 1 course.http://www.pinehurst.com/about/pasture-pinehurst/ As a youngster Tucker was taught how to play golf by his father, a green keeper at Wimbledon Common Golf Club. He also became a proficient sod roller but rather than golf course maintenance he yearned for a career as a professional golfer. ==Golf career== At first he moved to Biarritz, France, where he worked for Willie Dunn. He didn't stay there long and soon returned to London where he worked as a club maker for Slazenger. He was the professional at Redhill & Reigate Golf Club in the early 1890s, playing in the 1894 Open Championship. He emigrated to the United States in 1895 and went to work with his brother Sam who was the professional at St. Andrew's Golf Club in Yonkers, New York. The brothers manufactured hand-made golf clubs that they marketed under the name \\"Defiance\\". While at St. Andrew’s, Willie helped with the design of St. Andrew’s Mount Hope course. Later he designed such courses as the original North Hills in Douglaston and built the present 27-hole Ridgewood Country Club course in Paramus, New Jersey, for A. W. Tillinghast. 1896 U.S. Open The 1896 U.S. Open was the second U.S. Open, held July 18 at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York. Tucker finished in seventh place with rounds of 78-82=160 and won $5. His brother Sam had played in the 1895 U.S. Open and finished in the ninth position. James Foulis won the tournament, his only major, finishing three strokes ahead of runner-up Horace Rawlins, the defending champion. Like the first Open, it was a sideshow to the more established and better known U.S. Amateur. However, there were 35 entrants and 28 finished the 36 holes. Golf course architecture Tucker designed the St. Martin's course at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. It is named \\"St. Martin's\\" after the adjacent episcopal church, St. Martin's in the Fields. The club originally opened a 9-hole course in 1895, which was quickly replaced by the 18-hole St. Martin's course in 1898, designed by Willie Tucker. This course hosted the U.S. Open championships in 1907 and 1910, won by Alec Ross and Alex Smith, respectively. Today, this course has been reduced to a 9-hole layout. Despite the reduction, the 7th, 8th, and 9th holes are the same layout as they were played during the 1907 and 1910 U.S. Open championship.Golf Courses of the U.S. Open, by John Steinbreder, Taylor Publishing Company, Dallas 1996, , pp. 129–131 Tucker was one of the early pioneers in American golf course architecture. He designed at least four courses in the Queens, New York, area – including Douglaston Golf Club and Clearview Golf Club – and in the American midwest at Salt Lake City, Utah, and courses as far west as Washington state. He built a golf course at the University of New Mexico and designed the Preakness Hills Country Club in Wayne, New Jersey, the latter completed in 1926. ==Family== Tucker was married to Annie Ada, née Jeal (1873-1951).https://billiongraves.com/grave/Annie-Ada- Tucker/2770781#/ They had a son, Willie Tucker, Jr., who was also a golf course architect. ==Death and legacy== Tucker died on 6 October 1954 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Championship Course at the University of New Mexico, designed by Tucker, has been home to the William H. Tucker Invitational for the past 43 years. The tournament is the second longest running college tournament in the U.S. and the golf course hosted the 61st playing of the event in 2015. ==References== Category:English male golfers Category:Golf course architects Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:1872 births Category:1954 deaths ","title":"Willie Tucker"},{"id":"46359966","text":"Phetetso Monese leading the 2015 Lesotho Sun Cross Country Course test race.

He had two starts in the Open Championship, in 1890 and 1893, and finished in 22nd and 33rd place, respectively. ==Early life== Wilson was born on 19 August 1868 in Anstruther, Scotland. He was in business as a clubmaker in the 1890s and produced fine long-nosed woods. He carved his signature on the clubs he made in an oval configuration on the top of the clubhead, the markings reading: \\"R B Wilson, Maker, St Andrews\\". He learned his trade as a clubmaker when he apprenticed under Old Tom Morris at St Andrews. He obtained patents on several of his golf club designs, including a mashie-cleek for approach shots; it was a popular item in his shop—he sold 1,200 clubs in 1898 alone. He first posting as a professional was at Minchinhampton where he also designed the course. After intermediate stops at Sheffield, Sidcup, and Beckenham he set sail for the United States and took up a posting at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, Long Island. He also worked at Lakewood Golf Club in New Jersey. In the winter months he always returned to St Andrews and went back into his workshop producing more clubs, most of which he exported to the U.S. He was posted at the Wentorf Reinbek Club in Germany in 1905 but stayed only a short time before returning to Scotland. ==Golf career== 1896 U.S. Open Wilson placed ninth in the 1896 U.S. Open, held 18 July at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York.

The event has been sanctioned by the Lesotho Cycling Association since 2011. It has been accredited as category 1 by the Union Cycliste Internationale (the UCI). The event first took place in 2011 covering 430 km over the 6 days. More recently the route has shortened to 340 km with a time trial through the capital of Maseru to start. The Lesotho Sky is a small event but attracts professional and amateur riders from around the world. Riders are required to ride in teams of 2 that must stay within 2 minutes of each other throughout the event. The times taken for each team to finish each day are added together and the shortest total time is the winner. ==Origins== The flag of Lesotho The Lesotho Sky was foundered in 2011 by Christian Schmidt and Darol Howes. The idea was conceived on a mountain bike tour across the small mountainous Kingdom of Lesotho in January 2011. Starting in the village in Morija on the west to finish going down Sani pass on the east. Christian is from Germany but spent several years in Morija in Lesotho during his youth and knew that Lesotho had huge potential for mountain biking. After returning to Africa to study at the University of Cape Town he joined the UCT cycling club and organized the tour. His love for both Lesotho and his mountain bike are what drives the success of the event. The first event took place in November 2011 with just 22 people, 10 of which were from Lesotho. The Lesotho Sky is now a top bucket list stage race and as of 2015 is a Class 1 Union Cycliste Internationale stage race. ==Route== The route is typically between 340 kilometres and 400 kilometres in length split over 6 days.

Kaleidica creates imagery and script-generated animations based on a number of geometric algorithms that arrange arrays of images or animation clips in various user-determined patterns. Composed of multiple internal \\"studios,\\" Kaleidica can produce patterns reminiscent of kaleidoscope art, Arabic tapestries, psychedelic \\"op-art,\\" mandala and yantra meditative patterns, and abstract forms akin to Kandinsky or Renoir. Kaleidica uses images as brushes that are selected from a collection of image libraries. Images libraries can be changed and new libraries can be created by users. Animated brush effects are created by cycling through a series of images creating three dimensional and abstract effects. In light-show mode users of the Kaleidica are able to move the mouse in-sync with music and simultaneously manipulate a variety of functions using the keyboard. Subtle and vigorous effects can be achieved by manipulating blend, rotation, image-brush size, skew, etc. The sequel to Yantram: Sacred Art Toolbox (Published in 2000 also by fishrock studios), Kaleidica enables users to record and play-back the process of creating symmetrical art, effectively creating full-screen animations. Using simultaneous input from both keyboard and mouse, users manipulate the position, size, rotation, blend, skew and other variables in real-time. Computers with modest video card and processor speeds can display evolving artwork in sync with live or recorded music suitable for interactive light-shows. Kaleidica uses single images and loops of sequential images as animated brushes. These image-brushes are written to the screen buffer much like paint applied to a canvas. In the case of Kaleidica multiple brush strokes are applies simultaneously to create the kaleidoscopic variations. ==Description== An example of the artwork created with Kaleidica. Kaleidica is based on a system of studios, each of which can produce a distinct effect. In each studio, the user controls the movement of the brushes with the mouse, while manipulating the characteristics of the brush (like size or rotation) with the keyboard. The studios inside Kaleidica include the maze studio, the mirror studio, the star studio, the array studio, and the kaleido studio, among others. In most Kaleidica Studios the same brush appears multiple times on the screen, each brush exactly mimicking the others. The brush appears as many times as the user specifies, each radiating from the central point called a \\"centroid\\" which can be placed anywhere inside or outside the screen. Users may retrieve content from the program by capturing the screen. As well, users can record their actions on the screen in real time to be later replayed. ==Custom Content== Users can upload their own content into Kaleidica, using their own images as brushes.

He left home in 1745, apparently because his father had thwarted his ardent desire to join the Jacobite rebels. He had an interest in horses from an early age, and entering the service of Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, he soon rose to be his stud-groom. ==Horse auctioneer== Having put by a considerable sum of money, Tattersall purchased in 1766 from the Earl of Grosvenor the ninety-nine years' lease of premises at Hyde Park Corner (then an outlying part of London). There he set up as a horse auctioneer. His straightforward honesty and businesslike precision won him golden opinions. He soon numbered among his clients the chief members of the Jockey Club and the nobility, and he even procured horses for the king of France and the dauphin. In 1774 he sold the stud of his former patron, the Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, and had some difficulty in resisting the claims to the proceeds of the rapacious Elizabeth Chudleigh, Duchess of Kingston. Early in 1779 he bought the famous racer Highflyer from Lord Bolingbroke for what was deemed the enormous price of £2,500, being then described as \\"Richard Tattersall of the parish of St. George-in-the-Fields, liberty of Westminster, gentleman.\\" ==Further business ventures== He now started a stud farm at Dawley in Middlesex (near Hayes, Hillingdon), which, together with his reputation for integrity, became the cornerstone of his large fortune. About the same time he fitted up two rooms at Hyde Park Corner for the use of the members of the Jockey Club; and these \\"subscription rooms\\" soon became a most important resort of the sporting world, and the centre whence all betting upon the turf was regulated. Tattersall purchased New Barns, near Ely, known thenceforth as Highflyer Hall, where he regaled chosen spirits, such as the Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV), Charles James Fox and William Windham, with \\"some of the best port in England.\\" The prince is said to have made Tattersall his almoner for the relief of certain elderly racing-enthusiasts, and in honour of his patron the auctioneer erected the cupola with a bust of the prince as a youth and an effigy of a fox, known as \\"the palladium of Tattersall's.\\" He was given the responsibility of the arrangements for the sale of the prince's stud in July 1786. About 1788 Tattersall became proprietor of the Morning Post, which, in spite of the clever verses of Peter Pindar (John Wolcot) and the attention paid to sporting matters, proved a losing venture. The property was made over for a nominal sum in 1792 to Daniel Stuart. \\"Old Tatt,\\" as he was called in later days to distinguish him from younger members of the dynasty, died on 21 February 1795, and was buried in St George's, Hanover Square. His popularity was so widespread that he was said to be \\"free of the road, as no highwayman would molest him, and even a pickpocket returned his handkerchief, with compliments.\\" ==Family== Tattersall was married to Catharine, a granddaughter of James, twelfth Baron Somerville; they had one son Edmund (1758–1810), who succeeded him in the business and proprietorship of \\"the Corner\\", and extended the business to France. Edmund's son Richard (\\"Old Dick\\", 1785–1859) and his son Richard (\\"Young Mr Richard\\", 1812–1870)) later headed the business.

Photo taken in 2005. The Detroit Newspaper Strike was a major labor dispute which began in Detroit, Michigan on July 13, 1995 and involved several actions including a local boycott, corporate campaign, and legal charges of unfair labor practices. The primary action involved around 2,500 members of six labor unions going on strike from July 13, 1995 to February 14, 1997. The unions ended their strike on February 14, 1997, and it was resolved in court three years later, with the journalists' union losing its unfair labor practices case on appeal. ==Background== Tension between the unions and management of Detroit's primary two newspapers had been building for several years. Management attempted to force out the unions by attempting to switch from employee distribution to independent contractors. The unions claimed management was engaging in unfair labor practices. Chris Rhomberg, a sociology professor at Fordham University, concludes in his book, The Broken Table, that management provoked the strike and had been preparing for several years. Revolutionary Worker claimed that the owners had been planning as early as 1989 to significantly change the existing labor agreements with the unions. They cite the 1989 \\"Joint Operating Agreement\\" (JOA), which combined the non- editorial operations of the newspapers, as one example of those efforts. The agreement resulted in a 29% reduction in the workforce. ==The strike== On July 13, 1995, about 2,500 members of six different unions went on strike after management indicated it would not discuss recent labor practice changes by Detroit News publisher, Robert Giles. The unions included The Newspaper Guild and the Teamsters, along with the pressmen, printers and Teamsters working for the \\"Detroit Newspapers\\" distribution arm. The papers lost approximately in the first six months of the strike. The newspapers continued to publish during the strike, and aired commercials depicting \\"People Behind the Paper\\". The strikers published a competing weekly newspaper, the Detroit Sunday Journal. By October, about 40% of the editorial staffers had crossed the picket line, and many trickled back over the next months, including Mitch Albom - who wrote a column urging an end to the strike, while others stayed during the duration of the strike. The newspapers hired replacement workers, spent approximately on private security, and provided the police department in Sterling Heights, Michigan - where a production plant was located - with . Striking workers traveled the United States to draw attention to the conflict and pressure corporate boards of directors of advertisers in the two newspapers. In Winter 1996, twenty-seven strikers were arrested for blocking Gannett Company's Port Huron, Michigan printing facility for the USA Today regional edition. The company switched printing of that edition to a more secure facility in Toledo, Ohio. In September 1996, columnist and strike supporter, Susan Watson, was terminated from the Detroit Free Press for participating in a sitdown strike at the Detroit Free Press Building. The unions ended their strike on February 14, 1997. The strike was costly for the labor unions, such as the Teamsters paying about toward legal fees and strike benefits. ==Resolution and aftermath== Following the strike, management indicated they would not fire any of the replacement workers, and would only hire strikers as positions became available. By April 1997, only 200 of the 2,000 striking workers had been rehired. The National Labor Relations Board ruled in 1997 that the newspapers had engaged in unfair labor practices. But the newspapers appealed, and the federal courts reversed the NLRB ruling in 2000. The unions remain active at the papers, representing a majority of the employees under their jurisdiction. Ten years after the strike, the newspapers had still not recovered the lost circulation from the strike. ==References *The Detroit Sunday Journal at Wayne State University Library contains the full run of the Detroit Sunday Journal, which was published by the striking union works for the duration of the strike, in a digitized, searchable format.

This is the only one multimedia fountain in Ukraine and the largest floating fountain in Europe. Fountain runs from early April to late October. The project design and development was performed by Emotion Media Factory, a Germany-based company responsible for the dancing fountains in Chiang Mai Night Safari Park (Thailand) and Kangwon Land (South Korea) as well as the multimedia shows for AIDA Cruises. The show was created by Ralph Douw, the CEO of the company. The total cost of the project was 37 million UAH (~ 1.5 million EUR). The fountain was officially inaugurated on 4 September 2011 along with the official opening ceremony of Roshen Quay. The Multimedia fountain Roshen is ranked No.1 on TripAdvisor among 46 attractions in Vinnytsia. ==Description== Multimedia Fountain Roshen is the only one in Ukraine and the largest floating fountain in Europe, built on the river Southern Buh in Vinnytsia City near Festivalny Isle (Campa Isle) Multimedia fountain Roshen is located in Vinnytsia, a city in west-central Ukraine, located on the banks of the Southern Buh. Built in 2011 it is considered as one of the largest floating fountains in Europe. It is the major multimedia attraction in the city. The fountain constitutes a part of the complex reconstruction project of the Southern Buh quay near Roshen Confectionery Factory in Vinnytsia. In the framework of the project the 700 meter water front was embanked, a pedestrian zone and a leisure area were constructed, a street lighting system was installed, and an amphitheatre was built for hosting spectators of the fountain shows. To install the fountain equipment the riverbed of the Southern Buh was cleared in the volume of 28000 cubic meters. In the history of Ukraine this project is the first of such a scale implemented on the private company costs. Primarily the fountain systems are installed in the artificial water basins with water cleaning system. The unique characteristic of the Roshen multimedia fountain is the use of the running river water. One more exceptional characteristic of the multimedia fountain is its “hibernating technology”, due to which the fountain equipment is sinking under the ice on the bottom of the Southern Buh during winter periods. == Awards == Roshen Fountain and Roshen Quay are recognized the winners of the all Ukrainian competition “The Best Building and Construction” of the year 2012. Commemorative coin with Multimedia Fountain Roshen ==Multimedia Shows== Multimedia show of Multimedia Fountain Roshen The multimedia shows are combining water effects (fountain), music, lasers and 3D projection on the water screen. For the fountain shows the super powerful LED lights are used allowing applying very bright and showy backlighting resulting in various picturesque effects. Despite other fountains in Ukraine, Roshen multimedia fountain has moving particles reaching verticity due to which the water spring angle is changing dynamically. The sound power of the audio system is 3840 Watt. The height of the central spring reaches 65–70 metres, the projection screen dimension is around 16 metres height and 45 metres width, and the frontal water dispersion constitutes 140 metres. Performance repertoire includes: * W.A. Mozart, No. 40 Symphony (Day/night show with synchronised music) * M. Glinka, Ruslan and Lyudmila (Day show with a synchronised music) * P. Tchaikovsky, The Nutcracker (Day show with synchronised music) * A. Vivaldi, The Four Seasons: Summer (Day show with synchronised music) * G.

The idea for the Inventions show was inspired by the major milestones of human inventions. Mechanical, Electrical, Analogue and then finally Digital. The scenes shifted from a huge steam engine created by the large water effects and sound, morphing slowly into a “train” using the full 100 meters of fountain effects, through the mechanical era with cars and bikes floating across the massive water screen. Reaching the Electric era sparks and lasers fill the sky above the audience. In the pre Computer era a huge oscilloscope displays analogue morphing patterns on a 70m wide water jet screen. Grids of Laser beams fill the entire sky as we travel into the Digital era with Hologram like projections onto the entire fountains, ending in a mighty final fountain display. The music was individually composed and produced for each scene by Alexius Tschallener (Composers4Film).Hardstudios, Retrieved June 22, 2015,http://www.hardstudios.ch/de/daily-news/roshen- multimedia-fountain-1 ==Swan Lake Fantasy Show== The theme is a total re- interpretation of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake.

Originally a part of the parish of Castleton, it became a parish in its own right in 1863. The current church was built between 1885 and 1886 to the designs of architect William Dawes of Manchester in the Decorated Gothic style. The contractor for the church was Mr Thomas Beck of Matlock Bridge.

He lives in Milan and works in Milan and London. ==Biography== Omar Hassan, Glove Save the Queen, Mixed media, 25x17 cm Omar Hassan was born in 1987 in Milan, Italy, to an Italian mother and an Egyptian father. His best friend, a prolific graffiti artist, encouraged a 15-year-old Omar to join him in experimenting on the walls of his native city. Hassan later witnessed his best friend fall to his death in one of Milan’s tunnels. The tragedy proved a formative event for Hassan. The artist felt compelled to explore various paths, experimenting with a significant talent for boxing and fearless creative risks. However, after 10 years of training in the ring, Hassan was forced to abandon his love of boxing and the lure of competitive sport when a diagnosis of diabetes was discovered – disqualifying him from professional boxing on the grounds of health and safety. Being unable to fully explore this passion, Hassan returned to his other love; investing all his energy into his artistic practice. Being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, Hassan raised money for Diabetes UK via selling a piece of performance art he created at the private view of his exhibition ‘Breaking Through’. Hassan collaborated with artist Helidon Xhixha to support Diabetes Research Institute Foundation (DRI) at an art event in Miami. Hassan graduated from the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in 2010, and after several group and solo exhibitions, he was invited by Vittorio Sgarbi; curator of the Italian Pavilion, to exhibit at the 2011 54th Venice Biennale. == Technique == The wall Borgio Verezzi in Wonderland realized in 2011 by Omar Hassan in Borgio Verezzi, Italy In a series of paintings, Hassan performs a painting technique inspired by his boxing career. This involves dipping his boxing gloves into paint and punching onto a large canvas. He uses some classical references in his work, such as Nike taking off the sandal, but also takes some influence from Islamic art. Additionally, he creates sculptures and patterns from the spray painting materials he uses. His series of paintings called Injections, are single dots of colour with streams of paint issuing from the nucleus. They refer to his daily shots of insulin from being diabetic. ==Public Works== Hassan has created several public works in Italy and the UK. These include One Wall at the Palazzo della Regione in Milan, the Museo Mille Miglia in Brescia, the Accademia delle Belle Arti Aldo Galli in Como and Colour Cube in London’s Brick Lane. The latter work was created by redecorating a concrete bollard located alongside the East London Line. They all make use of his signature motif found in the injections series. ==Solo exhibitions== 2009 \\\\- Gaijin, Musashy Gallery, Tokyo. 2011 \\\\- H.O.2, Fabbrica Eos, Milan. 2012 \\\\- Jab, Jab!!, Colossi Arte Contemporanea, Brescia. 2014 \\\\- L'essenziale è Invisibile agli Occhi, Castle, Montesegale. 2015 \\\\- Breaking Through, ContiniArtUK, London.Omar Hassam, Breaking Through, Exhibition Catalogue, ContiniArtUK, 2015. \\\\- Breaking Through — Miami, Rosenbaum Contemporary, Bal Harbour, Florida. 2016 \\\\- Breaking Through Milan, M.A.C centre, Milan. \\\\- Breaking Through New York, UNIX Gallery, New York City. 2017 \\\\- Do ut Des, Abbazia della Misericordia, Venice. ==Gallery== File:Omar Hassan, Rimembranze di Conte Rosso.pngMilan, Italy File:Omar_HassanPalazzo_Regione_Lombardia.pngMilan, Italy File:Omar_Hassan,_Il_Dolce_Far_Nulla.pngMontesegale, Italy File:OmarHassanBorgio.jpgBorgio Verezzi, Italy ==Selected publications== 2013 London Street Art, by Frank Steam156 Malt, 2013. ==External links== * * *ContiniArtUK Selected Press == References == Category:Living people Category:1987 births Category:People from Milan Category:Italian contemporary artists Category:Italian people of Egyptian descent Category:Brera Academy alumni ","title":"Omar Hassan (artist)"},{"id":"46360973","text":"Shinobu Toyoda is the Representative Director at Unity Technologies of Japan.

It was released as a bundled app in iOS 8 on September 17, 2014—replacing the Camera Roll—and released as a bundled app to OS X Yosemite users in the 10.10.3 update on April 8, 2015. It was released for tvOS 10 on September 13, 2016. ==History== In June 2014, Apple announced its plan to discontinue the applications iPhoto and Aperture, to be replaced by a new application, Photos, at some point in 2015. Photos is included with OS X Yosemite 10.10.3, released as a free update to users on April 8, 2015. On September 13, 2016, the app was later included in tvOS 10. ==Features== Photos is intended to be less complex than its professional predecessor, Aperture. Photos are organized by the \\"moment\\", which is a combination of time and location metadata attached to the photo. Editing Photos tucks complex editing tools into several simple controls by default. Photos is designed to \\"reward curiosity and additional clicks with ever more granular manipulation capabilities\\". A one-click auto- enhance button is also available. iCloud Photo Library iCloud Photo Library is heavily integrated into the program, keeping photos and videos in sync with various Apple devices designated by the user (such as Macs, iPhones, and iPads), including edits and album structures. Storage starts at a complimentary 5 GB and can be bought in a number of tiers up to 2 TB. While iCloud integration is still optional, it is much more central to Photos as compared to iPhoto. Professional printing Like its predecessors, Photos initially included a number of options for professional printing of photos, which could then optionally be turned into books or calendars and mailed to an address. With Photos, Apple added new types of prints, including square sizes and the ability to print panoramas. In July 2018, Apple announced, via a pop- up message in Photos, that they would be discontinuing these services, adding that users should submit any final orders by September 30, 2018. Sharing iCloud Photo Sharing allows sharing photos with others. Others can view, like or comment existing shared photos or contribute new photos to the shared album. Other ways of sharing includes e-mail, social platform that integrates through iOS Extensions, or Apple's peer-to-peer AirDrop technology. ==Criticism== Critics have noted the loss of functionality in Photos as compared to its predecessors. In particular, photos can no longer be ordered as events but are either automatically ordered chronologically into moments or must be put into albums; the latter do not allow for automatic sorting. (Although smart albums, with customized user-defined rules, will allow for sorting.) As of OS X El Capitan, only the latest version of iPhoto still operates; because iPhoto has been removed from the Mac App Store, customers who upgraded to El Capitan without first obtaining the latest version of iPhoto were locked out of iPhoto without warning, pushing them to use Photos. == See also == * Google Photos * darktable * gThumb ==References External links == * Category:Image organizers Category:Photo software Category:Raster graphics editors Category:Apple Inc. software Category:MacOS graphics software Category:IOS software Category:WatchOS software Category:TvOS software Category:2014 software Category:2015 software Category:IOS ","title":"Apple Photos"},{"id":"46361058","text":"CMD Distribution is a faith and family film distribution company, headquartered in Wake Forest, North Carolina.

Malcolm Willis McConahy files Boy Scouts of America. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 9 April 2015. Nothing more is known of his youth but he later changed his name to Adam Aristotle Starchild, explaining on his website that Starchild was \\"a common Plains Cree name, found in usage across western Canada\\" indicating that he may have been of Native American descent. He claimed to be a former chairman of the Confederation of American Indians. ==Scouting== Between February and July 1965, McConahy was an assistant scout master with Troop 27 in Minneapolis, a troop sponsored by Plymouth Congregational Church of that city, but was suspended after admitting homosexual interest in boys in the troop. Scouting records state that his personal and family church relationship was with Joyce Methodist Church. At the time he was operating a travel business in Minneapolis. In July 1965, McConahy was arrested in Wisconsin for circulating pornographic material. He was travelling to New York to take up residence there and was in the company of four boys to whom he had given money. In 1966, he moved to Milwaukee where he applied in February to be a college reserve scouter. His application stated that he was studying at Blackstone School of Law, to graduate in December 1968. The application was rejected by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America who were aware of his scouting background in Minneapolis. In 1967 he was convicted of possessing obscene literature and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. In 1968 he was arrested for his involvement with a 16-year-old. ==First frauds== In 1968, McConahy was convicted for a $57,000 cheque fraud in which he tried to dupe ten different banks. He was running a travel agency, Creative Travel Inc., at the time.\\"Check Fraud Charge Leads to Indictment\\" The Milwaukee Journal, 12 September 1968, p. 1. Google News.

In January 1969 he was sentenced to one year and one day in jail on three counts of mail fraud but failed to appear to start his sentence in April that year, resulting in the issue of a warrant for his arrest. He travelled to England around 1970 where he was arrested by police and subsequently served four years in jail for forgery. In 1970, the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission placed securities thought to have been issued by McConahy on its Foreign Restricted List. These included \\"Bank Money Orders\\" in the name of J.P. Morgan & Company Ltd. of London (intended to be mistaken for the J.P. Morgan) in an amount exceeding $375,000 which had been mailed to 31 savings and loan associations in California and a bank in Minnesota in order to open new accounts against which withdrawals were then attempted, and documents labelled \\"Negotiable Certificate of Deposit\\", also of J.P.

Archived here. After being released from prison in the U.K., McConahy was extradited to the United States where he was arrested by U.S. Marshals in February 1974 after he stepped off the plane in New York. He was charged with unlawful flight and bail jumping and extradited to Wisconsin where he was convicted and sentenced to an additional one-year and one day in prison. He began his sentence in Sandstone, Minnesota, in May 1974 and was released in July that year.Malcolm Willis McConahy. Jeff Anderson & Associates, 2013. Retrieved 9 April 2015. In September 1974 he appeared in court in Trenton N.J., asking to be declared indigent so that he would not have to pay fees required as part of the process of recovering the charters of three Panamanian mutual funds that had been seized by British police. He claimed their loss had cost him $855,000. ==Adam Starchild== Around 1975 or 1976, McConahy changed his name to Adam Aristotle Starchild. In February 1976 a photograph of him as Adam Starchild appeared in the gay newspaper The Advocate by that name. The paper reported that Starchild, an \\"openly gay business consultant\\" of West Hudson Business Service, Kearny N.J., had received a Presidential Sports Award from Gerald Ford for his canoe expeditions through the Quetico-Superior wilderness area of Minnesota and Ontario. On 4 March 1976 an obituary appeared in the Kearny Observer as follows: > Malcolm McConahy, of 325 Maple St., was killed in an auto accident in > Minneapolis, Minn. while visiting relatives. McConahy was the sales manager > for the West Hudson Business Service and recently opened his own consulting > firm, McConahy Associates. He is survived by a brother in Tennessee. In May 1976, he appeared in Bergen County courthouse seeking dismissal of a lawsuit he had filed one year earlier against his mother. Starchild's writing career began at about the same time as he changed his name. He was prolific, writing on topics that broadly reflected his libertarian, anti-tax, anti- government attitudes. He often used publishers who specialised in producing works of a similar nature, such as Loompanics Unlimited, Paladin Press and Scope International. Periods in the 1970s and 80s when he produced no books appear to tie-in with times when he was in prison.

However, Starchild neglected to provide proper accounting, or hand over the securities to the successor trustee, Edward Brongersma, whom an increasingly worried Shelden appointed. Despite being an international fugitive, in 1983 Shelden managed to successfully take Starchild to court to reclaim the funds. ==1980s== In 1980, Starchild was linked by the St. Petersburg Times to Richard Kelly's involvement in the Abscam scandal through Starchild's relationship with Kelly's aide J.P. Maher III. According to Kelly, it was Maher who asked Starchild to handle a campaign mailing list through his firm Minerva Consulting Group Inc.

Majoragio was born Maria Antonio Conti in a place in the proximity of Milan in Italy, known as Majoragio. Majoragio was professor for a time at Milan, and a scholar who was known to have studied after the ancient Roman philosopher and orator Cicero. During 1542 he attended lectures held within Ferrara, these lectures were performed by Maggi on the subject of philosophy, and by Alciati on jurisprudence. He occupied an intellectual position both in defence of Cicero, in respect to Calcagnini's attack on the work De Officiis and contrary and in some way hostile, in respect to the work Paradoxa Stoicorum, in this case in his own work Antiparadoxon. In Antiparadoxon Majoragio expressed the thought that Cicero's work was composed of dialogues which were un-Socratic, and more over, that Cicero's work was in fact demonstrably untrue. Majoragio believed in Platonic Christianity, and thought that those who expressed contrary thoughts, that there was no after- life and the present material world was the only world that exists should be righteously condemned to the fate of having themselves burnt alive, and additionally those punished thus, to be in full consciousness during such an act. ==Works== Majoragio produced the following: *A 1546 work of criticism against Paradoxa Stoicorum *A 1547 commentary on Aristotle's - Rhetoric. *A 1552 commentary on Orator written by Cicero. *A commentary on the first book of De Oratore written by Cicero, published 1587. ==References== Category:Italian philosophers ","title":"Marcantonius Majoragio"},{"id":"46361249","text":"Charles Thorn (born November 1877) was a Scottish-American professional golfer. Thorn placed seventh in the 1902 U.S. Open. ==Early life== In 1879 at age 2, he emigrated with his family to the United States and became a naturalized American citizen. In 1900 he was boarding with the George Eke family at Shelter Island, New York. ==Golf career== Head professional jobs By 1901 he was serving as the professional at Bedford Springs Hotel resort course in Bedford Springs, Pennsylvania, one of the oldest golf courses in the country. While there, he worked to improve the course by rebuilding greens and tee boxes and installing an irrigation system using the natural springs found in the area as a water source. In January 1919 Thorn was the head professional at Miami Beach Golf Club in the winter months and spent his summers working at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on Long Island, New York. Major championship tournaments Thorn was in the field for the playing of the eighth U.S. Open in 1902. The golf tournament was held October 10–11, 1902, at Garden City Golf Club in Garden City, New York. Fellow Scotsman Laurie Auchterlonie established a new 72-hole U.S. Open scoring record to win his first U.S. Open title by six strokes ahead of Stewart Gardner and Walter Travis. Thorn's steady play resulted in a seventh-place finish. Auchterlonie turned in a record-breaking performance on his way to the championship. He posted rounds of 78-78-74-77, becoming the first golfer in U.S. Open history to card four sub-80 rounds. His 307 total was six shots better than the previous tournament record, set by Harry Vardon in 1900. Stewart Gardner and amateur Walter Travis, the designer of Garden City Golf Club, both posted a 313 total to share second place. The low scores were in large part due to the introduction of the Haskell golf ball, which soon replaced the gutta-percha ball as the prominent golf ball in use. ==References== Category:Scottish male golfers Category:American male golfers Category:Scottish emigrants to the United States Category:1877 births Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Charles Thorn (golfer)"},{"id":"46361258","text":"Melaleuca linophylla is a plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae and is native to the north-west of Western Australia. It is a bushy shrub with narrow leaves and spikes of cream-coloured flowers in spring. It is distinguished by its fruits which are much more urn-shaped than those of other melaleucas. ==Description== Melaleuca linophylla is a spreading, sometimes bushy shrub which grows to a height of . Its leaves are arranged alternately on the stems, very narrow elliptic in shape, long and wide. The flowers are cream coloured and profuse, arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow before the flowers have opened, sometimes in the upper leaf axils, with each spike containing 30 to 70 individual flowers. The spikes are up to long and in diameter. The petals are long and the stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, with 7 to 15 stamens in each bundle. Flowering occurs in spring and the fruit which follow are woody capsules long and distinctly shaped like an urn or a vase. ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca linophylla was first formally described in 1862 by Ferdinand von Mueller in \\"Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae\\". The derivation of the specific epithet (linophylla) is uncertain but may be due to Mueller's perception that the leaves of this plant are similar to those of a species of Linum in the Family Linaceae. The Ancient Greek word phýllon means “leaf”. ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca linophylla occurs in and between the districts of Karratha, Port Hedland and Paraburdoo in the Gascoyne, Great Sandy Desert and Pilbara biogeographic regions. It grows in stony and sandy soils along creek edges. ==Conservation== This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==Use in horticulture== This species is rarely cultivated but it should tolerate dry conditions in well-drained soil. ==References== linophylla Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1862 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ","title":"Melaleuca linophylla"},{"id":"46361261","text":"The power room at the mill Cavan Water Mill, formerly Lifeforce Mill, is a 19th-century mill located in Cavan. The current building dates from 1846 and contains a notable MacAdam water turbine. Having been abandoned in the 1960s, it was restored as a museum and visitor attraction in the 1990s. ==History of the site== Room containing milling stones, which were used for grinding grains Milling on this site can be traced back to the 14th century, when there was a Franciscan mill in the same location. The current mill was established by the Greene family in 1846. During the 1840s, there were 90 working water mills in County Cavan, but at the time this mill was built it was the only one within a two-mile radius. The building operated as a mill for more than a century until its closure in the 1960s. Following restoration, it operated again for a short while as a working mill for the creation of wholemeal flour for Lifeforce Foods. ==Design of the building== The two-storey design has a three-bay extension at split level to the west and a two-storey return to the side. An adjacent mill building to the north was removed from its original site and rebuilt here in 1995 as part of the mill's restoration.

The music director was Saraswati Devi with lyrics and dialogues by J. S. Casshyap. The screenplay was by Niranjan Pal. The film's \\"star value\\" was Devika Rani, with Kishore Sahu making his debut as an actor in the film. The cast included another debutant, Renuka Devi, with Mumtaz Ali, Maya Devi and M. Nazir. The film deals with the social evils of the caste system, and remarriage. Uma is sent back to her father's home after her husband remarries, as she is unable to bear children. Her renewed friendship with a childhood friend, Ramu, a Harijan, bings censure and misunderstanding from her husband and society. ==Plot== Set in a village, a young Brahmin couple Nandlal (Mumtaz Ali) and Uma (Devika Rani) are unable to have any children. The husband plans to take another wife, Padma. Ramu (Kishore Sahu) belongs to the potters family, where Uma normally spent most of her time before marriage. The friendship has been frowned upon as Ramu is from the Harijan caste. Nandlal sends Uma to her father's house, where she renews her friendship with Ramu. Nandlal sees Uma talking to Ramu (Kishore Sahu). While at her father's house, Uma discovers that she is pregnant. Misunderstandings arise when Nandlal gets suspicious about Uma and Ramu, but all is set right by Padma, Nandlal's second wife. She clears Uma's name, and gets Nandlal and Uma together before walking out of their lives. ==Cast== *Devika Rani as Uma *Mumtaz Ali as Nandlal *Kishore Sahu as Ramu *Renuka Devi *Chandraprabha *Maya Devi *Vimala Devi *Aloka Aloka *Tarabai Solanki *Saroj Borkar *Kamta Prasad *P.F.

Baburao Patel, the Filmindia editor, in his review of December 1937, called it Osten's \\"better work than ever before\\". Saraswati Devi's music composition and Wirsching's cinematography were praised, as was Niranjan Pal's screenplay, \\"a good story with plenty of entertainment\\". Devika Rani was hailed for scoring \\"another triumphant\\". Renuka Devi was praised for her looks but criticised for her acting. Kishore Sahu was stated to be a \\"big disappointment\\". The audience reception was good with the film running for over 17 weeks in Bombay, while doing good business in the rest of the country too, becoming a commercial success. ==Production== The film starred Kishore Sahu with Devika Rani, who was cited as a \\"bankable star\\". Bombay Talkies was producing a large quantity of films in a short period of time. Jeevan Prabhat was completed in two months, while Achhut Kanya was made in six weeks. In a little over four years, Osten had directed about sixteen films for Bombay Talkies. ==Soundtrack== The music was composed by Saraswati Devi, with lyrics by J. S. Casshyap.

While these antibodies have a variety of specificities, their main mechanism of immunosuppression is through depletion of T cells. Thymoglobulin is currently approved for clinical use in Europe and the United States for renal allograft rejection, prevention of graft-vs.-host disease, and conditions involving bone marrow failure, including aplastic anemia and has additional off-label uses. == History of antithymocyte globulin == Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was originally developed as one of various tested preparations of antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) specifically generated against human lymphocytes within the thymus, or thymocytes. The purpose of this research was largely to produce an effective immunosuppressive agent safe for use in humans. Since the discovery of a link between antilymphocyte serum (ALS) and lymphocyte depletion by Metchnikoff in 1899, various studies have demonstrated the immunosuppressive ability of ALG and ATG. Experiments on ALS that confirmed its efficacy in lymphocyte depletion led to testing of different types of preparations including ALG, which were ALS produced against human lymphocytes, and ATG. A number of studies conducted in the 1960s, including studies by Starzl et al. and Mathe et al., resulted in promising data for the clinical use of ALG for preserving short-term and long-term kidney function in patients immediately after human kidney transplantation. Use of equine ALG was also found to be efficacious in preventing acute graft- vs.-host-disease in patients’ post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Experimentation with ALG and ATG preparations from different sources followed, leading to testing of ATG derived from rabbit serum. Thymoglobulin was the first commercial rabbit-derived ATG to be introduced in Europe and the US in the 1980s. Due to its demonstrated efficacy as an immunosuppressive agent, it remains a commonly used ATG for induction therapy and treatment of other associated conditions, such as graft-vs.-host disease and aplastic anemia. == Mechanism of immunosuppression == As an rATG, thymoglobulin consists of polyclonal antibodies, which, unlike monoclonal antibodies, target a large variety of immune cell surface proteins, including B and T lymphocyte, natural killer cell, and plasma cell surface antigens. However, its efficacy as an immunosuppressive agent is primarily through rapid induced apoptosis of CD3+ T cells present in the bloodstream. Even at low levels of concentration (up to 1 ug/mL), rATG T-cell depletive ability is still sound, but higher concentrations of ATG can induce lysis of T lymphocytes through the classical complement pathway along with B cell and NK cell depletion as well . Thymoglobulin has also demonstrated the ability to induce expression of a number of regulatory cell markers in vitro, including CD25, GITR, and CTLA-4 (aka CD152, functions as immune checkpoint, downregulates immune response). Recent research has suggested that Thymoglobulin may also contribute to T-cell anergy, in which T-cells remain inactive, though further research must be done to confirm this interaction. == Clinical applications == Thymoglobulin is commonly used to prevent and treat acute rejection and increase graft survival in solid organ transplantation (SOT), especially kidney, liver, pancreas, and heart transplantation. As multiple studies have demonstrated both its efficacy and safety in a clinical setting, it is also used in different minimization regimens to reduce the application of higher risk immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in solid organ transplantation. Because both corticosteroids and CNIs have been found to potentially cause long-term adverse effects in the body, a multitude of studies have been conducted to examine the efficacy of thymoglobulin in SOT either with minimal usage or without the use of either agent. Findings have indicated that use of thymoglobulin alone minimizes risk of adverse effects and thus improves long-term outcomes for transplant patients. Thymoglobulin is also an effective agent for preventing graft-vs.-host disease in patients receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). GVHD is a condition in which immune cells within the graft attack host cells and cause tissue damage. It is considered a major obstacle to successful HSCT. The T-cell depleting activity of thymoglobulin has proved to be useful in preventing GVHD. Multiple studies have indicated that thymoglobulin is favored in comparison to other induction agents for patients who have increased risk of developing post-transplant complications, such as elderly patients, patients undergoing a repeat transplantation, and patients in which minimization of use of steroids or CNIs post-operation is recommended. == References == Category:Polyclonal antibodies Category:Sanofi ","title":"Thymoglobulin"},{"id":"46361398","text":"His Honour John Charles Price is a retired British judge. ==Life== John Charles Price was educated at Wrekin College in Shropshire.

It was developed by Pasi Kainiemi in Tampere, Finland and Jack Mayol in Stuttgart, Germany, working under the team name Modulaatio Games (now Osumia Games). The game is primarily voxel-based, with the map texturing done using \\"splat map\\" texture layering, and with the modeling being done with typically low-poly or simple .mesh files. Because of this, the game runs very well on old hardware, making it more accessible to more players. == Gameplay == Running with Rifles is a down top shooter where the player takes on the role of an infantryman during a large conflict in multiple different regions for either the Greenbelts, the Greycollars, or the Brownpants. Running with Rifles main feature is its extensive single-player campaign, with adjustable settings for the enemy and friendly AI. While in game, friendly AI and units will counterattack and defend territory regardless of the players actions. Although a commander designates attack orders for the player's faction, the open world mechanic gives the player the ability to run around and capture any point on the map at any time, and disregarding the commander's orders will not incur a penalty. On harder difficulties, the player will need to flank, communicate, attack and defend simultaneously to counteract the enemy forces. The game is open ended and the player has access to powerful vehicles, the ability to command small squads of soldiers, and to call in powerful artillery barrages that allow for many different play styles. In game looting of enemies for supplies, and sabotaging the enemies's important structures and buildings will also play a role in winning the battle. == Development == Osumia Games (known as Modulaatio Games at its creation) started as a two-man independent development studio run by Pasi Kainiemi. He started developing Running with Rifles in early 2011. The game left pre-alpha on July 18, 2011. The game received minor updates during alpha before continuing into beta on September 14, 2011, where it spent most of its life. In 2011 he made the game available for pre-order. In early 2012 Jack Mayol joined the team and they decided together to push the game far beyond what was originally planned. The first Linux port was made publicly available and the game was put on Steam Greenlight, where it was later accepted and put onto the Steam Store. Two new King of The Hill maps were added and a single-player Invasion mode was added/enhanced during 2013. In 2014 the game was released onto Steam's Early Access platform and the first Mac (OS X) port is made available. In 2015, on April 2, the game left Steam's Early Access/left beta and was officially released. At some point prior to the DLC's official release, the team was expanded with the addition of three community modders who assisted in the development of Pacific, and who are currently involved in the upcoming DLC Edelweiss. In the community, these developers are known as TheSoldier, Tremozl, and 577. == Downloadable content == On October 26, 2017, the first pack of DLC was released - \\"Pacific\\" has players and their team (Imperial Japanese Army or United States Marine Corps) fight in the Pacific Theater in World War 2. The DLC adds new vehicles, such as landing craft and patrol boats, and adds new water craft. It also features a new weapon set, with bolt- action rifles such as the Type 99, combat rifles such as the M1 Garand, and the ability to place bayonets onto weapons, allowing extra melee mechanics. It also features a new side objective system, featuring new side objectives such as \\"Destroy the AA Gun\\" or \\"Repair the abandoned tank\\". On September 24, 2018, the second DLC pack was announced - titled \\"Edelweiss\\", it follows the Allied airborne campaigns across western Europe in late 1944, beginning during Operation Overlord, and featuring both British and American forces fighting against the Wehrmacht. == Reception == Running with Rifles has a 78/100 rating on the review aggregator site Metacritic, based on four reviews from critics. Kotaku writer Kirk Hamilton said the game is similar to both Battlefield and Hotline Miami. The game was described as a simple to jump into and play type of game, and was described as a modern-day Cannon Fodder. The single-player has the same structural play as the multi-player version so players who prefer solo play won't have to worry about missing out on key features of the game. == References  * Category:2015 video games Category:Linux games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:MacOS games Category:Open world video games Category:Top-down video games Category:Video games developed in Finland Category:Windows games Category:Early access video games Category:Steam Workshop games ","title":"Running with Rifles"},{"id":"46361519","text":"Henry Joseph Brownrigg (1874 - August 13, 1945) was a merchant and politician in Newfoundland.

The tour began in Osaka, Japan on 6 August 2014, and continued through Europe, the Americas, Oceania and Asia until 12 December 2015, where the tour ended in New Zealand. Sheeran planned 180 shows. In June 2015, the singer announced a documentary would be filmed during the tour's three sold-out dates, 10–12 July 2015, at 80,000-person capacity Wembley Stadium. ==Background== Throughout 2013, Sheeran supported Taylor Swift on her North American Red Tour, as well as performing throughout the show itself. He also is featured on her single, \\"Everything Has Changed\\", which was promoted at the Summertime Ball and the final of Britain's Got Talent. While touring, he began recording his second studio album, ×. The album was preceded by the lead single, \\"Sing\\", which reached number one in the UK. The album, released on 20 June 2014, received critical acclaim, and Sheeran performed at series of festivals in 2014, including Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park and Southside Festival. On 14 April 2014, following a performance on Saturday Night Live, Sheeran announced his first ever North American arena tour. Beginning in Seattle, the 15-date tour would travel all around North America. Due to demand, three dates were added to the tour (one date at the SAP Center and at the Staples Center in Los Angeles). During the 2015 leg of the X Tour, Ed Sheeran chose to use a Fender Stratocaster loaned to him by British contemporary artist Teddy M. The guitar known as Green T featuring graphics by the artist was played in 18 countries and used for the songs requiring an electric guitar including \\"Thinking Out Loud\\". Green T was returned to Teddy M at the end of the X Tour and later auctioned by Bonhams for £12,500 (Dec 2015). https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22818/lot/179/ The documentary movie Jumpers for Goalposts: Live at Wembley Stadium shot at Wembley Stadium at the end of the X Tour features the graffiti'd Fender Stratocaster Ed Sheeran commissioned as a collaboration between New York street art pioneer John Crash Matos and Teddy M. Known as the 'Crash x Teddy M' Stratocaster, the guitar features the debut of the Teddy M Heart design and Crash's signature eye symbol. GQ magazine featured a full page article on the 'Crash x Teddy M' Stratocaster in their July 2015 edition. According to Pollstar, the X Tour was the 43rd highest-grossing tour of 2014, with 667,066 tickets sold and US$33.4 million grossed. The next year, the X Tour became the seventh highest-grossing tour of 2015, with 1,823,410 tickets sold and a gross of US$117.3 million, accumulating a total of US$150.7 million grossed. The support acts were: Rudimental, Rixton, Foy Vance, Kodaline and Christina Perri. ==Set list== This set list is representative of the show on August 27, 2014.

In 1891 he moved to the City Architect’s Department, to work under Robert Morham. Around the same time he set up home at 3 Moston Terrace in Mayfield, Edinburgh. In 1896 he sent up in independent practice at 21 St Andrew Square, Edinburgh. After great success he moved to 44 Queen Street in 1898 in partnership with John Nichol Scott, creating the firm of Scott & Campbell. By 1907, when both partners were elected fellows of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Campbell was living at 7 Inverleith Terrace. Around 1914 the practice moved from Queen Street to 60 North Castle Street. Campbell’s partner, Scott, died in 1920, and Campbell thereafter went into partnership with John Begg, who was still heavily involved with public buildings in India. This partnership only lasted from 1921 to 1924. Campbell appears to have been a close friend of Robert Rowand Anderson and although never working with him, acted on his behalf on several occasions. Campbell designed the memorial to Anderson’s wife, Lady Anderson, in Colinton and was Anderson’s executor upon his death in 1921. In later life he became consultant architect to the General Trustees of the Church of Scotland, and was also on Edinburgh’s Dean of Guild Court. He was a leading member of the Edinburgh and East of Scotland branch of the Garden Cities Association. == Family == In 1916 he had moved out of the city centre to live with his wife, Elizabeth Catherine McGregor, at West Colinton Cottage, Woodhall Road, in the quiet suburb of Colinton to the south- west. He had no children. == Death == He died on 6 July 1944 and was buried in Colinton Cemetery near his home. ==Principal works== *Craigmillar Park Golf Clubhouse (1895) serving under Robert Morham *St Stephens UF Church, Comely Bank, Edinburgh (1900-1) *Carnegie Free Library, Hawick (1901) *Remodelling of Baberton Golf Clubhouse, Juniper Green (1902) *Leith Poorhouse (1903) (converted into the Eastern General Hospital in 1939 – now demolished) *South African (Boer) War Memorial, Hawick (1903) *Grange House, Linlithgow (1904) *McDonald Road UF Church, Edinburgh (1904) now demolished *St Andrews UF Church, Bo’ness (1905) *Lady Anderson Memorial Cottage, Colinton (1921) *Scottish Ministers War Memorial, St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh (1922) *Heriot Cross and Heriot Bridge (1922-3), part of the Grassmarket Improvement Scheme in Edinburgh *Villa, 26 Gillespie Road, Colinton (\\"L’Ermitage\\") (1923 plus additions 1927) *Villa, 36 Colinton Road, Edinburgh (1925) *Remodelling of the Edinburgh Dental Hospital, Chambers Street (1925) *St Cuthbert’s Episcopal Church Hall, Colinton (1925) *Dechmont House, Lothian (c. 1925) *Greenbank Church, Edinburgh (1927)Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh, by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker *Lochend Parish Church, Sleigh Drive, Edinburgh (1929) demolished late 20th century *Major remodelling within Kirk Yetholm Parish Church (1934) ==References== Category:1871 births Category:1944 deaths Category:architects from Edinburgh Category:People educated at George Watson's College Category:20th-century Scottish architects ","title":"Alexander Lorne Campbell"},{"id":"46361672","text":"Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Bank (or MUDRA Bank)) is a public sector financial institution in India.

He invented a version of the light-dimmer switch for use in homes around the United States and led his Lutron Electronics Company into the production of lighting controllers. ==Early life== Spira was born in New York City in 1927. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, in 1948 and became a benefactor with his wife, including the School of Mechanical Engineering Ruth and Joel Spira Award and others. In the 1950s, he worked for an aerospace company, where he was assigned to develop a reliable trigger for atomic weapons. Suggested by others at the laboratory, he called on the thyristor, a solid state semiconductor. During his research, he recognized that the device could also be employed to vary the intensity of light. A lighting dimmer existed at the time, but was expensive, complicated, and necessitated the use of large rheostats, about 10 in (25 cm) in size. Though there were dimming devices already in use for theater lighting, they were far too big and bulky for use in homes. Spira successfully manipulated a thyristor, a solid-state semiconductor small enough to fit into the wall box that housed a standard light switch. Unlike theatrical dimmers, Spira's standalone device was small enough for home application. He resigned from his job at the aerospace laboratory to concentrate on refining the device. Spira then went on to conduct experiments on a ping-pong table in his Riverside Drive apartment in New York City, which led to a device capable of dimming the lighting in a home or office setting. ==Lutron Electronics Company== Spira became—as a result of his discovery—best known for his initial, seminal invention: the first successful solid state-electronic dimmer. He filed for a patent on July 15, 1959 (U.S. 3,032,688). On the basis of the dimmer alone, he and his wife Ruth Rodale Spira, who was an active associate, founded the Lutron Electronics Company in Coopersburg, Pennsylvania, in 1961. The privately held firm, whose headquarters remain there today, has grown into an international manufacturer and distributor not only of dimmers, but also of motorized and automated window-covering systems, as well as lighting fixtures and temperature controls. Spira headed the firm for 54 years and more recently became chair of the board and research director. He died in 2015 at the age of 88 from a heart attack in Springfield Township, Pennsylvania. He was awarded the ASME Leonardo Da Vinci Award in 2000 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ==References== Category:1927 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American businesspeople Category:American inventors Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:People from Pennsylvania Category:Businesspeople in electronics ","title":"Joel Spira (businessman)"},{"id":"46361723","text":"Mountain Crystal () is a 1949 Austrian-German historical drama film directed by Harald Reinl and featuring a cast of unknown actors including Franz Eichberger, Hans Renz and Cilli Greif.Bock & Bergfelder p. 398 It is a mountain film based on a novella of the same title by Adalbert Stifter. The film's sets were designed by the Austrian art director Fritz Jüptner- Jonstorff. It was the directorial debut of Reinl who went on to become a successful film director. ==Cast Plot == The Tyrolean mountain farmer's son Franz loves Sanna, the daughter of a dyer beyond the mountain ridge. His rival, a hunter, caught him poaching, shot him and left him wounded. The hunter then has a fatal accident in a crevasse, but the villagers consider Franz, who was seriously injured, to be the murderer of the missing hunter. Acquitted for lack of evidence, he is still outlawed by everyone. Only Sanna sticks to him, marries him and is therefore rejected by her father. Franz is repeatedly confronted with the murder charge, which affects his whole life. Years later, his two children want to look for the Christ child at Christmas time because the bitter father does not tolerate a Christmas tree in his house. They get lost in the glacier region and find shelter in an ice cave, where the hunter's intact body is located. In a joint rescue operation, not only are the children rescued, but Franz is finally rehabilitated and finds his faith in God and the people again. == Production == Harald Reinl worked again with the producers Josef Plesner and Hubert Schonger to realize his first feature film, shot in winter 1948/49. Fritz Jüptner-Jonstorff was responsible for the buildings, the studio was in Kufstein. The exterior shots were taken in Kitzbühel, in the Kaiser Mountains, on the Tuxer Joch, at the Upper Court, and on the Spannagel Glacier. In addition to the actors mentioned by name, farmers, hunters, and shepherds from Tyrol also appear in the film.

The album is a collaboration with the composer John Harle and was released on Harle's Sospiro Noir label on 24 February 2014. ==Background== The Tyburn Tree (Dark London) is a song cycle about \\"the macabre, supernatural history of the loved and reviled city\\" of London and is named after the famous Tyburn Tree gallows where many criminals were hanged. Almond and Harle had worked together before on the latter's 2013 album Art Music, introducing Harle to what Record Collector call \\"a simpatico and invaluable collaborator\\" in Almond. According to the Daily Express the album was two years in the making and features a range of musical styles, \\"from electronic dance, to ambient music and classical\\". The album was released in a jewel case CD edition as well as a gatefold double vinyl edition with sleeve notes describing the backgrounds to the songs. ==Critical reception== The album received positive reviews overall from critics. The union of Almond and Harle is called \\"a powerfully theatrical alliance\\" by The Independent who compare songs on the album to both King Crimson and Scott Walker. Record Collector calls the album a \\"high-minded undertaking\\", praising both \\"the emotional breadth of Almond's compelling, immersive performances\\" and Harle's \\"consistently expansive and imaginative\\" musical settings. Joe Muggs for The Arts Desk writes that The Tyburn Tree (Dark London) \\"should by rights be really hard work\\" due to the many styles of music used but concludes that \\"like everything else in Almond's career, it's quite uncanny and unlikely that he carries it off – but he does.\\" The Observer calls the album \\"dark but dashing\\" and writes that \\"the echoing, crepuscular atmosphere is dominated by Almond's impressive neo-operatic singing\\". Jazz critic John Fordham writes in The Guardian that though \\"the music is often atmospherically layered and coloured\\" it is also \\"a shade self-important and overpacked\\". He concludes that \\"the composer's echoing soprano sax is always haunting, as is Sarah Leonard's eerie, soprano-meets-chorister voice, and the searing Almond is magnificent all through\\". ==Track listing== # \\"The Tyburn Tree\\" (Marc Almond, John Harle) – 2:53 # \\"Fortress\\" (lyrics by William Blake, adapted by Harle) – 4:19 #* adapted from the works of William Blake # \\"Spring Heeled Jack\\" (lyrics by Almond, Harle) – 4:29 # \\"My Fair Lady\\" (lyrics by Tom Pickard, Harle) – 4:59 # \\"Ratcliffe Highway\\" (lyrics trad., adapted by Almond, Harle) – 4:15 # \\"The Labyrinth of Limehouse\\" (lyrics by Almond, Harle) – 4:12 # \\"To the Crow the Spoils\\" (lyrics by Iain Sinclair, Harle) – 3:22 # \\"Dark Angel\\" (lyrics by John Dee, Harle) – 4:45 #* adapted from the manuscript \\"A True and Faithful RELATION of what passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee and some spirits\\" by John Dee. # \\"The Vampire of Highgate\\" (lyrics by Almond, Harle) – 4:17 # \\"Black Widow\\" (lyrics by Pickard, Harle) – 4:26 # \\"Poor Henry\\" (lyrics by Almond, Harle) – 5:16 # \\"Jerusalem\\" (lyrics by Blake, adapted by Harle) – 6:39 #* adapted from the works of William Blake ==Personnel== *Marc Almond – vocals *John Harle – keyboards, saxophones, vocals *Sarah Leonard – vocals *Neill MacColl – acoustic guitar *John Parricelli – electric guitar *Mike Lovatt – trumpet *Dudley Phillips – bass *Martyn Barker – drums *Iain Sinclair – voice (track 7) *Daniel Eisner Harle – sound design ==References== Category:2014 albums Category:Marc Almond albums ","title":"The Tyburn Tree (Dark London)"},{"id":"46361835","text":"The Queen of the Landstrasse (German: Königin der Landstrasse) is a 1948 Austrian romance film directed by Géza von Cziffra and starring Angelika Hauff, Rudolf Prack and Hermann Erhardt.Dassanowsky p.130 The film's sets were designed by art director Fritz Jüptner-Jonstorff. ==Cast== * Angelika Hauff as Flora Giebel genannt \\"Lulu\\" * Rudolf Prack as Michael von Dornberg * Hermann Erhardt as Johannes Giebel * Ditta Donnah as Nellie Giebel * Albin Skoda as Alfredo * Karl Skraup as Niko * Dagny Servaes as Regina von Dornberg, Michaels Tante * Karl Günther * Petra Trautmann as Gaby == References  Bibliography == * Robert Dassanowsky.

Some side effects which are observed from the treatment by dicycloplatin are nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, loss of appetite, liver enzyme elevation and alopecia. The drugs is a form of platinum-based antineoplastic and it works by causing the mitochondrial dysfunction which leads to the cell death. Dicycloplatin was developed in China and it was used for phase I human trial clinical in 2006. The drug was approved for chemotherapy by the Chinese FDA in 2012. ==Medical uses== Dicycloplatin can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells via the induction of apoptosis. It is used to treat a number types of cancer which are non- small-cell lung carcinoma and prostate cancer. ==Side effects== Similar to cisplatin and carboplatin, dicycloplatin also contains some side effects, which are nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, loss of appetite, liver enzyme elevation, and alopecia. However, with doses up to 350 mg/m(2), there is no significant toxicity; these effects are observed only at higher doses. Furthermore, the nephrotoxicity of dicycloplatin is reported to be less than that of cisplatin, and its myelosuppressive potency is similar to that of carboplatin. ==Chemical structure== Dicycloplatin consists of carboplatin and cyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid (CBDC) linked by the hydrogen bond. In the structure of dicycloplatin, there are two types of bond: O-H...O is the bond between the hydroxyl group of CBDC with carboxyl oxygen atom. It creates the one-dimensional polymer chain of carboplatin and CBDC. The second one is N-H...O which links between the ammonia group of carboplatin and oxygen of CBDC. It forms the two-dimensional polymer chain of carboplatin and CBDC. In aqueous solution, the 2D-hydrogen bonded polymeric structure of dicycloplatin is destroyed. Firstly, the bond between ammonia group of carboplatin and oxygen of CBDC breaks, thus inducing the formation of one-dimensional dicycloplatin. After that, the strong hydrogen bond breaks and creates an intermediate state of dicycloplatin. Finally, the rearrangement of different orientation of carboplatin and CBDC leads to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond and a supramolecule of dicycloplatin with two O-H...O and N-H...O is created. ==Mechanism of action== Similar to carboplatin, dicycloplatin inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells by inducing cell apoptosis. When treated with dicycloplatin, some changes in the properties of Hep G2 cells are observed: the declination of Mitochondria Membrane Potential, the release of cytochrome c from mitocondria to cytosol, the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and the decrease of Bcl-2. Those phenomena indicate the role of mitochondrial in the apoptosis by intrinsic way. Furthermore, the increase in caspase-8 activation is also observed. This can stimulate the apoptosis by activating downstream caspase-3 or by cleaving Bid. As a result, the cleavage of Bid (tBid) transfers to the mitochondria and induce mitochondrial dysfunction which promotes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. From the dicycloplatin-treated Hep G2 cell, an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species was detected, which plays an important role in the release of cytochrome c. In the mitochondria, the release of hemoprotein happens through 2-step process: Firstly, the dissociation of cytochrome c from its binding to cardiolipin happens. Due to the reactive oxygen species, the cardiolipin is oxidized, thus reducing the cytochrome c binding and increase the concentration of free cytochrome c ==Notes== Category:Coordination compounds Category:Platinum(II) compounds Category:Platinum-based antineoplastic agents Category:Ammine complexes Category:Cyclobutanes ","title":"Dicycloplatin"},{"id":"46361921","text":"Head of Christ is a painting in oil on panel by the Italian Renaissance painter Correggio, dated 1521. It depicts the head of Christ, wearing the crown of thorns. In the background there is a white cloth showing that the image represents the Veil of Veronica, but Christ's head is given volume through alternate use of light and dark shadows. The painting is in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Los Angeles. Correggio was known for creating some of the most sumptuous religious paintings of the period. The Getty Museum considers this artwork as one of the masterpieces of painting held by the museum. ==Painting== The painting is a small artwork, probably intended for private devotion, which depicts the head of Christ crowned with thorns, in half profile turning his head towards the viewer. Through the use of the alternate use of light and shade; the chiaroscuro technique is used by the artist to highlight the line of the nose, cheekbones and the neck. All this, however, is softened by the muted tones of the nuances he used when depicting the color of the body. The strong shadows and the sculptural treatment of the head make this one of the most distinguishable representations on the Veil of Veronica. According to legend, Christ stumbled on his way to Golgotha carrying the cross. Veronica took off her own veil, and wiped his face with it. Christ's features were miraculously imprinted on the veil. In the early 1520s, Correggio was particularly interested in the study of the characters of the sacred history. Christ has his lips slightly parted, as if he would like to speak to the viewer. Correggio's bold reassessment of the theme filled the face of Christ an intense pathos. He looks at the viewers, as if to implore their mercy. According to art historian John Shearman this kind of depiction is a typical example of a \\"transitive work\\", i.e. a work that requires the emotional participation of the viewer and that can only be completed through being in the physical presence of the image.John Shearman makes a plea for a more engaged reading of art works of the Italian Renaissance, one that will recognize the presuppositions of Renaissance artists about their viewers. His book constructs a history of Renaissance paintings and sculptures that are by design completed outside themselves in or by the spectator, that embrace the spectator into their narrative plot or aesthetic functioning, and that reposition the spectator imaginatively or in time and space.Giuseppe Adani, Correggio pittore universale, Silvana Editoriale, Correggio 2007.

This hybrid of quicksort and radix sort was originally suggested by P. Shackleton, as reported in one of C.A.R. Hoare's seminal papers on quicksort; its modern incarnation was developed by Jon Bentley and Robert Sedgewick in the mid-1990s. The algorithm is designed to exploit the property that in many problems, strings tend to have shared prefixes. One of the algorithm's uses is the construction of suffix arrays, for which it was one of the fastest algorithms as of 2004. ==Description== The three-way radix quicksort algorithm sorts an array of (pointers to) strings in lexicographic order. It is assumed that all strings are of equal length ; if the strings are of varying length, they must be padded with extra elements that are less than any element in the strings. The pseudocode for the algorithm is then algorithm sort(a : array of string, d : integer) is if length(a) ≤ 1 or d ≥ K then return p := pivot(a, d) i, j := partition(a, d, p) (Note a simultaneous assignment of two variables.) sort(a[0:i), d) sort(a[i:j), d + 1) sort(a[j:length(a)), d) The function must return a single character. Bentley and Sedgewick suggest either picking the median of or some random character in that range. The partition function is a variant of the one used in ordinary three-way quicksort: it rearranges so that all of have an element at position that is less than , have at position , and strings from onward have a 'th element larger than . (The original partitioning function suggested by Bentley and Sedgewick may be slow in the case of repeated elements; a Dutch national flag partitioning can be used to alleviate this.) Practical implementations of multi-key quicksort can benefit from the same optimizations typically applied to quicksort: median-of-three pivoting, switching to insertion sort for small arrays, etc. ==See also== * American flag sort another radix sort variant that is fast for string sorting * Ternary search tree three-way radix quicksort is isomorphic to this data structure in the same way that quicksort is isomorphic to binary search trees ==NotesReferences== Category:Articles with example pseudocode Category:Comparison sorts Category:String sorting algorithms ","title":"Multi-key quicksort"},{"id":"46361947","text":"The delicate blue-eye (Pseudomugil tenellus) is a species of fish in the subfamily Pseudomugilinae.

It is a 'free of cost' community-based service dedicated to the support and education of people with mental health difficulties. It offers 'at home' treatments (both pharmacological and talking therapies), counseling and rehabilitation to those who are needy and willing to accept such help. Shant Manas works to promote positive mental health by working in close partnership with families and the local communities. Improving awareness of the importance of mental health and minimizing stigma and discrimination, through regular psychosocial educational programs, within the rural communities that we serve, remains one of our prime objectives. ==History== Shant Manas was begun in 2007 by Dr Cahn Vasudevan, a retired Consultant Psychiatrist and Psychotherapist from the UK. His was a simple idea of 'putting back' some of his skills and experience into a small rural community of the country of his origin and making mental health services accessible to a section of people who previously had no such service available to them. Shant Manas began as a small clinical project in 4 villages. Since its inception it has expanded its field of care to 14 villages, with a combined estimated population of about 80,000. It is staffed by three full-time mental health social workers (supported by supervision from 2 sessional psychiatrists) overseeing the psychiatric and social care of 220 service users, with around 50 of them in being in active treatment, as of in May 2015. As well as the treatment of psychiatric disorders, Shant Manas aims to provide education on mental health to the local population, reducing stigma and myths surrounding mental health. Due to its success the service continues to expand as demand and awareness of mental health increases. The main body of clinical and social work at Shant Manas is to do with all forms of mental illness and their consequences, but in a very limited sense with difficulties relating to alcohol addiction or learning difficulties. ==Mental health beliefs in the locality== The Shant Manas catchment area covers a rural population, with many informal workers often living in poor economic conditions. As such there is little or no awareness regarding mental health and illness, there are no local services and access to free, urban government treatment is limited or not possible, with no consistent follow-up after treatment. Mental health compounds economic difficulty by keeping able people out of work, creating a negative impact on their families also (in a community in which most households have one wage earner). Many communities retain the idea that mental health is a product of ‘possession’ or have other mythological roots, and significant stigma is still attached to mental health issues. Because of these beliefs many sufferers (or their families) seek alternative forms of treatment and do not access conventional healthcare. The behaviour of those mentally ill often could trigger in others different emotions such as fear, anger, disgust, etc. which might then lead to a response of hostility or even aggression by neighbors or villagers who do not understand their condition. Such stigma also creates social limitations on a sufferer’s family and their place in the community, affecting deeper levels of rural society: for instance, a mental illness can force the entire family into the fringes of the community and affect the prospects of a sufferer’s relatives. ==The Shant Manas Approach== A field clincic in the community from ShantManas. Shant Manas is community based, relying on word-of-mouth and family referrals for service users to access care. Its approaches to care are: # The 'doorstep' approach – Staff visit the villages regularly to identify and approach new service users, as well as new cases being brought to light by word-of-mouth and family members. # An initial assessment, in the home, is done and rapport is built with the service user. Shant Manas involves the family and community at every stage of treatment and all assessments are done in the company of anybody who wishes to attend. # The new service user is referred to a psychiatric consultant, who advises on any diagnosis or medication queries. # The Shant Manas team formulates a personalized care plan for the service user, including treatment, talking therapy, rehabilitation and education for them and the family. # Medication for acute issues is given if required. # Follow-up visits are planned. For acutely ill service users this is once a day, reducing to at least once a week for the entire caseload. All follow-up visits are done in the service user’s home and in the presence of his/her family. Counseling is also given regarding how to cope with the diagnosis and the team ensures any queries the family have are answered. This includes sleep issues, medication, and how to recognize deterioration and relapse. # For those recovering, the team aids service users financially, by seeking employment and motivating families to do the same. # Shant Manas always maintains close links with the village panchayat leaders (governing body), school heads and local health workers for mutual support and easier identification of new service users. # Shant Manas runs mental health awareness programs in the villages, for the wider community. Through these awareness can be boosted regarding mental health and stigma sufferers may be enduring can be eased. These programs are also run in local schools with the same objectives but for the younger generation, with the aim of improving awareness in the years to come. Villages served by Shantmanas Shantmanas currently services the communities of: Thuvariman, Keelamathur, Melamathur, Kodimangalam, Melakkal, Katapulli Nagar, Depethar Santhai, Kachirairuppu, Keelamatayan, Thenkarai, Oothukuli, Narayanapuram, T. Pudur, Mullipallam, Achampathu, Sholavandan and Nagamalai. Pablo's Group: Shantmanas service users participating in exercises. Pablo’s Group Initiated in 2014 by Dr Pablo Curras, a Canadian psychiatrist volunteering with Shant Manas, Pablo’s Group is a meeting for service users and their carers or families. It is focused on boosting the self-confidence and social skills of service users (who, due to their conditions, may have been ostracized or have little social contact). Although the session is a free structure its core themes are psycho-social education, friendship and communication, and games or activities during the group are aimed at building upon any or all of these. It also teaches relaxation and exercise regimes such as simple yoga routines. The group, held once every three weeks, has an attendance of around 10-15 people (both service users and their families), and has received positive feedback from those accessing it. Student placements Placement work is crucial for the Indian social work syllabus and Shant Manas is actively involved in healthcare education. It accepts a wide variety of local students and international volunteers. Social work and nursing students from local Universities in Madurai opt for placements with Shant Manas and a variety of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses and social workers from overseas have volunteered. The organization’s novel approach to home-based care offers a different insight into home-based care and students and volunteers alike are able to influence treatment and healthcare plans. The opportunity for students to improve their own skills is also available – students are encouraged to formulate their own assessments and give presentations on case studies. A quarterly mental health seminar for local students is also given at the Shant Manas site as an educational tool and synergist alongside the Indian social work syllabus. ==References * The ShantManas website.

After a schism in the Church, she founded and led the Cherubim and Seraphim Society. ==Personal life== Abiodun Akinsowon was born in 1907 to a Saro family. The daughter of a pastor, she was baptised into the Anglican Church in Lagos, Nigeria, where she attended elementary school. In 1920, she left school to join her aunt as a trader. In 1942, she married George Orisanya Emanuel, a civil servant working in Lagos City Council. ==Founding the Cherubim and Seraphim== In 1925, while watching a Catholic Corpus Christi procession, Emanuel reportedly fell into a lengthy trance. She awoke from her coma after the healer Moses Orimolade arrived to pray for her. Waking, Emanuel claimed she had been visited by angels who had taken her to heaven. As increasing numbers of visitors came to hear of her visions, Emanuel and Orimolade founded an interdenominational prayer group called the Cherubim and Seraphim. In 1927, Emanuel led an evangelical tour of Western Nigeria, condemning the worship of traditional gods and encouraging Christian prayer. In 1928, they established the Cherubim and Seraphim as its own independent church, within the Aladura tradition. ==Schism and reconciliation== In 1929, the Cherubim and Seraphim underwent its first schism, with Emanuel founding the Cherubim and Seraphim Society and Orimolade founding the Eternal Sacred Order of Cherubim and Seraphim. The split arose from disputes within the group over the role of female leadership. (JStor) Emanuel demanded to be recognised as co-founder of the church. This was viewed by Orimolade, who denied she was co-founder, as insubordination, and led to their eventual split. This was followed by other schisms, leading to the existence of more than 10 separate sects within the Cherubim and Seraphim. After Orimolade's death, Emanuel campaigned to be recognised as the supreme head of the church, claiming she had been discriminated against as a woman. In 1986, in an attempt to reunite the disparate groupings within the Church, she was reinstalled as leader of a united Cherubim and Seraphim Church. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Founders of new religious movements Category:Nigerian Christian religious leaders Category:Yoruba Christian clergy Category:Female Christian clergy Category:Angelic visionaries Category:20th- century Nigerian people Category:20th-century Protestant religious leaders Category:Saro people ","title":"Christiana Abiodun Emanuel"},{"id":"46362110","text":"The Tubariaceae is a family of basidiomycete fungi described by Alfredo Vizzini in 2008. ==Taxonomic Details== The genera Flammulaster, Phaeomarasmius, Phaeomyces and Tubaria, that previously belonged to the Inocybaceae, form the family Tubariaceae based on molecular evidence. ==References * Category:Agaricales families ","title":"Tubariaceae"},{"id":"46362117","text":"The 1976 United States presidential election in Connecticut took place on November 2, 1976.

Forcibly, Charles James Fox resided in Surrey country estate with his wife Elizabeth Armistead. Some years after restoring his body and spirit with the help of his neighbour Sir Joseph Mawbey, 1st Baronet, Charles James Fox died in 1806. Sir Joseph Mawbey, 1st Baronet did not long out-live Charles James Fox where he ultimately died in 1817. Sir Joseph bought the estate of Botleys in Chertsey in 1763, however upon his death, his Daughter and Son-In-Law, John Ivatt Briscoe Debrett's House of Commons - Members Of Parliament bought the estate which we know now as Foxhills. In the 1870s the estate was passed to a relative of John Ivatt Briscoe, Edward Hutton who served as a veteran in the Anglo-Zulu and Boer wars. Lieutenant General Sir Edward Hutton, died in 1923 being buried in Lyne near Chertsey Surrey.= British Empire - Lt-Gen Sir Edward Thomas Henry Hutton Before General Hutton's death he sold the estate to Borthwicks in the early 1920s who were successful merchants.

Located on Dallas Mountain Road, it is the best-preserved of two surviving district schoolhouses built by the small community, and has apparently served as town hall since its construction (whose date is a subject of uncertainty). The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. ==Description and history== The Upper Dallas School is set on the north side of Dallas Mountain Road, adjacent to a large public works building opposite its junction with Herrick Farm Road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front- gable roof, clapboard siding, and a rubblestone foundation. The front facade is symmetrically arranged, with two widely spaced entrances and a central sash window, framed by simple trim with modest entablatures. The building has thin cornerboards, and the front-facing gable has cornice with simple returns. A small ell extends the building to the rear. The west elevation has a single window, while the east side has eight. The interior features a pair of narrow vestibules opening into a large chamber, which has a raised platform (presumably for a teacher's desk) in the space between the vestibules. The vestibules and main chamber both feature pressed tin ceilings. The ell houses a storage space for town records, and for pit toilets at the rear. Town records are sketchy as to when this particular building was built. Dallas Plantation was organized in 1845, and an 1861 map shows a school building standing at or near this site. However, the parcel of land on which this building stands was purchased by the town in 1888, and the building is stylistically of a later 19th-century period. The town also built a second school in 1895 (known as the \\"Lower Dallas School\\"), which has been converted into a residence. The exact period for which it was used as a school is unknown; local lore maintains that it has been used continuously since its construction for town meetings (notwithstanding a 1939 WPA history claiming its use for that purpose ended in 1929). It is one of the small community's only surviving 19th-century buildings. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Franklin County, Maine ==References== Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Victorian architecture in Maine Category:School buildings completed in 1888 Category:Buildings and structures in Franklin County, Maine Category:Town halls in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Franklin County, Maine ","title":"Upper Dallas School"},{"id":"46362237","text":"Fadiman is a surname.

He is best remembered as the husband of novelist Jacqueline Susann and for his promotion of Susann's popular books. ==Early life and career== Irving Mansfield was born Irving Mandelbaum on July 23, 1908 in Brooklyn, to Jacob and Polish-born Annie Mandelbaum. Mansfield graduated from New York University in the early 1930s. After working in public relations for several years, Mansfield became a producer with CBS in 1946 and developed Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts, This Is Show Business and The Jane Froman Show, among other programs. Mansfield gave up his career to help his wife promote her book, Valley of the Dolls, which was published in 1966 and became the best-selling novel of the year. Mansfield continued to work with his wife in promoting her subsequent novels, The Love Machine (1969) and Once Is Not Enough (1973), both among the top three sellers of their respective years. Mansfield also executive-produced movie versions of his wife's novels The Love Machine (1971) and Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (1975), as well as a 1981 television mini-series version of Valley. ==Personal life== Mansfield met Jacqueline Susann, then an aspiring stage actress, in the late 1930s while he was working as a press agent. Susann was impressed by his ability to place \\"items\\" about her in the theater and society pages of New York newspapers, and they were married on April 2, 1939. Susann gave birth to their only child, Guy Hildy Mansfield, on December 6, 1946. At the age of three, Guy was diagnosed as autistic. In an interview with People magazine in 1983, Mansfield described his son and how he found out his son was autistic: Despite persistent rumors of Susann's infidelity, the couple was devoted to each other, and remained married until Susann's death from cancer on September 21, 1974, at the age of 56. After her death, Mansfield alone promoted her novella Dolores (William Morrow, 1976) which became another huge best seller (according to Publishers Weekly, Dolores was the third best-selling novel of its year). In 1983, learning of an upcoming biography of Susann, Mansfield published his own book, Life with Jackie (Bantam), written with Jean Libman Block. In 1983, he married Beverly Robinson, who survived him at his death. == Description == Editor Michael Korda gave this description of Irving Mansfield, \\".. talked and acted as if he were a character straight out of Guys and Dolls, and was comfortable only at places like Lindy's, the Stage Delicatessen, and Sardi's (although late in life he managed to settle into the West Coast equivalent: a bungalow and a cabana at the Beverly Hills Hotel and a table at the Polo Lounge). ==Death== Mansfield died on August 25, 1988, at his home in Manhattan after suffering a heart attack. He was 80. In addition to his second wife, he was survived by his son. His funeral service was held on August 28 at the Riverside Chapel in Manhattan. ==ReferencesCategory:1908 births Category:1988 deaths Category:New York University alumni ","title":"Irving Mansfield"},{"id":"46362318","text":"Sandra Suh is an American aid worker deported from North Korea in 2015 on charges of \\"using her humanitarian status as a cover to gather and produce anti-Pyongyang propaganda.\\" == Humanitarian Efforts== In 1989, Suh founded a California-based organization, Wheat Mission Ministries.

It was the first final of the Gillette Cup, which was the first English domestic knock-out competition between first-class sides. Sussex won the match by fourteen runs. ==Background== During the 1950s and early 1960s, county cricket clubs were struggling to get good attendances at County Championship matches, and although The World of Cricket described there being \\"misgivings among the more conservatively minded\\", the 65-overs-a-side Knockout Cup was played for the first time in 1963. Sussex overcame Kent, Yorkshire and Northamptonshire to reach the final, while Worcestershire beat Surrey, Glamorgan and Lancashire. ==Match== Summary The final was played in front of a sell-out crowd of 24,000 people at Lord's Cricket Ground in London on 7 September 1963. Sussex won the toss, and their captain Ted Dexter elected to bat first. Jim Parks, Jr. was Sussex' leading run-scorer, with 57 runs, and his side were bowled out for 168, with just under 5 of their allocated 65 overs remaining. In their response, Worcestershire had to contend with drizzle and fading light while they were batting. Dexter made use of the conditions, by selecting his fastest bowler, John Snow, to bowl. Worcestershire struggled to play him, and Snow took three wickets, and only conceded 13 runs across his eight overs. A partnership between Worcestershire's final two batsmen gave them some hope of victory, but despite scoring 21 runs together, they did not manage to overhaul Sussex's total, and Sussex won the match by 14 runs to become the first winners of the Gillette Cup. Scorecard ==Reaction== Dexter drew a lot of criticism for his tactics throughout the competition, and particularly in the final. The competition had been devised to attract people to cricket, and was intended to promote more attacking cricket. However, Dexter advocated a very defensive style of play, asking his bowlers to bowl at the stumps, and when Worcestershire had needed to score boundaries, he placed all nine of his fielders on the boundary edge to restrict their chances of doing so. The Daily Mirrors Brian Chapman claimed that Dexter's \\"tactics could eventually kill a great idea\\", and The Times echoed the sentiment, saying \\"the means on the way had, at times, been a perversion of positive cricket.\\" ==References== Gillette Cup Final, 1963 Category:Friends Provident Trophy Finals ","title":"1963 Gillette Cup Final"},{"id":"46362351","text":"The Airport railway line is an under construction railway line on the Transperth network in Perth, Western Australia.

An artist who works in themes, his recent large- scale head paintings have been exhibited worldwide. == Education == Davidson was born in Belfast in 1968 and attended Methodist College Belfast between 1980 and 1987. He graduated from the University of Ulster in 1991 with a First Class Honours Degree in Design. He worked in the field of design for print until 1999 when he started to paint full-time. Davidson is an Academician of the Royal Ulster Academy and served as President of the Royal Ulster Academy between 2012 and 2015. == Early work == Davidson started to paint Belfast in his teens, and this theme came to the fore in 2004 when his exhibition No Continuing City was mounted at the Tom Caldwell Gallery. The exhibition included large paintings of Belfast as seen from high view-points. The urban theme continued between 2006 and 2010 when Davidson made paintings based on the illusionary world seen in city window reflections. == Portraits == Since 2010 Davidson's work has been concerned with the human face and the resulting large scale head paintings are now recognised internationally. His portraits of Brad Pitt, Seamus Heaney and Michael Longley are held in the collection of the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC, the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin respectively. A permanent exhibition of Davidson's work is on display at Lyric Theatre, Belfast, where he personally presented his work to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the President of Ireland during the Royal visit to Northern Ireland in 2012.http://www.lyrictheatre.co.uk/news/specific/sir-kenneth-branagh-portrait- unveiled-at-lyric-theatre Davidson's work has been exhibited in the BP Portrait Award at the National Portrait Gallery in London in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

The event was also known in Romanian press as Black Easter. The fire took place on April 18, 1930, during a religious service on Good Friday, when hundreds of people from the Orthodox community gathered at the wooden church in the town, built in the eighteenth century. The church was no more than 48 square meters and so children, singers and some elders gathered in the narthex while parents listened to service from outside. The fire broke out during Lamentations, from a candle that reached a wreath braid. The fire was extinguished immediately, but without anyone even noticing, the wreaths housed in the church attic were also ignited. The church door, with an opening width of only 60 centimetres, was locked, trapping inside 130 people. Within a few minutes, dozens of people died from smoke inhalation or burns. The shingle roof also collapsed, crushing to death many still trapped in the church. Only 14 people managed to escape, of which two died a few days later from burns. After the fire, the Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church, at the initiative of Patriarch Miron Cristea, launched a national public offertory, supported by newspaper Universul, headed at that time by Stelian Popescu. From all over the country, but also abroad, from Europe and the United States, tons of aid arrived to the families of those killed. At the funeral of 116 victims Queen Marie and her grandson, King Michael I were in attendance. Shortly after the tragedy, several parents of those killed committed suicide, feeling guilty for the death of children. Between 1932 and 1934, a new cathedral was built on the site. == References == Category:Fires in Romania Category:1930 in Romania Category:1930 fires Category:Religious buildings and structures fires ","title":"1930 Costești wooden church fire"},{"id":"46362537","text":"Kimmo Savolainen (born 2 August 1974) is a Finnish former ski jumper. == World Cup ==  Standings  {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" fff; font-size:86%; line-height:16px; border:gray solid 1px; border-collapse:collapse;\\" - ccc; text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" dcdcdc; width:45px;\\"Season ! scope=\\"col\\" dcdcdc; width:55px;\\"Overall ! scope=\\"col\\" dcdcdc; width:55px;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" dcdcdc; width:55px;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" dcdcdc; width:55px;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" dcdcdc; width:55px;\\" - ! scope=row align=center1993/94  align=center68  align=center —  align=center —  align=centerN/A  align=centerN/A - ! scope=row align=center1994/95  align=center67  align=center —  align=center —  align=centerN/A  align=centerN/A - ! scope=row align=center1995/96  align=center21  align=center29  align=center38  align=centerN/A  align=center19 - ! scope=row align=center1996/97  align=center45  align=center29  align=center —  align=center40  align=center42 - ! scope=row align=center1997/98  align=center19  align=center25  align=center25  align=center49  align=center19 }  Wins  {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" fff; font-size:86%; line-height:15px; border:gray solid 1px; border-collapse:collapse;\\" - ccc; text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" ccc; width:15px;\\" No. ! scope=\\"col\\" ccc; width:50px;\\" Season ! scope=\\"col\\" ccc; width:120px;\\"Date ! scope=\\"col\\" ccc; width:200px;\\"Location ! scope=\\"col\\" ccc; width:200px;\\"Hill ! scope=\\"col\\" ccc; width:30px;\\" Size - ! scope=row style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1  align=center1995/96  align=right28 February 1996  Kuopio  Puijo K90 (night)  align=centerNH } ==External links== * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:People from Siilinjärvi Category:Finnish male ski jumpers ","title":"Kimmo Savolainen"},{"id":"46362543","text":"Une nuit à l'Assemblée Nationale (A Night at the National Assembly) is a 1988 French comedy film directed by Jean-Pierre Mocky. ==Plot== Walter Arbeit, an ecologist practising naturism, accompanies his mayor and MP, Dugland, to Paris where he is to be awarded the Legion of Honour.

In this sense, any color perception is subjective. However, successful attempts have been made to map the spectral power distribution of light to human sensory response in a quantifiable way. In 1931, using psychophysical measurements, the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) created the XYZ color space“XYZ” refers to a color model and a color space at the same time, because the XYZ color space is the only color space that uses the XYZ color model. This differs from e.g. the RGB color model, which many color spaces (such as sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998)) use. which successfully models human color vision on this basic sensory level. However, the XYZ color model presupposes specific viewing conditions (such as the retinal locus of stimulation, the luminance level of the light that meets the eye, the background behind the observed object, and the luminance level of the surrounding light). Only if all these conditions stay constant will two identical stimuli with thereby identical XYZ tristimulus values create an identical color appearance for a human observer. If some conditions change in one case, two identical stimuli with thereby identical XYZ tristimulus values will create different color appearances (and vice versa: two different stimuli with thereby different XYZ tristimulus values might create an identical color appearance). Therefore, if viewing conditions vary, the XYZ color model is not sufficient, and a color appearance model is required to model human color perception. ==Color appearance parameters== The basic challenge for any color appearance model is that human color perception does not work in terms of XYZ tristimulus values, but in terms of appearance parameters (hue, lightness, brightness, chroma, colorfulness and saturation). So any color appearance model needs to provide transformations (which factor in viewing conditions) from the XYZ tristimulus values to these appearance parameters (at least hue, lightness and chroma). ==Color appearance phenomena== This section describes some of the color appearance phenomena that color appearance models try to deal with. Chromatic adaptation Chromatic adaptation describes the ability of human color perception to abstract from the white point (or color temperature) of the illuminating light source when observing a reflective object. For the human eye, a piece of white paper looks white no matter whether the illumination is blueish or yellowish. This is the most basic and most important of all color appearance phenomena, and therefore a chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) that tries to emulate this behavior is a central component of any color appearance model. This allows for an easy distinction between simple tristimulus-based color models and color appearance models. A simple tristimulus-based color model ignores the white point of the illuminant when it describes the surface color of an illuminated object; if the white point of the illuminant changes, so does the color of the surface as reported by the simple tristimulus-based color model. In contrast, a color appearance model takes the white point of the illuminant into account (which is why a color appearance model requires this value for its calculations); if the white point of the illuminant changes, the color of the surface as reported by the color appearance model remains the same. Chromatic adaptation is a prime example for the case that two different stimuli with thereby different XYZ tristimulus values create an identical color appearance. If the color temperature of the illuminating light source changes, so do the spectral power distribution and thereby the XYZ tristimulus values of the light reflected from the white paper; the color appearance, however, stays the same (white). Hue appearance Several effects change the perception of hue by a human observer: * Bezold–Brücke hue shift: The hue of monochromatic light changes with luminance. * Abney effect: The hue of monochromatic light changes with the addition of white light (which would be expected color-neutral). Contrast appearance Bartleson–Breneman effect Several effects change the perception of contrast by a human observer: * Stevens effect: Contrast increases with luminance. * Bartleson–Breneman effect: Image contrast (of emissive images such as images on an LCD display) increases with the luminance of surround lighting. Colorfulness appearance There is an effect which changes the perception of colorfulness by a human observer: * Hunt effect: Colorfulness increases with luminance. Brightness appearance There is an effect which changes the perception of brightness by a human observer: * Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect: Brightness increases with saturation. Spatial phenomena Spatial phenomena only affect colors at a specific location of an image, because the human brain interprets this location in a specific contextual way (e.g. as a shadow instead of gray color). These phenomena are also known as optical illusions. Because of their contextuality, they are especially hard to model; color appearance models that try to do this are referred to as image color appearance models (iCAM). ==Color appearance models== Since the color appearance parameters and color appearance phenomena are numerous and the task is complex, there is no single color appearance model that is universally applied; instead, various models are used. This section lists some of the color appearance models in use. The chromatic adaptation transforms for some of these models are listed in LMS color space. CIELAB In 1976, the CIE set out to replace the many existing, incompatible color difference models by a new, universal model for color difference. They tried to achieve this goal by creating a perceptually uniform color space, i.e. a color space where identical spatial distance between two colors equals identical amount of perceived color difference. Though they succeeded only partially, they thereby created the CIELAB (“L*a*b*”) color space which had all the necessary features to become the first color appearance model. While CIELAB is a very rudimentary color appearance model, it is one of the most widely used because it has become one of the building blocks of color management with ICC profiles. Therefore, it is basically omnipresent in digital imaging. One of the limitations of CIELAB is that it does not offer a full-fledged chromatic adaptation in that it performs the von Kries transform method directly in the XYZ color space (often referred to as “wrong von Kries transform”), instead of changing into the LMS color space first for more precise results. ICC profiles circumvent this shortcoming by using the Bradford transformation matrix to the LMS color space (which had first appeared in the LLAB color appearance model) in conjunction with CIELAB. Nayatani et al. model The Nayatani et al. color appearance model focuses on illumination engineering and the color rendering properties of light sources. Hunt model The Hunt color appearance model focuses on color image reproduction (its creator worked in the Kodak Research Laboratories). Development already started in the 1980s and by 1995 the model had become very complex (including features no other color appearance model offers, such as incorporating rod cell responses) and allowed to predict a wide range of visual phenomena. It had a very significant impact on CIECAM02, but because of its complexity the Hunt model itself is difficult to use. RLAB RLAB tries to improve upon the significant limitations of CIELAB with a focus on image reproduction. It performs well for this task and is simple to use, but not comprehensive enough for other applications. LLAB LLAB is similar to RLAB, also tries to stay simple, but additionally tries to be more comprehensive than RLAB. In the end, it traded some simplicity for comprehensiveness, but was still not fully comprehensive. Since CIECAM97s was published soon thereafter, LLAB never gained widespread usage. CIECAM97s After starting the evolution of color appearance models with CIELAB, in 1997, the CIE wanted to follow up itself with a comprehensive color appearance model. The result was CIECAM97s, which was comprehensive, but also complex and partly difficult to use. It gained widespread acceptance as a standard color appearance model until CIECAM02 was published. IPT Ebner and Fairchild addressed the issue of non-constant lines of hue in their color space dubbed IPT. The IPT color space converts D65-adapted XYZ data (XD65, YD65, ZD65) to long-medium-short cone response data (LMS) using an adapted form of the Hunt–Pointer–Estevez matrix (MHPE(D65)). The IPT color appearance model excels at providing a formulation for hue where a constant hue value equals a constant perceived hue independent of the values of lightness and chroma (which is the general ideal for any color appearance model, but hard to achieve). It is therefore well-suited for gamut mapping implementations. ICtCp ITU-R BT.2100 includes a color space called ICtCp, which improves the original IPT by exploring higher dynamic range and larger colour gamuts. CIECAM02 After the success of CIECAM97s, the CIE developed CIECAM02 as its successor and published it in 2002. It performs better and is simpler at the same time. Apart from the rudimentary CIELAB model, CIECAM02 comes closest to an internationally agreed upon “standard” for a (comprehensive) color appearance model. iCAM06 iCAM06 is an image color appearance model. As such, it does not treat each pixel of an image independently, but in the context of the complete image. This allows it to incorporate spatial color appearance parameters like contrast, which makes it well-suited for HDR images. It is also a first step to deal with spatial appearance phenomena. CAM16 The CAM16 is a successor of CIECAM02 with various fixes and improvements. It also comes with a color space called CAM16-UCS. It is published by a CIE workgroup, but is not yet a CIE standard. ==NotesReferences== * Category:Visual perception Category:Cognitive modeling Category:Color space ","title":"Color appearance model"},{"id":"46362619","text":"The Hobart Baroque Festival was a Music festival of Baroque music that took place in the city of Hobart, Tasmania.

He also holds the position of first vice president-elect of the Eastern Communication Association. In addition, he is the chair of the Eastern Communication Association's Task Force on the Status of Interest Groups, and the vice-chair and primary planner for the Commission on Parliamentary Procedure's associated with the National Communication Association (Boston College). He has received awards for his contributions to the field, including the 1998 Haiman Award for Distinguished Scholarship in Freedom of Expression from the National Communication Association, the 2001 Phifer Award for Outstanding Scholarship in Parliamentary Procedure from the Commission on American Parliamentary Practice, the 2001 O'Neill Award for Outstanding Paper in Freedom of Expression at the National Communication Association Convention, and the 2003 O'Neill Award for Outstanding Paper in Freedom of Expression at the National Communication Association Convention. == Contributions and works == Fishman's most cited piece of literature is titled “ValuJet Flight 592: Crisis communication theory blended and extended.” In this work, Fishman uses the communication surrounding the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 as the scenario for which he applies a type of blended methodology approach to crisis communication. The blend he devised uses components from three previously existing crisis communication theories: Steven Fink's Natural History Approach, William Benoit's Image Restoration Approach, and Thomas Birkland's Focusing Events Approach. The paper begins by discussing the event the blended method is being applied to (the disaster itself). An introduction to some of the communication surrounding the event is presented, including public addresses from Senior Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officer David Hinsonand, and a damage control speech given by the United States Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, who is quoted in the paper saying, \\"I've flown ValuJet. ValuJet is a safe airline, as is our entire aviation system. Whenever we have found any issues, ValuJet has been responsive, they have been cooperative, they have in some cases even exceeded the safety standards that we have.\\" The paper then defines crisis communication largely in terms of what is and is not a legitimate crisis situation, and how the word is improperly used in many context today. It is continued by briefly explaining each of the three approaches that are used to create the blended methodology. In the paper Fishman states, “The models used in conjunction strengthen rather than undermine the claims that each approach offers, and that each model provides insights that reinforce constructs that the other model ignores or undervalues.” He applies his blend to the ValuJet crisis by demonstrating what pieces of each model most appropriately fit each step in the crisis communication process. For example, he applies the Prodromal Stage of Fink's model to the initial occurrence of the ValuJet crash, because Benoit's model would require an accusation, and is more appropriate than Birkland's “focusing event” concept. This application theme continues throughout the paper, thus making Fishman's large contribution blended methodology. Fishman does, however, state in the paper that the blended theory method may not be applicable in all crisis communication situations. However, he finds many scenarios in which he his blended methodology was applicable. Among these are the United States Navy’s 1991 Tailhook sexual misconduct scandal, Tylenol's 1982 cyanide mishap, Exxon's 1989 Valdez oil spill, and more. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Boston College people Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"D.A.

With a possible construction history dating to about 1800, it is one of the coastal community's oldest buildings, and is the only surviving 19th-century hostelry in the town. Extensively altered in 1887 and operated as an inn between 1887 and 1942 as the Des Isles Inn, it is now a summer rental property, located within walking distance of Lamoine Beach State Park. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. ==Description and history== Shore Acres is set on the south side of Lamoine Beach Road, near its eastern end in the southern part of the town, between the Lamoine Beach State Park campground and beach parking area. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building that now has relatively vernacular styling. It has a side-gable roof which has a projecting section at the western (right) end, wooden clapboard siding, and an open hip-roofed porch extending across its front (north-facing) facade. Shed-roof additions (both enclosed porches) span the eastern and southern sides. The entry connecting this rear porch to the main house has a projecting vestibule area with Greek Revival styling, suggesting it may once have been the main entrance. The interior reflects late 19th-century tastes, but includes some Federal period trim and wainscoting in the downstairs parlor. There is architectural evidence suggesting that house once had a large central chimney, although there is no evidence for the foundation of one in the partial basement. The property has had a somewhat complex construction history. In 1796 Louis des Parres des Isles, secretary to a wealthy French landowner in the town, married Mary Googin, and is said to have built a house on this property soon afterward. It is unclear whether that house is this one with substantial alterations, or whether a new structure was built in 1887, when this building reached its approximate current shape. It was the community's only hotel during the 1880s, operated by des Isles' son William. By the early 20th century the building had been doubled in size, with historic photos showing large additions that had been removed by the 1930s. It may have acquired the name \\"Shore Acres\\" due to the popularity of a play written by James A. Herne, who summered at the nearby (and no longer extant) Gault House hotel prior to the 1893 publication of the play. The 1886 date reflects the time the structure was expanded to a large Hotel. The original build date was approximately 1796, and the structure as viewed today, was the original farm house. The Hotel Shore Acres, as it was once known, was owned in the 1930s by Sherman Douglas, a then state senator. The Lamoine Historical Society has pictures of Senator Douglas and Henry Ford in Lamoine, promoting the area for a Summer White House.

Data architects define how the data will be stored, consumed, integrated and managed by different data entities and IT systems, as well as any applications using or processing that data in some way. It is closely allied with business architecture and is considered to be one of the four domains of enterprise architecture. ==Role== According to the Data Management Body of Knowledge, the data architect “provides a standard common business vocabulary, expresses strategic data requirements, outlines high level integrated designs to meet these requirements, and aligns with enterprise strategy and related business architecture.” According to the Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), a data architect is expected to set data architecture principles, create models of data that enable the implementation of the intended business architecture, create diagrams showing key data entities, and create an inventory of the data needed to implement the architecture vision. ==Responsibilities== # Organizes data at the macro level. # Organizes data at the micro level, data models, for a new application. # Provides a logical data model as a standard for the golden source and for consuming applications to inherit. # Provides a logical data model with elements and business rules needed for the creation of data quality (DQ) rules. ==Skills== Bob Lambert describes the necessary skills of a Data Architect as follows: * Foundation in systems development: the data architect should understand the system development life cycle; software project management approaches; and requirements, design, and test techniques. The data architect is asked to conceptualize and influence application and interface projects, and therefore must understand what advice to give and where to plug in to steer toward desirable outcomes. * Depth in data modeling and database design: This is the core skill of the data architect, and the most requested in data architect job descriptions. The effective data architect is sound across all phases of data modeling, from conceptualization to database optimization. In his/her experience this skill extends to SQL development and perhaps database administration. * Breadth in established and emerging data technologies: In addition to depth in established data management and reporting technologies, the data architect is either experienced or conversant in emerging tools like columnar and NoSQL databases, predictive analytics, data visualization, and unstructured data. While not necessarily deep in all of these technologies, the data architect hopefully is experienced in one or more, and must understand them sufficiently to guide the organization in understanding and adopting them. * Ability to conceive and portray the big data picture: When the data architect initiates, evaluates, and influences projects he or she does so from the perspective of the entire organization. The data architect maps the systems and interfaces used to manage data, sets standards for data management, analyzes current state and conceives desired future state, and conceives projects needed to close the gap between current state and future goals. * Ability to astutely operate in the organization: Five key characteristics, which point to the data architect’s ability to operate politically in the organization: ** Well respected and influential ** Able to emphasize methodology, modeling, and governance ** Technologically and politically neutral ** Articulate, persuasive, and a good salesperson ** Enthusiastic ==ReferencesSee also== * Data Architecture * Information Architect * Enterprise Architecture Category:Data management Category:Data modeling Category:Data security ","title":"Data architect"},{"id":"46362829","text":"Rudolph Gerhardus Snyman (born ) is a South African professional rugby union player who currently plays for the South Africa national team and Irish province Munster in the Pro14.

At the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Lord Davey, ruling that the exemption was constitutional, stated that \\"The rule laid down ... is a general one, applicable to all the States alike, and the fact that it operates unequally in the several States arises not from anything done by the Parliament, but from the inequality of the duties imposed by the States themselves.\\" This principle has not been in doubt in subsequent jurisprudence.. The High Court of Australia first considered the provision in R v Barger,. which held the Excise Tariff 1906Excise Tariff 1906, Act No. 16 of 1906 invalid on several grounds. The aspect which offended s. 99 concerned an exemption relating to goods manufactured by any person in any part of the Commonwealth under certain conditions relating to the remuneration of labour, which could vary according to local circumstances, agreements and judicial opinion. In invalidating this provision, Griffith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ said: > The words \\"States or parts of States\\" must be read as synonymous with \\"parts > of the Commonwealth\\" or \\"different localities within the Commonwealth.\\" The > existing limits of the States are arbitrary, and it would be a strange thing > if the Commonwealth Parliament could discriminate in a taxing Act between > one locality and another, merely because such localities were not > coterminous with States or with parts of the same State. In his dissent in Barger, Isaacs J disputed the inclusion of \\"different localities within the Commonwealth,\\" and subsequent judgments of the High Court and the Privy Council split on this point. In Elliott v Commonwealth,. Evatt J, in his dissenting judgment, rejecting Isaacs, stated: > in relation to sec. 99, the following propositions should be accepted:— > #Sec. 99 forbids four types of preferential legislation, viz., (a) giving > preference to a State over another State; (b) giving preference to a State > over any part of another State; (c) giving preference to any part of a State > over another State; (d) giving preference to any part of a State over any > part of another State. #Sec. 99 forbids laws or regulations which accord > preferential treatment to persons or things as a consequence of local > situation in any part of the six States, regardless of all other > circumstances. #The section is not infringed if the preferential treatment > is a consequence of a number of circumstances, including the circumstance of > locality. #The section operates objectively in the sense that the purpose or > motive of the Legislature or Executive in giving preference by a law of > commerce or revenue is not a relevant question, e.g., it is irrelevant that > the Legislature or Executive desires to facilitate or encourage inter-State > or overseas trade, or to increase revenue. #Sec. 99 may apply although the > legislation or regulations contain no mention of a State eo nomine, e.g., > the section may be infringed if preference is given to part of a State > (e.g., that part of New South Wales which is represented by the port of > Sydney) over another State (e.g., Western Australia) or any part of another > State. #To prove infringement of sec. 99 it is not sufficient to show > discrimination based on mere locality; it must also be shown that, as a > consequence of the discrimination, tangible benefits, advantages, facilities > or immunities are given to persons or corporations. Evatt J's summary was endorsed by the High Court in 2004 in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue, which is the foundation of current jurisprudence concerning the provision. Its rationale was further summarised in 2013 where, in Fortescue Metals Group Limited v Commonwealth,. the Court declared that its objectives were similar to that with respect to the taxation power: > 49\\\\. ... the constraints imposed by ss. 51(ii) and 99 of the Constitution > serve a federal purpose – the economic unity of the Commonwealth and the > formal equality in the Federation of the States inter se and their people. > Those high purposes are not defeated by uniform Commonwealth laws with > respect to taxation or laws of trade, commerce or revenue which have > different effects between one State and another because of their application > to different circumstances or their interactions with different State legal > regimes. Nor are those purposes defeated merely because a Commonwealth law > includes provisions of general application allowing for different outcomes > according to the existence or operation of a particular class of State law. > A criterion for determining whether that category of Commonwealth law > discriminates or gives a preference in the sense used in ss. 51(ii) and 99 > is whether the distinctions it makes are appropriate and adapted to a proper > objective. ==Significant cases== * The Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited v Irving; * R v Barger; * Cameron v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation for Tasmania;. * James v Commonwealth (1928);. * Crowe v Commonwealth;. * Elliott v Commonwealth; * W R Moran Pty Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation;; . * Morgan v Commonwealth;. * Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Clyne;. * Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue; * Fortescue Metals Group Limited v Commonwealth; * Queensland Nickel Pty Limited v Commonwealth of Australia;. ==Further reading== * ==NotesReferences== Category:Australian constitutional law ","title":"Section 99 of the Constitution of Australia"},{"id":"46362961","text":"Helga Slessarev, née Rettig is a scholar of German literature, a specialist in the poetry of Eduard Mörike.

Currently it is published every other year in two volumes by the publisher Walter de Gruyter. The reference work is named after the specialist in German studies Joseph Kürschner. ==History== For more than 130 years Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender has documented the contemporary literary scene. The compendium, constituted in 1879 by Heinrich and Julius Hart, was resumed in 1883 by Joseph Kürschner, who, with strategic and economic foresight, expanded it by introducing a questionnaire for authors, expanded the content from a list of 1260 writers to around 16,000 entries (in the 10th year) and made it a popular and comprehensive reference work. Without any critical judgement, the literary calendar presents living authors of German language fiction – regardless of their citizenship and where they live and work. After Kürschner’s death in 1902 the calendar was continued by numerous editors, among them in the beginning Hermann Hillger, Heinrich Klenz, Gerhard Lüdtke, Erich Neuner or Hans Strodel, in the spirit of its origins. Initially it registered authors of \\"aesthetic“ works as well as \\"educated“, academically active writers. Due to the abundance of material, Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender was published as a separate work from 1925 and soon outreached the extent of its older counterpart. During the National Socialist regime the editor had to bow to the requirement of publishing only entries about members of the Reichsschrifttumkammer (Reich literature chamber). However, in 1936 he managed to publish the Necrology 1901-1935 listing the authors that had died since 1900 and their works; thus also he could be accused of publishing \\"unwanted writings“.Kürschners Deutscher Literatur- Kalender. In: Werner Schuder: Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender. Nekrolog 1936-1970., Walter de Gruyter, 1973, Vorwort In 1949 the work was again published according to the original editorial principles. The editor Werner Schuder was responsible for the years from 1958 up to the 1980s. After not being published for a while, its publisher changed in 1998: librarian and copy editor Andreas Klimt accepted the challenge of updating and continuing the reference work for the publishing house K. G. Saur Verlag in Leipzig with the 61st edition. The publishing house Walter de Gruyter took over K. G. Saur Verlag, so Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender is published again by its original publisher since the 67th edition of 2010/2011. The 71th edition of Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender contains, in addition to entries on ca. 12,000 writers, over 800 literary translators, over 1000 publishers, over 500 literary awards with awardees, more than 600 professional unions and literary associations, houses of literature, about 300 literary magazines and periodicals as well as literary agencies, cultural departments of radio and television channels and literary feuilletons. Articles on the individual authors in alphabetical order provide information about addresses, biographical data, memberships in professional unions and literary associations, literary awards and about the writers‘ publications. The latest version of the work in two volumes was published in September 2018. ==Reception== \\"When the specialist in German studies, magazine editor and theatre critic Joseph Kürschner, a very ambitious personality, took over the Literaturkalender from its founders Heinrich and Julius Hart in its fifth year in 1883, it was a slim duodecimo book without any economical success. Kürschner introduced the distribution of questionnaires for authors and made the calendar a register, being listed in which became very popular. The number of 1260 names in the fourth year had gone up to 16,000 in the tenth. The venture prospered, and after Kürschner’s death successors were easily found who continued it in the spirit of its beginnings. That means: banning literary criticism, extreme value freedom, documentation of the facts of literary life.“Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender in Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 21. Dezember 2010 – Joachim Güntner - Neue Zürcher Zeitung: \\"A monument made of facts – Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender has always been striving for completeness.\\" \\"Once Roda Roda was challenged by friends: he might be able to achieve many things, but not one in particular. Never ever would he be first in Kürschner. The year ended, the new Kürschner was published, and it started with: Aaba, see Roda Roda. (In which the considerate double A is especially nice: so really nothing bad can happen.)

His father was Rector (headmaster) of St John’s Grammar School and had founded Gilbertfield House School, both in Hamilton. His mother came from a Glasgow mercantile family and was a niece of the social activist John Murray.George Haynes, Dictionary of National Biography, 1961-1970 (Oxford University Press, 1981), p. 4. Educated at St John’s (where he was School Dux in 1891), Adams proceeded to Glasgow University with a Dundonald Bursary in Philosophy.\\"St John’s Grammar School Centenary 1836-1936\\" (The Hamilton Advertiser, 1936). Adams’s sister Annie had been Girl Dux in 1884; she was a linguist (LLA, St Andrews) whose translations of Fournier’s Napoleon I: A Biography (1911) and Erich Brandenburg’s From Bismarck to the World War, 1870-1914 (1927) have not been superseded. At Glasgow he was Blackstone medallist in Latin and Sandford scholar in Greek and obtained a first-class degree in Classics (1897). He afterwards went up to Balliol College, Oxford, with a Snell Exhibition, and gained Firsts in Greats (1900) and Modern History (1901), taking political philosophy and political economy as his special subjects. He was president of the Arnold Society and rowed for his college.The Scotsman, 14 November 1938; Balliol College Register 1900-1950 (Oxford University Press, 1953); Haynes, Dictionary of National Biography, 1961-1970 (Oxford University Press, 1981), p. 4. ==Early career and Irish appointment== Following a year as a tutor at Borough Road Teacher Training College, Isleworth, Adams briefly lectured on Finance and Colonial Policy in the University of Chicago’s Department of Political Economy (1902) and afterwards spent three months in the United States and Canada studying the work of governmental and educational institutions. Returning to Britain in 1903, he became Lecturer in Economics at Victoria University of Manchester, where he was also secretary of the university’s educational outreach initiative.Oxford Times, 12 February 1910; Brian Harrison, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004). In 1904 he accepted Sir Horace Plunkett’s offer of the position of Head of Statistics and Intelligence at the Irish Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, of which Plunkett had charge.Margaret Digby, Horace Plunkett, An Anglo-American Irishman (Basil Blackwell, 1949), p. 96; Haynes, Dictionary of National Biography, 1961-1970. He remained in post for five years, obtaining close insight into both the workings of the civil service and matters of central and local government administration and becoming both the “right-hand man”A. V. Dicey, \\"The Extension of Law Teaching at Oxford\\", Harvard Law Review, Vol. XXIV, No.1 (November 1910), p.4. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1324642?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents] and close personal friend of Plunkett, who inspired in him a lifelong concern for rural welfare.Adams considered Plunkett “the greatest man” he had ever met (Adams’s Introduction, p. xii, to Margaret Digby’s Horace Plunkett, An Anglo- American Irishman). Plunkett considered he had “no truer friend than Adams”; on learning Adams might leave his Department, he recorded it as “a great loss to Ireland and me”: diary entries, 8 April 1929 and 10 January 1910 (Sir Horace Plunkett Papers, National Library of Ireland, MS. 42,222/49 and /30). The annual reports Adams issued while in Ireland were “more than mere statistical tables ... each was a valuable economic treatise on the trade of the country”,Irish Independent, 31 October 1910. and in 1909 it was suggested that his work on the Irish economy during the previous five years “has done more to stimulate practical patriotism than all the political speeches of the last decade”.Irish Times, 12 June 1909. In 1911 he was appointed to the Irish Financial Committee, which was established, under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Primrose, to examine financial relations between Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom and to consider how revenues should be allocated in the event of Ireland being granted home rule.Daily Telegraph, 8 April 1917. Adams’s belief that a federalist approach was key to resolving the Irish Question was reflected in the Committee’s recommendation that a future Irish Government should have full control over Irish revenues, but Asquith’s administration declined to adopt this approach in the Third Home Rule Bill.Patricia Jalland, \\"Irish Home-Rule Finance, A Neglected Dimension of the Irish Question, 1910-1914\\", in Reactions to Irish Nationalism 1865-1914, ed. Alan O’Day (Bloomsbury, 1987), pp.2 98-308. ==Political science at Oxford, 1910-18== By the time of his membership of the Primrose Committee, Adams had resumed an academic career. The Oxford University Endowment Fund had financed a three-years Lectureship in Political Theory and Institutions to which Adams was appointed in early 1910.Yorkshire Post, 7 February 1910. The Warden of All Souls College, Sir William Anson, intervened to procure conversion of the Lecturership into a Chichele Readership further endowed by a Fellowship of All Souls, to which Adams was elected on 15 June 1911. It has been suggested that Anson knew little about Adams and wrongly assumed his appointment would serve the Unionist cause in Ireland, but the selection was generally well-received and Adams proved an able lecturer and effective organiser.Green, \\"Warden Anson, All Souls College, and the Curious Creation of the Gladstone Chair of Political Theory and Institutions at Oxford\\". Dicey thought Adams was “as well acquainted with the law and the practice of what one may call administration as any man who could have been appointed... In none of the many places he has occupied has he disappointed those who relied on his energy and talent”, while the Oxford Magazine of 28 November 1912 appreciated his “knowledge, personality and zeal”. A. L. Smith considered “For the union of thinking power with practicality there is no-one in Oxford to come near him” (letter, Smith to Thomas Jones, January 1917), while George Parkin reported it as “the universal view at Oxford that he is our best man - one of the best men in Britain” (quoted by Frederick W. Gibson in Queen’s University: Vol. II, 1917-1961, McGill-Queen’s Press, 1983, p. 14). In 1912 his Readership was, with the benefit of further endowment by the Committee for a National Memorial to W. E. Gladstone, upgraded to the Gladstone Professorship of Political Theory and Institutions, and Adams became a member of the University’s Hebdomadal Council.The Times, 11 December 1912; Norman Chester, Economics, Politics and Social Studies in Oxford, 1900-85 (Macmillan, 1986), p. 16; Who Was Who, 1961-1970. “Few men - before or since - can have risen so quickly up Oxford’s academic ladder subsequent to so little exertion on their part” - Green, \\"Warden Anson, All Souls College, and the Curious Creation of the Gladstone Chair of Political Theory and Institutions at Oxford\\", p. 61. Adams took a leading role in rationalising Oxford’s research and teaching facilities for social and political sciences, first as Secretary of the Association to Advance the Study of Social and Political SubjectsGreen, \\"Warden Anson, All Souls College, and the Curious Creation of the Gladstone Chair of Political Theory and Institutions at Oxford\\", p. 61. and then as a promoter of the Barnett House initiative. In 1913 he, Sidney Ball and A. L. Smith agreed to buy a house in central Oxford in order “to make it a centre of social economic studies and interests with a good specialist library” and to be named after Samuel Augustus Barnett.George Smith, Elizabeth Peretz and Teresa Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House (University of Oxford Department of Social Policy and Intervention, 2014), p. 307. Barnett House was formally opened on 6 June 1914, when Horace Plunkett, who was visiting Adams, spoke on the need for research into rural matters.Letter, Adams to Plunkett, 2 December 1913, Sir Horace Plunkett Papers (Correspondence), National Library of Ireland, MS49,803/2. The original idea for Barnett House came from Rev. (later Bishop) George Bell, Adams taking it up enthusiastically and involving Sidney Ball and others in progressing it: Helena Deneke, Grace Hadow (OUP, 1946), pp. 88-89. Besides becoming an important resource for the University, the House provided a range of services to Oxfordshire’s rural communities, including circulating books to schools and village halls in outlying districts. The paucity of access to books across the nation’s rural communities was highlighted in the comprehensive survey of public library provision which the Carnegie Foundation’s UK Trustees had engaged Adams to undertake in 1913.The Scotsman, 23 December 1913. His Report, published by the Trustees in 1915, argued that such provision should be part of an overall State system and that its administration and funding at county rather than borough level could correct the imbalance between urban and rural facilities.The English Public Library 1850-1939, p. 3 ; H. E. Bracey, English Rural Life: Village Activities, Organizations and Institutions (Routledge, 2013), p. 194; W. H. G. Armytage, Four Hundred Years of English Education (CUP, 1970), p. 224; Alice Evans, A History of Children’s Reading and Literature (Elsevier, 2014), p. 142. The Adams Report has been described as “of outstanding importance”,Henry Adolphus Mess, writing in 1948, Voluntary Social Services Since 1918 (Taylor and Francis, 1998), p. 173. resulting in fundamental change to the Carnegie Trustees’ library policyThomas Kelly, A History of Public Libraries in Great Britain, 1845-1975 (The Library Association, 1977), pp. 118, 211 ff. . and paving the way for the Public Libraries Act of 1919, the evolution of the County Library Scheme, the creation of the Central Library for Students (later the National Central Library), which became a clearing house for interlibrary loans, and developments such as university education for librarians.Kathleen M. Heim, Library Co-operation in Great Britain 1915-1972 (US Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1976, pp. 4-5 ; Anne Welsh, The Education of Librarians in the UK , pp. 47, 53-54; and see Wayne A. Wiegand and Donald J. Davis, Encyclopedia of Library History (Routledge, 2015), p. 370. The legislation of 1919 also reflected the deliberations of the Education Reviewing Committee (established as a sub-committee of the National Reconstruction Committee), of which Adams was Chairman from 1917: Geoffrey Sherington, Education, Social Change and the War, 1911-20 (Manchester University Press, 1987), p. 92; Alistair Black, Simon Pepper, Kaye Bagshaw, Books, Buildings and Social Engineering: Early Public Libraries in Britain from Past to Present (Routledge, 2017), p.40. In May 1915 Adams successfully proposed to the Hebdomadal Council that a committee be appointed to evaluate establishing an Oxford degree course in Political Economy, Political Science and Public Law. The committee (of which he was a member) recommended the institution of such a course for post-graduate study leading to a degree in Civil Science. The recommendation was accepted and the committee prepared an enabling statuteChester, Economics, Politics and Social Studies in Oxford, 1900-85, pp. 24-26. but further progress languished under wartime constraints. ==The Political Quarterly== During 1913 Adams made arrangements with the Oxford University Press for publication of a quarterly journal “devoted to every branch of political science, from the reviewing of its literature to the criticism of current affairs”.Pall Mall Gazette, 2 January 1914. The first issue of the Political Quarterly appeared in February 1914, many copies from its print-run of 3,000 being sent to North America.Letter, Adams to Plunkett, 2 December 1913. Seven further issues followed, with substantial editorials by Adams and articles by Arnold Toynbee, Lewis Namier, Arthur Greenwood, R. H. Tawney and Ernest Barker, before publication was suspended at the end of 1916 owing to war “service in the field or at home”.Editorial prefatory note, The Political Quarterly, No. 8, Summer 1916. The Political Quarterly did not appear again until the title was revived in 1930 by a group including Leonard Woolf, J. M. Keynes and Harold Laski.Harrison, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, p. 279. Adams himself served at the Ministry of Munitions from early 1915 and in July was given charge of its Badges Section, determining the categories of tradesmen whose continued civilian employment was essential to the war effort and qualified them for “On War Service” status.History of the Ministry of Munitions, Vol. II (HMSO, 1922), p. 116. Adams was Chairman of the Committee that laid out the foundations for production of the History: Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, p. 21. He became an adviser to the Council for the Study of International Relations,Middlesex Chronicle, 6 March 1915. and in 1915 was appointed to the Treasury Committee which reviewed the scheme of examination for Class I of the Home Civil Service.P. J. Hartog, Examinations And Their Relation To Culture and Efficiency (Read Books, 2013), Note A. ==Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, 1917-18== While at the Ministry of Munitions, Adams was known to David Lloyd George, the Munitions Minister. But it was at the recommendation of Thomas Jones, reinforced by David Davies, that Lloyd George, on becoming Prime Minister in 1916, appointed Adams to be his Principal Secretary.Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, p. 19; Thomas Jones, Whitehall Diary, Vol. I, 1916/1925 (Oxford University Press, 1969), p. 17. The Prime Minister’s Secretariat, popularly known as Downing Street’s “Garden Suburb”, was formed to assist Lloyd George discharge his overall responsibilities within the constraints of the war cabinet system: its function was to maintain contact with the numerous departments of government, to collect information, and to report on matters of special concern.Andrew Blick and George Jones, A Century of Policy Advice at No.10, Part I. Official UK government history of policy advice. As Principal Secretary, Adams – together with the Secretariat’s other leading member, Philip Kerr – determined its organisation and the allocation of work among the other secretaries (who included David Davies, Joseph Davies, Waldorf Astor and, later, Cecil Harmsworth). Adams himself was responsible for covering Treasury, Home Office, Local Government, Education, Food, Agriculture and Labour Affairs,Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, pp. 19-20, 29. initially concentrating on Labour and Food issues. He promoted measures to regenerate agriculture and increase national crop production, conceiving and organising the Fertilisers Committee and involving himself with tractor supply. He challenged Food Ministry policy on sugar imports and influenced both the text and the practical application of the Corn Production Act 1917.Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, p. 51. He attended and spoke at War Cabinet meetings.Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, pp. 50, 109. He was also a member of the Reconstruction Committee (set up to address issues expected to arise in the aftermath of war) and served as chairman of its education panel, which began to formulate plans for raising of school leaving age that were more ambitious than those proposed by the Ministry of Education.Sherington, Education, Social Change and the War, 1911-20, pp. 92, 104. The Ministry prevailed, and the Education Act 1920 raised the leaving age to 14; Adams continued to advocate a leaving age of at least age 15 and, as a member of the influential School Age Council, he summed up the Council’s case in support of this increase in a long-awaited but unproductive meeting with Prime Minister Ramsey Macdonald in February 1935 (Derek Gillard, Education in England: a History, Chapter 8, 2018 ). From early 1917 he increasingly worked on the Irish Question and played a key role in arranging the Irish Convention that sat from July 1917 to April 1928 with Horace Plunkett as Chairman.Birmingham Daily Post, 12 June 1917; Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, p. 100; Brendan O’Leary, A Treatise on Northern Ireland, Volume 1: Colonialism (Oxford University Press, 2019), p. 330. Personal relationships with prominent figures in Irish public life enabled him both to explore and to influence opinion in a way conducive to the Convention’s progress.Turner notes (Lloyd George's Secretariat, p. 93) that T. P. Gill had been Adams’s colleague in the Department of Agriculture (the pair attended the International Agricultural Conference in Rome in December 1909). Other examples are his relationships with fellow delegates to the Convention such as George Russell, well-known to Adams on account of his service with Plunkett’s Irish Agricultural Organisation; Stephen Gwynn, a relative of Adams’s wife; and Bishop Denis Kelly of Ross, who had been a fellow member of the Primrose Committee. His correspondence with Plunkett became the principal line of communication between the United Kingdom Government and the Convention and, from December 1917 onwards, he orchestrated government policy in an attempt to avoid the Convention’s collapse.Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, pp. 85, 122. In October 1917 Plunkett suggested that Adams should be appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland in place of Henry Duke: Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, p.117. His was the principal hand in drafting the Government’s proposals accepted by a majority (but an inadequate majority) of the Convention in April 1918 and, after the Convention initiative was spent, he played a major part in preparation of a new Home Rule Bill.Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, pp. 116, 120. Together with Kerr he edited the War Cabinet Reports of 1917 and 1918, but, with the coming of peace, the Prime Minister’s Secretariat, in which his work was unremunerated, was disbanded.Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, pp. 169-172; Chester Chronicle, 4 August 1917. Adams had recommended that his Secretariat should be merged with the War Cabinet Secretariat and, as a Prime Minister’s Department, become a permanent part of central government (Proposed Statement by Professor Adams, 7 March 1918: Lloyd George Papers, Parliamentary Archives, LG/F/74/10/4). The recommendation seems to have found initial favour with Lord Haldane’s Committee on the Machinery of Government but to have been overcome by opposition from Maurice Hankey (Andrew Blick and George Jones, At Power’s Elbow, Biteback Publishing, 2013, at pp. 139-140; John F. Naylor, A Man and an Institution: Sir Maurice Hankey, the Cabinet Secretariat and the Custody of Cabinet Secrecy, CUP, 1984, pp. 62-63). Adams refused both a knighthoodPlunkett Papers, diary entry 23 June 1918 (MS42,222/38). And see A. L. Rowse, All Souls In My Time (Duckworth, 1993), p. 125: “Adams would not accept any recognition of his lifelong public work. He turned down knighthoods (sic): in the end Mrs Adams had to make him accept a C.H.” and, after some hesitation, a Coalition Coupon in the General Election of 1918.Turner, Lloyd George's Secretariat, p. 196. ==Political Science at Oxford, 1919-33== The scheme for a School of Civil Science, still in abeyance when Adams resumed peacetime lecturing at Oxford, encountered competition in the form of a proposal to establish an Honour School of Modern Humanities, in which philosophy would be the dominant element. This provoked a competing proposal for an Honour School of Economic and Political Science.Chester, Economics, Politics and Social Studies in Oxford, 1900-85, pp. 31-33; Julia Stapleton, Englishness and the Study of Politics. The Social and Political Thought of Ernest Barker (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 64-65. Various committees debated and developed the several proposals, Adams “fighting hard and successfully for the ‘equipollence’ of politics with the other live subjects”.Chester, Economics, Politics and Social Studies in Oxford, 1900-85, pp. 33ff.; The Times, 1 February 1966 (obituary notice, first draft by Thomas Jones). He sat on both the Civil Science and Political Science CommitteesChester, Economics, Politics and Social Studies in Oxford, 1900-85, p.190. and also on the Civil Science and Modern Humanities Joint-Committee. In the Joint-Committee he ultimately made common cause with A. D. Lindsay, the philosophers’ main spokesman, to finalise the scheme for an Honour School of Philosophy, Politics and Economics which was eventually approved by the University in Convocation in November 1920.Drusilla Scott, A. D. Lindsay, A Biography (Basil Blackwell, 1971), p. 50; Chester, Economics, Politics and Social Studies in Oxford, 1900-85, p. 38; Warren Young and Frederic S. Lee, Oxford Economics and Oxford Economists (Springer, 1993), pp. 9-11. Adams was initially influential in arguing that economics was a discipline best studied in conjunction with philosophy and history, urging the point in Convocation in 1920, but by the later 1920s economic theory had displaced political economy in the teaching of economics at Oxford (Young and Lee, pp. 15-16). He was a member of the PPE Board of Studies from its outset and of the group that reviewed the school’s governing statute in 1929-30.Smith, Peretz and Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House, p. 54; Chester, Economics, Politics and Social Studies in Oxford, 1900-85, p.41. The review ultimately led to introduction, within the politics segment of the school’s examination, of compulsory papers on Political Institutions and British Political and Constitutional HistoryChester, Economics, Politics and Social Studies in Oxford, 1900-85, p. 44. and the numbers attending Adams’s “carefully prepared and lucid” lectures grew accordingly.Green, \\"Warden Anson, All Souls College, and the Curious Creation of the Gladstone Chair of Political Theory and Institutions at Oxford\\", p. 63; Harrison, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, p. 279. Prior to the creation of the PPE School, Adams’s lectures were largely attended by undergraduates reading Greats or Modern History. Christopher Morley’s notes of lectures given by Adams in 1910-12 on European Governments and Parties since 1895 and The Principles of Political Science are preserved among the Morley family papers (Coll.807) at Haverford College, Pennsylvania. In 1919 he had been offered the position of Director of the London School of Economics, coupled with its Chair of Political Science, but declined. Somewhat earlier he had refused the post of Principal of Queen’s University, Belfast.Ralf Dahrendorf, LSE: A History of the London School of Economics and Political Science 1895-1995 (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 138; Gibson, Queen’s University: Vol. II, 1917-1961. In 1919-22 he was a member of the Royal Commission on Oxford and Cambridge Universities, considering state funding issues.The Scotsman, 17 November 1917; Brian Harrison, History of the University of Oxford, Vol.III: The Twentieth Century (Clarendon Press, 1994), p. 33. In 1923 he succeeded Sidney Webb as a Commissioner under the Development Acts, continuing as such until 1949.Smith, Peretz and Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House, p. 43. He was also a member of the Rural Industries Intelligence Bureau, set up by the Commission to help craftspeople share information. In 1922-24 he was one of the three-member Agricultural Tribunal of Investigation set up to consider improved farming practices adopted by foreign governments during the previous fifty years,Yorkshire Post, 30 December 1922. Adams was already relatively knowledgeable on foreign developments; during his time at the Irish Department, he had spent ten months in France and Germany studying agricultural practices there (Green, \\"Warden Anson, All Souls College, and the Curious Creation of the Gladstone Chair of Political Theory and Institutions at Oxford\\", p. 58). The Tribunal’s Final Report was published in 1924 and made numerous recommendations (few of which were given effect by successive governments) and led to the Conference upon Agricultural Co-operation in the British Empire, which was held during the Wembley Exhibition and adopted the general principles of an agricultural policy for the Empire (Plunkett, The Spectator, 4 April 1931). and in 1924 he was in large measure responsible for the establishment of the Institute of Agricultural Engineering at Oxford with financial assistance from the Development Commission.Lincolnshire Echo, 6 February 1924. In 1926-28 he was a member of the Joint-Committee of Enquiry established by the BBC and British Institution of Adult Education that produced the New Ventures in Broadcasting Report, leading to formation of the Central Council for Broadcast Adult Education and launch of The Listener magazine.New Ventures in Broadcasting, A Study in Adult Education, BBC, 1928, p. 91; Glasgow Herald, 9 April 1928; Sunderland Echo, 21 July 1933. He gave ten Stevenson Lectures on Citizenship at Glasgow in 1923-4, and lectured at the Lowell Institute, Harvard, in 1924, and at McGill University, Montreal, in 1933.Northern Whig, 23 March 1931. He chaired the British Group which attended the Institute of Pacific Relations Conference in Hangzhou and Shanghai in 1931 and he lectured at eleven universities in China and Hong Kong during the course of that year.See p. 5320 of Part I of the Congressional Hearings investigating conduct of the Institute of Pacific Relations, 1952; Report of Professor Adams on Lectures Given in China under the Auspices of the Universities’ China Committee (printed for circulation). He was involved in the arrangements whereby Oxford University introduced the tutorial system into Chinese education.George E. Taylor, Present at a Revolution: A Personal Account of 1930s China, pp. 132-3. He became Chairman of the Universities’ China Committee in 1942, and was made a member of the Order of the Brilliant Star.Smith, Peretz and Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House, p. 307; Who’s Who, 1938 (A. & C. Black, 1938). In 1933 he was elected Warden of All Souls College and retired from the Gladstone Chair.Yorkshire Post, 5 June 1933 ==Voluntary Service and Rural Communities== In 1920 Adams became Chairman of the National Council of Social Services.Justin Davis Smith, 100 Years of NCVO and Voluntary Action (Palgrave Macmillan, 2019), pp. 21, 34. Instrumental in its foundation a few months earlier,Simon David Adderley, \\"Bureaucratic Conceptions of Citizenship in the Voluntary Sector (1919-1939): The Case of the National Council of Social Service\\", PhD thesis, University of Wales, Bangor, pp. 61ff. he was “the man who was to shape its destiny for over thirty years”.Margaret Brasnett, Voluntary Service Action: A History of the National Council of Social Service 1919-69 (NCSS, 1969), p. 17. The National Council’s objective was to co- ordinate the welfare activities of voluntary organisations and central and municipal government, seeking also to foster the formation of local Social Service Councils as necessary to streamline co-operation “on the ground”.By 1939 there were estimated to be Councils of Social Service in some 120 towns: J. Davis Smith, 100 Years of NCVO and Voluntary Action, p. 88. Adams’s belief that voluntary action was core to the development of good citizenship and democracy was reflected in his address to the NCSS’s first national conference when he told the 400 delegatesJ. Davis Smith, 100 Years of NCVO and Voluntary Action, p. 34. Local government representatives included the Mayor of Stepney, Clement Attlee.: “The good done by the State must depend upon the voluntary spirit behind it... Local and central authorities are well suited for carrying out certain functions but it is the voluntary spirit which must move them”.Smith, Peretz and Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House, p. 43. Government came to look on the NCSS as an important partner in welfare work: in 1932, at the request of the Ministry of Labour, the National Council assumed responsibility for some 1,500 occupational clubs for the unemployed, and as the Second World War approached it agreed to create and resource a national network of Citizens’ Advice Bureaux.National Council of Social Service, Unemployment and Community Service, 1936; Adderley, \\"Bureaucratic Conceptions of Citizenship in the Voluntary Sector (1919-1939): The Case of the National Council of Social Service\\", p. 199. 200 Bureaux were set up in September 1939; 900 existed by the end of 1940: J. Davis Smith, 100 Years of NCVO and Voluntary Action, p. 80. In 1940 Adams was appointed to the Government’s Advisory Committee on maximising voluntary co-operation in tackling social problems arising from the war.The Scotsman, 28 February 1940. He remained NCSS Chairman until 1949, acknowledged as “the central figure of the exceptional men and women” who directed its affairs.George Haynes, Social Service Quarterly, Vol. XXXIX, No. 4, Spring 1966, p. 136, naming the exceptional others as A. D. Lindsay, Edward Peacock, Ernest Barker, R. C. Norman, Wyndham Deedes and Margaret Bondfield. In parallel with his NCSS work, Adams pioneered the creation and growth of Rural Community Councils. He recruited Grace Hadow, with whom he had worked at the Munitions Ministry, to become Secretary of Barnett House.Smith, Peretz and Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House, p. 45; Deneke, Grace Hadow, p. 91. The two shared a vision of a “new rural civilization” based on co-operative principlesJeremy Burchardt, \\"'A new rural civilisation': village halls, community and citizenship in the 1920s\\" in The English Countryside between the Wars: Regeneration or Decline? Ed. Paul Brassly, Lynne Thompson and Jeremy Burchardt (Boydell Press, 2006), p. 30. and in 1920 the Council of Barnett House approved Adams’s scheme whereby the resources of the House would be made available to villages within 30 miles of Oxford.Deneke, Grace Hadow, pp. 90-91. Forging links with the YMCA, the Workers’ Educational Association, the Women’s Institute and other voluntary bodies, Barnett House arranged for the villages to receive visiting lecturers, circulating libraries, information on social and economic issues, and assistance in applying for financial grants. The agencies participating in this endeavour were represented on a committee that became known as the Oxfordshire Rural Community Council,Smith, Peretz and Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House, p. 50. Adams serving as Chairman of its Executive Committee from 1925 until 1950.Banbury Guardian, 9 November 1950. He regarded the Oxfordshire scheme as a pilot exercise which, if successful, should be adopted nationwide - and so it was. By 1942, NCSS initiatives had resulted in the formation of twenty-four more Rural Community Councils covering twenty-nine counties in England and Wales.Christopher Bailey, \\"Rural industries and the image of the countryside\\" in The English Countryside between the Wars: Regeneration or Decline?, p. 144. With the aid of grants and loans from the Plunkett Foundation, the Carnegie UK Trust and the Development Fund, the RCCs facilitated schemes that provided village halls, playing fields, allotments and other amenities.Smith, Peretz and Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House, p. 46. In 1938 Adams could report that 449 schemes had resulted in halls being built in 406 villages (Daily Herald, 2 July 1938). Adams’s positions as a trustee of both the Plunkett and Carnegie organisationsDigby, Horace Plunkett, An Anglo-American Irishman pp. 257-258; J. Davis Smith, 100 Years of NCVO and Voluntary Action, pp. 36, 272. Adams remained a trustee of the Plunkett Foundation until May 1956, when he was elected a Life Member of the Foundation. and as a Development Commissioner helped streamline the funding process. By 1939 the RCCs had become “integral to organised social life in England” and were to have “some impact on parts of the Empire”.Burchardt, \\"'A new rural civilisation': village halls, community and citizenship in the 1920s\\" in The English Countryside between the Wars: Regeneration or Decline?, p. 30; Smith, Peretz and Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House, pp. 44, 48-49. The human and material resources of Barnett House were indispensable to the early phase of the rural communities project and the importance of the several interdependent strands of activity based there was recognised by a visit from Queen Mary during her tour of Oxford in 1921. Adams was President of Barnett House from 1929 to 1946.Smith, Peretz and Smith, p. 41. In 1919 Adams had applied funds from the newly-formed Horace Plunkett Foundation to establish a lectureship in rural sociology at Barnett House: Plunkett Papers, diary entries 2 April and at year-end 1919 (MS42,222/38). In 1929 the Ministry of Agriculture asked the NCSS and the Carnegie Trustees to organise a voluntary, self-governing association to which local clubs already formed by young farmers could affiliate and which would have both a social and an educational agenda. In response the Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs of England and Wales was formed in 1932 with Adams as Chairman. Under his guidance the Federation’s wider mission became “to build up the rural community... to train young people to come forward as leaders, to train them not only in business methods but in team work and co-operation”.Alice Kirke, \\"Education in Interwar Rural England: Community, Schooling, and Voluntarism\\" (PhD Thesis, UCL Institute of Education, 2016) pp. 149-150. In 1942 Adams was able to announce that there were 600 Young Farmers’ Clubs, up from 150 in 1932 (Yorkshire Post, 10 December 1932; Nottingham Journal, 4 July 1942). He continued as Federation Chairman until 1946, taking a close interest in the movement and being described in 1943 as “the great ‘protector’” of the clubs.Rowse, All Souls In My Time, p. 109; Western Mail, 24 April 1943. Haynes, referring to Adams’s work for the NFYFC, says he “found great joy in working with young people” (Social Service Quarterly, p. 136). Adams became a Vice-President of the Boys’ Brigade in 1939 (Acton Gazette, 20 January 1939). ==Warden of All Souls, 1933-45== Having promised, on joining the College, to be “a worthy son of All Souls”,Green, \\"Warden Anson, All Souls College, and the Curious Creation of the Gladstone Chair of Political Theory and Institutions at Oxford\\", p. 63. Adams presided over celebration of the College’s quincentenary in 1938. In A. L. Rowse's judgement, “He made a good Warden, and was moreover a dear man, apt to be right”, while Arthur Salter recalled that the College “welcomed his practical hold on the reality of every issue of policy with which we were confronted”.Rowse, All Souls In My Time, p. 109; Salter, 19 March 1966, Memorial Addresses of All Souls College, Oxford (Leopard’s Head Press for All Souls, 1989), p. 66. He recruited for All Souls’ Fellowships a succession of significant figures in the academic world, from H. D. Henderson in 1934Thomas Jones, A Diary with Letters, 1931-1940 (Oxford University Press, 1954), pp. 116, 126. to G. D. H. Cole in 1944.Rowse, All Souls In My Time, p. 137. In the 1930s he took up the cases of academic refugees from Germany and Austria with the result that several were able to progress to distinguished careers from specially created Chichele lectureships at All Souls.They included Jacob Marschak, Ernst Cassirer and Frederick Hertz: Sally Crawford, Katharina Ulmschneider and Jar Elsner, Ark of Civilization: Refugee Scholars and Oxford University, 1930-45 (Oxford University Press, 2017), p. 5; Paul Weindling, Forced Migration and Scientific Change: Emigre German-speaking Scientists and Scholars after 1933, ed.

Among those he helped was Max Grünhut, and in 1942-43 the two worked together on a survey of the social and educational consequences of wartime evacuation of children to Oxford.Published as London Children in War-time Oxford: A survey of social and educational results of evacuation, by a Barnett House Study Group (Geoffrey Cumberledge, Oxford University Press). For Adams’s assistance to Grünhut in 1939 see Elizabeth Peretz, \\"Looking Back: Max Grünhut\\". During his time as Warden, Adams’s influence contributed to a doubling of All Souls’ agricultural estate.John Davis, A History of Oxford Anthropology, ed. Peter Rivière (Berghahn Books, 2009), p. 81. From 1937, Adams sat on the British Hanseatic Scholarships advisory committeeYorkshire Post, 1 August 1938. and was a member of the Nuffield College Committee appointed to progress creation of the physical and academic fabric of the college endowed by Lord Nuffield’s Benefaction.Chester, Economics, Politics and Social Studies in Oxford, 1900-85, p. 83. In the war years he organised a series of social reform conferencesHarold L. Smith, War and Social Change: British Society in the Second World War (Manchester University Press, 1990), p. 237; Robert Mackay, The Test of War: Inside Britain 1939-45 (Routledge, 2003), p. 59. and joined the committee, formed as part of the Nuffield College Social Reconstruction Survey, considering the post-war role of statutory and voluntary social services.J. Davis Smith, 100 Years of NCVO and Voluntary Action, p. 91. A report on the work of the sub-committee, Voluntary Social Services: Their Place in the Modern State, ed. A. Bourdillon (Methuen & Co.), was published in 1945. From 1941 onwards he convened what became known as the “All Souls Group”, a gathering of specialists in the field of education who met (initially at All Souls) to discuss the administrative, philosophical and social aspects of education. The Group met every three to four months, inviting guests such as R. A. Butler, and its deliberations have been said to help shape wartime and postwar educational decisions. It has continued to meet into the present century.Elizabeth Sunderman, For God and Country: Butler’s 1944 Education Act (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016), p. 120; William Taylor, In History and in Education, ed. Richard Aldrich (Routledge, 2014), p. 180. Members of the Group included Robert Birley, John Newsom, Eric James, John Maud and John Wolfenden. Adams was still listed as a member in 1959: Clive Whitehead, Colonial Educators: The British Indian and Colonial Education Service 1858-1983 (I. B. Tauris, 2003), p. 201. During the 1930s Adams was a member of the national Market Supply Committee, which reviewed the distribution and prices of agricultural products,Aberdeen Press and Journal, 27 October 1933. and of the Overseas Settlement Board, which co-ordinated support for emigrants to the British Dominions and colonies.Western Daily Press, 26 February 1936. He chaired the Imperial Conference on Co-operative Farming held at Glasgow in 1938,The Scotsman, 19 July 1938. in which year the University of Glasgow made him an Honorary Doctor of Laws.The Scotsman, 14 November 1938. He was made an Honorary Doctor of Civil Law by Oxford in the following year and an Honorary Doctor of Laws by Manchester in 1943.The Tatler, 28 June 1939; Glasgow Herald, 25 February 1943. He was a Pro-Vice Chancellor at Oxford from 1939 until 1945, when he retired as Warden of All Souls and was elected an Honorary Fellow of the College.The Times, 14 March 1946. He was President of the Classical Society of Scotland in 1946.The Scotsman, 4 and 9 December 1943. In 1949 he gave a series of lectures as a Visiting Professor in the Graduate School of History at the University of Toronto, and in 1953 he made a three-month speaking and fact-finding tour of South Africa sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation of New York.Who’s Who, 1959 (A. & C. Black, 1959). He was made a Companion of Honour in the 1936 Birthday Honours. ==Preservation of Oxford’s Rural Hinterland== As early as 1918, Adams mooted the formation of a trust to acquire an area of four square miles adjacent to Oxford, including the distinctive landmark of Cumnor Hurst, and to farm it on co-operative principles while making its fir-crowned summit a permanent memorial to Oxford men who had fallen in war.Plunkett Papers (Correspondence): Adams to Plunkett, 2 July 1918, MS49, 803/2. With the support of a group of friends he was able to realise a more modest version of this scheme in 1920, bringing some 700 acres east of Cumnor Hurst into the ownership of a preservation trust.Haynes, Dictionary of National Biography, 1961-1970, p. 5. He was later very active in the affairs of the Oxford Preservation Trust, of which he was a foundation trustee in 1927.Harrison, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, p. 279. ==Personal life== In 1908 Adams married Muriel Lane, a former Irish women’s hockey international, who came from an old Anglo-Irish family with connections that crossed some of the fault-lines of Irish society.Londonderry Sentinel, 19 September 1908; Belfast News-Letter, 8 June 1933. Their son was born in 1910, and from 1920 the family lived on Boars Hill, where Adams was “a practical hog and wheat raiser” at his farm of Powder Hill, bordering on Matthew Arnold’s “Signal Elm”.Haynes, Dictionary of National Biography, 1961-1970, p. 5; The Official Record, United States Department of Agriculture, Vol. 14, No. 19, 19 May 1925, p. 5. Horace Plunkett liked to stay with the Adams family in this haven for professors and poets “with Sir William Beveridge as fellow guest. Gilbert Murray or John Masefield would call, and Robert Bridges would come round at night, carrying a lantern”.Digby, Horace Plunkett, An Anglo-American Irishman, p. 258. On leaving Powder Hill, Adams made the property over to All Souls to provide additional accommodation for Fellows of the college.Dorothy Hodgkin lived there from 1951 to 1957; it was during this period that she made the discovery for which she later received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry: Georgina Ferry, Dorothy Hodgkin, A Life (Bloomsbury Reader, 2014), pp. 287ff. In both private and public life Adams was sustained by firmly held religious conviction: brought up a Scots Presbyterian, he faithfully attended the services in All Souls Chapel and, in later life, found a spiritual home in the Church of Ireland. In retirement he removed to Fahan, County Donegal, where he farmed in a small way and took an active interest in the affairs of Magee University College (now part of the University of Ulster). He died on 30 January 1966, aged 91.Haynes, Dictionary of National Biography, 1961-1970, p. 5. ==Legacy== The organisations that Adams was instrumental in creating continue to serve the causes intrinsic to their foundation. The National Council of Social Service is now NCVO (the National Council for Voluntary Organisations); the Rural Communities Councils now combine as ACRE (Action with Communities in Rural England); and in December 2018 NCVO and ACRE announced their partnership to strengthen the support available to rural communities.Announcement of partnership between NCVO and ACRE The Barnett House operation has passed through several removals and reorganisations but, in its present guise as the Oxford University Department of Social Policy and Intervention, continues to be active in the fields of social research, reform and action.Smith, Peretz and Smith, Social Enquiry, Social Reform and Social Action: One Hundred Years of Barnett House, pp. 1-5. Oxford’s PPE degree course has flourished and become popular to such extent that it is imitated by colleges around the world. The University’s large sub-Faculty of Politics, which contributes to the governance of both PPE and other degree courses, has been said to be “witness to Adams’s faith in his subject at times when it was somewhat despised and when weaker men might have allowed it to fall into a subordinate position”.The Times, 1 February 1966 (obituary notice; first draft by Thomas Jones). ==Works== * 'The Incorporation of Trade Unions: The Position in England'.

Chin (born July 21, 1966) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 13th lieutenant governor of Hawaii, from February to December 2018. A member of the Democratic Party, Chin was previously the Attorney General of Hawaii. On December 18, 2017, Chin announced his intent to run for the U.S. House of Representatives; in August 2018, he lost the seat's Democratic nomination to Ed Case. In February 2018, Chin became Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii after the resignation of Shan Tsutsui and after two others in the line of succession declined the office. ==Early life and education== Douglas S. Chin was born in Seattle to Chinese immigrant parents, his mother a librarian, and his father a civil engineer.Meet Doug He grew up studying violin and piano. He earned his B.A. in English from Stanford University and his J.D. degree from the University of Hawaii's William S. Richardson School of Law. ==Career== Doug Chin started his legal career at the Honolulu prosecutor’s office in 1998, where he tried approximately fifty jury cases to verdict. Chin obtained guilty verdicts in notorious cases including a brutal rape-murder committed by the victim’s neighbor and a serial rapist of Honolulu prostitutes. He was recognized with a \\"Top Gun\\" award for winning the most trials in a calendar year out of 100 Honolulu prosecutors. In 2006, Chin was appointed chief deputy prosecutor and later acting prosecutor in 2010. Managing Director for the City and County of Honolulu From 2010 to 2013, under Honolulu mayor Peter B. Carlisle, Chin served as managing director for the City and County of Honolulu. Chin was directly responsible for 23 municipal government and public safety agencies and approximately 10,000 employees with an annual operating budget of $2 billion. In 2011, Chin oversaw city operations during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Honolulu, the first time the summit of nations was held in the United States. Law Partner and Corporate Lobbyist From 2013 to 2015, Chin was a law partner and eventual managing partner at Carlsmith Ball, one of the oldest and largest law firms in the state of Hawai‘i. His areas of practice included renewable energy and clean technology projects, land use and development projects and commercial litigation. In August 2013, Chin registered as a lobbyist for Corrections Corporation of America (know known as CoreCivic),http://files.hawaii.gov/ethics/lobreg/1314/Kfx10-4283.pdf and subsequently successfully lobbied to house Hawaiian prisoners in Arizona.https://www.civilbeat.org/2018/07/campaign-corner-doug-chins-cosmetic- political-makeover/ Attorney General of Hawaii Governor David Ige nominated Chin for Attorney General of Hawaii in January 2015. The Hawaii Senate was unanimous in its confirmation of Chin on March 12, 2015. Chin also led a suit on behalf of the State of Hawaii against the federal government that, on March 15, 2017, blocked implementation of President Donald Trump's Executive Order 13780 entitled, \\"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\\". Chin filed a motion asking for clarification on what a bona fide relationship with someone in the United States means. This was in leading the fight against the travel ban imposed by president Donald Trump, after the Supreme Court allowed it to go into partial effect in late June 2017. An expedited process was requested for the clarification. Congressional campaign and Lieutenant Governorship On December 18, 2017, Chin announced he would run for Hawaii's 1st congressional district in 2018 to succeed the retiring Colleen Hanabusa. In January 2018, he announced he would resign as Attorney General effective March 15, 2018 in order to focus on his congressional campaign. On January 31, 2018, Lieutenant Governor Shan Tsutsui resigned from his office. By law, the attorney general is third in the line of succession to the office of lieutenant governor, but Hawaii Senate president Ron Kouchi and Hawaii House of Representatives Speaker Scott Saiki turned down the job. Chin continued to serve as Lieutenant Governor while running for Congress, and lost the August 2018 Democratic primary to Ed Case. == Political Positions ==  Campaign Finance Reform  Chin received the endorsement of End Citizens United in his Congressional campaign and signed a pledge to reject corporate political action committee contributions. Chin previously indicated support for enacting the Democracy for All Amendment to U.S. Constitution to overturn Supreme Court decisions – including Citizens United, Buckley v. Valeo, and McCutcheon v. FEC – which Chin said \\"have given the largest corporations and the wealthiest individuals more influence than ever in our political system.  Health Care  Doug Chin supports the merits of a universal healthcare system. He also supports giving Medicare additional powers to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for seniors.  Environment  Chin has been a strong advocate for preserving Hawai‘i's natural resources and protecting the environment. He supports Hawai‘i's plan to make a transition to 100% renewable energy by 2045, and he signed a pledge for Hawai‘i to uphold the commitments in the Paris Climate Agreement despite Trump’s plans to withdraw from it. Chin opposed Scott Pruitt’s EPA nomination and resisted the current administration’s attempts to rollback the Clean Water Act. Doug Chin has supported preservation movements, such as those with the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument and protecting coastlines along O‘ahu’s North Shore. In Congress, Chin wants to expand funding to Hawaii for sustainable source expansion, protect parks from fracking and drilling, and work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Chin received the endorsement of Ocean Champions, an organization dedicated to protecting the world's oceans, in his Congressional campaign.  Transgender Rights  As Attorney General of Hawaii Doug Chin led 18 states and the District of Columbia asking Congress to pass legislation prohibiting discrimination against transgender service members to include transgender protections in the National Defense Authorization Act. The letter says President Donald Trump's policy banning transgender service members from the military \\"violates fundamental constitutional and American values.  Abortion  In Calvary Chapel versus Chin Attorney General Doug Chin was sued by a national anti-abortion religious organization for enforcing Act 200 requiring pregnancy counseling centers to advertise contraception and abortion \\"services Chin is strongly pro-choice and \\"doesn't believe it is his place – or the government's– to stand between a woman and her doctor.  Same-Sex Marriage Advocate  Doug Chin successfully defended Hawaii’s Marriage Equality Act of 2013 in Hawaii Supreme Court case brought by Representative Bob McDermott attempting to invalidate the 2013 Act and restrict the rights of same-sex couples.  LGBT Rights  Arguing that a business owner’s personal beliefs do not give him a right to discriminate against customers, a coalition of 20 states led by Chin and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, filed an amicus brief with the US Supreme Court defending the constitutionality of Colorado’s public accommodations law. Attorney General Doug Chin said, \\"All citizens deserve fair and equal treatment. We must vigilantly fight discrimination in all of its forms.\\"  Criminal Justice Reform  Chin supports enacting commonsense criminal justice reforms to reduce U.S. incarceration rates, and focus more on rehabilitation and recovery. \\"The U.S. criminal justice system treats the rich and guilty better than the poor and innocent. We must do better,\\" Chin said. He also pledged to use his experience as a prosecutor to advocate for criminal justice reforms to sharply reduce America's \\"immoral over-incarceration rates which have disproportionately impacted minority populations.\\"  Gun Control  Chin believes that Hawai‘i has the lowest gun death rate in the nation because it has passed legislation that limits who and what types of weapons the people of Hawai‘i may possess. Chin received the \\"Gun Sense Candidate\\" distinction from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America is a grassroots movement of Americans fighting for new and stronger solutions to lax gun laws and loopholes.  Immigration  Indicating his support for comprehensive immigration reform, Chin called the current immigration system \\"failed and outdated\\" and called for it to \\"recognize the critical contributions and harness the talents of America’s immigrants.\\" Chin supports passing the DREAM Act and expressed a desire to expand family reunification policies and provide a pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrations living in America.  Foreign Policy  Doug Chin said \\"the might of the U.S. military should only be brought to bear when all efforts at diplomacy have failed and when America, or our interests, are threatened with imminent harm.\\" Chin has been critical of what he describes as President Donald Trump's \\"dangerous tendency to conduct U.S. foreign policy via Twitter – even as he undercuts real diplomacy by failing to staff the State Department.\\" He has previously indicated supporting a vote to repeal and replace the Authorization for Use of Military Force, a measure passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, which he says \\"has been used by presidents of both parties to engage in short-sighted and destabilizing military campaigns in places like Iraq and Libya.\\" ==Controversy==  Anti-Gay Speech and Conversion Therapy  In 1995, Douglas Chin, then 27 years old, delivered an anti-gay speech at the Oahu Church of Christ. A recording was made of Chin angrily yelling: > 'But-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but-but > my family taught me something different. My family taught me something > different than what the Bible teaches.' Well- Okay. The bible is right, your > family is wrong [about tolerance of homosexuality]. Is there any shame in > that? Hey! What’s so bad about that? God is right. Your family is wrong. Is > there anything wrong with that? That's fine! Okay. Let’s do something > constructive with that. Amen? 'But-but-but-but my...' On February 19, 2018, during the race for Congress, Chin, Lieutenant Governor at that time, said he had \\"really grown up since [1995] and I regret if I had any sort of tone.\\" He further said, \\"I apologize if I used anything that caused people to feel uncomfortable or overly guilty.\\" Chin noted that, as Attorney General, he defended the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act in the Hawaii Supreme Court and fought the Trump Administration to defend the rights of transgender service members, and, as Lieutenant Governor, announced his support for a proposal to ban gay conversion therapy. == Personal life == He lives in Honolulu. ==References * Office of the Attorney General of Hawaii - Category:1966 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American politicians of Chinese descent Category:Hawaii Attorneys General Category:Hawaii people of Chinese descent Category:Lawyers from Seattle Category:Lieutenant Governors of Hawaii Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Seattle Category:Politicians from Honolulu Category:Stanford University alumni Category:University of Hawaii alumni ","title":"Doug Chin"},{"id":"46363093","text":"Boy Meets Girl is a 2014 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Eric Schaeffer and starring Michelle Hendley as a transgender woman living in a small town in Kentucky, looking for love. ==Plot== 21-year old Ricky is a transgender woman living in a small town in Kentucky with big dreams to move to New York and attend a school of fashion design.

At age 7, she began violin lessons and started studying music theory and history at the Avignon Conservatory. After singing a variety of repertoire (pop, jazz…), she was selected to be part of a European choir, “Voices of Europe” with whom she toured Europe, and sang with Bjørk during the recording of “Which was the Son of” by Arvo Pärt. This experience marked a turning point in her young musical life, as she discovered a desire to explore singing. At age 18, she began private classical voice lessons and acting lessons. In 2006, she entered the Conservatoire of Paris, considered the top conservatory in France. There, she made her first operatic role debuts as Elle in L'amour masqué by Messager and Susanna in Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart. During her time at the conservatory, she met and developed relationship with artists that she is still working with today, such as the founder of the French contemporary classical music group, Le Balcon, and the pianist Alphonse Cémin. In 2010, she graduated with honours. == Career == As soon as she finished her studies, she made her professional career performing Galatea at the Aix-en-Provence Festival. In 2013, she joined the opera ensemble at the Zurich Opera where she debuted several roles, including Marzelline in Fidelio, Morgana in Alcina, Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro, and Angelica in Orlando. In 2014, Fuchs signed a recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon; she released her first album Yes! the following year, which paid homage to French repertoire in the 1930s and 1940s. Also in 2015, Fuchs made her debut at the Opéra national de Paris in the role of la Folie in Platée by Rameau. She also made her debut in the Rossini repertoire as the Comtesse Folleville at the Zurich Opera, and sang in the televised concert in celebration of Bastille Day in Paris, under the Eiffel Tower. At the Salzburg Festival that same year, she made her festival debut singing the soprano part in Mozart’s Mass in C Minor. 2016 marked her debut at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich as Musetta in La Bohème. she sang with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms, and she made her debut at the Chorégies d’Orange, the celebrated festival in the South of France. Her year of debuts continued in Vienna, where she was praised by the press for her debut as Marie in Donizetti's La Fille du régiment. In 2017, she returned to the Opéra national de Paris, creating the role of Esther for the premiere of the opera Trompe-la-mort de Lucas Francesconi, and to sing the role of Nannetta in Verdi's Falstaff. Other highlights included Leïla in Bizet's Les Pêcheurs de perles at the Auditorium du Nouveau Siècle in Lille and at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées. She also returned to the Festival d’Aix-en- Provence as Zerlina in Don Giovanni. She also made her debut at the Teatro Real de Madrid as Giunia in Lucio Silla. 2018 began with the role of Comtesse Adèle in Le Comte Ory, a new production at the Opéra-Comique in Paris. Her season ended at the Zurich Opera in a new production of Monteverdi's L’Incoronazione di Poppea, appearing in the title role. The same year, she was also the center of a media firestorm regarding her firing from the Hamburg Staatsoper where she was scheduled to sing Pamina in Die Zauberflöte, due to her pregnancy. The coverage surrounding her brought to light the progress that still needs to be made regarding women’s right in the opera world. In 2019, she released her latest recording for Deutsche Grammophon, Mademoiselle, a collection of Bel Canto arias, some of which were recorded for the first time. Julie Fuchs is particularly active on social media under the handle juliefuchssoprano. == Other == She was a “marraine” of Tous à l'Opéra alongside Ruggero Raimondi in 2012. At the end of 2017, she sang Ave Maria by Franz Schubert at the televised funeral of Johnny Hallyday at the Madeleine Church in Paris. ==Awards== ** Révélation classique de l'Adami (2009) ** Prize winner at Palazzetto Bru Zane at the Concours de Paris (2010) ** Gabriel Dussurget Prize at the Aix-en-Provence Festival (2011) ** Révélation lyrique at the Victoires de la musique classique (2012) ** « Révélation musicale » of the 2012/2013 par le Syndicat professionnel de la critique de théâtre, musique et danse 2. ** Second prize at Operalia (2013)1 ** Nominated as « artiste de l'année » at the Victoires de la musique classique (2014). == Recordings == **Mélodies de Jeunesse, including works by Gustav Mahler and Claude Debussy with pianist Alphonse Cemin, recorded for Aparté/Harmonia Mundi. ** The complete Mélodies pour Piano et Voix by Francis Poulenc for the label Atma Classique. ** Ciboulette, 2014, (DVD) Opéra de Hahn, Framusica ** Yes!, 2015, répertoire français des années 30, Deutsche Grammophon, ** l’Amour Masqué by Messager Elles et Barbara, 2017, femmes qui chantent' et offrent une relecture inédite des classiques de celle qui se définissait comme 'la femme qui chante' Mercury Music Group [archive] ** l’Amour Masqué by Messager Les pêcheurs de perles, 2018, enregistrement live, Pentatone Music [archive] **Les pêcheurs de perles (The Pearl Fishers).

There was a very popular district league in Cobh in the 1920s with such teams as Red Rovers, Blue Rovers, Sunny Havanas, Pride of the East and Springfield taking part. Jack Hurley was very much involved with the running of the league. Jack and his brother Pakie Hurley, both ex-service P.E. Instructors, brought together some of the better players to form a new club, Cobh Wanderers. There were many tough encounters between the young Wanderers and teams made up of many servicemen living locally at the time. These games taught them at an early age how to take care of themselves as they were playing against physically stronger men. Pakie Hurley’s influence and experience were very important to this young side. There were some well known names in that Wanderers side such as Henry Ward, Mick Doherty and Tom Burke, who went on to gain international honours. The team started at minor level and had an impressive win in the final of the Cork Minor Cup in 1925/26 beating Sutton 7–0 at Victoria Cross, Cork. A Junior side was started and the club even played Senior for a couple of seasons before its final demise. In their brief history Wanderers played on various pitches. The main one was Villa Park (where Moore’s Place is now). They also played in Carrignafoy and Ticknock (adjacent to where the slaughterhouses were located). They had no clubhouse as such until eventually they were allowed to use McGowan’s shed, which was behind where the Spar shop is today. The shed was used for meetings and dances (or ‘Hops” as they were known) were also held there. In the late 1920s players of the quality of Mossy Cummins, Jim Agger, John ‘Speed’ Hennessy, Joe O’Driscoll and Jackie O’Reilly were regular Wanderers players. The club was soon to embark on its most successful spell. They were runner-up in both the Minor League and Cup in 1930/31. The following season they bettered this by winning the League and Cup, remaining unbeaten in both competitions. Among the stars of that 1930/31 side were Dick O’Keeffe, Dick Barry, Jim Cotter, Joe Murphy and John Hennessy. The team late moved up to Junior level and 1933/1934 had the distinction of reaching the final of the “Free State” Junior Cup. They lost 2–1 to B & I in Dalymount Park despite a great goal from Jerry Walker and outstanding displays from Jim Cotter, Joe Murphy and John Hennessy. The Wanderers were runner-up in the Junior 2nd Division League in 1934/35. Further success was achieved in 1935/36 when they beat North End 2–1 in the Cork Area Final of the Munster Junior Cup in Villa Park. Some names to note from the 1930s teams were the famous ‘Pop’ Keller, Paddy O’Neill, Paddy O’Rourke, Dave Stack and Ted ‘Tildy’ Lawton. There are some interesting connections between players of that era and the more recent Wanderers teams. Paddy O’Neill was Paul O’Neill’s father, Jim ‘Tubby’ Cotter was grand-uncle of Eoin O’Sullivan (both of them earning International caps). Paddy O’Rourke was also a dedicated Wanderer. Dave Stack, ex Cobh Ramblers President, played Minor, Junior and Senior for the Club and the uncle of Joe and Tim Stack. Timmy Burns (Sr) was also involved with the Club and his grandson Ger and Timmy also played for the current club. In the 1930s the Wanderers had the honour of having two of their players capped for their country. Dick Barry was capped at Junior level versus Scotland in 1933/34 and later won a second cap versus England in Dublin. He went on to play for Ramblers in the Intermediate Cup Finals of 1939/40 and 1941/42. Jim ‘Tubby’ Cotter who was a stylish full back, was capped in 1934/35 also at Junior level versus Scotland. He joined League of Ireland side Limerick in 1937 and played for Cork F.C. and also Ramblers in an along and distinguished career. Sadly the Wanderers did not survive beyond the 1940s. This was a time of high level unemployment and when work became available in London there was a big exodus from Cobh which including most of the players. As well as this more members joined the services during the war and eventually the club folded. Cobh Wanderers may not have existed for very long but they had the success in their era, and they are well remembered. It is only fitting that the present day club should take its name from such a famous predecessor. ==Current Cobh Wanderers F.C.== When Cobh Wanderers was founded in 1981 one of the main aims of the club was to one day purchase their own ground. Initially home games were played in Whitegate. Since then the club has been lucky enough to have had the use of the excellent facilities at the Cobh Community College. Without these facilities it would not have been possible to have continued as a club. In 1993 the club became aware that some land was available for purchase in the Ticknock area. Meetings took place with the landowner and with the local bank, AIB. A business plan was drawn up and an agreement was reached to purchase approximately five acres in Ticknock. The club officially took possession of the property in May 1995. It was decided to develop the land in phases as and when finances allowed. Then in 1996 an application was made for National Lottery funding. After receiving a further bank loan work commenced on the development in May 1997. In July 2016, they appointed former Carrigtwohill United manager, Michael Deasy as manager of the senior side. The appointment has proved to be very successful. Under Deasy's tenure, Cobh have won two trophies, the Donnie Forde Cup and Keane Cup. They have also been runner's up in three major competitions, the Beamish Cup,http://thejuniorsoccerportal.info/ringmahon-make-history-at-turners-cross/ Munster Senior Leaguehttp://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/sean- mcloughlin-strikes-as-ucc-take-title-451325.html and the FAI Intermediate Cup. In May 2017, Cobh Wanderers were defeated by Liffey Wanderers in the FAI Intermediate Cup Final, on penalties. It was first time they had reached the final in the club's history.http://www.fai.ie/domestic/news/video-liffey-seal- fai-intermediate-cup-in-a-thriller In November 2017, Cobh Wanderers won the Keane Cup by defeating Castleview AFC 3-0.

Both embryos are oriented with the anterior pole at left. Image courtesy of Shawn C. Little and Thomas Gregor (see Little et al. for methods). Bicoid is a maternal effect gene whose protein concentration gradient patterns the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis during Drosophila embryogenesis. Bicoid was the first protein demonstrated to act as a morphogen. Although Bicoid is important for the development of Drosophila and other higher dipterans, it is absent from most other insects, where its role is accomplished by other genes. == Role in axial patterning == Bicoid mRNA is actively localized to the anterior of the fruit fly egg during oogenesisSt. Johnston D, Driever W, Berleth T, Richstein S, Nusslein-Volhard C (1989). Multiple steps in the localization of bicoid RNA to the anterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte. Development 107 Suppl: 13–19. along microtubules by the motor protein dynein, and retained there through association with cortical actin. Translation of bicoid is regulated by its 3' UTR and begins after egg deposition. Diffusion and convection within the syncytium produce an exponential gradient of Bicoid protein within roughly one hour, after which Bicoid nuclear concentrations remain approximately constant through cellularization. An alternative model proposes the formation of a bicoid mRNA gradient in the embryo along cortical microtubules which then serves as template for translation of the Bicoid protein to form the Bicoid protein gradient. Bicoid protein represses the translation of caudal mRNA and enhances the transcription of anterior gap genes including hunchback, orthodenticle, and buttonhead. == Structure and function == PyMOL rendering of Bicoid homeodomain bound to its consensus site Bicoid is one of the few proteins which uses its homeodomain to bind both DNA and RNA targets to regulate their transcription and translation, respectively. The nucleic acid-binding homeodomain of Bicoid has been solved by NMR. Bicoid contains an arginine-rich motif (part of the helix shown axially in this image) that is similar to the one found in the HIV protein REV and is essential for its nucleic acid binding. Bicoid mutant produces no head Bicoid protein gradient formation is one of the earliest steps in fruit fly embryo A-P patterning. The proper spatial expression of downstream genes relies on the robustness of this gradient to common variations between embryos, including in the number of maternally-deposited bicoid mRNAs and in egg size. Comparative phylogenetic and experimental evolution studies suggest an inherent mechanism for robust generation of a scaled Bicoid protein gradient. Mechanisms that have been proposed to effect this scaling include non-linear degradation of Bicoid, nuclear retention as a size-dependent regulator of Bicoid protein's effective diffusion coefficient, and scaling of cytoplasmic streaming. == See also == * Maternal effect == References == Category:Animal developmental biology Category:Drosophila melanogaster genes ","title":"Bicoid (gene)"},{"id":"46363297","text":"Dapdap, also known as Tinago, refers to a barangay in the municipality of Tarangnan, Samar in the Philippines. The barangay is home to the San Francisco de Asis Church, a 16th-century church ruins located atop a hill. ==The Old Church of Tinago== Built in 16th century upon the arrival of the three Jesuit missionaries, Francisco De Otazo, SJ, Bartolome Martes, SJ, and Domingo Alonzo, SJ, on October 15, 1596. The Jesuit fathers started their mission as a lay faithful teaching catechism, healing the sick and spread the good news of the Catholic faith. The faith planted 400 years ago and it is much very alive among the people of Samar. ==Tinago as Cabecera== Tinago was the first town to be Christianized by the Jesuits and was made as the cabeccera (center or capital) of the island of Samar. Francisco Ignacio Alcina, SJ, the author of nine series book Historia de Las Islas y Indio de Bisaya was also assigned in the parish of St. Francis of Assisi in the church of Tinago. In 1616, the Moro pirates, Camucunes was burned down their residence and mission center in Tinago, and the Jesuit's decided to transfer it to the village of Catbalogan. ==Transferring the Cabecera from Tinago (Dapdap) to Tarangnan== Tarangnan was legally constituted by authority of the governor of Samar, Gov. Enrique Chacon, who promulgated the transfer of the site of Poblacion or town center from Dapdap to Tarangnan. This movement started on June 20, 1881 when suggested to his superiors that the poblacion be transferred from Dapdap to Tarangnan considering the following reasons: # That Dapdap had hygienic problems, it being surrounded by mangrove swamps, hills and mountains that prevent winds from cleansing the area of hot and foul atmosphere. # That there was a problem of accessibility, and therefore disadvantageous to both the spiritual and governmental administration. # That Dapdap had no more available lands for expansion. # Tarangnan on the contrary was in a healthier site, it had an all-weather port, with lands sprawling wide for a growing population. The Gobernadorcillo of Dapdap, Mr. Villanueva Perez, and other principales opposed to move. They manifested that it’s hard for them to abandon their fields, their livestock and their lands in which they were accustomed to live, but apparently their arguments centered on their desire to prevent the transfer of the blessed image of Saint Francis of Assisi to Tarangnan. The parish priest, Fr. Angel Pulido OFM., refuted all and every reason and ultimately filed a complaint against for the imputed crime of insurrection. The contradictory testimonies presented in the course of the investigation precipitated and incident resulting in the arrest of the Dapdap officials. However, Adolfo Rodriguez of the Visayan Regional Office recommended their release and reinstatement to their public office, but the phenomenal removal in 1882 of the altar and the image of Saint Francis to Tarangnan deeply touched the Dapdap leaders and followers. On October 9, 1883, disregarding evaluation of the attendant circumstances, the move of the poblacion was ordered by a decree of Governor General Fernando Primo de Rivera, and was approved by King Alfonso I of Spain in April 1884. The new pueblo of Tarangnan rapidly prospered. Subsidiary population clusters from nearby visitas, barangays, Rancherias, and sitios immigrated to the poblacion. By 1896, Tarangnan had 1,392 inhabitants while Dapdap just 533, and indication that Tarangnan indeed surpassed the former poblacion in strategic importance. ==St. Francis of Assisi== Tarangnan up to the present is still considered a pilgrim land. There are times when voyages or devotees from different towns of Samar, Leyte and neighboring provinces, come on a certain day to pay homage, to say a novena, and to show their love and veneration to the miraculous image of St. Francis of Assisi, the Patron Saint of Tarangnan and the town's perennial protector and instrument of peace.

All 39 seats in the Regional Assembly were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in 12 other autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. The People's Party won the election, recovering much of the vote it had lost in 1991 to Hormaechea's Union for the Progress of Cantabria (UPCA), which fell to third place and lost over half of its seats and votes. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), which in 1991 had won the regional election, collapsed and obtained its worst result until that time. The Regionalist Party of Cantabria (PRC) recovered and scored fourth with nearly 15% of the vote, while United Left (IU) entered the Assembly for the first time. As a result of the election, José Joaquín Martínez Sieso from the People's Party was able to be elected as regional President thanks to a PP-PRC coalition agreement. ==Overview== Electoral system The Regional Assembly of Cantabria was the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Cantabria, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Cantabrian Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a President of the Regional Deputation. Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in Cantabria and in full enjoyment of their political rights. The 39 members of the Regional Assembly of Cantabria were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 5 percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. The electoral law provided that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electors registered in Cantabria. Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called. Election date The term of the Regional Assembly of Cantabria expired four years after the date of its previous election. Elections to the Regional Assembly were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 26 May 1991, setting the election date for the Parliament on Sunday, 28 May 1995. The Regional Assembly of Cantabria could not be dissolved before the date of expiry of parliament except in the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot. In such a case, the Regional Assembly was to be automatically dissolved and a snap election called, with elected deputies merely serving out what remained of their four-year terms. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. It is a small plant, with sickle-shaped greyish-green leaves (hence the name), lilac-violet flowers and darker veining, and a white or yellow beard. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry, temperate regions. ==Description== It has a thick, short, rhizome,Andrey Aleksandrovich Fedorov (Editor) that produces nut-like segments, one per year, that spread to create small dense tufts of plants.British Iris Society (1997) On top of the rhizome are the fibrous remains of the previous seasons leaves, underneath are thick fleshy roots. It has greyish-green (falcate) curved leaves, that are covered in very small hairs. They can grow up to long and 2–4 mm wide. It is a dwarf plant, that has a stem (or peduncle) that can grow up to between long. The stem is hidden by 1–2 sheathing leaves. The stems have 3–4 spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are long. They are greenish tinted purplish, partially membranous, with a hyaline (clear and translucent) margin. The stems hold short pedicels (flower stalks), and 2–5 flowers, in spring, between March and April. The flowers are in diameter, come in shades of lilac-violet, and purple. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are oblong or lanceolate-obovate shaped, and are long and 0.6-0.9 cm wide. They have a yellow, or whitish beard in the middle of the leaf. They have darker veining. The standards are lanceolate, narrow, with a canaliculate (small channel) on the haft (section of the petal closest to the stem). It has a small perianth tube, cm long, 1.0 cm long filaments, 1–1.5 cm long anthers, and a globose and crenulated (notched) stigma. It has a pale lilac, and cm long style branches, which are keeled, and have narrow lobes which are 8mm long. After the iris has flowered, it produces an oval seed capsule, which is long. The seeds come out of the capsule via lateral slits, they are 5mm long and pear shaped. They have a whitish, ring shaped aril (appendage), on the smaller end. Biochemistry As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=18, which was discovered by Zakharyeva in 1985. == Taxonomy== It is known in Pakistan as 'khakhobe'.Umberto Quattrocchi Christian Rätsch The Latin specific epithet falcifolia refers to 'sickle shaped leaves'. It was found in 1847, in Baluchistan (Pakistan) near the Caspian Sea, by Alexander von Bunge. It was first published and described by Alexander von Bunge in Beitrag zur Kenntniss der Flora Russlands und der Steppen Central- Asiens (Beitr. Fl. Russl.) Vol.329 on 7 November 1852. It was also published in 'Mém. Acad. Imp. Sci. St.-Pétersbourg Divers Savans' Vol.7 page505 in 1854. Later published in 1941, 'Flora Uzbek' Vol.1 page 510, in 1971 in 'Consp. Fl. As. Med.' Vol.2 page130 and by Wendelbo in 'Flora Iranica' Vol.112 page37 in 1975. Later in 1913, William Rickatson Dykes, when he wrote his book the 'Genus Iris', placed the iris in the Regelia section. Then Lawrence in 1953 and Rodionenko in 1987 placed it in the Psammiris section. In 2004, Carol Wilson carried out a study on various irises including Iris falcifolia. She thought that the iris was misplaced and that it had a bulb instead of a rhizome, so should be placed with the Juno (Scorpiris) section. In 2011, a molecular study was carried out and replaced the iris back within the Hexapogon section. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 2 October 2014. Iris falcifolia is an accepted name by the RHS. ==Distribution and habitat== Iris falcifolia is native to temperate and tropical regions of central Asia. Range It is found in temperate regions of Afghanistan, Iran, (in the former states of USSR), in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. It is found in the tropical region of Pakistan, (also known as 'Baluchistan'). They are specifically found in Kara Kum (desert) and Kyzyl Kum (desert) in Kazakhstan. Habitat It grows on the clay soils of deserts. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. ==Cultivation== It is hardy to areas with hot dry summers and very cold, nearly dry winters. It could be cultivated in zones similar to N America and parts of Australia. It is occasionally grown in the UK but it is rare, also getting it to bloom is even rarer. It shares a similar geographic range with the Regelia irises. A specimen was sent to Paris Botanical Garden. ==Toxicity== Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause diarrhoea, stomach pains and vomiting. The rhizome can also be toxic to domestic animals. ==Uses== Iris falcifolia is used as a purgative, an oil from the rhizomes was used as an ointment to treat rheumatism. In Baluchistan (Pakistan), 10g of ground flowers (not just the pistils) are mixed with liquid yoghurt and then drunk in the mornings and evenings, as a herbal remedy for dysentery. ==ReferencesSources== *Czerepanov, S.

Her life was shaped in part by the publication The Ladies' Diary. ==Her parents and the magazine== Ladies Diary Almanack, for the Year of Our Lord 1786 Charlotte's father was Robert Richardson, a regular writer for the magazine The Ladies' Diary. He admired a fellow contributor to the magazine called Elizabeth Smales, who wrote enigmas in verse. Richardson had been so intrigued by \\"Betty Smales\\" that he wrote letters of admiration, and from these and a short correspondence, they were later married. This kind of exchange seems to have been encouraged by the character of the magazine that combined poetry with mathematics against the structure of an almanac. Prizes were offered to the answers to charades, verse enigmas and mathematical puzzles. Her parents' meeting and marriage via poetry was included in a later poem, \\"Jonah Tink\\", that was published by John Atkin in 1823: :I took the book, within it gaz'd, :The more I read, the more amaz'd; :I saw the name of Betty Smales, :Prefix'd to entertaining tales, :Of Richardson, her rhyming beau... ==Life== Charlotte Richardson was born in Lambeth on 15 May 1796 to Elizabeth and Robert Richardson. She was the youngest of three daughters. Richardson was educated at the Grey Coat School in York.Charlotte Richardson, Poetry Foundation, retrieved 9 April 2015 After her father's death in 1804, her mother decided to open a boarding school in Vauxhall for the dual purpose of earning an income as well as ensuring her two oldest children could be educated. She decided to temporarily send her youngest, Charlotte, to live with an aunt who, for unknown reasons, failed to return her for a decade. It was neither Charlotte or her mother's idea that she should spend her childhood in Hinderwell, Yorkshire.J. R. de J. Jackson, \\"Richardson, Charlotte Caroline (1796–1854)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 9 April 2015 In an attempt to reconnect with her family, Richardson wrote a poem in The Ladies' Diary in 1815, explicitly referring to her mother. Her mother replied in verse a year later, and Richardson reunited with her immediate family in London. All of Richardson's family (her mother and her two older sisters) regularly wrote contributions for the Ladies' Diary. In 1841, her mother died, and five years later, Richardson and her sister Elizabeth made a memoir of her life titled Poems, which was derived from her mother's contributions to The Ladies' Diary. Her first publications were Waterloo, a Poem on the Late Victory and Isaac and Rebecca, published in 1817. The following year Richardson published Harvest, a Poem, in Two Parts: with other Poetical Pieces, which she dedicated to the editor of The Ladies' Diary, the mathematician Charles Hutton. In 1823 she published a Gothic novel, The Soldier's Child, or, Virtue Triumphant, and Ludolph, or, The Light of Nature, a Poem. In 1827 she married a wharfinger, John Richardson. Charlotte Richardson died in Vauxhall on 29 March 1854. ==Works== ;Poetry *Waterloo, a Poem on the Late Victory (1817) *Isaac and Rebecca, 1817 *Harvest, a Poem, in Two Parts: with other Poetical Pieces (1818) *Ludolph, or, The Light of Nature, a Poem (1823) ;Novels *The Soldier's Child, or, Virtue Triumphant (1823) ==Name confusion== The Dictionary of National Biography noted in its 48th volume in 1896 that this person had frequently been confused with other women with similar names, including Mrs. Caroline Richardson (1777–1853), who was also a poet.

It was started in 2011 and was intended to be a ten-year project, but will probably be considered finished in the next major update. The game takes place in a procedurally generated world around the time of the scientific revolution. It is about \\"uncovering an intellectual conspiracy to rewrite history in the most culturally, religiously and socially detailed procedural world ever generated\\", and the game's core technical objective is \\"nothing short of the procedural generation of culture\\". == Gameplay == A procedurally generated altar to a generated deity, within a generated subterranean crypt. Ultima Ratio Regum is presented in a roguelike manner with ANSI characters and features permadeath. Unlike most roguelikes, Johnson has stated that combat itself will not be the main source of difficulty, and the game is instead focused around a kind of cultural detective-work wherein the player pieces together clues from the world's generated culture, history, religions, social norms, etc, to \\"uncover an intellectual conspiracy to rewrite history\\". The whole world is procedurally generated, from solar systems (the macro scale) to small details like tombstone engravings which are displayed with generated ANSI graphics (the micro scale). Puzzles are also generated anew each game and scattered around the world, to ensure that they are \\"not so easily spoiled by a wiki\\". The game does extensive procedural generation of aesthetics and graphics, ranging from tables and chairs to ornate vases and religious altars. Civilizations have different policies that affect the player to varying degrees. NPCs have their faces generated in ANSI according to their civilization's genetic features and social norms (earrings, tattoos), and can be viewed ingame so the player may figure out the social class or origin of an NPC. There is no consistent cultural style, so in one game tattoos might be worn by people in lower-class districts, while in another one they might be a distinct feature of the ruling class. == Development==  Developer  Mark R Johnson is currently a Lecturer in game studies at the University of Sydney. After his undergraduate degree in politics and sociology, he studied for a PhD in science and technology studies from 2011 to 2014. He is also an ex- professional poker player.  Influence  According to Johnson, Jorge Luis Borges, who \\"wrote a lot about themes which resonate with roguelikes but haven't been fully explored\\", Umberto Eco and Neal Stephenson were all inspirations for Ultima Ratio Regum. == References  External links == * Category:2012 video games Category:Freeware games Category:Indie video games Category:Roguelike video games Category:Strategy video games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Video games using procedural generation ","title":"Ultima Ratio Regum (video game)"},{"id":"46363576","text":"Giovanni Solinas, also known as Gianni Solinas, is an Italian football manager.

While pharmaceutical companies have justified the development of me-toos as offering incremental improvements in efficacy, side-effects, compliance and cost, critics have questioned the increasing marketing of me-toos, their absorption of research and development resources and their impact on the innovation of new treatments. In 1956, Louis S. Goodman, co‐editor of Goodman and Gilman, referred to “the problem of the introduction of ‘me too’ drugs, that is, drugs without signal advantage of any sort”. However, me-too drugs can be novel compounds themselves. They are commonly used and include several beta blockers, antidepressants and stomach acid reducing and cholesterol lowering drugs. ==History== Louis Goodman, who coined the phrase \\"me-too\\" The term \\"me‐too drugs\\" was coined in the 1950s. In 1956, Louis S. Goodman, co‐editor of Goodman and Gilman, referred to “the problem of the introduction of ‘me too’ drugs, that is, drugs without signal advantage of any sort”. Once a new drug class was discovered, other major drug companies made efforts to produce their own similar versions. Pharmacologist Milton Silverman and physician Philip R. Lee noted \\"the great drug therapy era was marked not only by the introduction of new drugs in great profusion and by the launching of large promotional campaigns but also by the introduction of what are known as 'duplicative' or 'me-too' products\\". Between 1960 and 1962, Estes Kefauver, then Senator of Tennessee, led a series of hearings enquiring about the pharmaceutical industry's motive to produce me-too drugs after it was noted that much of their time and resources were spent producing them. Subsequently, the FDA required drug companies to prove their drugs were safe and effective. In 1964, Louis Lasagna described me-too drugs as being “hard to justify putting into man at all, let alone on the market”. Three years later, the term appeared in the Oxford English Dictionary. In the early 1970s, Silverman and Lee reported that there were almost 100 tranquillisers, 130 antihistamines, greater than 270 antibiotics and more than 200 sulfonamides. In 1994, Desmond Laurence's textbook Clinical Pharmacology referred to me-too as \\"me-again\\". ==Definition== There is no agreed definition, however, several have been proposed, including: *\\"multiple drugs within the same therapeutic class\\" *\\"drugs that are chemically related to the prototype, or other chemical compounds which have an identical mechanism of action\\" *\\"drugs which have more or less identical clinical outcomes to pre‐existing drugs\\" *\\"a drug with a similar chemical structure or the same mechanism of action as a drug that is already marketed\\". Biosimilars are compared with other biosimilars and are therefore not me-toos. ==Examples== Me-too drugs include diazepam, ranitidine and esketamine. Beta blockers The first-in-class β-blocker pronethalol was developed by James Black at ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was followed by propranolol, sotalol, practolol, metoprolol, labetalol, acebutolol and bisoprolol. Successive differences between β-blockers have had a combined cumulative effect and are seen as \\"innovative\\". Benzodiazepines 15 benzodiazepines were marketed in the UK between 1960 and 1982, of which seven were produced by Roche. Proton pump inhibitors The proton-pump inhibitor Nexium by AstraZeneca is a me-too which was granted its patent by showing that it was effective for heartburn, not that it was better than its precursor, prilosec. It was shown to preserve revenues of prilosec, whose U.S. patent expired in 2001. Considered a new drug by the FDA, nexium was patented separately, sold for eight times the cost of its generic esomeprazole and advertised as significantly better than its predecessor, a move the company received much criticism for, with a subsequent class action lawsuit filed against them. File:Nexium (2598347399).jpgNexium (esomeprazole) H2 antagonists Both tagamet's and zantac's prices increased following the arrival further me-too drugs pepcid and axid. ACE inhibitors Several me- toos followed the prototype of the ace inhibitor, captopril, with enalapril being its first me-too. Most were as efficient as each other and had similar adverse effect profiles. Statins When Merck's cholesterol-lowering statin mevacor was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987, the understanding of the link between cholesterol and heart disease was improving, and the potential market for the drug became significant. Subsequently, several other companies developed similar drugs: Merck produced zocor and crestor (rosuvastatin), Pfizer made lipitor (atorvastatin), Bristol- Myers Squibb produced pravachol, and Novartis developed lescol. Others include pitavastatin (Livalo). File:Atorvastatin40mg.jpgLipitor (atorvastatin) File:Crestor Tablets (rosuvastatin).jpgCrestor (rosuvastatin) Antidepressants Imipramine was the first-in-class of the tricyclic antidepressants. Amitriptyline, Nortriptyline, Dosulepin and Doxepin are some of the me-toos that followed. Several me-too Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been developed for maintenance treatment in chronic depression. These include paxil, celexa, zoloft, lexapro (escitalopram) and prozac (fluoxetine). File:Lexapro pills.jpgLexapro (escitalopram) File:Zoloft 100 mg.jpgthumbZoloft (sertraline) File:Paxil, June 2003.jpgPaxil (paroxetine) ==Debate== In 2005, a report by the International Policy Network defended me-toos, describing their development as \\"incremental improvements on already existing drugs\\". The report stated: > ... this often represent(s) advances in safety and efficacy, along with > providing new formulations and dosing options that significantly increase > patient compliance. From an economic standpoint, expanding drug classes > represent the possibility of lower drug prices as competition between > manufacturers is increased. Additionally, pharmaceutical companies depend on > incremental innovations to provide the revenue that will support the > development of more risky “block-buster” drugs. Policies aimed at curbing > incremental innovation will ultimately lead to a reduction in the overall > quality of existing drug classes and may ultimately curb the creation of > novel drugs. This incremental innovation has led to some referring to me-toos as \\"me- betters\\". Many physicians are unaware that me-toos are compared to placebos rather than pre-existing drugs. Me-toos are seen as patentable new drugs and therefore substantial profit makers, where innovative drugs may be more risky to develop. ==Statistics== Between 1998 and 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 487 drugs, of which 78 per cent appeared to have similar characteristics to pre-existing marketed drugs. More than 60% of medicines listed on the World Health Organization's essential list are me‐too drugs. In September 2019, half of antibiotics under clinical development were “me-too” drugs. At the beginning of 2020, the WHO stated that only two of the 50 antibiotics in clinical development are active against serious drug resistant gram-negative bacteria, and most are not significant \\"upgrades\\" of drugs. ==See also== * Unique selling point ==References== Category:Pharmaceutical industry Category:Drugs Category:Medical terminology ","title":"Me-too drug"},{"id":"46363601","text":"Maspeth station was a stop along the original New York & Flushing Railroad that opened on January 15, 1855.Station The Long Island Rail Road A Comprehensive History by Vincent F.

All of his films have been produced by Al Morrow of Met Film. == Filmmaking == Rothwell's first feature documentary, Deep Water, (co-directed with Louise Osmond), is about Donald Crowhurst's ill-fated voyage in the 1968 round the world yacht race. The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"Deep Water is a stunning documentary that not only beautifully elucidates a nearly forgotten incident but touches on crucial themes involving isolation, sanity, self-worth, impossible dreams, the nature of heroism and limits of human endurance.\\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/deep-water-15810 The Baltimore Sun commented, \\"...the less said about this film the better. It's that good.\\" The film premiered at Rome International Film Festival in 2008, where it won the award for Best Documentary. And Philadelphia's The Inquirer, gave it 3 and half out of 4 stars, calling it \\"fascinating\\". Shot over two years, Heavy Load is about a group of people with learning disabilities who form a punk band and the journey of recording their first album “The Queen Mother’s Dead.” The Herald Scotland said, \\"... there aren't too many quietly moving documentaries about thrash punk bands, which is just one reason to treasure Jerry Rothwell's film…Although a portrait of a band, Heavy Load is as much about the lives of people with learning disabilities - chaperoned dates and all. Respectful and never patronizing, Rothwell genuinely connects with his subjects.\\" Donor Unknown tells the story of sperm donor, Jeffrey Harrison, and his many offspring. Rothwell describes it as \\"a story that provokes us to question what a family is. Through a bizarre set of coincidences, Jeffrey and his children are negotiating new kinds of relationship, for which there aren’t really any social rules. What does a connection based solely on genetics mean? Can it become the basis of a lasting ‘family’ relationship? Is it emotionally necessary for the child? And what does it mean for the biological father? I was excited about how those questions were raised for this specific group of people, connected by a single sperm donor.” Total Film claims \\"Donor Unknown is a skillfully constructed look at a very modern family.\\" Town of Runners is a feature documentary about two girls in the Ethiopian village of Bekoji who want to become track athletes. The initial idea for the film came from one of the producers, Dan Demissie. Rothwell wanted to make the film \\"... because as a child I lived in Kenya in the 1970s, and my heroes weren’t George Best or Neil Armstrong, but the East African runners of the time such as Kip Keino. Much later, my daughter had become a keen athlete and I was interested in how some children seize on a sense of their own potential and develop an ambition, which is strong enough to sustain them through the hardships of daily training. And I wondered how that played out in an African context.\\" Little White Lies said, \\"the beauty of Town of Runners lies in is its subtlety. … Rothwell’s careful cinematography is careful to make sure that the film is not a simplistic fable of sporting optimism…. Heartfelt, lively and candid, Town of Runners deserves be the sleeper hit of this Olympic year.\\" The Financial Times called it \\"a fantastically cool British documentary.” Total Film said, \\"Dispelling the usual clichés about Africa, Rothwell reveals instead an entrepreneurial community where \\"running is work\\" and villagers chip in two per cent of their salaries to support coach Sentayehu Eshetu. Fluctuations in form, funding and bureaucracy hinder the girls’ progress but their ambition never wavers. In an Olympic year, here's an inspirational reminder of what it's all about.” The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2012. In 2015, Rothwell released the documentary How To Change The World. A New York Times \\"Critics Pick\\", the film tells the story of the founders of Greenpeace - an eclectic group who set out to stop an atomic bomb test in Alaska in 1971, and began what has grown into a multimillion-dollar organization. Rothwell based his documentary on the journals and other writings of Robert Hunter, one of the founding members of Greenpeace. The film premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2015 and won a Special Jury Award for Best Editing. The New York Times called the film, \\"engrossing\\", stating \\"... while the film, polished and paced like a caper flick, captures the excitement of the make-it-up-as-you-go early days, Mr. Rothwell also highlights the stresses that come after a movement takes on a life of its own.\\" The Telegraph of London, called the piece, \\"remarkable\\", saying it was \\"... a devastating illustration of how power corrupts,\\" and stating that \\"Whatever your politics, this documentary about the founders of Greenpeace is essential viewing\\". They lauded Rothwell's ability to remain apolitical in telling the story. Rothwell co-directed the 2016 documentary, Sour Grapes, with Reuben Atlas. The film traces the case of what is considered to be the largest wine-fraud case in history. It follows the rise of Rudy Kurniawan in the world of wine connoisseurs, followed by the detective work of Laurent Ponsot, the doyen of Domaine Ponsot, and Bill Koch, which went into exposing his fraud. The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Hot Docs Festival on May 3. At Met Film Production, he has been an executive producer and worked as an editor on numerous feature documentaries including Dylan Williams’ Men Who Swim and Sarah Gavron's The Village At The End Of The World. ==Film awards and nominations == Rothwell has won and been nominated for numerous awards. His first documentary, Deep Water won the award for \\"Best Documentary\\" at the 2008 Rome International Film Festival, where it had premiered. It was also awarded the Best Cinema Documentary for 2007 at The Grierson Awards. In 2012, Donor Unknown won the Tribeca (Online) Film Festival Best Feature Film award, as well as being nominated for a Grierson Award, this time for \\"Best Documentary on a Contemporary Theme - International\\".

The West Ham team from this season achieved their highest ever position in the Football League, third in the First Division. They were challenging for the title throughout the season which has been described as West Ham's greatest ever season. With one game remaining they were second in the league eventually finishing third behind champions, Liverpool and Everton. The season is often used as a comparison for more modern West Ham United teams. ==Background== Phil Parkes played in goal for every game of the 85-86 season. Managed by John Lyall, West Ham had finished 16th in the previous season but additions of Frank McAvennie and Mark Ward combined with the partnership of McAvennie and Tony Cottee and the captaincy of Alvin Martin made West Ham genuine title challengers. The season had started badly with one win from the first seven games. By the autumn the club had gone on a record 18 games undefeated including nine successive victories and by Christmas of 1985 they were described by journalist Joe Melling of the Daily Express as the \\"best team in the land\\". After three defeats in four games and a period when fixtures were badly affected by weather West Ham were 7th. However a 4-0 away win at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge, an 8-1 win against Newcastle United, in which Alvin Martin scored a hat-trick against three different goalkeepers, and a period when four games were played in one week, had West Ham four points behind Liverpool with a game in hand. The title was eventually won by Liverpool after Kenny Dalglish scored in a 1-0 victory over Chelsea in the last but one game of the season. In a final game of the season an exhausted West Ham team lost to Everton at Goodison Park to take third place. Team member Tony Gale, who would later go on to win a Premier League title with Blackburn Rovers, said of the season, \\"I will never forget those days as long as I live. That was a dream team....wonderful to play in and wonderful to watch\\". McAvennie scored 26 league goals in the season with Cottee contributing 20.

Interactive Entertainment, for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Wii U, Xbox One and Xbox 360. It follows the toys-to-life format, in that the player has Lego figures and a toy pad that can be played within the game itself where it features characters and environments from over 30 different franchises. The Starter Pack, containing the game, the USB toy pad, and three minifigures, was released in September 2015, while additional level packs and characters were released over the following two years. A third year of content was planned, but was cancelled in October 2017. ==Gameplay== Lego Dimensions features the same style of gameplay as the previous Lego video games developed by Traveller's Tales, in which up to two players control Lego minifigures based on various represented franchises. Players progress through linear levels, using their characters' abilities to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and attempt to reach the level's end. Characters are entered into the game by placing their respective minifigures onto a USB toy pad, with each character possessing unique abilities that can be used to solve puzzles or reach hidden areas. Using a character from a certain franchise will also unlock that franchise's Adventure World, an open-world area for players to explore and complete in-game objectives. The Starter Pack includes the toy pad and the game's 14-level main story campaign, which revolves around Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle, while additional levels are made available by purchasing Level Packs and Story Packs. In addition to the minifigures, players can also build models of vehicles, such as the Batmobile, TARDIS, Mystery Machine, or DeLorean, and put them into the game for characters to drive. Completing objectives in the levels and adventure worlds will reward players with gold bricks, which can be used to upgrade vehicles and give them new abilities. Each adventure world also contains a red brick for players to retrieve; these will unlock special bonuses, such as visual modifiers for characters or extra assistance at finding collectible items. Unlike series such as Skylanders, Disney Infinity, and Amiibo, the minifigures, vehicles, and the USB toy pad are all made from real Lego pieces and can be freely built and customized. All minifigures and vehicles can be used in any available level, though specific figures must be present to initially enter those levels or worlds. An additional feature called \\"Hire a Hero\\" was added shortly after the game's launch; this feature allows players to pay in-game currency to temporarily summon characters they do not own in order to complete an otherwise- inaccessible puzzle. The game's second year of content also introduced competitive multiplayer in the form of the Battle Arenas, allowing up to four players to compete in modes such as Capture the Flag. Gold bricks can be used to purchase new power-ups for the Battle Arenas. Certain packs also include exclusive features; for example, the Midway Arcade level pack unlocks playable emulations of over 20 Midway arcade titles, while the Teen Titans Go! packs unlock an exclusive Lego-themed episode of the series that can be viewed in- game. ==Plot== Arriving on Foundation Prime, a planet located in the center of the Lego multiverse, Lord Vortech (Gary Oldman), a being who has the power to shapeshift and travel through dimensions, and his robotic minion X-PO (Joel McHale) seek the twelve Foundation Elements, the cornerstones of time and space itself, in a bid to merge all the dimensions into one under Vortech's control. These Elements, such as the Ruby Slippers, the One Ring, the Flux Capacitor, the Palantir, and Kryptonite, were scattered across the dimensions long ago, but gathered together at Foundation Prime can unlock the power to control all of the dimensions. When X-PO voices his doubts of Vortech's evil plan (as it is too dangerous to harness the Elements safely), Vortech decides that he no longer needs him and banishes him to the planet Vorton. Unfortunately for Vortech, his own body cannot handle too many more dimensional jumps, forcing him to open vortexes to the different dimensions and recruits their villains to help him search for the Elements while imprisoning the heroes pulled through them. These actions damage the boundaries between the dimensions, causing them to merge and characters to be displaced. When Robin (Scott Menville), Frodo (Yuri Lowenthal), and MetalBeard (Nick Offerman) are pulled into the vortexes, each unknowingly in possession of one of the Elements, Batman (Troy Baker), Gandalf the Grey (Tom Kane), and Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) all jump in after them. The three get pulled into the same vortex and appear on Vorton, where the vortex generator they came out of explodes, prompting them to rebuild it. Aided by X-PO, the three use the generator to travel through the dimensions and search for the Foundation Elements and the five missing Keystones that power the generator (Shift, Chroma, Elemental Phase, Scale, and Locate) hoping to find their missing friends and stop Vortech's plan from succeeding in the process. Along their journey, they meet and assist the various heroes of the dimensions they visit, such as Dorothy Gale (Laura Bailey), Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta), Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), Wheatley (Stephen Merchant), and Scooby-Doo (Frank Welker) while fighting numerous villains, including the Wicked Witch of the West (Courtenay Taylor), Lord Business (Nolan North), the Joker, Master Chen, Saruman the White (Roger L. Jackson), Daleks (Nicholas Briggs), Lex Luthor, the Riddler, Two-Face, Sauron, General Zod, as well as Vortech himself in 1885 Hill Valley and a haunted circus. However, Vortech eventually realizes that X-PO is helping them. The heroes travel to Foundation Prime to find their friends and fight Vortech, but it turns out to be a diversion, allowing the villains to ambush X-PO and retrieve the trio's Foundation Elements in their absence. With all twelve Elements collected, Vortech unlocks the foundation of all the dimensions, a green Lego building plate, and is imbued with near- unlimited power. He merges Robin, Frodo, MetalBeard, and a piece of himself into a giant robot mutant known as the Tri, (Menville, Lowenthal, and Offerman) and sends it to wreak havoc on the trio's worlds. Fearing that a failure could lead to a transformation into a similar mutant, the villains bail out on Vortech. The heroes free their friends from inside the Tri and destroy the Vortech piece, causing it to implode. After the Tri's defeat, Batman realizes that they will need all the help they can get to defeat Vortech, leading them to recruit the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi), Mystery Inc., the Ghostbusters, the space ship Defender, and GLaDOS (Ellen McLain) to their cause. While the Doctor, GLaDOS, and X-PO work on a plan to seal Vortech in a rift loop, the heroes head to Foundation Prime, fighting him along the way. With their allies' help, they are able to destroy the Lego plate, which causes Foundation Prime's palace to collapse and infuriates Vortech. He grows to an enormous size and attacks the trio, but the Doctor is able to manipulate the portal technology and sucks all of them into a rift loop. Using a special device he, GLaDOS, and X-PO designed, the heroes are able to seal Vortech in an endless rift prison for all eternity, saving the multiverse. In a post- credits scene, an unknown figure finds a piece of Vortech's giant body in the remains of Foundation Prime's palace. He picks it up and instantly becomes corrupted, yelling in pain as he converts into a Vorton being. Vortech's laughter is heard as the scene fades out, suggesting that the figure has been transformed into another Vortech. Franchises The game features characters and worlds from thirty different franchises, consisting of: *The A-Team *Adventure Time *Back to the Future *Beetlejuice *DC Comics *Doctor Who *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them *Ghostbusters *Ghostbusters (2016) *The Goonies *Gremlins *Harry Potter *Jurassic World *Knight Rider *Legends of Chima *Lego City (based on the Lego City Undercover video game) *The Lego Batman Movie *The Lego Movie *The Lord of the Rings *Midway Arcade *Mission: Impossible *Ninjago *Portal 2 *The Powerpuff Girls *Scooby-Doo *The Simpsons *Sonic the Hedgehog *Teen Titans Go! *The Wizard of Oz The game also features character and setting cameos from other franchises, including HAL 9000 from the Space Odyssey series, S.T.A.R. Labs from CW's The Flash, Bedrock from The Flintstones, the family room from The Jetsons, and the DNA ship from Red Dwarf. Unlike other toys-to-life series such as Skylanders and Disney Infinity, Lego Dimensions allows all figures to be compatible with the existing title, rather than releasing a sequel. ==Packs== In addition to the game's starter pack, Lego Dimensions has a wide range of packs available, split into four categories: story packs, level packs, team packs, and fun packs. Packs from the game's second year (September 2016–17) also unlock Adventure World Battle Arenas, competitive four-person multiplayer areas themed after each figure's respective franchise.

IGN awarded it a score of 7.7 out of 10, saying \\"Lego Dimensions great characters and fun references consistently left me with a big dumb grin on my face.\\" GameSpot awarded it a score of 8.0, saying \\"In any game within the toys-to-life genre, there's sometimes an unspoken question: is this also a great toy or just a great game? In Lego Dimensions case, the answer is easy: it's both.\\" They also praised the open world sections of the game, stating that \\"While they don't feature the same level of intricacy the main game provides, they do add several more hours each to the overall experience.\\" Polygon awarded it 8 out of 10, saying \\"Where the game's innovative designs push forward what it means to blend toys and games into a single experience, the writing and both companies' willingness to dig deep into their vaults, pull the whole game together.\\" Good Game: Spawn Point Hosts Bajo and Hex both awarded the game 3 out of 5. Praise was given to the puzzles and mechanics, commenting that it may be their favourite LEGO game. However, they gave harsh criticism to the pricing model. Their summation was that it was \\"poor value\\", stating that the last few Lego games were \\"pretty much as good as this one\\", but players can play as their extensive character rosters without having to buy expensive expansions.\\" Sales In the UK and Ireland, Lego Dimensions landed at number 2 on the sales charts in its first week. Sales had surpassed in comparison to first week sales of other 2015 toys-to-life game competitors Skylanders: Superchargers and Disney Infinity 3.0.

However, ELT requires sufficient processing power within the data processing engine to carry out the transformation on demand, to return the results in a timely manner. Since the data is not processed on entry to the data lake, the query and schema do not need to be defined a priori (although often the schema will be available during load since many data sources are extracts from databases or similar structured data systems and hence have an associated schema).

Published by Indian Academy of Sciences (Bangalore) in 2008, the book was edited by Rohini Godbole and Ram Ramaswamy. Reviews have appeared in The Hindu, Nature and C&E; News among other places. The book contains brief biographical and autobiographical sketches of women scientists working in India. Covering a range of disciplines, in these essays the scientists talk of what brought them to science, what kept their interest alive, and what has helped them achieve some measure of distinction in their careers. This collection represent the cultural diversity of the country as well as a diverse range of disciplines, so that any student could gain from the insights and experiences of professional women to whom they may be able to relate at many levels. [The title of the collection is a nod to the 12th- century treatise, Lilavati, written by the Indian mathematician Bhāskara II wherein problems in arithmetic, algebra, geometry, etc. are discussed via poetic conversations addressed to his daughter Lilavati.] The book has been translated in Malayalam as \\"Leelavatiyude Pennmakkal\\", published by the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishath. A shorter (and different) version of Lilavati's Daughters was brought out as \\"The Girl's Guide to a Life in Science\\" edited by Ram Ramaswamy, Rohini Godbole and Mandakini Dubey (co-published with Young Zubaan, New Delhi).

Examples of her work are in the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, The Brooklyn Museum, the British Museum, the Museum of Fine Art, Boston, and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian. She has won prizes for her work from the Siga Prefecture Art Exhibition in 1983, the Kyoto Art and Crafts Exhibition in 1984 and 1985, and the World Triennial Exhibition of Small Ceramics in Zagreb, Croatia in 1997. Kitamura completed her MFA at the Kyoto City University of Art. She is married to artist Yo Akiyama, and was the student of two prominent Japanese artists: Suzuki Osamu and Kondo Yutaka. Kitamura Junko,Vase, The Brooklyn Museum == Work and inspiration == Kitamura’s ceramic works are made of stoneware and white slip, often decorated with intricate, dizzying patterns. The wheel- thrown pieces are sometimes adorned with white dots, which create a shifting pattern against the background, heighted by their subtle texture. Although the tiny decorations appears obsessive, Kitamura’s work is inspired by the ancient 15th century Korean tradition of buncheong ware of slip-inlay. Her designs are punched into the surface by hand with bamboo, then inlaid with a white slip. Punch’ong, or otherwise known as buncheong ware could be either inlaid or stamped to create well defined patterns, or incised for a more freehand, inventive style. The buncheong tradition was interrupted by the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1592, and 1598, but was resumed in the seventeenth century by Korean and Japanese potters. Kitamura’s work also appears to reference or evoke pottery designs from the Jōmon Period (10,500-300 BC). == Gender in Japanese ceramics == Post-World War II, Japanese women began to enter the world of ceramics. While a number of female Japanese ceramic artists are prominent today, women were traditionally excluded from the apprentice system of ceramic production, and not accepted as apprentices. The post-war university system allowed for an alternative teaching route, which allowed women to learn through a school rather than the apprenticeship system. == References == Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese ceramists Category:Japanese women ceramists Category:20th-century Japanese artists Category:20th-century Japanese women artists Category:20th-century ceramists Category:21st-century Japanese artists Category:21st-century women artists Category:21st-century ceramists ","title":"Kitamura Junko"},{"id":"46363824","text":"Josh van der Flier () (born 25 April 1993) is an Irish rugby union player for Leinster and Ireland.

It was founded as Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre in 1187 by Robert of Dreux as a Collegiate church. It had fallen into ruin by 1739 and was rebuilt as Saint- Louis-du-Louvre in 1744. The church was suppressed in 1790 during the French Revolution and turned over the next year for use as the first building dedicated to Protestant worship in the history of Paris, a role in which it continued until its demolition in 1811 to make way for Napoleon's expansion of the Louvre. The Reformed congregation was given l'Oratoire du Louvre as a replacement and saved the choir stalls from Saint-Louis-du-Louvre which are still in place at l'Oratoire. ==History== Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre Saint- Thomas-du-Louvre on the Turgot map of Paris (1736) On 8 October 1164, Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, after intensifying conflict with Henry II over his efforts to reduce the power of the church through the Constitutions of Clarendon, was put on trial and convicted of various offenses by Henry in Northampton Castle. Becket proceeded to flee to France where he was welcomed and hosted for six years by Louis VII. Shortly after his return to England in 1170, Becket was famously murdered in Canterbury Cathedral and subsequently canonized in 1173. In 1179, Louis VII travelled to Canterbury to pay his respects to the saint, making a donation of a gold chalice and an annual donation of 100 muids (~3,400 gallons) of wine for the celebration of the annual feast. Inspired by his brother's devotion, Robert of Dreux founded a new collegiate church, Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre, in 1187, with endowment for four canons. After Robert's death, his wife, Agnès de Baudemont, obtained confirmation of the foundation of the church from Pope Clement III in 1189. Philip Augustus provided further confirmation in 1192 by means of letters- patent with the great seal in green wax. A papal bull from Pope Innocent III in 1199 took the church, its property and clergy, under the protection of the Pope. In 1428, John VI, Duke of Brittany endowed more prebends for the church by donating the adjoining hotel, La Petite Bretagne, on the condition that the canons pray for his family. This increased the number of canons to seven, to be chosen alternately by the king and bishop. Saint-Louis-du-Louvre Ground floor plan for Saint-Louis-du-Louvre, from the book Architecture françoise by Jacques-François Blondel Cross section of Saint-Louis-du-Louvre The entrance and cross section of the church Saint-Louis-du-Louvre By 1739 the church had fallen into ruin and Louis XV gave 50,000 crowns for it to be rebuilt. During the demolition process a portion of the church was left for the continuing use of the chapter. While the canons were performing the office the remaining structure collapsed, burying them in the ruins. This accident led to the union of the chapter with that of the neighboring Saint-Nicolas-du- Louvre, which had also been founded by Robert of Dreux and had at various times previously been united with Saint-Thomas, and the rededication of the reconstructed church to Saint Louis in 1744. In 1749, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés was also merged with the new congregation. The new church was designed by Thomas Germain, known best for his work as a silversmith, and consisted of just a nave and an apse. The entrance of the church was in a circular projection decorated with Ionic pilasters. The apse housed the choir stalls of the canons surrounding the high altar. The nave was decorated with Corinthian pilasters surmounted by an entablature. In the chapel of the Virgin there was a sculpture of the Annunciation by Jean-Baptiste II Lemoyne. The church was also decorated with works by members of the families of painters, Coypel, Restout, and Van Loo. The building enjoyed a good reputation in the middle of the 18th century for its singular plan and rich internal decoration. However, the style of the exterior and portico came under some criticism. When Cardinal Fleury, the tutor and chief minister of Louis XV, died in 1743 the king decided that his mausoleum would be placed in Saint-Louis-du-Louvre. A competition was held for the commission to create the tomb, a landmark event in the history of 18th century French sculpture due to its solicitation of public input. Philibert Orry, then the director of the Royal Buildings, solicited proposals from sculptors who were members of the Royal Academy. Models for the tomb were offered by Nicolas-Sébastien Adam, Edmé Bouchardon, Charles-François Ladette, Jean-Baptiste II Lemoyne, and Jean-Joseph Vinache. The wax maquettes of proposals were displayed at the Salon for public response. Bouchardon won the competition though ultimately Lemoyne was given the commission by the family of Cardinal Fleury and the tomb remained unfinished at the time of the church's suppression. The church was also home to the tomb of its architect, Thomas Germain. At the time of the French Revolution the church had a provost, a cantor, and twenty canons with the provost, cantor and fifteen canons nominated by the archbishop, four by the Duke of Penthièvre in this role as the Count of Brie, and one by Les Gallichets. On 24 February 1790, the chapter declared to the revolutionary authorities annual revenues of 98,562 livres, a great sum for the time. On 11 December 1790, municipal officers came to the church to announce to the canons the suppression of their chapter and abolition of their titles. An inventory of the objects in the church was made and all the church's properties and possessions were turned over to the state. Protestant Church Paul-Henri Marron, the pastor of the Reformed congregation The choir seats from the church now found in l'Oratoire du Louvre In 1791, at the behest of Jean Sylvain Bailly, the mayor of Paris, and the Marquis de Lafayette, the empty Saint-Louis-du-Louvre was rented to the newly formed Reformed congregation in Paris for the annual sum of 16,450 livres, with the first service held on Easter. In 1598, Protestant worship had been forbidden in Paris by the Edict of Nantes. In 1685, the Edict of Fontainebleau made non-Catholic services illegal in all of France. This inaugurated a long period of persecution for French Protestants, though some in Paris were able to worship in the chapels of the Dutch and Swedish embassies. The Edict of Tolerance in 1787 gave Protestants legal status and a congregation was formed under the pastorship of Paul-Henri Marron, who had been serving as the chaplain at the Dutch embassy. The congregation gained permission to worship openly in 1789 during the revolution and met in a variety of places including a wine shop before gaining permission to rent Saint-Louis-du-Louve, the first building dedicated to Protestant worship in the history of Paris. For the dedication of the new church, or temple as French Protestants referred to their buildings, Pastor Marron preached from the text, \\"Soyez joyeux dans l’espérance, patients dans l’affliction, persévérants dans la prière,\\" (be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer (Romans 12:12)). When the mayor, Jean Bailly, attended in person on 13 October 1791 Marron chose the passage, \\"Vous connaissez la vérité et la vérité vous rendra libres,\\" (you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free (John 8:32)). As the revolution became increasingly hostile to Christianity, Marron was arrested on 21 September 1793. He was released and then rearrested and released once more, having made the concession of having services once every ten days according to the revolutionary calendar instead of on Sundays. Marron was once more arrested in June 1794 for continuing to marry and baptize in secret after Christian practice had been banned by Robespierre in favor of the Cult of the Supreme Being. He was freed from prison only by the fall of Robespierre.Almanach des Protestants de l’Empire Français pour l’an de grâce 1809, Notice sur l’église actuelle de Paris, Bibliothèque du Protestantisme Français (75007, Paris), pages 259, Cote L.22864 I In the Concordat of 1801, Napoleon came to an agreement with Pope Pius VII to reconcile the Catholic church to the French state. The concordat also led to official recognition of, and state control over, other religious groups including Protestants. As a result, three former Catholic churches were dedicated for the use of reformed believers in Paris, Sainte-Marie-des-Anges, the chapel of the Pentemont Abbey, and Saint-Louis-du- Louvre. In 1806 however, Napoleon decreed an expansion of the Louvre that would require the demolition of all existing structures between the Louvre and the Tuileries Palace including the church of Saint-Louis. As a replacement the Reformed congregation was given the Oratoire du Louvre, which had also been suppressed in the Revolution. The choir and some of the other woodwork was preserved and can be seen in the Oratoire, including the misericorde seats in the choir stalls that enabled the canons to rest while standing. While most of the church was demolished in 1811, a portion remained standing until the construction of the Denon wing of the Louvre in 1850. ==References *An article on the church's tombs Category:Roman Catholic churches in the 1st arrondissement of Paris Category:Reformed churches in Paris Category:Former collegiate churches Category:Destroyed churches in France Category:Former buildings and structures in Paris Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1811 ","title":"Saint-Louis-du-Louvre"},{"id":"46363865","text":"Thomsen's theorem, P_7=P_1 Thomsen's theorem, named after Gerhard Thomsen, is a theorem in elementary geometry.

The team of four elite police officers consist of two women and two men - promoting the idea that women can work together as equals in the police force. According to the Associated Press, \\"The Taliban have long used Afghanistan's corruption and lawlessness as a recruiting tool, promising stability and the rule of law through strict Islamic justice.\\" Recruitment for the Afghan National Police increased after the show was played on TV, and the show was intended to represent ANP officers as hard-working and professional.

Phineas was educated at private schools in Baltimore then studied medicine at the University of Maryland. Following his graduation in 1845, he continued his medical studies at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. == Career == After passing the exams of the U.S. Navy's Medical Department, he was appointed Assistant Surgeon on November 18, 1847. His first posting was to the Gulf Squadron, which was engaged against Mexico during the Mexican–American War. He was soon placed in charge of the Naval Hospital in Frontera de Tabasco, where he would remain until the end of the war. His work at the hospital earned him a commendation from the squadron commander, Commodore Matthew C. Perry. Following the end of the conflict, Dr. Horwitz was posted to the USS Constitution, which was joining the Mediterranean Squadron following its refitting in 1847. He then joined the supply ship USS Relief, bound for Brazil. Following an examination, he was promoted in 1853 and assigned to the steamer USS Princeton, where he would serve for two years. While the Princeton stationed in Philadelphia, Dr. Horwitz met his wife, Caroline Norris, whom he married in 1854; the couple would have seven sons and two daughters.

Jeremy Cordeaux hosted the show in 1970. A 1974 on the Seven Network was hosted by Scottish-born Bobby Hanna. A 1991 version hosted by Greg Evans was screened on Network Ten as a revived version of Perfect Match, which was also based on the same format. A new series, termed the show's revival, began on 15 October 2018 on Channel 10, hosted by Julia Morris. It showed at 7:30 pm on Mondays until the fifth episode, where it moved to the time-slot of 8:40 pm on Wednesdays. ==Format== Each week, a number of single Aussies around Australia, who are looking for 'love', ask three questions to three potential suitors who are behind a wall (which is called the Slide-O Wall from the seventh series). Each potential suitor takes turns to answer these questions and then the contestant has to choose a date only from the potential suitor's answers and voices. The host asks the contestant, \\"Which contestant would you like to choose? 'Contestant number 1', 'number 2' or 'number 3'?\\" The contestant will choose one of these, with each number corresponding to each potential suitor, with '1' being the suitor sitting closest to the wall and number '3' being the person seated furthest. Once the contestant chooses a suitor, they meet the two other potential suitors they did not choose. Then, the contestant and suitor ('the dates') stand on either side of the wall and for the first time, the host reveals the suitor who is behind it by saying the suitor's name while the wall slides away to reveal them. The dates are then given the opportunity to choose from two envelopes which contain two different dates (which are paid for by the show) that they could potentially go on. Once they choose the date, they proceed to walk up a staircase and near the top, the turn around to wave goodbye. The dates then walk away to the top of the staircase which then leads to a backstage area so that they can 'get ready' to go on their date. In the next episode, the dates normally come back to make another appearance and talk about how their date went with the host. At their second visit, a video is shown about their date went and what happened there. Then the dates disclose if they would like to stay together for another date, 'just be friends', or end the relationship altogether. ==Episode status== Archival status of the show is not known, given the wiping of the early eras.

The narrative is set between 1843 and 1848 in the French Prealps and follows a police officer who discovers unpleasant truths about himself during a murder investigation. It was the first book by Giono to be published after World War II and marks the beginning of a new phase in the author's oeuvre. The book was the basis for the 1963 film A King Without Distraction, directed by François Leterrier from a screenplay by Giono. ==Origin== Jean Giono was a pacifist and had participated in the journal La Gerbe which was seen with suspicion after World War II. He was imprisoned in 1944 by commissars from the French Resistance and blacklisted by the Conseil national des écrivains. Un roi sans divertissement was written in the autumn of 1946. The lyrical prose and humanism of Giono's works from the interwar period was replaced by pessimism and sarcastic humour, something which came to characterise many of the author's post-war novels. ==Publication== The book was published by éditions de la Table ronde in June 1947, breaking the embargo from the Conseil national des écrivains and making Un roi sans divertissement the first book by Giono to be published after the war. It was republished by éditions Gallimard in December the same year. The book has been grouped with several other of the author's post-war novels.

Knight's works are mostly portraits; Knight wanted to draw the human face as a child and it continues to be the main thing that he focuses on painting as an adult. Each one of Knight's series of work is stemmed from his autobiographical memory. He works at a downtown Toronto studio that he shares with illustrator Winnie Truong. ==Life and career== Knight was born in Windsor, Ontario in 1980, and moved to Toronto in 1999 for art school. Knight has three other siblings. Growing up in a bakery, where his mother worked as a baker, Knight's pastel palette was influenced by his experiences tinting icing used for baked goods. Knight mixed his color palette by using the technique bakers use to make cake icings - by starting off with a white base and later adding the tint. Knight has described himself as having an awkward and shy personality. Knight's parents gave art supplies as Knight's birthday and Christmas present since he was young, seeing that he had an interest in art. Knight received his degree in 2003, majoring in Painting and Drawing from the Ontario College of Art and Design (AOCAD), with a minor in Curating and Criticism. In most of Knight's twenties, he worked in art galleries during the day and restaurants at night. Knight's works are represented by Katharine Mulherin in Toronto, Spinello Gallery in Miami and Galerie Alain Gutharc in Paris. He claimed that he paints everyday but destroy half of his work. Knight's work was hand-picked by fashion designer Christian Lacroix to be part of a group exhibition, Carte Blanche a Christian Lacroix, at Musée Cognacq-Jay in Paris in November 2014. His work was featured alongside other contemporary artists who are inspired by the 18th century. ==Works== 18th century styles painting like Romanticism, Symbolism, Sturm und Drang, and Rococo have influenced Knight's work. Drawn to the ghostly look of French 17th century portraiture(Baroque) because of the 'heavy white powder make-up that was in vogue at the time', Knight cited the pastels used in the work of Joseph Ducreux and Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun as an influence. Knight often mute the skin tones of his palette so that the characters of his paintings appear powdered and slightly translucent. Obsessed with the French Revolution since he was a kid, having always been inspired by folklore, myth, secrets, gossip, fashion and historical costumes. The works of Thomas Lawrence, John Singer Sargent, Nicolas Poussin, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, and Thomas Gainsborough has influenced Kris Knight as well. The majority of Knight's characters are based on real people, mostly his close friends and family, but sometimes collaged images culled from mass media, self-portraits, and his imagination. Knight's subjects have mostly been young men or androgynous men, admitting that he has a fascination with \\"youth decay\\" - of holding on to one's youth:\\"Our society focuses so much on youth as the pinnacle of beauty that we become poisoned by the obsession of preserving what is naturally fleeting.\\" Knight attributed his love of naming \\"cheesy subversive title\\" to his paintings to growing up gay in \\"unromantic, small farming towns in rural Canada\\". He also compared the titles of his paintings to \\"someone making a bad joke to cheer [the viewer] up\\" because he found most of his paintings have a sad atmosphere. The Lost and Found (2012) In paintings like Mischief, Caught and My Porcelain Life, characters in the portraits are wearing masks. Knight stated that the group of paintings are about \\"a group of disenchanted youths who subtly play with roles of being the hunter and the hunted. As much as the characters in these paintings try to be lost, they are very much aware of who is watching them.\\" Knight said that the characters are often wearing elements of protection—sweaters, furs, masks—that are \\"too delicate to protect or hide anything\\", Knight wanted his characters to be \\"as guarded as they are vulnerable\\". He examined the emotional state of what it is like to feel lost and how the characters return to where they were. The series was Knight's response to feeling \\"a bit burnt out\\" from deadlines. Secrets Are Things We Grow (2013) Knight said that \\"within these portraits are elements of the garden and exercises in pattern work representing how secrets are rooted and grow with time. Other paintings note the bonds formed when secrets are revealed to those we hold closest.\\" Knight elaborates, \\"Within these portraits are elements of the garden and exercises in pattern work representing how secrets are rooted and grow with time. Other paintings note the bonds formed when secrets are revealed to those we hold closest.\\" Smell The Magic (2014) The exhibition was first exhibited at Gucci’s Art Basel event at Spinello Project’s pop-up gallery in Wynwood, Florida,sponsored by the Italian fashion house Gucci. Because of the exhibit location in Miami, Knight was inspired to use brighter colors in this body of work, saying that some of his new paintings are deliberately tropical but in an awkward \\"northerner's first day in the tropics\\" kind of way. Some figures of the paintings have Ouija board pointers for eyes, others have blossoms painted on their faces. ==Gucci Collaboration== In January 2014, a friend notified Knight that his painting's pastel color palette was listed as a color inspiration for Gucci's men's ready-to-wear fall/winter 2014 collection. The collaboration began a month late after the event, with Knight being invited to Rome to meet Gucci's creative director Frida Giannini, a fan of Knight's works, and her team to rework Gucci's iconic Flora print. The original floral print, commissioned by Rodolfo Gucci to Vittorio Accornero in 1966, was applied on a silk scarf as a gift to Princess Grace of Monaco on her trip to the brand's store in Via Monte Napoleone with her husband Prince Rainier. In Knight's reimagining of Gucci's Flora design, Knight referenced ancient pagan Rome; he illustrated plants that women used for healing (poppy, henbane, mandrake); seduction (belladonna, datura); and protection (clover, dandelion, and nightshade), he envisioned for a design that is 'strong, feminine, magical and quietly dangerous'. Knight picked botanicals that either blossomed at night, dawn or dusk but also chose plants that have strong roots for adaptability, persistence and resistance in harsh environments. Knight also cited singer Marianne Faithfull as a muse for the project after spotting a photo of the singer on Gucci’s mood board. The resulted work was applied to a variety of Giannini's design for Gucci's Cruise 2015 season. Giannini played the song Blue Neck Rivierathe from the Montreal band No Joy album, one of the thank-you gifts Knight gave her, for one of her runway shows. Vogue editor Anna Wintour was photographed in a dress featuring Knight’s motif. ==Notes and references * Kris Knight's blog Category:Canadian painters Category:Living people Category:LGBT artists from Canada Category:OCAD University alumni Category:1980 births Category:Artists from Toronto Category:People from Windsor, Ontario ","title":"Kris Knight"},{"id":"46364085","text":"Stephen Ostroff is an American physician.

Microcredentials including Microdegrees act as a pointer to the criteria for and demonstration of the skills represented by the microcredential. Because the credentials are presented in a digital format, they can be parsed automatically for verification over the web and allow for a greater level of granularity than a traditional paper transcript. Microdegrees meet the criteria for Open Educational Data defined by the U.S. Department of Education. Within the hierarchy of educational credentials microdegrees are considered to be \\"certificates\\" requiring a lower level of commitment and rigor than a traditional degree program but serving an important role as a vocational credential. The advent of the microdegree is presented by its promoters as a challenge to the existing degree model as it permits students to utilize accelerated, free and low cost programs to earn credentials of direct relevance to their interests and career ambitions. Microdegrees and other Microcredentials are also seen as a system to facilitate and record lifelong learning. A significant percentage of Microdegree students are working adults seeking career change or advancement. Some institutions that offer Microdegree programs describe themselves as a \\"Micro College\\". In recent years, MOOC platforms have started expanding their offerings of microcredentials as viable substitutes, going as far as offering a blended education model.

Tsinguirides was engaged at the Staatstheater Stuttgart in 1945 and was promoted to soloist in 1957 under ballet director Nicolas Beriozoff. In 1960 she performed in Der Pagodenprinz by John Cranko who later succeeded Beriozoff as director in 1961. She performed in The Lady and the Fool, and in Romeo und Julia. Cranko sent her to study the Benesh Movement Notation in London, which she completed in 1966. The notation, which shows movements of head, shoulders, hips, knees and feet on five lines similar to music notation, is according to experts still the most precise representation of ballet even in the time of video, offering also the possibility of synchronization with the music. Tsinguirides became the first choreologist in Germany in 1966, and preserved all major ballets by Cranko, and later Kenneth MacMillan, and others.

It is a notable example of Gothic church architecture in northern France. The north façade, and, especially the south façade and porch, are some of the best examples of late Flamboyant Gothic architecture in France. == Chronological overview of Notre-Dame de Louviers == The plan of the church today is the result of several major construction campaigns that began at the end of the twelfth century and concluded in the early sixteenth. The building features elements from both the High Gothic and Late Gothic (or Flamboyant) periods. #c. 1190-1240s: chevet, nave, and west façade are constructed #1346: English invaders burn the lantern tower/spire #1385: Spire over the crossing built #1414: Challenge Tower construction begins #1493-96: North facade under construction (architect: Jehan Gillot) #1496-1506: South facade under construction #1506-1510: South porch under construction #1705: Spire destroyed in a severe thunderstorm #Restoration work in the 19th and 20th centuries, including the cementing of the triforium windows and restoration of both interior and exterior sculptures (L. Delahaye and V. Pyanet) #2003-2013: massive structural repairs and repainting of the nave ==Interior features==  Chevet  The chevet, or eastern end of the church containing the altar, has been reworked several times since the thirteenth century. It is difficult to know its original form. Documentary sources do not provide a reliable foundation date so scholars have relied on style.  13th-century nave  Over the course of the early thirteenth century construction probably progressed westward after the completion of the eastern chevet. The nave, or central vessel of the church, is seven bays in length and was originally flanked by one aisle on each side. The elevation of the nave consists of three stories: nave arcade, triforium, and clerestory. The nave columns appear distantly related to Notre-Dame de Paris but closer prototypes can be found in the hemicycle of Rouen Cathedral. A triple bundle of shafts rest on corbels designed to resemble human heads. The shafts pass a very unusual trilobed triforium (the middle level) which was originally open to the space between the aisle vaults and aisle roof. The nave vaults spring about two-thirds up the clerestory (the row of windows that continue along the nave) but were probably lower before the upper parts of the church were modified during the expansion in the 15th and 16th centuries. The nave was restored between 2006-2013 based on traces of medieval paint.  15th- and 16th-century expansions  The church of Notre-Dame de Louviers underwent a dramatic expansion project during the Late Middle Ages. An entirely new aisle was added to the north between 1493 and 1496. According to historical documents, the architect was Jehan Gillot. Mr. Gillot worked in the Late Gothic period, and his design for the expansion project shows this. The prismatic bases of the piers in this part of the church are much higher, the linear vault moldings disappear into piers and walls, vault responds intersect one another, and the window tracery is Flamboyant in nature—it resembles the flickering patterns of a flame. Documentary sources imply that Gillot continued work on the new south nave aisle between 1496-1506 but this has yet to be proven. However, many of the same architectural forms were employed on the south side with the notable omission of the intersecting vault responds. The expansion of the nave necessitated the reworking of the upper parts of the church, which received a glazed triforium (later filled with cement) and a modified system of flying buttresses. The amount of usable interior space increased dramatically as a result of these extensive expansion projects, which were funded in large part by Louviers' cloth guilds and elite patrons, including Guillaume II le Roux, Duke of Bourgtheroulde. Stained glass A great deal of the late medieval stained glass has been lost over time; however, several excellent examples remain intact. The window of the Apparition of Christ to Mary Magdalene is located in the south nave aisle. From left to right, it depicts St. George, Mary Magdalene, Christ, and St. Adrian. Guillaume Le Forestier, governor of Louviers in 1515, donated the window; Muraire restored part of it in 1903. Just to the right is a rectangular stained glass panel depicting the Procession of the Guilds. It is equally significant because it depicts the guilds that made donations to fund the church expansion. Hoisting their blazons, weavers, stretchers, wool workers, and tanners accompany a bishop during a religious procession through the town of Louviers. The glass was visual proof of their patronage and piety.  Nave column sculptures  Relatively large sculptures of the 12 Apostles adorn the nave of Notre-Dame de Louviers. These sculptures rest on foliate corbels just above the capitals of the nave columns. The entire arrangement recalls the design of the upper chapel of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, which would suggest the nave of Notre-Dame de Louviers was still under construction during the late 1240s—the period when Louis IX's celebrated chapel was completed in the capital. The sculptures themselves, however, are probably from the early 16th century, and can be linked to the artistic patronage of Georges d'Amboise at château de Gaillon. The figures—almost Manneristic in style—have undergone varying degrees of restoration, complicating technical studies.  Lantern tower  The lantern tower above the transept crossing has undergone several changes since its original construction in the thirteenth century. Today it features many Flamboyant motifs and structures dating to the early sixteenth century. A tall, slender spire that blew away in a storm in 1705 originally capped the tower.

The tympanum with four rose motifs was part of a regional vocabulary. The trumeau was replaced in 1607. The principal entrance of the church shifted to the south following the completion of the south portal in the early 1500s, effectively reorienting the entire edifice from east-west to north-south in order to embrace the expanding town and to ensure the church remained the major focal point during processions. Challenge Tower The years from 1410-1466 were a particularly troubled and violent time for Louviers. The only construction that occurred in the early fifteenth century was the addition of the \\"Challenge Tower\\" to the church of Notre-Dame de Louviers. Named after a military captain, construction began in 1414. The tower design was influenced by defensive architecture. It features massive walls and enormous sloping buttresses to thwart attackers. The Lovériens told the English it was to be a bell tower, which it later became and remains so today. Its massive construction dominates the west façade of the church. North façade Jehan Gillot began work on the expansion of the north aisle and façade in 1493. Because it faces a narrow street and is less ostentatious than its southern counterpart, the north facade has not received as much attention from restorers. It features four and a half bays, one of which contains a portal leading to the interior. The bays are separated by buttresses capped with pinnacles that shoot upward at least an additional story. The width of each bay is devoted to stained glass windows. The design of the Flamboyant tracery is generally uniform throughout, with only a few small deviations between bays. Only the entry portal features a gable, which pierces the balustrade above. The openwork gable is steeply pitched and complements the tracery in the windows below. The original tier of buttresses and their Late Gothic pinnacles can be seen behind the 1493 expansion. Overall, this expansion is harmonious, refined, and simple—adjectives that do not necessarily describe the modifications made to the exterior of the southern half of the church. South façade and porch These two parts of the church represent the zenith of the Late Gothic craft of masonry and are one of the most \\"justifiably famous\\" examples of the late Flamboyant style in northern France (c. 1480-1525). Its magisterial visual presence offered visual proof of Louviers's stability, power, and wealth. Stylistically, the projecting porch and façade created a visual link between Louviers and Rouen, home to very similar Late Gothic monuments and the seat of the powerful archbishop. A veritable lacework of intricately carved stone, the completion of the façade and south porch in 1510 effectively reoriented the entire church. Subsequently, the south porch and portal became the main point of entry and, ultimately, the focal point of the entire town. Indeed, upon entering Louviers from the south, one witnesses the effect of the alignment of the porch and portal with the \\"Grand-Rue.\\" Sinuous Flamboyant window tracery, tall ogee gables, an openwork balustrade, spiky pinnacles, and countless sculptures nestled in richly-carved nodding niches give the façade an unmatched quality of richness, visual complexity, and dynamism that was never replicated. Within decades of its completion, the great era of medieval Gothic construction in France drew to a close.

She was born in 1959, in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture. == Biography and Accomplishments == She studied in Japan at the School of Ceramic Art in Seto, Aichi from 1979–82, and is a graduate of the Centre Artisanal de Ceramic de L’Ecole Duperre in Paris. Her work resides with the collection of the Harn Museum of Art, the AIC Ariana Museum in Geneva, the Yale University Art Gallery, and The Brooklyn Museum. She was one of five leading female ceramic artists featured in a show at Joan Mirviss Gallery in NYC, entitled, \\"The French Connection: Five Japanese Women Ceramicists and a Passion for France”. == Gender in Japanese Ceramics == Within the global art market, Futamura's work references both modern and classical themes in Japanese ceramics. Her use of naturally occurring, organic textures are combined with traditional shapes, creating unique works of art. Her role within Japanese ceramics is also nontraditional, as women are excluded from the apprentice system of ceramic production. As a result, Futamura's work is both sculptural and functional, but emphasizes self-expression as a fundamental part of her artistic practice. The shift in gender roles occurred post-World War II, marking the development of independent female artists. As secondary education became more open to a wider audience, women were able to study ceramics through universities, rather than entering the apprenticeship system. While Futamura's work in France may be read as indicating the importance of globalization within contemporary artistic practice, it is also important to indicate that her training occurred within a country with a long running history of ceramic arts produced by both men and women. == Work and Ethos == Futamura's work is often inspired by nature, but reflects the natural kiln effects. The texture of her work may appear burned, crushed, creased, charred, or speckled with fine granules. Her materials, from porcelain to terracotta are used to create forms that often appear biomorphic, irregular and almost sexual. In an interview, she mentioned that her work showcases the materiality of her medium, earth. Futamura's artwork can be read within the concept of wabi sabi, or imperfect, incomplete beauty. The irregularity of her pieces only increases their meditative quality. == References  External links == Website : yoshimifutamura.com Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese ceramists ","title":"Yoshimi Futamura"},{"id":"46364303","text":"Xuxa em O Mistério de Feiurinha () is a children's film directed by Tizuka Yamasaki and starring Xuxa Meneghel.

For the first time, Xuxa Meneghel works on a literary adaptation and the author is Pedro Bandeira, an editorial phenomenon for children and youth in Brazil. Banner has sold more than 23 million books. Xuxa, this time, is not the protagonist of the story itself. She plays Cinderella. The Feiurinha of the title, debuting in the cinema, is its daughter Sasha Meneghel. It was the daughter, moreover, who presented Pedro Bandeira to his mother. Xuxa said that at the insistence of author Pedro Bandeira he found that his daughter, Sasha, played the part. But she did not watch her daughter's recordings, because she was \\"very nervous\\". Beside the two, Luciano Szafir did not restrain his tears when watching the film for the first time. \\"I did not know how to handle it. When I saw footage of Sasha, I cried about five times,\\" he confided. The actor, who plays the nearsighted and amusing prince of Cinderella, role of Xuxa, also lives a wanderer, father of Feiurinha, made by his heiress. \\"I wanted to do any scene next to Sasha, I could be a beggar, just to get through it,\\" he said, who said he was impressed by his daughter's performance. \\"If she did not know, she would not believe that she had never done a job as an actress,\\" he said proudly. The film marks the second partnership of Luciano and Xuxa in theaters. The two had already worked on Xuxa and the Goblins in 2002. Directed by Tizuka Yamazaki and written by Gabriela Amaral, the film counts on the participation of Brazilian artists like Angélica, Luciano Huck. The film also counts on the participation of the late TV hots Hebe Camargo who commented on his participation of working with Xuxa \\"I have very proud to be friends with Xuxa. She develops a barbaric work for the children in her foundation [Xuxa Menenghel], as well as doing incredible things on TV and in the movies. I'm in this movie for her,\\" said Hebe. ==Release== The first pre-premiere of the film took place on a cruise on 12 and 13 December. The route of the ship was: Rio de Janeiro-Búzios-Santos. The premiere of the film took place on December 19, 2009 in Rio de Janeiro, The release took place on December 25, 2009, in 216 rooms throughout Brazil. In Angola, was released on 24 January 2010. In the U.S. state of Florida, the launch took place on April 16, 2010. ==Reception== Critical response Xuxa em O Mistério de Feiurinha received negative acclaim from critics, the film was mostly criticized for its script and bad performances, but some performances were praised by critics. On Cineweb, he gave the film a star, AdoroCinema, which assigns a weighted average score, has a score of 2.6 based on 11 reviews, having received three and a half stars out of five. The Filmow, gave three stars of five to the film. The Cineclick wrote that \\"The performances are mediocre: Xuxa is always the same, the debutant Sasha tries, but luckily her role is small and it does not make much difference if she is bad or not, but Luciano Szafir is ashamed. exception is Zezé Motta, who is a talented actress who even in the role of assistant of the writer, can illuminate, on the scene, even this poor movie. Túlio Moreira of Cinema com Rapadura, gave a first note to the film, defining it as \\"a legitimate case of cinematic nepotism\\", writing \\"Xuxa summons her patron of hots, singers, ex- boyfriends and celebrities of the moment to compose a mise-en-scène absolutely fond of content and absurdly worried about sizing the screen for the ego of personalities of the so-called Brazilian television culture. If the theme is interesting by showing the princess routine, its illusions and achievements after the \\"happily ever after,\\" any chance of developing this context is useless after the first bouts of starry on the film.\\" Mateus Nagime of Cineplayers, gave Xuxa in Feiurinha's, note 1.5 and a star, writing that \\"All celebrities play the role of \\"I'm here on the screen, do not demand talent.\\" Sasha, however, overcomes all barriers. does not have a facial expression and much less talent, a characteristic that he inherited from his mother, who has already been caged with bad performances since Love Strange Love (1982) three decades ago, or his father, who probably has one of the worst performances in film history in this film. completed his criticism by writing that \\"The scenes are poorly structured. In the first part it counts on a band of princess screaming and talking at the same time, trying to evoke laughs, whereas in the history of Feiurinha, Sasha Meneghel can not transmit the smallest charisma, besides being totally false to have still compassion with the witches who are to arrest for more than ten years. Ana Martinelli of R7, describes the film as full of \\"cliches, obvious dialogues and repetitions\\" and says that \\"a poor resource was no longer enough, the princesses are no longer in their prime. justification for the writer to live on a ship is some sponsor's requirement. Author of the book O Fantástico Mistério de Feiurinha, that was adapted for the cinema by Xuxa, the writer Pedro Bandeira affirmed to the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo that Sasha - hots daughter who lives the title role in the film - has no talent at all.\\" Following publication, Bandeira denied the claim, claiming that the publication was distorted. Box office The Ministry of Culture released the production company Conspiração Filmes to raise until the end of the year 6.4 million reais in resources via Law Rouanet to O Mistério de Feiurinha.

She attended a number of schools which included Columbia University Medical School, Rutgers University, University of Alabama, and University of Oxford. In 2001 she became a part of The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and, along with being the chair of Virology, is also the co-organiser of the medical microbiology course. The virus that she has dedicated most of her career to is Bluetongue disease that affects sheep and cattle. She became interested in this virus after attending a symposium and was intrigued by the fact that not much was known about the virus that was causing such a nasty and sometimes fatal disease. ==Education== Roy went to Presidency College in Calcutta, India, where she was born. Thereafter, she received a scholarship to study at New York University where she received her PhD in Molecular Virology. Whilst studying biological sciences she met biologist Sol Spiegelman. Roy then spent three years in a post-doctoral position in RNA Virology at Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University. After her post-doctoral work, she went to the University of Alabama at Birmingham to begin her own Blue Tongue Virus research group. She became a professor at University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1987. Roy then received the Fogarty Fellowship at the University of Oxford in 1997 where she established a second virology lab. In 2001 Roy moved to The Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as a Virology professor where she leads a research groups. == Research == Throughout her career, Roy has improved understanding on basic molecular and cell biology, replication and the transmission of a variety viruses. Her research has led to advances in the development of improved diagnostic assays, more efficacious virus-like protein (VLP) vaccines, vaccines for Bluetongue and African Horse sickness virus (AHSV) and the possibility of other therapeutics relating to these diseases. Roy's research has been published in multiple highly acclaimed journals alongside contributing to several published books as a guest writer/editor. Roy's current research includes gaining a clearer understanding around the blue tongue virus at a molecular level, the potential for developing vaccines for Bluetongue virus and the African Horse sickness virus, RNA-RNA interactions and packaging, cell entry and transcription activation of non-enveloped dsRNA viruses and defining the cis and trans acting factors in the assembly of the Bluetongue virus. ==Research interests== *RNA Virology *Viral Genetics *Protein Function & Capsid Assembly *Replication of Segmented Genome & Packaging *Virus Trafficking in Host Cell *Technology Development & Generation of Particulate Vaccines ==Contributions to our understanding of Blue Tongue Virus== *Viral Structure *Viral Assembly *RNA Replication *Virus Release *Supervised Post-doctoral & Post-graduate Researchers *Published close to 300 Research Papers *Served on Many Different Scientific Organizations, Committees, & Boards *Organized International Conferences *In 2006 Dr. Polly Roy was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences for Conference on Viral Assembly *Delivered a talk at Women in Health 2018 Lecture series - How a virus works: a journey ==Honors and awards== * Senior Investigator Award from the Wellcome Trust (2012) * Recipient of the Indian Science Congress General President's Gold Medal, awarded by the Prime Minister of India (2012) * 'Innovator of the Year' Finalist, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (2012) *The Indian Science Congress General President's Gold Medal * Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours, for services to virus research * Elected Fellow of the Society of Biology (2014) ==References External links == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Indian virologists Category:Indian women microbiologists Category:New York University alumni Category:Academics of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Category:University of Alabama at Birmingham faculty Category:Academics of the University of Oxford Category:Scientists from Kolkata Category:Bengali chemists Category:20th-century Indian biologists Category:20th-century Indian women scientists Category:21st-century Indian biologists Category:Women scientists from West Bengal Category:21st-century Indian women scientists ","title":"Polly Roy"},{"id":"46364332","text":"Sandra L. Quackenbush is an American virologist working as an Associate Professor of Retrovirology at the Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Quackenbush also serves as the Associate Head of Graduate Education for the Microbiology, Immunology & Pathology Department within the college. Her research interests include viral pathogenesis, with emphasis in viral-induced oncogenesis. ==Education== Sandra Quackenbush received her bachelor's degree in animal science nutrition from Ohio State University in 1979, obtained her Masters in retroviral pathogenesis from Colorado State University in 1987 and her Ph.D. also in retroviral pathogenesis in 1994 from Colorado State University. She has had several articles published within her field of study. ==Research contributions== Summary of work Quackenbush has worked with both gammaretrovirus (feline leukemia virus) and epsilonretrovirus (walleye dermal sarcoma virus) extensively. Gammaretroviruses are single stranded RNA viruses that are present in the genome of vertebrates including reptiles, birds, amphibians, and mammals. Epsilonretroviruses are viruses that infect fish, and have a single stranded RNA genome. Retroviruses within these genera cause disease by containing RNA sequences that code for proteins that promote oncogenesis which leads to sarcomas and leukemias. Through her work with two genera of retroviruses, Quackenbush determined mutations to Gammaretrovirus (feline leukemia virus) makes them less lethal, and Epsilretrovirus (walleye dermal sarcoma virus) contains sequences that encode for cyclin proteins, leading to the proliferation of normal cells and eventually giving a means for cancer cells to become abundant Most notable work Her most notable work focuses on feline leukemia virus. This report was published in Science in 1988 and has been cited over 200 times. The research found that replication-defective strains of feline leukemia virus can cause deadly immunodeficiency syndrome in felines. Results of the study revealed that a less fatal form of immunodeficiency syndrome could be induced with mutations to the feline leukemia virus. Phylogeny of Retroviruses Most recent publication The most recent published study Quackenbush was involved in was the study of walleye dermal sarcoma virus. This research investigated the role of retroviral cyclin (RV-cyclin) in sarcoma progression in walleyes as a comparable study to human cancer. It was determined that he RV-cyclin bound to cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and increased its activity. The genes IEGs are normally stimulated for transcription by cyclin C with an up regulation in CDK8 IEGs are expressed at a higher rate for a period of time. Since IEGs encode for cell proliferation a mutation in the CDK8 could lead to dermal sarcoma. This investigation determined the mechanism behind retrovirus-induced oncogenesis caused by walleye dermal sarcoma virus. These implications would later be used to determine other retroviral-induced oncogenesis in human cancers. Current research Quackenbush has current laboratory research focusing on viral-induced oncogenesis, in fish retroviruses. Studies investigate how a virus (walleye dermal sarcoma virus) is involved in the introduction of sarcomas. Her lab is trying to determine the mode by which transcription, apoptosis, and transduction are controlled by viral regulatory proteins such as kinases. Studies focus on the walleye dermal sarcoma virus and inducing sarcomas. ==Publications== *The retroviral cyclin of walleye dermal sarcoma virus binds cylin-dependent kinases 3 and 8. *Transgenic expression of walleye dermal sarcoma virus rv-cyclin (orf A) in Zebrafish does not result in tissue proliferation. *Cancers induced by piscine retroviruses. *Non-primate mammalian and fish retroviruses ==Honors== *Named an Outstanding Educator at the University of Kansas in 2001 by the Mortar Board ==See also== *Retroviruses *Viral pathogenesis *Oncogenesis *Feline leukemia virus *Walleye *Sarcoma ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American virologists Category:Colorado State University faculty Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:Colorado State University alumni ","title":"Sandra Quackenbush"},{"id":"46364350","text":"Erin Michelle Wüthrich (born August 10, 1992), also known as Aryn Wüthrich and professionally as Ryn Weaver, is an American singer and songwriter who first gained attention with the single \\"OctaHate\\" in June 2014.

Francisco Olazábal committed 30 years to his evangelistic healing ministry. Olazábal held healing campaigns across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. ==Early life== Francisco Olazábal was born on October 12, 1886 in El Verano, Sinaloa, Mexico. Francisco's mother, Refugio Velazquez, left Catholicism and converted to Methodism in 1898 in Mazatlán, Mexico. Olazabal's father, Juan Olazábal, abandoned him and his mother after his mother converted and she became a lay evangelist (SOURCE-lecture notes). Olazabal left his mother in 1902 to travel to San Francisco, California to visit family. At this time Olazábal, through George Montgomery's ministry, rededicated his life to Jesus, returned to Mexico and to the Methodist Church. In 1911 Francisco Olazábal immigrated to the United States and moved to El Paso, Texas, where he pastored a Spanish-speaking Methodist Church. In 1914 Francisco Olazábal married Macrina Orozco, his childhood sweetheart. Bishop A.W. Leonard ordained Olazábal as a minister in the Methodist Church in 1916. However, Olazábal left the Methodist Church to preach the \\"full Gospel\\" after having converted to Pentecostalism under the ministry of George and Carrie Montgomery in 1916. The General Council of the Assemblies of God ordained Olazábal on September 24, 1916. On February 14, 1918, Robert J. Craig laid hands on Olazábal and ordained him to the Assemblies of God. ==Affiliations with notable Pentecostals & Christian Evangelists== Aimee Semple McPherson, a famous Pentecostal evangelist and founder of the Foursquare Gospel denomination, referred to Olazábal as the \\"Mexican Billy Sunday\\". McPherson invited Olazábal to preach at Bethel Temple. In March 1927 Olazábal and his congregation were invited to attend services at Aimee Semple McPherson's church, Angelus Temple in Los Angeles. McPherson sought to merge her Foursquare Gospel denomination and the Latin American Council of Christian Churches, but the Council rejected her proposition. At this time, McPherson began a Spanish-speaking Foursquare ministry in East Los Angeles. Alice E. Luce-founder of the Latin American Bible Institute and H. C. Ball helped pioneer the Latino Pentecostal movement and influenced Olazábal's ministry. While at Moody Bible Institute in 1911, Olazabal worked under James M. Gray and Reuben A. Torrey. Torrey believed that baptism with the Holy Spirit was a \\"definite experience\\" and required for a Christian life, a belief that Olazábal rejected at this time in his life as a Methodist. After a brief stint at Moody, Olazábal would go on to minister at Torrey's Church of the Open Door in Los Angeles. Rev. Homer Tomlinson—Olazábal's good friend and pastor of Jamaica Tabernacle Church of God. ==Education== In San Luis Potosí, Mexico, Olazábal attended Wesleyan School of Theology from 1908 to 1910. In 1911, he attended Moody Bible Institute in Chicago for one semester. ==Ministry== Francisco Olazábal committed 30 years to his evangelistic healing ministry. Olazabal held healing campaigns across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. Before attending Moody, in 1911, Olazábal pastored a Spanish-speaking Methodist congregation in El Paso, Texas. After a semester at Moody Bible Institute, Olazábal followed Reuben A. Torrey to Los Angeles to pastor to the Mexican congregants at Church of the Open Door. After parting ways with Torrey, Olazabal went on to pastor in Spanish-speaking Methodist Churches in California; for example: the Northern Methodist Episcopal Church in Pasadena, California and the Northern Methodist Episcopal Church in San Francisco Bay area. Olazábal pastored Mision Mexicana de Pasadena until 1916. In 1920 Olazábal began Buenas Nuevas Mission in El Paso, Texas. In 1922 Olazábal founded a Bible college in El Paso, Texas. In 1923 Francisco Olazábal formed Latin American Council of Christian Churches, the first independent Latino Pentecostal denomination in the United States. In 1929 Olazábal held a healing campaign in Chicago. In 1931 Olazabal's evangelic healing campaign attracted over 100,000 people to Spanish Harlem. Olazábal's services took place at Cavalry Baptist Church in Brooklyn. Olazábal's \\"Puerto Rico Para Cristo\\" campaign in 1936 was considered unsuccessful. On September 10, 1936 Olazábal announced his intention to unite with The Church of God, at that time the group under the leadership of A.J. Tomlinson which would later become the Church of God of Prophecy. ==Death== On June 1, 1937 Olazábal was critically injured in an automobile accident near Alice Springs, Texas. Olazábal died in the hospital from internal bleeding on June 9, 1937. Francisco Olazábal is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in East Los Angeles. == References Further reading== Espinosa, Gastón (2008).

She wrote several plays about women and the problems they faced in a patriarchal society that run parallel with the second wave of the feminist movement in Japan. Even though she did not strictly identify herself as a feminist, she believed that the system of a male dominated society had to change in order for women to gain equal rights as their male counterpart. ==Biography== Early life and career Kishida was born in 1946 in the Nagano Prefecture, Japan. In 1974, Kishida graduated from the Law School of Chuo University. She was qualified for the bar, but instead chose to join Shūji Terayama’s theater company Tenjō Sajiki (Ceiling Gallery). She collaborated with Terayama, who she viewed as a mentor, in writing Shintokumaru (Poison Boy), The Audience Seats, and Lemmings. Even though Terayama had collaborated with several people, Kishida was the only one in his troupe to have collaborated with him several times. It is not clear as to who wrote which parts of the plays. Kishida, with the permission from Terayama, founded her own company Because of My Older Brother Theater and wrote her own plays that were independent from Tenjō Sajiki in 1978. Kishida wanted to write plays about women and issues that they faced against as the main focus. Kishida changed the name of her theater company to The Kishida Office after she had left Tenjō Sajiki in 1981. It wasn't until after her mentor's death in 1983 that she had established herself as being completely independent from Tenjō Sajiki and left Terayama's shadow. Later life and career In 1983, The Kishida Office became The Kishida Office & The Optimists Group after merging with Yoshio Wada's theater company, The Optimists Group. Kishida's play Itojigoku (Thread Hell), was first produced in 1984 and won the Kishida Prize for Drama in 1985. She began to write her plays independently again after 1993 with her company, The Kishida Rio Company. At this time, she was interested in Korea's art and even invited Korean actors to create bilingual plays with the actors of her company. Her play Tori yo, Tori yo, Aoi Tori yo (Bird, Bird, Blue Bird!) deals with the destruction of Korea's language and culture due to Japan's occupation in Korea. While working with the Singaporean director Ong Keng Sen, Kishida rewrote several of William Shakespeare's plays for performances in multiple languages. In 1997, Kishida wrote Lear and Ong Keng Sen was the director of the play. She wrote her own version of Othello in 2001 called Desdemona. Both Desdemona and Lear were written with characters from all around the world and different backgrounds including a noh actor, a Burmese puppeteer, and a Korean musician. Kishida became the lead organizer of 3rd Asian Women's Theatre Conference after Kahoru Kisaragi died in 2001. She died on June 28, 2003 at a hospital in Okaya. Each year on the anniversary of her death, members of her theater company hold an event called RIOFEST, where actors and companies come together and perform Kishida's plays. ==Works== Knock Knock was one of her collaborative plays with Terayama. Many people collaborated in creating the play that experimented with multiple authorship, but Kishida was responsible for writing a large portion of the play, including the public bath sequence. Knock was one of Tenjō Sajiki's largest street performances. The sequences of the play were dictated by a \\"time schedule\\", but actors were free to say their lines whenever they wanted to. The actors body movements were also regarded as being more important to the performance than the spoken dialogue. Thread Hell The play Thread Hell takes place in a silk thread factory, which is in reality a prostitution house, in 1939. The story revolves around 12 women, all named after Hanafuda cards, and two girls named Mayu (meaning cocoon) and a girl referred to as School Girl. Mayu comes to the factory in search of her mother and has no memories. After she finds her mother amongst the workers at the factory, Mayu becomes infuriated that her mother chose to be a prostitute and abandon her role as a mother to Mayu. In a fit of anger and an attempt to cut all connections with her mother, Mayu kills her mother. The play criticizes what little power women have in a traditional family oriented household. The silk thread factory represents a family house and the women are a part of the house, but do not have full membership and rights that the rest of the family have. ==NotesReferences== *Cody, Gabrielle H., and Evert Sprinchorn.

Hundreds of churches were born out of his ministry, and he was a pioneer in the healing ministry of Pentecostalism as a whole, leading hundreds of healings during his lifetime. He became a leader in the Burning Bush movement before attending the Azusa Street Revival and subsequently devoting the rest of his life to healing evangelism and planting Pentecostal churches in the nation and across the globe. ==Early life== Garr was born in Danville, Kentucky, on July 27, 1875, the youngest child in his family by 12 years. He was baptized at age seven at a local Baptist church, after having a conviction of sin. He continued to feel distant from God, however, as he did not have the real experience with God that he had expected post-baptism. He remained hungry for spiritual encounters in his young age, even traveling to Charleston, Virginia, for a Presbyterian Church meeting. As a teen, he struggled with his relationship with churches and God, and began using tobacco. While in Kentucky for business, Garr met a preacher from the Holiness movement. Garr believed the preacher's conviction that he was free of sin, and felt inspired by that notion. After this meeting, Garr said he felt the call of God to preach, but resisted that call initially. Garr later enrolled in Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky, in the fall of 1898 to study ministry. Shortly thereafter, he married his wife, Lillian Anderson, on March 12, 1899, and withdrew from Asbury College. They both became ordained with the Methodist Church and the International Apostolic Prayer Union, led by Martin Wells Knapp. ==Career== Through Knapp, the Garrs met leaders of the Burning Bush movement and moved to Chicago to join it. During his time with the movement, Garr was exposed to the use of technology to spread ministry and the use of free healings, which would later affect his ability to spread the Pentecostal faith. As Garr and his wife continued to gain success and more responsibility within the movement, they were asked to pastor a small revival meeting in Kewanee, Illinois, for the Burning Bush and the Pillars of Fire, another Holiness group. Their meeting drew wide success, and they soon held more meetings. Garr eventually resigned from the leadership of the Kewanee congregation in 1903, but still remained part of the Burning Bush movement. In 1904, the Garrs moved to Danville, Virginia, to lead a new congregation for 18 months. By February 1906, the Garrs moved to Los Angeles by request of the Burning Bush leaders. Garr was named the west coast director of the movement, and his first decision was to get a 1,000-seat facility, an upgrade from the smaller venue the movement had been using. He gradually became disenchanted with the movement, however, and decided to begin visiting the Azusa Street Revival led by William J. Seymour. Lillian soon attended a meeting with him and she was consequently baptized in the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues. Garr himself was baptized in the Holy Spirit on June 16, 1906, in the bell tower of the Burning Bush facility. He went on to shut down that church and combine it with the Azusa Street Mission. He brought hundreds of new attendees to Azusa, helping the previously struggling ministry grow. Three weeks after Garr's experience, he said God called on him to take Pentecostalism to India and China. In congruence with this, Garr was taken off of the editor list for the Burning Bush magazine and was denounced by other leaders of the Burning Bush movement. Before they arrived in India and China, however, the Garrs stopped in Danville to spread the Pentecostal message to their former congregations. Gifts of the Holy Spirit were given to many in the congregation. They then went on to India and arrived in Calcutta, where Garr began preaching on January 13, 1907. He ministered there for three months, believing that God had given him the gift of the Bengali language because one of the attendees at Azusa Street reported recognizing the languages he spoke in tongues as 'languages of India' and Garr heard himself say 'Bengali' before moving to Bombay.McGee, G.B. \\"Garr, Alfred Goodrich, Sr.\\" Edited by Stanley M Burgess and Ed M Van der Maas. The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements. Grand Rapids, Mich: Zondervan Pub. House, 2002. By October 8, 1907, the Garrs were in Hong Kong. Garr preached about repentance and restitution, and many in the meetings had convictions of sin. In the spring of 1908, the Garrs were back in Los Angeles, after the Lord spoke to them about the Pentecostal movement struggling in the states. They decided to travel the states for 16 months to spread the gospel and message of Pentecostalism. During this time, Garr met with Joseph H. King, who went on to become the leader of the Pentecostal Holiness Church. The Garrs went on to travel to Toronto and participate in a meeting where many emerging Pentecostal leaders, such as Aimee Semple McPherson, were also in attendance. ==Later life and legacy== In the fall of 1909, the Garrs returned to Hong Kong. Garr then decided to open a missionary home, and shift his focus from pastoring churches to planting them. On April 9, 1911, the Garrs had a son, Alfred Gaeleton Garr, Jr. By 1914, the Garrs were back in Los Angeles. Garr rented out a large building for a new congregation he named The Garage. By this time he also decided to live by the Finished Work doctrine and help unite the fractioning Pentecostal movement. He then joined the Assemblies of God. Lillian died on April 12, 1916, and Garr went on to marry Hannah Erickson on July 26, 1918. They moved to Los Angeles in 1919. In September 1922, Garr partnered with Hannah's father, R.L. Erickson, to evangelize in open-air meetings that included healing services and prayers for the sick. There were several healings and the number of attendees swelled. After this success, Garr went on to travel for the next five years, evangelizing and planting more churches in his wake. In April 1930, Garr and his family arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina. He held meetings in a tent in a vacant lot and they gradually grew in size after a dramatic healing that caught the attention of local media. Garr then built a wooden tabernacle to increase the size of the crowd that could attend a meeting. The tabernacle was soon bested by the Garr Auditorium, which opened on June 18, 1933. Garr continued to train hundreds of missionaries and ministers until he died on July 23, 1944. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1930 deaths Category:American Pentecostal pastors Category:People from Danville, Kentucky ","title":"Alfred Goodrich Garr"},{"id":"46364479","text":"The evangelical practices began in the early 1900s in Colombia. Throughout the 20th century, there was a widespread occurrence of Colombians transitioning to Pentecostalism. == The Beginning of Pentecostalism == Pentecostalism was first introduced in Bucaramanga, Colombia, in 1936 by Canadian citizens, Verner Larsen with his wife and younger son. After two years of evangelizing in Colombia, Larsen had made no progress with converting people to Pentecostalism. Along with his failing work, he has to deal with the trauma of his wife passing away during childbirth leaving him with two children who he sends to other missionaries while he stays in Colombia to continue his work. Despite dealing with life altering events, a small Pentecostal group was started. From this tiny spark, other missionaries from the United States traveled to Colombia to hear the Pentecostal message and spread the word. In Bucaramanga, Larsen and his new wife, Fayette Barnard, founded a new church in a rented house for everyone to practice Pentecostalism in. After some time, the couple decided to travel back to Canada. While making their trip, they missed a flight and got as far as Barranquilla. With this unforeseen opportunity, they began to evangelize on the streets. The results were so promising, they decided to stay in Barranquilla, one of the poorest barrios of the city. == Social Dislocation == After the establishing of two oneness Pentecostal churches by the 1950s, there was a change in Colombia. Starting in 1946, many foreign missionaries began to leave Colombia for their own safety because of La Violencia. With most of the foreign missionaries leaving, Pentecostal religion began to transform into a religion that Colombians could do in private. Rather than drastically changing the public realm it sought to change the private realm, home and family to the centre of both the men and women's lives. Helping to improve the lives of women who were victims of the Machismo and men who were constantly born into the stereotypes.Therefore, with this absence, the time of La Violencia also became the Period of the Awakening. Many people began to secretly follow Pentecostalism. From the 1950s-1970's, Latin America experienced a period of massive urbanization and rapid modernization. With this growth, the socio-economic status of the cities began to change. The Pentecostal churches were on the outside of cities since the first movement. Once people began to move into the city who could afford it, it began to push more to the outskirts of the city. Therefore, more people were being introduced to the Pentecostal churches at this time. The overall message of Pentecostalism and community feel of the churches recreated for the migrants a community or social and material exchange. This community feel and influx of lower-class people created the stereotype that Pentecostalism was for the poor. The appeal of the Pentecostal church for the poor in that it offers practical services that ease the strain of daily life. == Rejection of Catholicism == For years leading up to the Evangelical movement, Catholicism had been the primary religion in Colombia. The Pentecostal movement gave people a new idea surrounding religion. \\"To be Colombian meant one was Catholic.\\" When [La Violencia] began in Colombia, people were looking for outlets or new ways to express themselves which make Pentecostalism more appealing. == Growing political influence == Recently, Pentecostal and Neo- charismatic churches strive for political power, not only in Colombia, but in whole Latin America. Usually, pentecostal churches and affiliated politicians support free market and christian right positions, which are more radical than those of US american counterparts. The Evangelical opposition in the Colombian peace agreement referendum is considered for many pivotal in its rejection. ==References== Category:Pentecostalism in South America Category:Protestantism in Colombia ","title":"Pentecostalism in Colombia"},{"id":"46364484","text":"Penicillium lacus-sarmientei is an anamorph species of the genus of Penicillium which was isolated from soil of the shores of the Lake Sarmiento in the Chilean Tierra del Fuego.ATCC == Further reading == * == References == lacus-sarmientei Category:Fungi described in 1986 ","title":"Penicillium lacus-sarmientei"},{"id":"46364485","text":"is a contemporary Japanese playwright notable for his plays that frequently comment on social and political issues in Japan. His most prominent plays are The Attic (屋根裏 Yaneura, 2002), Come Out (カムアウト Kamu auto, 1989), Tokyo Trial (トーキョー裁判 Tōkyō saiban, 1988), and Epitaph for the Whales (くじらの墓標 Kujira no bohyō, 1993). In his works, he focuses on dramatizing real-life events, and also depicts the historical past. In 1983, he founded his own theater company called the Phosphorescence Troupe (燐光群 Rinkōgun). Sakate is currently the president of the Japanese Playwrights Association, and the director of both the Japan Directors Association and Japanese Center of International Theater Institute. ==Biography== Sakate was born in Okayama, Japan in 1962. He studied Japanese literature at Keiō University in Tokyo. During his time at Keiō University, he was inspired and learned from Tetsu Yamazaki, a second wave playwright, to utilize theater as a method to confront contemporary issues in society. He later joined Yamazaki’s theater company called Transposition 21. Historical Events The 1980s in Japan was a time of economic growth and prosperity. Japanese arts and culture had also expanded to more modern forms of media such as television broadcasts, magazines, manga, and anime. Japanese theater in the 1980s was characterized by playwrights focusing more on the idea of “little theater.” Foundations like the Japan Arts Fund have helped to create more funding and promote Japanese theater on an international level. In the 1990s, a time period also known as the Lost Decade, the economic prosperity Japan had experienced came to a halt when Japan’s bubble economy collapsed. This period was characterized by a number of economic issues, an aging population, high unemployment rates, and lack of stable lifetime careers. These events translate into Sakate’s works through his criticisms of society’s issues. Sakate directly discusses specific controversial and historical events of this era in his plays, such as the occupation of Okinawa by the United States in the aftermath of World War II in The Last of the Okinawa Milk Plant (沖縄ミルクプラントの最后 Okinawa miruku puranto no saigo, 1998), the 1995 Subway Sarin Incident in Breathless, and the March 11, 2011 Great East Japan earthquake in some of his latest plays Dropping By the House and A Problem of Blood. ==Career== Phosphorescence Troupe (燐光群 Rinkōgun) Drawing influence from Yamazaki and fellow playwright Hirata Oriza, he created his own theater company Phosphorescence Troupe (燐光群 Rinkōgun) in 1983. Along with his plays that reveal commentary on Japanese society, he was also active in the radical angura movement that flourished in the 1960s. The Phosphorescence Troupe focuses on performing mostly Sakate’s works and plays, and they have been met with positive reviews from outside Japan. In 2007, The Attic made its first American premiere in Manhattan, New York. In The New York Times, editor Ginia Bellafante describes Sakate’s language usage in the play as “economical [and] poignant”. In this play, Sakate focuses on the social phenomenon in Japan known as hikikomori, where young adults withdraw from society and isolate themselves typically in their homes. For the company’s 30th anniversary, the Phosphorescence Troupe presented four of Sakate’s original plays: Honchos’ Meeting in Cowra (カウラの班長会議 Kaura no hanchō kaigi, 2013), Return Home (帰還 Kikan), The Attic (屋根裏 Yaneura, 2002), and his newest play, There Was A Cinema Here (ここには映画館があった Koko ni wa eigakan ga atta, 2013). Influences Yamazaki’s work in Transposition 21 heavily influenced Sakate’s theater work, as it was the first kind of theater he had encountered. Inspired from his time in the theater company, he established his own company on this principle. By using real live and historical events as a basis for his plays, they are able to concentrate on political and social commentary going on in modern Japan. Sakate was also influenced by Yamazaki’s journalistic style of writing social criticism by dramatizing contemporary events. The commentary and criticism made within his plays is not solely his view on these incidents, but instead they are a shared opinion of the troupe. The topics that his plays directly addresses are usually taboo or controversial topics within society. Other figures that significantly impacted the style of Sakate’s works were European playwrights Anton Chekhov and Henrik Ibsen. Sakate has adapted and translated several of Chekhov's works into the nō style, thus creating his contemporary nō series. In 2010, these adapted plays were collected into The Contemporary Nō Collection (現代能楽集 Gendai nōgakushū). Although Chekhov and Ibsen were not part of the nō style, Sakate took these works and created them to fit the general view of nō and also making unique adaptations to create his own style. Plays of Chekhov he translated include The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard, and Three Sisters. ==Themes== Through his plays, Sakate challenges a plethora of contemporary issues such as social and political issues, censorship, and sexuality. In Epitaph for the Whales (くじらの墓標 Kujira no bohyō, 1993), he presents the issues related to the 1988 whaling ban and the reactions against it. This play is an example of a “dream play”, and is also the start of a series known as “contemporary nō”, in which the play takes place in a dream. The Attic (屋根裏 Yaneura, 2002) is an example of the lives that take place amongst those with antisocial syndromes. He also satirizes Japan’s legal system in response to the bombing of a Korean Airlines plane in Tokyo Trial (トーキョー裁判 Tōkyō saiban, 1988), and explores female sexuality in Come Out (カムアウト Kamu auto, 1989). Social criticism is the focus in The Last of the Okinawa Milk Plant (沖縄ミルクプラントの最后 Okinawa miruku puranto no saigo, 1998) in where he writes about the problems related to the US military in Okinawa in the aftermath World War II. In his newest work, There Was A Cinema Here (ここには映画館があった Koko ni wa eigakan ga atta, 2013), he presents criticism of the lack of nostalgia in society by reminiscing about the times in Japan where movie theaters were the center of entertainment and life. Not only are his plays harsh criticisms of the modern society, they also present questions about the nature of theater itself. Other playwrights at the time, like Ai Nagai, offered a different approach to these issues. They often wrote in a more comical way to satirize societal issues. In light of the 1st anniversary of the March 11, 2011 Great East Japan earthquake, Sakate and several other prominent Japanese and American playwrights collaborated in Shinsai: Theaters for Japan. This event took play in New York City at the Segal Theater and included other notable playwrights such as Hirata Oriza, Okada Toshiki, and Nen Ishihara. Sakate’s contributed plays, Dropping By the House and A Problem of Blood, dealt with several issues related to the disaster such as the fear of radiation, generational differences, and the effort to create a sense of everyday life in the midst of disaster. The funds raised from the plays were directly allocated to theater companies in Japan affected by the disaster. The triple disaster in 2011, which consisted of an earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown, took the lives of over 18,000 people and thousands missing, injured, or displaced from their homes. ==Awards and nominations== As a playwright, he has been awarded several accolades such as the Fifteenth Kinokuniya Drama Award in 1990 and the Kishida Prize for Drama in 1991 for Breathless (ブレスレス Buresuresu, 1990). This play focuses on the issue of Tokyo’s garbage disposal problem and the events of the 1995 Subway Sarin Incident. His works have also been published and translated in over 10 languages. *Kishida Prize for Drama (1991) **Breathless (ブレスレス Buresuresu, 1990) *Tsuruya Nanboku Drama Award **Won: DA-RU-MA-SA-N-GA-KO-RO- N-DA (だるまさんがころんだ Daruma san ga koronda, 2004) (2005) **Nominated for: ***The Boiling Point of the Sea (海の沸点 Umi no futten, 1997) (1998) ***The Emperor and The Kiss (天皇と接吻 Ten'nō to seppun, 1999) (2000) ***Pikadon Kijimunā (ピカドン・キジムナー Pikadon kijimunaa, 1997) (2002) ***The Attic (屋根裏 Yaneura, 2002) (2003) *Yomiuri Prize for Literature *Yomiuri Prize for Theater **Best Director Awards: ***The Emperor and The Kiss (天皇と接吻 Ten'nō to seppun, 1999) (2000) ***The Attic (屋根裏 Yaneura, 2002) (2003) ***DA-RU-MA-SA-N-GA-KO-RO-N-DA (だるまさんがころんだ Daruma san ga koronda, 2004) (2005) *Fifteenth Kinokuniya Drama Award (1990) *Asahi Performing Arts Award ==Notable Works== *Come Out (カムアウト Kamu auto, 1989) *Tokyo Trial (トーキョー裁判 Tōkyō saiban, 1988) *A Dangerous Story (危険な話 Kiken na hanashi, 1988) *Breathless (ブレスレス Buresuresu, 1990) *Epitaph of the Whales (くじらの墓標 Kujira no bohyō, 1993) *The Capital of the Kingdom of the Gods (神々の国の首都 Kamigami no kuni no shuto, 1993) *The Origin of the Fire (火の起源 Hi no kigen, 1994) *Sōseki and Hearn (漱石とヘルン Sōseki to Herun, 1997) *The Boiling Point of the Sea (海の沸点 Umi no futten, 1997) *Pikadon Kijimunā (ピカドン・キジムナー Pikadon kijimunā, 1997) *The Last of the Okinawa Milk Plant (沖縄ミルクプラントの最后 Okinawa miruku puranto no saigo, 1998) *The Emperor and The Kiss (天皇と接吻 Ten'nō to seppun, 1999) *The Attic (屋根裏 Yaneura, 2002) *DA-RU-MA-SA-N- GA-KO-RO-N-DA (だるまさんがころんだ Daruma san ga koronda, 2004) *Dropping by the House (2012) *A Problem of Blood (2012) Notable Productions by Phosphorescence Troupe ==References *Yōji Sakate Official Blog *Rinkōgun Official Website Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century Japanese dramatists and playwrights Category:21st-century Japanese dramatists and playwrights Category:Winners of the Yomiuri Prize ","title":"Yōji Sakate"},{"id":"46364497","text":"was one of Japan's most prominent postwar playwrights, novelists, and essayists, associated with the Angura (\\"underground\\") theater movement in Japan.

Performing Arts Network Japan, 16 Oct. 2007. Web. 01 May 2015. His works focused a lot on the aftermath of the war and especially the nuclear holocaust. == Early life == Map of the Manchukuo state in 1939 Manchuria Minoru Betsuyaku was born in 1937 in Manchuria. Before he was born, inner Manchuria was detached from China by Japan to create a buffer zone to defend Japan from Russia's Southward encroachment. Due to Japanese investment and being rich in natural resources, Manchuria became an important industrial domain for Japan. Under Japanese control Manchuria was one of the most brutally run regions in the world, with a systematic campaign of terror and intimidation against the local Russian and Chinese populations including arrests, organized riots, and other forms of subjugation. The Japanese also began a campaign of emigration to Manchukuo, the name the Japanese government gave to its puppet state in Manchuria. The Japanese population there rose from 240,000 in 1931 to 837,000 in 1939, and the Japanese had a plan to bring in 5 million Japanese settlers into Manchukuo. Hundreds of Manchu farmers were evicted and their farms given to Japanese immigrant families. Manchukuo was used as a base to invade the rest of China in 1937–40. At the end of the 1930s, Manchuria was a trouble spot with Japan, clashing twice with the Soviet Union. These clashes – at Lake Khasan in 1938 and at Khalkhin Gol one year later – resulted in many Japanese casualties. The Soviet Union won these two battles and a peace agreement was signed. Adding to being born in a harsh environment, Betsuyaku also experienced severe deprivation during World War II because his father died. In July 1946, a year after the sudden Soviet invasion of Manchuria, his mother succeeded in repatriating by ship with her children. Then the family moved to Sasebo in Kyushu and spent two years in Kochi, his father’s hometown. Then they moved to Shimizu where Betsuyaku finishes high school before he went to Tokyo for university. He actually wanted to become a painter in high school, however, his relatives strongly disapproved of this career path. Therefore, Betsuyaku enrolled in Waseda University in 1958 with the intention to become a newspaper correspondent. In his first day of school, his upperclassman suggested that he look into becoming an actor since he was tall. That is why he joined a drama club called Jiyu Butai where he met Tadashi Suzuki, a director who would start the Waseda Small Theater Company with Betsuyaku. == Career and influences == Before being involved in Waseda Small Theatre Company, Betsuyaku dropped out of college to be involved in a protest movement in 1961. This protest movement focused on stopping the establishment of a military base in the island, Niigima. These were political demonstrations against the renewal of the United States-Japan Security Treaty. When he returned from this hiatus, Suzuki and his friends wanted to do a separate play from their drama club, Jiyu Butai, at the Waseda festival. So Betsuyaku wrote his first play, A and B and a Certain Women, for them in 1961. Waseda University His first play, A and B and a Certain Women, is about a man B who felt inferior to man A. Man B was being continuously derided by man A that man B kills man A. It contains a lot of characteristics of “silence” and “irresolvable conflict”. The main influence on him at that time was films. His play, A and B and a Certain Women, was inspired by the film called An Eye for an Eye in 1957, which had a similar plot with unstoppable conflict. However, that was not the only influence. The main influence was from Beckett. Samuel Beckett came around when the theater was getting the end of the “realism” plays. Realism plays are plays that have three sided walls and a fourth wall which is only present to the actors. It would usually have many props and background objects to make the play realistic. However, Betsuyaku’s work was like Beckett’s work in the sense that it had no walls and it had very little background objects. For example, some of the plays would only have a telephone pole just like a lone tree in Beckett’s Waiting for Godot. Betsuyaku called this the “Beckett’s space”. Also, a realism play would have complex characters with names to make the play very realistic. However, Betsuyaku’s and Beckett’s plays had simple characters with no names. This style of play was unique and was able to be open to many interpretations. For example, the character’s names were identified as man A and man B instead of Paul or John. == Style of work == His career really took off when he joined the Waseda Small Theater Company. He created many works with the principle of “theater of the absurd;” however, his style of play did change multiple times along the way. For example, he moved into the concept of “isolation” in his plays. This happened in the post-war period. His motivation for this was the “animosity and agony” aroused by the condition of times. Betsuyaku believed that “the moment we understood that it is a solitude resulting from animosity and agony, that solitude could become a weapon”. However, this theme disappeared in his writing by the 1980s. Betsuyaku was also influenced by Anton Chekhov during his career. He focused mainly on “Japanizing” Chekhov’s work. For example, Betsuyaku wrote his play, Three Sisters in a Thousand Years based on Chekhov's Three Sisters. The plot and characters were not changed but the setting has been changed to Japan. Betsuyaku is trying to say that meaning of life is completely lost and that it is empty to search for identity. This is referring to the people of Japan after the loss in World War II. ==Personal life== He left Waseda Little Theatre in 1968, and in 1970 he married actress Yuko Kusunoki who has been an indispensable partner in many productions of Betsuyaku’s work, especially in her small theatre group, the Snail Theatre Group [Katatsumuri no Kai] (1978–99). In 1971 a daughter was born. == Awards == * 1968 – 13th “New Theatre” Kishida Kunio Drama Award (“The Little Match Girl” and “A Scene With A Red Bird”) * 1971 – Kinokuniya Theater Award (“A Town and a Blimp” and “Alice in Wonderland”) * 1972 – “New Artist” Award of the Ministry of Education’s Selected Artists Encouragement Awards (“The Revolt of the Breeze Tribe”) * 1987 – Yomiuri Literature Award (“The Story of the Two Knights Traveling Around the Country” and other plays) * 1988 – Minister of Education Award for the Arts (“Giovanni’s Journey to His Father”) * 1997 – Cultural Award of Hyogo Prefecture * 1998 – Special Award of the 39th Mainichi Art Award * 2007 – Kinokukniya Theater Award (“Godot Has Come” and “If a Dog Turns to the West, Its Tail Faces the East”) * 2008 – 11th Tsuruya Nanboku Play Award and the Asahi Award (“Godot Has Come”) == Famous works == * A to B to Hitori no Onna (A and B and a Certain Woman) [1961] This is a work that shows a fight resulting from unidentified animosity and feelings of inferiority between two men A and B who deride each other and argue. * Match Uri no Shojo (The Little Match Girl) [1966] It is about a woman paying a visit to the home of an ordinary middle-class elderly couple.

It is a work that criticizes the postwar attitude of pretending that the war had never happened. * Zō (The Elephant) [1962] It is one of his most famous plays and was first presented by Jiyu Butai (Free Stage).

His nephew tries to stop him from these actions and tries to convince him that nobody in the audience neither loves nor hates or cares about the atomic bombing victims. Also he tries to convince his uncle that victims should suffer the pain in silence. These contradicting characters provide the audience with the information of how the victims of the war are dealing with the pains. * I Am Alice [1970] Alice lives in a country where a republican government and a monarchy exist simultaneously. Alice is then given double sentences of exile by these two organizations. Alice rediscovers her true identity during the exile and tells the world, \\"I Am Alice”. This work tells us that a person must find their true self once again. * Suji de Kakareta Monogatari – “Shinou Dan” Tenmatsuki (a story told in numbers – the end of the “let’s die group”) [1974] Seven men and women have gathered for “Rite of Death by Starvation”. They isolated themselves with the intention of dying, but they must starve together as a group. * Godot Has Come [2007] – Godot Has Come is based on Samuel Beckett's “Waiting for Godot”. The story is about two men, Estragon and Vladimir, who wait for a person named Godot. Godot Has Come had all the same characters and plot as Waiting for Godot and adds a twist to it. There are two women who meet Estragon and Vladimir while waiting for Godot. Before long, Godot does arrive. He looks like a traveler, wearing a trench coat and carrying a suitcase and an umbrella. He lets everybody know that he is Godot and that he has arrived. But by the time Estragon and Vladimir hear the news; they already have their hands full with other things to do. It turns out that the lady waiting for the bus may be Estragon’s mother and that the child carried by the other woman may be Vladimir’s son. This play is to portray that they were too busy with their real lives and forgot what/who they were waiting for.

She first appeared in history in 1906 during the Azusa Street Revival. She was the founder of the Azusa Temple as well as other Pentecostal churches across the United States. Cotton's preaching and involvement in the Pentecostal circuit, as well as her friendship with famous evangelist, Aimee Semple McPherson, paved the way for women in church leadership in the 1900s. == Life in Pentecostalism ==  Azusa Street Revival  Cotton was brought to the revival by hearing of \\"the great awakening of the Spirit.\\" At the revival, she was later healed of weak lungs and cancer that was found in her nose. After her conversion, Cotton was frequently referred to herself as \\"a walking drug store\\" while many others called her \\"Sister Cotton\\". She soon met her husband, Henry C. Cotton, who worked as a railway cook on a run between Los Angeles and San Antonio While Henry was away on work, Cotton was available to participate in evangelistic work around California. Cotton and her husband returned to Louisiana for a period before she was appointed assistant state mother of California by Lizzie Robinson. Returning to California, Sister Cotton held a variety of church services all across the state. She held divine healing services at the Pentecostal Assembly in San Jose in 1916 followed by the establishment of multiple Pentecostal churches in Bakersfield, Fresno, and Oakland.  Azusa Temple  By 1920, Cotton had stepped down from her role as church mothers to becoming a full-time pastor for her own church, the Azusa Temple, in Los Angeles. Together, Emma and Henry co-pastored the church through the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) but remained independent as a church due to COGIC's decision to not ordain women. Today, the church is known as Crouch Memorial Church, named after one of Cotton's proteges, Samuel Crouch. To this day the church is an active congregation affiliated with COGIC. == Friendship with Aimee Semple McPherson == During the 1930s, Cotton become close friends with Aimee Semple McPherson while holding many Pentecostal church services together. McPherson was frequently known to only allow a small number of women to preach at her church, the Angelus Temple. In 1936, Mother Cotton asked McPherson to host a 30th anniversary party to commemorate the Azusa Street beginnings. It was described in fliers as \\"a great getting together that we might be renewed in the old-time Spirit and power.\\" Cotton was asked to speak at the gathering in order to address the crowds at the Angelus Temple. It was there that she encouraged the temple towards unity and warned against sectarian interests that were starting to rise. This gathering was considered a great success and eventually turned into a six-month event in which Cotton and her husband preached to their followers. == Legacy == By April 1939, Cotton had edited and published a paper called \\"The Inside Story of the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit - Azusa Street - April 1906.\\" It's only appearance was in a volume of Message of the Apostolic Faith, a newsletter written by Cotton that was meant to be the beginning of a regular series. This included detailed accounts of her eyewitness accounts of events surrounding the Azusa Street Revival as well as an emphasis on the role of women in the church. While many accounts focus on the prominence of men in leadership, Cotton wrote about the importance of Lucy Farrow and Julia Hutchins in the success of the revival. Cotton is also credited with songwriting credits including a gospel favorite, \\"John Saw That Number.\\" Some historians also credit her with authorship of the famous, \\"When the Saints Go Marching In,\\" although that has never been fully corroborated. Cotton's bout of cancer return in 1950 after nearly half a century of reprieve. She died on December 27, 1952 followed by Henry in 1959. They are both buried in Lincoln Memorial Park in Compton, California. ==References== Category:1877 births Category:1952 deaths ","title":"Emma Cotton"},{"id":"46364524","text":"Aimee Semple McPherson was widely known for her work in faith healing ministries. This work, especially during her early revival meetings, helped catapult her career. Tremendous amounts of documentation attest to sick people coming to her by the tens of thousands. Many were healed temporarily, others for the rest of their lives. She would take no credit for the results and always insisted Christ the Great Healer was responsible. Biographer Daniel Mark Epstein writes: ==Aimee's life of healing== McPherson's faith healing demonstrations were extensively written about in the news media and were a large part of her early career legacy. No one has ever been credited by secular witnesses with anywhere near the numbers of faith healings attributed to McPherson, especially during the years 1919 to 1922. Over time though, she almost withdrew from the faith healing aspect of her services, since it was overwhelming other areas of her ministry. Scheduled healing sessions nevertheless remained highly popular with the public until her death in 1944. Described incidents of miraculous faith healing are sometimes clinically explained as a result of hysteria or a form of hypnosis. Strong emotions and the mind's ability to trigger the production of opiates, endorphins, and enkephalins; have also been offered as explanations as well as the healings are simply faked. In the case of McPherson, there was no evidence of fraud found. In August 1921, doctors from the American Medical Association in San Francisco secretly investigated some of McPherson's local revival meetings. The subsequent AMA report stated McPherson's healing was \\"genuine, beneficial and wonderful.\\" Biographer Daniel Mark Epstein himself was looking for such fraud but found none. In an interview with the Baltimore Sun, Epstein said: McPherson stated she had experienced several of her own personal faith healing incidents, among them one in 1909, when her broken foot was mended, an event which first served to introduce her to the possibilities of the healing power. Another was an unexpected recovery from an operation in 1914 where hospital staff expected her to die, and in 1916, before a gathered revival tent crowd, swift rejuvenation of blistered skin from a serious flash burn caused by a lamp exploding in her face. Her reported first successful public faith healing session of another person was demonstrated in Corona, Long Island, New York, 1916. A young woman in the painful, advanced stages of rheumatoid arthritis was brought to the altar by friends just as McPherson preached \\"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever\\", meaning, in part, Jesus had the same power to heal now as in ancient times. McPherson, laid hands upon the crippled woman's head and witnesses looked on as she walked out of the church that same night without crutches. Sick and injured people came to her by the tens of thousands. Press clippings, and testimonials became mountainous. To people who traveled with her, the numerous faith healings were routine. Lubricating her hands with spiced oil, McPherson touched and prayed over the infirm and reporters wrote extensively of what they saw. When asked by a journalist about these demonstrations, McPherson indicated, \\"the saving of souls is the most important part of my ministry.\\" Alleged healing miracles played a part in the conversion of past peoples and tribes to Christianity; for example, stated in the testimony of Sozomen (435 AD) about the conversion of his friend Alaphion near Gaza from the city of Bethelea. Alaphion was believed to have been possessed of a devil; and neither the Jewish or pagan physicians and exorcists by their crafts could deliver him from this affliction. The monk Hilarion, by simply calling on the name of Christ, expelled the demon and Alaphion and his whole family and many other relatives immediately embraced Christianity.Schaff, Philip; Wace , Henry A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church: Socrates, Sozomenus: Church histories. Christian literature Company; 1890 p.233 The Romani was ethnic group that had many of its members migrate to the United States in the mid-1860s. The infusion of crosses and other symbols of Christianity alongside Romani astrology charts and crystal balls was the result of McPherson's influence.Epstein, p. 239 When a Romani tribe king and his mother stated they were faith-healed by McPherson, thousands of others came to her, as well, in caravans from all over the country and were converted. Prizing gold and loyalty, the Romani repaid her in part, with heavy bags of gold coin and jewels, which helped fund the construction of the new Angelus Temple.Epstein, p. 241 In Wichita, Kansas, on May 29, 1922, where heavy perennial thunderstorms threatened to rain out the thousands who gathered there, McPherson interrupted the speaker, raised her hand to the sky, and prayed, \\"let it fall (the rain) after the message has been delivered to these hungry souls\\". The rain immediately stopped, an event reported the following day by the Wichita Eagle on May 30: \\"Evangelist's Prayers Hold Big Rain Back,\\"Blumhofer, p. 184 For the gathered Romani, it was a further acknowledgement \\"of the woman's power\\".Epstein, p. 240 ==Examples of healings== Aimee Semple McPherson conducting a healing ceremony at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion in 1921. Police support along with U.S. Marines and Army personnel helped manage traffic and the estimated 30,000 people who attended.Edith Waldvogel Blumhofer, Aimee Semple McPherson: everybody's sister (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, Inc., 1993), pp.160- 161 Not all healings were successful and McPherson had occasional well-publicized failures. But these were apparently few and people in ever increasing numbers came to her. She was invited back again and again to cities that she previously visited. Perhaps one of the more dramatic public faith healing demonstrations of her career occurred starting in late January 1921 at Balboa Park in San Diego, California. The Spreckles Organ Pavilion in the park was site of several earlier revival meetings by many of her predecessors, and there McPherson preached to a huge crowd of 30,000. She had to move to the outdoor site since the 3,000 seat Dreamland Boxing Arena could not hold the thousands who went to see her. To assist the San Diego Police in maintaining order, the Marines and Army had to be called in. During the engagement, a woman paralyzed from the waist down from childhood, was presented for faith healing. Concerned because numerous, previous demonstrations had been before much smaller assemblages, McPherson feared she would be run out of town if this healing did not manifest. Author Daniel Mark Epstein, in his book, Sister Aimee, describes her state of mind and what happened next. Believing in the reality of the living Christ, filled with sincere passion beyond love for humanity, McPherson prayed, and laid hands on her. Before 30,000 people—and captured for all time by photography—the woman got up out of her wheelchair and walked. The large gathering responded with thunderous applause. Other unwell persons came to the platform McPherson occupied, and though not all were cured, the sick, injured and invalid by the hundreds continued to line up for healing. According to news reporters and other witnesses, among the numerous healings that occurred, a goiter shrank, crutches were abandoned, and an abscessed arm was returned to normal. Thousands of people wanted her help, more than she could handle and her stay was extended. As with many of her other meetings, McPherson labored and prayed feverishly for hours over the infirm, often without food or stopping for a break. At the day's end, she would eventually be taken away by her staff, dehydrated and unsteady with fatigue; her distinct, booming voice reduced to a whisper. McPherson herself wrote, “As soon as one was healed, she ran and told nine others, and brought them too, even telegraphing and rushing the sick on trains.\\" Originally planned for two weeks in the evenings, McPherson's Balboa Park revival meetings lasted over five weeks and went from dawn until dusk. Years later, Epstein interviewed Rolf McPherson, his mother's appointed successor who spoke of the period: \\"more patients were open to the possibilities of faith healing.\\" Next to him, mounted on his office wall; was a hand tinted photo enlargement of his mother helping a woman out her wheelchair in Balboa Park. He speculated that healings occurred because they had more faith in God and less in science, and he could not \\"imagine this sort of thing happening again.\\" ==Public response== Later in 1921, investigating McPherson's healing services, a survey was sent out by First Baptist Church Pastor William Keeney Towner in San Jose, California, to 3,300 people. 2500 persons responded. Six percent indicated they were immediately and completely healed while 85 percent indicated they were partially healed and continued to improve ever since. Fewer than half of 1 percent did not feel they were at least spiritually uplifted and had their faith strengthened. Denver Post reporter Frances Wayne writes that while McPherson's \\"attack\\" on sin was \\"uncultured,...the deaf heard, the blind saw, the paralytic walked, the palsied became calm, before the eyes of as many people that could be packed into the largest church auditorium in Denver\\". In 1922, McPherson returned for a second tour in the Great Revival of Denver and asked about people who have claimed healings from the previous visit. Seventeen people, some well known members of the community, testified, giving credence to McPherson's claim \\"healing still occurred among modern Christians\\". McPherson herself disliked being given credit for the healings, considering herself the medium through which the power flows, the power of Christ working the cure. Actor Anthony Quinn, who for a time played in the church's band and was an apprentice preacher, in this partial quote, recalls a service: A Washington Times reporter wrote that for her work to be a hoax on such a large scale, it would be more miraculous than the healings that were occurring more rapidly than he could record them.Epstein, Daniel Mark , Sister Aimee: The Life of Aimee Semple McPherson (Orlando: Harcourt Brace & Company, 1993), pp. 166, 178, 182 When McPherson retired for much needed rest after a long and exhausting faith healing service, she would sometimes suffer from insomnia, a problem she would contend with for the rest of her life. Regarding her own illnesses, she did not abstain from visiting doctors or using medicines. McPherson considered each faith healing incident a sacred gift from God, passed through her to persons healed and not to be taken for granted. In visiting foreign lands, for example, she paid scrupulous attention to sanitation, concerned that a careless oversight might result in acquiring an exotic disease. In later years, other individuals were identified as having the described faith healing gift. On stage, during Wednesday and Saturday divine healing sessions, she worked among them, or was even absent altogether, diminishing her own singular role. Divine healing, in her view, was not the emergency room, entertainment or something to puzzle scientists, it was a church sacrament. In her own writings and sermons, McPherson did not refer to her own particular personal proficiencies, conveying divine healing was accessible by faith and devotion. ==References== ;Notes ;Citations ==Further reading== * Category:Aimee Semple McPherson Category:Faith healers ","title":"Faith healing ministry of Aimee Semple McPherson"},{"id":"46364529","text":"Java–Partizan Pro Cycling Team is a Serbian UCI Continental team founded in 2014.

For the majority of his life, he has been best known for his work in theater and creating what he has coined, “contemporary colloquial theater,” or as theater critics call it, “quiet drama.”Rimer, J. Thomas, Mitsuya Mōri, and M. Cody Poulton. The Columbia Anthology of Modern Japanese Drama. New York: Columbia UP, 2014. Print. ==Career== Oriza Hirata graduated from International Christian University as a part of their Humanities division. In 1983, he formed the Seinendan Theater Company, which he established in order to practice contemporary colloquial theater. In 1984, Seinendan settled into using the Komaba Agora Theater as their main base of operations. Hirata remains as the theater's primary artistic director and has continued to play a major role in the theater's management. Hirata's first play, , first premiered in 1989, and has remained one of his most famous plays. 6 Years later, in 1994, he debuted , which is still considered his magnum opus. As a playwright, Hirata has continued to write and direct plays both at Komaba Agora theater, as well as theaters in Europe, the Americas, and other parts of Asia. He is also known for doing international collaborations both in Japan and all around the world, where he has worked with a multitude of playwrights and artists to introduce his own work to new audiences, as well as introduce foreign work to Japan. Hirata worked at Obirin University for six years as a professor in their theater department before moving onto Osaka University, where he works in their communication-design and robotics departments. ==Contemporary colloquial theater== Contemporary colloquial theater is a theatrical style Oriza Hirata founded as an answer to the “boisterous and festive nature of 1980s Japanese theater.” This style emphasizes colloquial Japanese language use that is designed to sound distinctly typical of the linguistic tendencies and patterns of everyday Japanese speaking. As a result, his plays oftentimes feature multiple characters talking at once, sentence fragments, inaudible speech, and an understated, \\"normal\\" speaking tone. This style informs his plays stylistically, both in language and plot, in the sense that Hirata emphasizes realism throughout. However, Hirata has preferred his own stylistic title of \\"contemporary colloquial theater\\" because he thinks that relatable terms like Shingeki or realism \\"sounded too much like the Western drama that [they] emulated.\\" Hirata's style is partially due to his identification the impact of Western style was having on Japanese arts. As a reaction, he has sought to create an artistic style more representative of typical Japanese language and culture. As a playwright, he founded the Seinendan theater company in 1983 as a way to push his acting style into the greater Japanese and international theatre scenes. Hirata has worked closely with international actors when translating his work to preserve the Japanese identity of the speech, which has particularly resonated with French audiences.Hirata, Oriza. \\"Artist Interview: Speaking with Oriza Hirata, a New Opinion Leader in the World of Contemporary Theater.\\" Interview by Akihiko Senda. Performing Arts Network Japan. The Japan Foundation, 23 Mar. 2007. Web. 28 Apr. 2015. This style also tends to emphasize a small, intimate set of characters—usually represented by the actors playing the role of a family—to serve as a “microcosm of Japanese society as a whole.” Japanese theater scholar, M. Cody Poulton, describes Hirata's style as an emphasis of the Greek idea of ethos, \\"the prevalent tone of sentiment of a people or community; the genius of an institution or system.\\" ==Interdisciplinary work== After working at Obirin University as a theater professor, Oriza Hirata moved to work for Osaka University, where he collaborated in the scientific fields of communication-design and robotics.\\"Oriza Hirata.\\" ORIZA HIRATA: SEINENDAN. Seinendan, n.d. Web. 28 Apr. 2015. Hirata has participated in designing university classes that emphasize the communication environment for different fields in order for them to perform more successfully. For robotics, Hirata used his theater experience to attempt to make robots that act similarly to humans. While his work has been used to generally fulfill this role, he has also brought his work in robotics back to the theater, where he has incorporated robots in plays to explore themes of humanity. His play, I, Worker uses two robots as main characters to explore this very idea. He has collaborated with robotics expert Hiroshi Ishiguro for his theatrical experiments using robots. ==International work and acclaim== Shortly after beginning his career as a playwright, Oriza Hirata has had a prolific international career—both touring his work around the world, as well as staging foreign playwrights work at his own theater in Japan. Beginning in the early 2000s, Hirata's work started to garner international attention. With the help of Japan's Saison Foundation, a grant-making foundation that supports Japanese Theater, and Manhattan's Nonprofit organization Japan Society, Hirata's most famous work, Tōkyō Notes was debuted in the United States in October 2000 in New York City. Japan Society's theater series, Japanese Theatre NOW, has helped bring a number of contemporary Japanese dramas to the United States, Hirata's being notable since Tōkyō Notes was one of the first. Since then, Hirata's work and company have traveled much of the world, including France, Belgium, Switzerland, Ireland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Korea, China, Australia, and Brazil. Hirata says that he believes he has \\"done the best work in France,\\" where \\"the people in France have been very enthusiastic about [his] work.\\" Both in France and Belgium, Hirata has collaborated with international actors and directors to bring his theatrical work to an international audience, as well as creating new commissioned work as both a playwright and director. Hirata has also collaborated on many international works inside of Japan, using his theater to stage plays by playwrights from France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, the United States, Korea, and China. Hirata's admiration for the French theater scene can be seen with these collaborations as well, as he has tended to stage more French plays than any other country he has collaborated with. A year after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Hirata submitted a 10-minute play, along with 18 other American and Japanese artist, to be performed and documented in an event called Shinsai: Theaters For Japan. The event happened that the Great Hall at Cooper Union in New York City. Hirata's play, entitled \\"Sayonara II\\", tells the story of a partially-broken robot who is asked to read poems to the people who died after the disaster. ==Accolades== *39th Kishida Prize for Drama for his play Tōkyō Notes (1995). *5th Yomiuru Theater Outstanding Director Award for producing Masataka Matsuda's play The Cape of the Moon (1998). *9th Yomiuri Theater Award for Outstanding Production on his play Attacking Ueno Zoo for the Fourth Time (2002). *Association Internationale des Critiques des Théâtre Critique Award for his book Arts as the Basis of a Nation (2002). *Winner of the Grand Prix of the 2nd Asahi Performing Arts Awards for his play Across the River in May (2003). *Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award (2006). ==List of works== Major works *1989: : One of Hirata's earliest and most critically acclaimed works, Citizens of Seoul tackles Japan's superiority complex over Korea during their colonization. *1994: : Hirata's most famous and praised work around the world, Tōkyō Notes takes place in a museum where a number of people's personal lives are examined in order to gain a fuller picture of the political, social, and cultural context of a near-future Japan. *2002: : Summarizing the world's history post- WWII, this is one of Hiraza's most grand dramas in terms of scope.

It was created by the Central Bank of Czechoslovakia, who started collection quotes from reference banks in order to determine PRIBOR. After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the process of calculating PRIBOR was taken over by the newly created Czech National Bank (CNB). CNB was responsible for calculating the rate up to the point, where they handed over the role of calculation agent to Telerate (who was acquired by Reuters in 2005) and the role of administrator to The Financial Markets Association of the Czech Republic (also called Forex Club Czech Republic) around year 2000. In the middle of year 2017, Czech Financial Benchmark Facility took PRIBOR over from Czech Forex Club. On December 11, 2018 CFBF was authorized as an administrator under the European Benchmark Regulation (BMR), meaning PRIBOR became one of the first benchmarks to be authorized under BMR. During its existence, PRIBOR was fixed every business day with a single exception in the summer of 2002, when it was not fixed on August 13 and August 14 due to massive flooding that took place in Czechia. == Definition and the fixing process == PRIBOR is defined as follows: PRIBOR (or Prague Interbank Offered Rate) is the average interest rate at which unsecured CZK funds are offered by Panel Banks in the interbank market, just prior to 11.00am local time. It i fixed every business day according to the rules that are defined in the Code of Conduct and publicly accessible on the administrator's website. Data used to calculate the final rate are supplied daily to the administrator by the so-called \\"panel banks\\" (panel is used to designate a group of banks that are compliant with the requirements put forward by BMR and the administrator and who are therefore eligible to contribute to the calculation of the rate). These data consist mostly of prices of the loans made by the panel bank and if those did not take place, it consists of an expert judgement of said prices using knowledge of the underlying markets. There are currently six banks contributing to the calculation of PRIBOR. == Usage of the rate == PRIBOR provides information about the current price of money on the market, which is important information for financial and non-financial corporations as well as for the government, the central bank and for everyone who is interested in either investing or borrowing money. It is used in a wide range of financial instruments, including standard interbank products such as FRAs, Interest Rate Swaps and others. PRIBOR is often used as a reference rate for mortgages (so-called floating rate), meaning that their price is wholly or partially dependent on the development of PRIBOR (e.g. interest rate of the mortgage is re-fixed every one/two/three months according to the value of PRIBOR) == Suspected PRIBOR Manipulation == On 24 March 2015, Hospodářské noviny revealed PRIBOR was not a market rate or the rate of the real interest rate, but a fictional figure which does not represent current money market trends. Allegations were made that so-called reference banks manipulated the rate for their own gain, and that such changes resulted in greater income from loans.http://archiv.ihned.cz/c1-63732140-banky-drzi-uroky-umele-vysoko-nikdo- je-ale-ucinne-nekontroluje The Czech Finance Ministry asked the central bank on April 10, 2015 to investigate whether PRIBOR, the main benchmark for the country's money market, had been manipulated to keep interest rates high. In a letter to bank governor Miroslav Singer, deputy finance minister Martin Pros referred to \\"unsettling reports concerning PRIBOR rates, of which the most serious ones include concerns of their manipulation\\".https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/10/us-czech-pribor- idUSKBN0N11IT20150410 == European Benchmark Regulation (BMR) == The European Regulation 2019/1011, often called European Benchmark Regulation or BMR, was devised to make financial benchmarks and indices more transparent and robust with regards to their methodology, and to unify the rules by which they are governed across the European Union. One of its main goals is to eliminate the risk of potential future manipulation of the rates (as was the case in the LIBOR scandal) and to try to ensure, that the benchmarks reflect the reality of the underlying markets. According to this regulation, any benchmark that will not have been authorized under BMR before December 31, 2019 could not be used after this date by any institution supervised in the EU. PRIBOR is one of the first benchmarks in the EU to fulfill the requirements of the Benchmark Regulation and is administered by an administrator authorized under BMR. == Links == * PRIBOR on Czech National Bank Web * PRIBOR *Information about PRIBOR on the Web of the administrator == References == Category:Economy of the Czech Republic Category:Interest rates ","title":"Prague interbank offered rate"},{"id":"46364653","text":"The Texas Renegades were a Junior A Tier III ice hockey team, based in North Richland Hills, Texas.

It is a contemporary reworking of the zoetrope, one of several pre-film animation devices that produce the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion. The crucial difference between the technique that the Phonotrope uses and the one a zoetrope uses is that the Phonotrope is specifically an in-camera technique using the frame-rate of a live-action camera set to a high shutter speed in confluence with a constantly rotating disc to create the illusion of movement. In a zoetrope it is the vertical slits around the drum or the flashes of a stroboscope which create the 'interruptions' needed to create the illusion of movement. As such the Phonotrope can only be seen through either the camera's viewfinder, a connected monitor or projector or viewed as footage after the event. From its inception the most commonly used methods of rotating the disc have been using a record-player however Le Fevre has used a pottery wheel to spin a glazed pot to create animation\\"Experimental Animation Meets Pottery\\" film commissioned by the Crafts Council by Jim Le Fevre as well as using a bespoke motor to animate hundreds of cut-out card images on a wooden tiered structure for the title sequence for the BBC television comedy film Holy Flying Circus.Footage of the \\"Holy Flying Circus\\" title sequence on Vimeo ==Public appearances== The earliest public showing of the Phonotrope was in March 2007 at an evening at the Victoria and Albert Museum\\"The Phonotrope (formerly the Phonographantasmascope)\\" by Jim Le Fevre on YouTube where Jim Le Fevre presented the process to members of the public as part of a 'Friday Late' event.

It occurs in most of Africa south of the Sahara Desert, but its main breeding ground, and the original source of most plagues, is on the floodplains of the Niger River in West Africa. Much of the time, this locust adopts a solitary lifestyle, but under certain conditions, it becomes gregarious; the young nymphs, known as hoppers, form bands that move together and the adult insects form swarms that may reach plague proportions. Plagues of this locust took place from 1891 to 1903 and again from 1928 to 1941. After many years without outbreaks of the insects, further plagues occurred in the last two decades of the 20th century. ==Description== The African migratory locust has two phases, a solitary one, where the insects behave independently, and a gregarious phase, where they gather together and act as a cohesive unit. Adult insects differ morphologically between the two phases; solitary insects have an arched prothorax, the foremost segment of the thorax, and are either green or brown, darkening in colour as they mature (especially the abdomen of the female). Gregarious insects have a flatter prothorax and are a pale tan or a greyish colour with dark markings. As they mature, they become duller in appearance and the males may become more yellowish. The hoppers are also different in the two phases. The newly hatched solitary hopper is grey, but later stages can be a variety of colours including green, buff, brown, red, grey, and black. Their colouring tends to match their surroundings, so on new, young foliage they are green and after wildfires they may be black. The gregarious hoppers are boldly marked in a pattern of brown and black. ==Lifecycle== Eggs are laid in soft, moist soil. This can be burnt land wet by recent rain and with a flush of new growth, recently flooded land, open areas in the vicinity of swamps, cleared farmland, and cattle-denuded pastures. The eggs are laid in up to three pods over a period of days or weeks. The pods of a solitary insect contain about 65 eggs, while those of a gregarious female average 39. The egg pods have a coating of foam to which sand particles adhere, forming a surrounding membrane. Some chemical factor in the foam produced by gregarious females encourages aggregation of the hoppers; if eggs are removed from the pod and reared separately, they develop into solitary individuals. The eggs take 10 to 100 days to hatch, depending on conditions. The hoppers usually develop through five stages, known as instars, separated by moults, but in the solitary phase, six or seven instars may occur in very dry conditions. The duration of each instar depends on environmental factors and is shortest in hot, humid regions and longest under cooler, dry conditions. The newly moulted adult is at first immature and does not start to breed immediately. Males can copulate after about four days and solitary females start laying around 10 days, but for gregarious females, the delay in maturation is 2.5 to 3.0 weeks. If conditions are unsuitable for egg-laying, the eggs may be reabsorbed. ==Ecology== The African migratory locust primarily feeds on grasses, including economically important crops, such as maize, millet, sorghum, and wheat. Hopper band in Sudan The African migratory locust exists in its solitary form in many parts of Africa and its development is then similar to that of other grasshopper species. When the eggs hatch in extremely close proximity to each other, the first-instar hoppers become attracted to each other and begin to form bands that move in synchrony. The band moves as a cohesive unit, pausing as the hoppers feed and bask in the sun, and merges with other bands. Bands have been known to travel for before they metamorphose into adults. The attraction between the individual hoppers continues into adulthood and the insects continue to act as a cohesive group, a swarm. Swarms of the African migratory locusts fly by day and settle on the ground at night, where they rest and feed on vegetation. After sunrise, they warm themselves in the sun before taking to the air again. They often settle for a while in the middle of the day, but do not normally feed much at this time. If the day is cloudy or cold, they may not fly at all. The swarm tends to adopt a stratiform shape with a dense, rounded leading edge and more dispersed trailing edge. It can be extremely dense and tends to move downwind. African migratory locusts travel closer to the ground than desert locusts and do not usually cover large distances. Rains in the mountains to the southwest of the Niger floodplain produce flooding in its upper parts from August to October, and that is where outbreaks occur after the floods recede. Lower down the river, the flooding occurs later, from about November to February. As these floods recede, further land covered with tall, coarse grasses is available for the insects to breed. While the river is in flood, the locusts migrate to the Sahel, where further breeding takes place. ==Locust control organisations== The International African Migratory Locust Organization (OICMA) was founded in 1955. Its aim was to \\"exercise continuous surveillance and preventive control of the African migratory locust in the outbreak area on the River Niger, destroy concentrations of the locust, carry out research and develop means of control.\\" This control was effective, and increasing dryland farming and better monitoring in Mali changed the character of the outbreak area such that by the 1980s, the insect's behaviour was thought to be more like that of a solitary grasshopper than a gregarious locust. OICMA was dissolved in 1986. ==Plagues== A major plague of the African migratory locust occurred from 1891 to 1903, followed by one that lasted from 1928 to 1941. For many years after that, the African migratory locust was in recession, which perhaps lulled the authorities into a false sense of security. The Sahel region experienced several years of drought in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The rains and more normal weather returned in 1984, providing ideal conditions for the locusts to breed abundantly. The African migratory locust, as well as the Senegalese grasshopper, the red locust, the brown locust, and the desert locust were flourishing in various parts of the continent at the same time. The Desert Locust Control Organisation of East Africa remained an effective body, but elsewhere little monitoring was done, with civil wars in Chad and the Central African Republic hindering the detection of outbreaks. In many countries, few resources were available to deal with any outbreaks that were discovered. This plague lasted until 1986. Outbreaks can originate from other parts of Africa, and in 1992, at the same time as a plague of desert locusts was affecting much of North Africa, an outbreak of the African migratory locust took place in Ethiopia and northern Somalia. ==References== Category:Locusts Category:Orthoptera of Africa Category:Insects described in 1849 ","title":"African migratory locust"},{"id":"46364735","text":"Cedar Manor, originally named Power PlaceOld Southern Road from Jamaica Station to Springfield Junction (Arrt's Arrchives) was a railroad station along the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, in Queens, New York City.

Exiled General Thao Ma returned from the Kingdom of Thailand on 20 August 1973 to take over Wattay International Airport outside the capital of Vientiane. Commandeering an AT-28, he led air strikes upon the office and home of his hated rival, General Kouprasith Abhay. While Thao Ma was unsuccessfully bombing Kouprasith, loyal Royalist troops retook the airfield. Shot down upon his return, Thao Ma was hauled from his airplane's wreckage and executed. The coalition agreement was signed 14 September 1973. ==Overview== Political factionalism within the upper ranks of the Royal Lao Army led to a series of coups in the Kingdom of Laos during the Laotian Civil War of the 1960s. When Phoumi Nosavan was forced into exile in February 1965, he could no longer use his influence to shield the officers in his rightwing faction. General Thao Ma, commander of the Royal Lao Air Force was one of those officers; he also went into exile in the neighboring Thailand, after his unsuccessful 1966 coup failed to take over the kingdom.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 156–158. ==Background== In 1973, former Laotian General Thao Ma was living in exile in Bangkok, Thailand, where he worked as an air dispatcher for Air France for $270 per month.Neeld, Dennis, \\"Coup Attempt by Small Band of Laos Rebels Fizzles\\", Associated Press via Lubbock Avalanche-Journal (Lubbock, Texas), 22 August 1973, p. 65. By the beginning of August, a deal was being thrashed out for a coalition government that would include the Laotian communist insurrectionists. Several Royal Lao Army officers traveled to Bangkok to keep Thao Ma posted on events. Rumors of a potential coup by Thao Ma began to surface in the Laotian capital of Vientiane.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 406–407. ==The coup== Despite the advance warnings, Thao Ma managed to surprise the populace of Vientiane. At 05:00 on 20 August 1973, he and about 60 of his followers boated across the Mekong River into the capital. Thao Ma was greeted enthusiastically by RLAF personnel at Wattay Airport, and began handing out blue and white scarves of allegiance to his followers. While Bounleut Saycocie took an armored car into town to secure the radio station, other rebels captured the bank and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma's vacant house. At 07:00, Bounleut began broadcasting anti- communist communiques from the insurrectionists. With his underlings attending to the seizure of Vientiane, Thao Ma commandeered an AT-28 fighter-bomber. Accounts disagree on the number of sorties flown by Thao Ma and his wingmen. While contemporary news accounts state Thao Ma flew at least three times, historians note only that he was accompanied by six loyal pilots. It is agreed that his principal target was a fellow general whom he hated, Kouprasith Abhay. Both Kouprasith's home and office were bombed by the AT-28s, but missed him. As Royalist troops began to rally against the coup, American colonel Al Degroote drove to the home of the commanding general of the Air Force. General Sourith Don Sasorith refused to come out of hiding, and lurked in his house with a blue and white scarf handy.Anthony, Sexton, p. 365. Even with Sourith's refusal to fight against it, the coup began to unravel. Royalist troops promptly recaptured the airfield. A Royalist soldier manning a truck-mounted machine gun managed to hit Thao Ma's aircraft. He crash-landed his smoking plane on Wattay's overrun area. An Air America crash truck crew fished him from the wreckage. He was capable of sitting up on his stretcher and thanking his rescuers. By 11:00, the coup was over. Thao Ma was tossed into a truck and taken to Kouprasith's headquarters where Kouprasith had his bodyguard shoot Thao Ma.Ahern, p. 500. ==Aftermath== There were ten killed on either side, and 14 insurrectionists captured. Bounluet Saycocie stole a helicopter to escape. On 14 September 1973, the agreement to establish the Third Coalition Government was signed. ==EndnotesReferences== * Ahern, Thomas L.

She gained popularity while a student at the University of Cambridge. == Early life == Calloway was born on 5 December 1991 as Caroline Calloway Gotschall in Falls Church, Virginia. At the age of 17, she changed her last name to Gotschall Calloway. Her maternal great-grandfather is Owen Burns, an entrepreneur and real estate mogul who developed many of the historic structures of Sarasota, Florida. She graduated high school in 2010 from Phillips Exeter Academy before studying history of art at New York University. In 2013 she left NYU to restart her undergraduate studies at St Edmund's College in Cambridge, where she graduated in 2016. == Career ==  Influencer  Calloway joined Instagram in 2012, with the help of her NYU classmate Natalie Beach. Calloway's Instagram account documented her boyfriends, vacations, and University experience via pictures and lengthy captions. Calloway bought followers and purchased ads to grow her account. In September 2019, Natalie Beach wrote an essay for The Cut, titled \\"I Was Caroline Calloway,\\" chronicling her friendship and collaborations with Calloway. In her essay, Beach disclosed that she had ghost-written a number of the captions credited to Calloway, and that she had closely collaborated with her to produce a subsequent book proposal. Calloway has since responded to this with a series of blog entries, titled \\"I Am Caroline Calloway,\\" on her personal website.  Writing   And We Were Like  In 2016 it was announced that Calloway would publish a memoir entitled And We Were Like about her time at Cambridge with Flatiron Books, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers, with the help of literary agent Byrd Leavell. During her senior year at Cambridge, Calloway had hired Beach to co-write the book and proposal. Leavell has since commented on his experience working with Calloway, stating that she was \\"deeply unwell, deeply dishonest\\" and that \\"It was more important to her to be seen as an author than it was to be an author. She didn’t know how to be an author.\\" Calloway publicly announced that Flatiron Books had offered her a book deal to write a memoir for half a million dollars in 2015, of which sum she had received 30% as an advance. Calloway announced via her Instagram stories in 2017 that after spending nearly all of the $167,000 paid to her, she had failed to write the book and would not fulfill her contract. Following this, Calloway offered the book proposal with personal annotations for sale on Etsy.  Writing workshops  In December 2018, Calloway launched an international \\"Creativity Workshop Tour\\". Her original announcement indicated that the workshop would offer tutorials on building an Instagram brand, as well as developing ideas, and addressing \\"the emotional and spiritual dimensions of making art.\\" Participation in the tour was priced at $165 per person, and tickets were sold for events to be held in Boston, Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Austin, Charlotte and Washington, DC. This tour was subsequently cancelled due to Calloway failing to book venues for these events, with Calloway announcing that she would refund those who had already bought tickets. Eventually, Calloway held two workshops in New York. The cancellation of the workshops gained public attention when reporter Kayleigh Donaldson created a Twitter thread that gained news coverage comparing Calloway's tour to Fyre Festival, later publishing this as an article for the online publication, Pajiba. Following the publication of Donaldson's article, Calloway briefly offered t-shirts for sale on Threadless, which bore the caption, 'Stop hate-following me, Kayleigh'. Threadless suspended the sale of these t-shirts for violating their targeted harassment policy. In August 2019, Calloway held a second creativity workshop titled, 'The Scam' in New York. Although press was not invited to the event, a reporter from Vice purchased a ticket, attended the event under a false name, and published an article about her experience.  Forthcoming publications  In April 2020, Calloway announced that she would be publishing a response to an essay written about her by her former ghost- writer, Natalie Beach. Calloway announced in January 2020 that she would be publishing a memoir titled Scammer in April 2020, which would be printed on demand and shipped in Spring 2020. Calloway subsequently stated on her website that because of delays in production, she would instead be combining her blog, \\"I Am Caroline Calloway\\", with her manuscript for Scammer instead, allowing her to expand the essay into three parts. In July 2020, Calloway announced that the book was estimated to ship by 31 August 2020. Scammer did not ship on 31 August 2020, and the author has not provided any writing, publishing, or shipping updates.  Sex work  In April 2020, Calloway posted a picture of her nipples on her Twitter account as a \\"humble apology\\" for failing to meet her promised word count in the first post of her blog, 'I Am Caroline Calloway'. In 2020, Calloway created an OnlyFans account, promising video and photo content containing nudity. Calloway stated in interviews that her intention to enter the adult entertainment industry had been planned by Playboy, and that the magazine had commissioned a photo shoot of her dressed as a student in a library. When asked, the magazine stated “Playboy does not have and did not have any photo shoot planned with Caroline Calloway.” Calloway has described her sex work as \\"emotionally poignant, softcore cerebral porn.\\" Her content includes cosplay of her favorite characters from children's movies such as Harry Potter, Matilda and Beauty and the Beast and partially-undressed photographs of herself captioned with details of her father's autopsy. She posted her projected income from sex work on her Twitter account in May 2020, leading to criticism about her failure to recognise difficulties faced by sex workers, as well as her attempts to distance herself from sex work. == Controversies == In April 2020, Calloway was criticised for posting a tweet with an antisemitic cartoon, with a caption mocking Natalie Beach, her former ghost-writer. Calloway later deleted and apologized for the tweet. Calloway further attracted criticism after she liked and shared a suggestion on social media that she should dress up as Anne Frank for her OnlyFans account. Calloway also attracted criticism for posting an image of Japanese shunga (erotic art) on her instagram, which depicted a woman copulating with a bat. Calloway captioned the image, \\"the first human case of the corona outbreak, but make it porn,” attracting criticism for engaging in the promotion of stereotypes about Asian cultures, particularly in the context of heightened racism and xenophobia during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. == Personal life == Calloway's early Instagram captions chronicled her relationship with her boyfriend, but the two split up in 2016. Since that break-up she has continued to narrate details about her personal life on Instagram. After complaints about lacking consent for the images posted, she covered the face of her date with an emoji. Calloway has general anxiety disorder and depression. She has been open about her Adderall abuse and addiction while at Cambridge. ==References * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:American women bloggers Category:American bloggers Category:People from Falls Church, Virginia Category:Phillips Exeter Academy alumni Category:Alumni of St Edmund's College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Social media influencers ","title":"Caroline Calloway"},{"id":"46364892","text":"Arie Priyatna (born 25 February 1982) is an Indonesian professional footballer who currently plays for Pusamania Borneo. == External links == * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Indonesian footballers Category:Borneo F.C. players Category:Liga 1 (Indonesia) players Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Arie Priyatna"},{"id":"46364901","text":"The 2015 Dartford Borough Council election took place on 7 May 2015 to elect members of the Dartford Borough Council in England.

He made numerous studies on Hungarian spiders, birds, and fishes, founded the journal Natural History Notebooks, which became one of the most popular scientific publications of Hungary, and the ornithological journal Aquila. He is called \\"the Father of the birds\\" in Hungary. He was a member of several learned societies including the Royal Hungarian Society of Natural History, Hungarian Linguistics Society, Hungarian Society of Ethnography and was elected to Hungarian Parliament. The Ottó Herman Museum of Miskolc bears his name. His work in favor of science, politics and all these activities have a significant impact in Hungary. ==Biography== Ottó Herman was born in Breznóbánya, Kingdom of Hungary (modern day Slovakia) into a Zipser Saxon family. He started his schools in Miskolc. He studied engineering in Vienna, however, due to family reasons he couldn't finish his studies. At age 14 he wanted to join the Hungarian revolutionaries of 1848 but was sent home because he couldn't provide a letter of his father's consent. Later, Herman spent years in military service in the Austrian Army as a punishment for trying deliberately to avoid conscription. He became a well- known journalist and a member of the Hungarian National Assembly. He frequently visited Lajos Kossuth in Torino, Italy. Ottó Herman was an autodidact who immersed himself in a wide variety of zoological (ornithological, ichthyological), speleological, archaeological and ethnographic sources. He was the first person who stated that cavemen lived in Hungary in the past after examining the chopping tools found in the area surrounding Miskolc. His best known works are Spider Faunas of Hungary, Birds Useful and Birds Harmful and the Book of Hungarian Fishery. Herman was the father of Hungarian palaeolithic research and Hungarian speleology. He initiated the Natural History Notebooks and was its editor for 10 years until 1886. He also founded and edited the ornithological review Aquila until the end of his life. Herman established and directed the Hungarian Ornithological Centre, at the time a department of the Hungarian National Museum. He was one of the founding members of the Hungarian Society of Ethnography. ==Scientific work== In 1864 Herman applied for a conservator position at the Transylvanian Museum Association. The association operated under modest circumstances; the aging head of the Department of Natural Sciences, Sámuel Brassai, managed the collection in Kolozsvár (Cluj) with a single employee. He offered one third of his annual salary of 1000 Forints to hire a conservator. Herman submitted a prepared abino skylark and a stuffed ermine, accompanied by a letter of support from Kálmán Chernel. On 6 April 1864, Brassai announced that he hired an individual from Kőszeg at his own expense. Herman's multifaceted scientific work and political engagement began with the period 1864–1872 in Kolozsvár. He produced his first major scientific work here on the Eurasian hobby, which was published in 1865 under the title \\"Falco subbuteo Linné\\". He wrote a number of popular works in Kolozsvár, for example, \\"The Art of the Spider\\" appeared in the 1866 Kolozsvár Almanach. Brassai and Herman had were almost identical in appearance. both wearing shoulder length hair and long beards. The striking exterior masked people who wanted to know and experience everything, especially the life of animals in natural surroundings. However, the two scientists did not share the same character: Brassai loved to spend time on the details, while Herman sought out great generalizations, delving into details only to support his arguments. Herman did not strive for popularity and despised those scientists who searched out unknown species to have their name remembered in the academic world. Instead, he tried to look for relationships and publish his experiences for the benefit ordinary people. In order to enrich the collection of the Transylvanian Museum, he performed several field trips, for example to the Székely region and the Transylvanian Plain. As a result of his work the zoological collections was becoming more and more rich and notable. He also collected minerals and is noted for his findings of syenite és a ditroite. Due to the growing domestic and international prestige, was soon offered new challenges. Carl Brunner invited him to Vienna to participate in a planned African zoological expedition to Cameroon. The Hungarian Natural History Society, thanks to the efforts of Kálmán Szily and János Frivaldszky, counter-offered with a multi-year scholarship to retain him. Instead of the foreign trip, Herman produced, to great international acclaim, a monograph on the domestic spider fauna, in which he provided descriptions of 328 species of spiders including 36 new ones. He became an employee of the Hungarian National Museum in 1875. Here he was able to publish scientific works such as the above-mentioned monograph on spiders, which appeared in 1875, 1877, and 1878 along with his own illustrations. The three-volume work was all the more popular abroad as the first and the second volumes were written in both Hungarian and German. The third volume was written in Hungarian only, with a German summary in the appendix. The bilingualism of the work was of great importance, since until then most scientific treatises were published in German. These results allowed the Hungarian publications to be read abroad, while serving to establish Hungarian as a language of scientific discourse. ==Legacy== Ottó Herman's holiday home in Lillafüred, Hungary Herman was the author of an enormous quantity of valuable scientific works, totaling 5940 pages. He published 14 books as well as 1140 articles and lectures. He identified 36 new spider species. Today, many schools and institutions bear his name, including one of the largest high schools in Miskolc, the Ottó Herman Gimnázium. In 1953, the museum of Borsod-Miskolc chose Ottó Herman Museum as its name. In 1960, the Hungarian Post issued a commemorative stamp in honour of the 125th anniversary of the birth of Ottó Herman; the stamp was designed by graphic artists József Vertel and László Kékesi. The Ottó Herman Medal was created in 1962 to recognize Hungarian karst and cave explorers. In 1915, the Herman Ottó cave west of Miskolc was named in tribute to the polymath scientist. A lake bearing his name forms part of the Orfű lake system in Baranya county. The Plant Protection Research Institute of the Academy is located in a street named after him in Budapest's II. district. A species of lace bug, Lasiacantha hermani (Vásárhelyi, 1977) bears his name. His former home built in 1890 in Lillafüred, which he called \\"Pele-house\\", was a tourist hut bearing his name, and is now known as Ottó Herman Memorial House. It is now the home of two permanent exhibitions presenting the scientist's life, as well as the wildlife of the Bükk Mountains. In accordance with Herman's will, his remains were moved from Budapest to Miskolc in 1965 and placed in the Hámori cemetery. His tomb is marked by Miklós Varga's sculpture. In remembrance of his accomplishment, the Ottó Herman National Biology competition is held biannually in Hungary. The City Council of Miskolc has created the Ottó Herman Scientific Award, which is presented annually as part of a celebrations of the City of Miskolc. The first honoree in 2001 was museum curator Lászlo Kárpáti. The year 2014 marked the 100th anniversary of Herman's death; the National Environment Institute organized Herman Otto Commemorative Year at the national level, to honour the scientist and his work. As part of the anniversary celebration, the City Council of Miskolc posthumously awarded honorary citizenship to Herman. Starting December 2014, Duna Television broadcast a four-part documentary about the life of the scientist, entitled Ottó Herman, the Last Hungarian Polymath. ==References* * Category:1835 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Hungarian entomologists Category:Hungarian ornithologists Category:Hungarian ethnographers Category:Hungarian politicians Category:Arachnologists Category:People from Brezno ","title":"Ottó Herman"},{"id":"46364918","text":"Benjamin Oliver Coad (born 10 January 1994) is an English cricketer, contracted to play for Yorkshire County Cricket Club. ==Early life and education== Coad was born on 10 January 1994 in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England.

She never knew her father, Timothy Lemont, and she was brought up by her mother who was a shop assistant. Her father was in the navy. She trained as a nurse and moved to the UK in the 1920s. While she was helping women in North Kensington she met and was inspired by the veteran suffragette Flora Drummond who was nicknamed \\"The General\\". She became involved with the feminist Six Point Group after her arrival in England.Mary Stott, 'Obituary: Juanita Frances', The Guardian, 2 December 1992 The group wanted to get women's equality included in the work of the League of Nations and the \\"Equal Rights International Group\\" was formed and Frances was sent to Geneva where she had three unproductive meetings. She wanted to empower mothers and married women. She was instrumental in setting up the Married Women's Association in 1938, and later served as its president. The first President of the MWA was Edith Summerskill and other notable recruits were Vera Brittain, the lawyer Helena Normanton and later in 1945 Lady Helen Nutting. In 1947 after they had two children she divorced her husband, a banker named Gerald Leonard Schlesinger. The London house which he had built became the MWA's official headquarters. 1952 was the big split. Helena Normington was President and she took an independent line when presenting evidence to the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce. Rank and file objections were made that the approach favoured privileged women which was not the association's aim. The row resulted in a schism and the formation of the Council of Married Women led by Normanton, Doreen Gorsky, Evelyn Hamilton and Helen Nutting. These had been the President, Chair, Deputy Chair and Secretary, respectively, before their resignations.

Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. The electoral law provided that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electors registered in Cantabria. Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called. Election date The term of the Parliament of Cantabria expired four years after the date of its previous election. Elections to the Parliament were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Legal amendments introduced in 1998 allowed for these to be held together with European Parliament elections, provided that they were scheduled for within a four month-timespan. The previous election was held on 28 May 1995, setting the election date for the Parliament concurrently with a European Parliament election on Sunday, 13 June 1999. After legal amendments in 1998, the President of the Autonomous Community was granted the prerogative to dissolve the Parliament of Cantabria and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no nationwide election was due and some time requirements were met: namely, that dissolution did not occur either during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year has elapsed since a previous dissolution. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Parliament was to be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called. Any snap election held as a result of these circumstances would not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remained of their four-year terms. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 20 seats were required for an absolute majority in the Parliament of Cantabria. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! style=\\"width:250px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Polling firm/Commissioner ! style=\\"width:125px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Fieldwork date ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Sample size ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Turnout ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PP ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PSOE ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" UPCA ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PRC ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" IU ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Lead - ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" -  colspan=\\"10\\" A0A0A0\\" - EFEFEF;\\"  1999 regional election  13 Jun 1999   68.8   42.5  33.1  3.1  13.5  3.7  style=\\"background:; color:white;\\" 9.4 -  colspan=\\"10\\" A0A0A0\\" -  Eco Consulting/ABC  24 May–2 Jun 1999 ?

After serving in the Navy, Dalenberg enrolled in Northwestern University in the School of Engineering. Dalenberg initially discovered Buddhism after attending a talk by Alan Watts in Chicago in 1949. Dalenberg eventually graduated Northwestern with a degree in Philosophy. After moving to California in the 1950s, Dalenberg began attending the American Academy of Asian Studies where he met D.T. Suzuki, Gary Snyder and others who deepened his interest in Buddhism. Dalenberg was a member of a zazenkai group with Snyder, Philip Whalen, Albert Saijo, and Lew Welch.

She is considered to be a \\"renegade feminist\\" whose work critiques dominant cultural stereotypes involving socioeconomics, race, gender and sexuality. Carrasco is as equally comfortable as an artist in creating large-scale works, like murals, as she is with detailed, small-scale pen and ink work. Her art has been exhibited nationally and internationally. She was part of the important Chicano art exhibit, Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation (CARA). Carrasco continues to create art and teach others about art today. == Biography == Carrasco was born in El Paso, Texas to Mexican- American parents. She was the second-oldest child and oldest girl in her family. She had two brothers and two sisters growing up. When she was around a year or so of age, her family moved to Los Angeles. They lived in government Veteran's housing in Culver City since her father was a Korean War Navy veteran. She recalls that they were poor and lived off of food stamps. Carrasco's childhood growing up in the predominantly Mexican-American and African-American community of Mar Vista Gardens was sometimes painful, because she was teased for having lighter skin than her peers and stood out for her green eyes; being called \\"white girl,\\" \\"green eyes\\" and \\"güera.\\" Her experiences with being simultaneously perceived as not truly Mexican-American and being told to \\"take advantage of being light skinned\\" makes up of part of her artistic subject matter later on in life. Carrasco said that her father encouraged her to broaden her horizons, go to college and encouraged her artwork. He had appreciated art and he was considered artistic. Her father, who worked as a bus driver for Santa Monica Bus Lines said that \\"anybody could be a bus driver but not everybody could be an artist.\\" Carrasco's father died of a heart attack when she was twelve and it was difficult for her because she was always close to her father. Carrasco's mother, who also volunteered as a Girl Scout leader, was also artistically inclined. Her mother admired Japanese art and decorated the house with it. Carrasco felt that growing up with Japanese images influenced her sense of line. She also felt that her mother was a personal role model because she was a strong woman. Her mother was also, however, very protective of her girls, and she expected Carrasco to act as a role model of traditional femininity for her sisters. Carrasco attended Catholic school from first to eighth grade. At school, like in her neighborhood, Carrasco felt that there was racism practiced there and that Anglo and white students were \\"treated better.\\" She often drew on the tables at the Catholic school instead of paying attention to her lessons. Because she was so often in her own \\"little world of drawing,\\" she repeated first grade. Some of the nuns, however, noticed and encouraged her talent, including Sister Mary Ann, who continued to stay in contact with Carrasco after she left school. In seventh grade, when she made her confirmation as a Catholic, Carrasco chose Saint Joan of Arc as her confirmation name because she was inspired by her leadership. During the summers, she and her sisters were part of a program that helped young people from the projects attend classes at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Carrasco credits the program with also expanding her horizons and encouraging her to apply for college. Carrasco attended Venice High School. Her high school art teacher, Mr. Shakagi, challenged her to try different mediums, including ballpoint pen, for creating art. Carrasco was very involved in both journalism and art in high school, but at the time hadn't started becoming very politically active yet. Carrasco received her BFA in art from UCLA in 1978. She was the first person in her family to graduate from college. At UCLA, she was the first woman editor of the campus Chicano newspaper, the La Gente. Carrasco deliberately chose demanding art professors, like Jan Stussey, at UCLA who gave her a solid background in drawing. Carrasco was one of the first artists to join with Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers (UFW) movement. She heard him speak at UCLA when she was nineteen and she says that she \\"volunteered right after the speech.\\" She did volunteer artwork for Chavez for fifteen years because she believed both in his movement and in Chavez himself. Occasionally, Chavez was able to reimburse her for art supplies, but most of the work Carrasco did was unpaid. Carrasco helped create \\"monumental banners\\" for the United Farm Workers movement and protests. Right after graduating from UCLA, Carrasco helped work on art for the Zoot Suit play, which later opened on Broadway. She also became involved with the Public Art Center (Centro del Arte Publico) after UCLA. She was one of a number of women invited to join the Centro. In the mid-1980s, Carrasco was commissioned to do a mural, The History of Los Angeles: A Mexican Perspective which led to a great deal of controversy. The publicity generated from the controversy, however helped Carrasco in some ways: she was chosen to go with a group of artists to the Soviet Union in 1985 and paint a mural in the Children's Museum in Yerevan, Armenia. She went on a second trip to the Soviet Union the next year and also took Dolores Huerta's thirteen-year-old son, Ricky, with her. She also went to Nicaragua in 1986 with a UCLA program called the Chicano Delegation to Nicaragua. It was during the Nicaraguan Revolution and the experience affected Carrasco deeply, making her think about death in a different context. Carrasco received her MFA in art from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in 1991. After graduating from CalArts, she didn't feel inspired and stopped producing art for about two years. In addition, the death of Cesar Chavez in 1993 created a sense of deep depression in Carrasco: she felt that there were not enough Chicano leaders and that few people could take his place. In the mid 1990s, Carrasco married artist, Harry Gamboa Jr. Gamboa and Carrasco had been good friends first for some time, and Carrasco liked him especially because he was \\"supportive of women artists.\\" In 1994, she had a daughter, Barbie. In 1995, she was diagnosed with lymphoma and in 1996 had a bone marrow transplant to treat the disease. After the transplant, Carrasco felt that her hand was less steady for detailed work. She is a founding member of the Dolores Huerta Foundation and serves as a board member. Carrasco was a UC Regents Professor in 2002-2003. She was recognized as a \\"community champion\\" in Los Angeles in 2014. == Art == Carrasco's art is often very focused on social commentary. She uses her art to advocate change in the treatment of women. She has been publicly acknowledged for her role in making the Chicano art movement aware of sexist attitudes. Her art also addresses problems that she sees with religious dogma as it relates to women. Carrasco uses her art to bring attention to issues that would otherwise remain invisible. She also helps celebrate influential women, like in her \\"iconic representation\\" of Dolores Huerta. Carrasco herself has stated that because she was so political, her art hasn't been taken as seriously. Carrasco credits older Chicana artists, like Santa Barraza, with creating a \\"positive impact\\" on her work. She also enjoyed working with other Chicana artists in her generation, like her friend Yreina Cervantez. Carrasco's work often uses \\"fine lines, sharp detail and a hard-edged graphic quality.\\" Carrasco was active with the United Farm Workers (UFW), creating banners for them between the years of 1976 and 1991. Carrasco worked closely with Chavez to create many banners for conventions, rallies and supermarket demonstrations. One of the largest banners she created for the UFW was about 30 feet by 30 feet on vinyl with Nasdar ink. Carrasco had about two weeks to complete the work and recruited a few people to help her finish it on time. The last banner she did for UFW was Cesar Chavez's funeral banner. Because of her critical stance towards culture, Carrasco has had her work rejected or censored based on the theme. Carrasco was commissioned to create a mural for the Los Angeles Bicentennial but her History of Los Angeles: A Mexican Perspective was too edgy for the project. The History of Los Angeles (1981), a 16 by 80 foot mural, sponsored by the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) became a portable mural that was only fully displayed one time because too many government officials felt it was too critical of events in American history. There were fifty-one separate events depicted in the mural. Events depicted in this mural include the Japanese American internment, the whitewashing of Siqueiros's mural, America Tropical, and the Zoot Suit Riots. Carrasco worked with three different historians to ensure that her information was accurate and conducted oral interviews with \\"city elders.\\" To create the mural, she had 17 young assistants, many of them gang members. There were several times that CRA attempted to censor the subject matter in the mural and even attempted to destroy the mural itself. Carrasco refused to censor her mural because she felt \\"that it would be compromising the integrity of--not only my integrity as an artist but the mural, the history of L.A.\\" Later, there was a court battle over the copyright of the mural, which Carrasco won. Carrasco felt that the controversy over the mural was tiring, but it also helped generate publicity for her as an artist. In response to the censorship of the History of Los Angeles: A Mexican Perspective, Carrasco created the seriograph, Self-Portrait (1985) at Self-Help Graphics. Self-Portrait depicts an artist dressed as a runner crossing a finish line. The runner, carrying a paintbrush looks over her shoulder in horror as a paint-roller whitewashes the mural grid behind her. The whitewashing of Siqueiros's controversial mural is referenced again on the brush itself. In 1989, Carrasco created a computer animation, PESTICIDES!, which was shown in Times Square in New York. It was considered \\"controversial.\\" Names Can Hurt (1991), was the first piece that Carrasco did which contained text. It was acrylic on canvas and contains many of the names she was called as a child growing up in Culver City. One of Carrasco's most iconic images is her print, Dolores (1999). The image depicts a bust of Dolores Huerta on a flat background with just her name. The image has a pop art sensibility to it. Carrasco states that she isolated her portrait in such a way to show that Huerta was \\"strong enough on her own.\\" == References  External links == * Barbara Carrasco at Laguna Art Museum Category:American artists of Mexican descent Category:Chicano Category:Mexican-American culture in Los Angeles Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture alumni Category:American muralists Category:American printmakers Category:Chicana feminists Category:Women muralists Category:American women printmakers Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Barbara Carrasco"},{"id":"46365418","text":"Hemimachairodus is an extinct genus of saber-tooth cat of the tribe Machairodontini and subfamily Machairodontinae.

He was even Governor of Italian Eritrea during 1937. ==Biography== Vincenzo De Feo was born in Mirabello Sannitico near Campobasso in September 1876. His paternal uncle, Francesco De Feo, was a patriot during the Risorgimento and in 1860 commanded the \\"First Legion Sannitica\\". The young Vincenzo was formed in the Italian Naval Academy of Livorno, where it came out in October 1890 with the degree in electrical engineering. He took part in the 1911–1912 Italo-Turkish War. During World War I he fought in submarines participating in various military operations in the Mediterranean sea, for which he was decorated with two \\"Silver war medals\\" in 1915 and in 1918. Vincenzo De Feo became Admiral on December 20, 1934. He was even a clever technician who, only in \\"Italian Marina\\", boasted patents of five specializations: underwater weapons, chemical explosives, electronics, telegraphy, ballistics. He invented a peculiar gyroscope called gimetro, an aiming system that was adopted by the Italian fleet from 1930 on all control shooting. De Feo collaborated with the \\"Rivista Marittima\\" from 1906 to 1936, supporting the strategic importance of submarines and aircraft carriers in naval battles. As uncle of Ugo Tiberio, he supported his research at the Naval Academy for the development of the Italian radar system. De Feo was appointed in 1937 Governor of 'Eritrea and remained in Italian Asmara since April 1, 1937 until December 15, 1937. He succeeded to Alfredo Guzzoni, and was later replaced by Giuseppe Daodice. He was appointed Senator in the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy, on the proposal of the \\"Ministero della Marina\\" on March 25, 1939 and was sworn in April 17, 1939. When World War II started De Feo was assigned to the \\"Commission of Armistice with France\\": he signed the Protocol, related to the \\"Italian Marina\\" issues, that regulated the conditions of the French surrender. In Rome the High Court of Justice for Sanctions against Fascism on August 7, 1944 punished him for having supported fascism and declared that he was held responsible of promoting war: he made possible it with his votes and with individual actions, including propaganda carried on and off the Senate.Judgment of Cassation on De Feo removal (Sezz.

He is best known as Chief Information Officer of Grindhouse Wetware, a biotechnology startup company that creates technology to augment human capabilities. Grindhouse was co-founded by Cannon and Shawn Sarver in 2012. Cannon himself has had a variety of body modification implants, and has been referred to in the media as a cyborg. Cannon has spoken at conferences around the world on the topics of human enhancement, futurism, and citizen science, including at TEDx Rosslyn, FITUR, the University of Maryland, the World Business Dialogue, the Medical Entrepreneur Startup Hospital, and others. He has been published in Wired and featured in television shows such as National Geographic Channel's \\"The Big Picture with Kal Penn\\". Cannon has been featured on podcasts including Ryan O'Shea's \\"Future Grind\\" and Roderick Russell's \\"Remarkably Human\\". ==Implants== Cannon has had a variety of body modification implants, including a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag in his hand and magnetic implants in a finger, wrist, and tragus, causing him to be labelled a cyborg by media outlets including Business Insider, Newsweek, The Awl, and others. Because of legal and ethical restrictions on the types of surgery that can be done on humans, most of these modifications cannot be done by doctors or anesthetists. Instead they are done by body modification experts or on a \\"DIY\\" basis. In May 2012, inspired by Lepht Anonym, Cannon had finger magnets implanted to give him an \\"extra sense\\", the ability to feel electromagnetism. In October 2013, Cannon became the first person to be implanted with the Grindhouse-designed biometric sensor known as Circadia, a procedure which was performed by body modification artist Steve Haworth in Essen, Germany. The device, approximately the size of a deck of playing cards, automatically sent Cannon's temperature to his phone, was powered wirelessly through inductive charging, and mimicked bioluminescence with subdermal LEDs. After a few months as an initial proof- of-concept test, a series of panic attacks led to the device's removal. Cannon is currently working to design an improved, consumer-friendly version of his Circadia implant that measures additional biometrics such as blood glucose, blood oxygen, blood pressure, and heart rate data. In November 2015, Tim had a prototype of Grindhouse’s Northstar device implanted into his right forearm during a procedure at the “Cyborg Fair” in Düsseldorf, Germany. A little larger than a coin, Northstar contained five LED lights, creating a bioluminescent effect when touched with a magnet (such as the ones implanted in Cannon's fingertips.) Its purpose is solely aesthetic. Capable of blinking around 10,000 times before the battery runs down, the device has been presented as a way to \\"light\\" tattoos. ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Futurologists Category:Cyberneticists Category:Life extensionists Category:American transhumanists Category:People from Camden, Ohio ","title":"Tim Cannon"},{"id":"46365478","text":"Pint of Science is an annual science festival that aims to communicate contemporary scientific developments to the public by bringing scientists to pubs, cafés and other public places to share their research and findings. It is mainly organised and run by volunteer postgraduate or postdoctoral researchers, lecturers and public engagement staff who are based at universities or research institutions. The festival takes place annually in the month of May and covers all aspects of research which are themed under the titles 'Beautiful Mind', 'Atoms to Galaxies', 'Our Body', 'Planet Earth', 'Tech Me Out', 'Our Society' and art-science events 'Creative Reactions'. During May 2019, thousands of researchers across 400 cities and 24 countries shared and discussed their findings with people. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Pint of Science festival took place online in September. ==History== Pint of Science has its roots in a 2012 initiative by a group of UK based postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers. Festival founders Dr. Michael Motskin and Dr. Praveen Paul were then researching different neurodegenerative conditions at Imperial College London and thought that there was a gap between their research efforts and what motivated them. In addition, when discussing their work with friends, especially some of the new techniques being used, such as nanoparticle delivery of drugs to the brain, their friends thought it sounded like science fiction. They felt that it was important to show how scientists conduct research, especially to the individuals and families affected by the conditions that they were working on. In September 2012, they organised ‘Meet the Researchers’, an event that brought people affected by Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, motor neuron disease, and multiple sclerosis into their labs so that they could see the research being carried out there. They said afterwards: \\"The guests were fascinated by the approaches being used to try to understand the biological basis of these afflictions and by the latest developments in both basic research and translational efforts. This event was inspirational to everyone involved - researchers and visitors alike. We thought that, if people want to come to labs to meet scientists, why not bring scientists to people? This was the birth of Pint of Science.\\" After running the first festival in May 2013 in three cities, Pint of Science received many emails from people wanting to join the festival - both around the UK and the rest of the world. ==Event format== Pint of Science talkThere is no fixed format and freedom is given to the local organisers for how events are run. Rather than a series of formal talks, Pint of Science aims to recreate the buzz of popular music festivals, offering multiple stages across each city that allow leading experts in various scientific fields to present, discuss and take questions on their latest discoveries and research with members of the public. The events aim to have an interactive element, from demonstrations to quizzes, entertainment or robots. Some events combine art and science and are called Creative Reactions. The UK Cambridge Pint of Science team started Creative Reactions as a collaboration between artists and Pint of Science scientists to produce artworks related to the science presented at the talks. They matched artists with their 50 speakers in Pint of Science Cambridge. The artists create a unique piece of art based on their interpretations of the scientific subjects in various forms of art such as illustrations, painting, jewellery, screen-printing, film, dance and more. The result of the collaboration was displayed in the very first Creative Reactions exhibition at the end of the 2015 festival, which had over 700 visitors in Cambridge. Creative Reactions exhibitions and performances have since expanded to further cities in the UK. ==International== In just its second year (2014), the Pint of Science festival expanded to include Australia, France, Ireland, Switzerland and the US, with all countries holding the events over the same three days. Pint of Science currently takes place in over 25 countries and across hundreds of cities.

Romulus.Plutarch, and Bernadotte Perrin. 1914. Lives. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.http://www.loebclassics.com/view/plutarch- lives_romulus/1914/pb_LCL046.137.xml?rskey=g0qgUH&result;=3 Romulus' Victory Over Acron (Romulus, Conqueror of Acron) is a painting completed in 1812 by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Ingres' source for this subject comes from Plutarch's Life of Romulus. The painting depicts the war that resulted from the Roman abduction of the young Sabine women in an effort to remedy the shortage of women in the newly founded city of Rome. In retaliation Acron, the king of the neighbouring tribe, the Caeninenses, declared war upon the Romans. He and his tribesmen were mercilessly defeated and their city sacked by the Romans.Plutarch and Bernadotte Perrin. 1914. Lives. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. http://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL046/1914/volume.xml. == Style and composition == Head of a horse of Selene from the east pediment of the Parthenon. Acropolis, Athens, 438–432 BChttps://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/h/head_of_a_horse_of_selene.aspx The subject, style and size of the piece make it clear that this piece embodies the Neoclassical tradition. At 276 x 530cm it is one of Ingres’ largest paintings and this grand scale is consistent with his previous classical subject paintings, such as Jupiter and Thetis. The canvas is cast in the form of a long frieze, a style traditional of the ancient world. Ingres introduces several motifs from ancient art; the horse for example is a clear homage to the marble horse of the Parthenon frieze. Ingres also uses tempera to evoke the matte quality of ancient Roman frescos.Vigne, Georges (1995). Ingres. Paris: Abbeville Press. 103 In the painting there is an element of stunted action which creates a somewhat icy and unemotional aspect which is a feature of the new Gothic style that was emerging forcefully in the early 19th century. == Influences == Jacques-Louis David, The Intervention of the Sabine Women, 1799 It is not just from the ancient world that Ingres took his inspiration. Elements of the painting recall the work of Jacques-Louis David, Europe's leading painter at the turn of the century and Ingres' master with whom he studied for four years. Romulus' Victory Over Acron has several points of similarity with David's The Intervention of the Sabine Women of 1799. The figure of Ingres' slain Acron closely matches that of his master's dead Sabine. The shield, depicting the she-wolf and infant twins Romulus and Remus characteristic of the Roman foundation myth, is also the same save that Ingres omitted the inscription. The warrior to the extreme left of the Sabines, whose stance derives from the antique, finds a fairly confirming echo in Ingres' victorious Romulus.King, Edward S. (1942). \\"Ingres as Classicist\\". The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery. Vol. 5, 73-74. It has also been suggested that the pose of Romulus was inspired by a fragment of a Roman bas-relief after a work by Phidias, a classical Greek sculptor.Wildenstein, Georges (1956). Ingres. 2nd ed. Great Britain: Hunt Barnard and Co. LTD. 175. == Commissioning and history == The painting—together with The Dream of Ossian—was commissioned by General Miollis in 1811 for Napoleon Bonaparte's residence, the Palazzo Monte Cavallo (now the Palazzo Quirinale) and was intended as decoration of the empress's second salon.Hauptman, William (2006). Ingres. Milan: Continents Editions. In 1815 the Romulus was taken out of the Quirinale and brought to the Palazzo di San Giovanni in Laterano. In 1857 it was given by Pope Pius IX to Napoleon III who presented it to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where it was hung in the Amphithéatre d'Honneur, until 1969 when it was deposited at the Louvre. In January 2017 it returned to the Ecole des Beaux-arts for restoration before being re-installed in the newly restored Amphithéatre d'Honneur (May 2017).http://www.beauxartsparis.com/images/telechargements/pdf/presse/Ingres/CP- Ingres-et-ses-eleves.pdf ==ReferencesBibliography== *Daniel Ternois, Ingres, Paris, Fernand Nathan, 1980 () *Robert Rosenblum, Ingres, Paris, Cercle d'Art, coll. « La Bibliothèque des Grands Peintres », 1986 () Category:1812 paintings Category:Paintings by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres Category:Paintings of the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts Category:Horses in art Category:Adaptations of works by Plutarch ","title":"Romulus' Victory Over Acron"},{"id":"46365497","text":"Dumbarton Concerts is an American nonprofit organization which presents classical chamber and jazz music performances in Washington, D.C.\\"Post- Classical Ensemble, National Cathedral Boy and Girl Choristers perform at Dumbarton\\".

She is the executive director of United and Strong and the Eastern Caribbean Coordinator of Caribbean Forum for Liberation and Acceptance of Genders and Sexualities (CariFLAGS). Between 2014 and 2016, she served at the Women's Secretariat for the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. She has been on the forefront of bringing LGBT issues into discussion throughout the Anglo-Caribbean and international community. In 2013, she was selected as Star Publishing's People’s Choice for Person of the Year in St. Lucia, the first time an LGBT person had been honored with the award in her country. ==Biography== Kenita Placide grew up in the Castries Quarter of Faux A Chaux in St. Lucia, attending Canon Laurie Primary and Vide Boutielle Secondary School. She studied women’s psychology and women’s human rights at the Athabasca University and University of Toronto and was trained in HIV testing, counseling and facilitating. She later studied Computer Systems Analysis and Design and Computer Maintenance and Repair at the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College. Advocacy Her activism began at Vide Boutielle as a member of the school's Drug Free Club, where she served as a representative to the island's AIDS Committee and attended government health meetings from 1996 to 2000. In 2000, she co-founded United and Strong as an advocacy group to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic and they were able to register the organization in 2005. In 2006, Placide represented United and Strong at a regional meeting, and the following year was elected to the Board of the organization and has served as its co-Executive Director since that time. With her joining the Board, United and Strong transitioned from a primarily health driven initiative to a human rights advocacy organization. While their primary focus is elimination of stigma and discrimination for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people, the organization seeks justice for all marginalized communities. In 2008, Placide addressed the Constitution Reform Commission urging elimination of discrimination for LGBT citizens and in 2009 she participated in St. Lucia's Universal Periodic Review for the United Nations. The Review occurred in 2011 and United and Strong was the only NGO from St. Lucian to submit a shadow report, increasing the international exposure and networking opportunities for the organization and Placide. In 2010 Placide was elected as a Secretary-General Alternate for the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), served as the Alternate Women’s Secretariat from 2012, and in 2014 was elected as the ILGA Women's Secretariat. In 2016, her colleague Jessica St Rose took the position. Since 2010, Placide has been an Outreach Officer at the AIDS Action Foundation and since 2012 the Eastern Caribbean Coordinator for Caribbean Forum for Liberation and Acceptance of Genders and Sexualities (CariFLAGS). Placide also serves on the board of the Caribbean Alliance for Equality (CAE). In July, 2011, Placide organized the first regional LGBT security and human rights training for the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and a regional documentation training for activists in 2013. In February 2012, she coordinated the first seminar in the Caribbean for International Dialogue on Human Rights. That same year, Placide led a public dialogue with the Ministry of Education and the Prime Minister’s office on the theme “Eradicate hate, educate”. The annual dialogue included the topic \\"education and awareness are the building blocks of acceptance and love,\\" for 2015. In 2013, Placide and United and Strong, in conjunction with Fundashon Orguyo Korsou (Curaçao Pride Foundation) (FOKO) from Curaçao, hosted a Caribbean Women and Sexual Diversity Conference which brought together LBT women from 14 Caribbean countries in a networking and leadership session. Placide received an award in 2012 from ILGA for her activism in spite of threats and the destruction of United and Strong's offices in an arson attack. In 2013, she was selected as Star Publishing's People’s Choice for Person of the Year in St. Lucia, the first time an LGBT person had been honored with the award in her country. Placide has been at the forefront of bringing LGBT issues into discussion in St. Lucia and throughout the Anglo-Caribbean and international community. Through regional and international networks, she is developing strategies to overcome the reluctance to embrace diversity in the Caribbean. == References  *Kenita Placide, a St. Lucian LGBT activist, shares her personal story Category:Living people Category:HIV/AIDS activists Category:Saint Lucian human rights activists Category:LGBT rights activists from St. Lucia Category:Women human rights defenders Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kenita Placide"},{"id":"46365541","text":"Matsuda Yuriko (born 1943) is a Japanese ceramic artist. Matsuda Yuriko, Tea Caddy and Tea Bowl, The Brooklyn Museum == Work and accomplishments == Matsuda Yuriko was a visiting artist in the exhibition Soaring Voices, which focused on female Japanese ceramic artists. Her work is in The Brooklyn Museum, The Yale Art Gallery, the Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas, and the San Antonio Museum of Art, among others. == Themes and influences == Matsuda’s work is often centered on body shapes, painted with bright colors, and hand-built. Her forms are irregular and playful, often dealing with themes of parody and exaggeration. Her works range from ceramic feet, teapots mounted with bananas, irregular vessels decorated with eggplants, ceramic buttocks, and roller skates, all handcrafted and colorfully painted. Her work shares elements with Dadaism, sharing playful elements with Man Ray and Elsa Schiaparelli. It often depicts decorations in red enamel with gold kinrande detailing, in the style of Imari porcelain export wares. Matsuda’s work subverts the traditional Japanese uses of colored glazes and gold patterning by applying them to a pair of porcelain feet, mounted on wooden blocks. Her work is not designed for strict functionality. Rather, they diverge from witty cultural commentary to self-expression. This break from tradition may be linked to the exclusion of women from the ceramic arts in Japan. Despite Japan’s long history of ceramic arts, Matsuda’s work may be read as springing from the post-war alternatives to traditional Japanese forms and the apprentice system. As women studied ceramics in universities, they broke from the traditional apprentice system, which created functional and artistic vessels but relegated women to the outskirts of production, from decoration to adding glazes. Women remained on the periphery of the ceramic world until the education and material post-war developments of broadly available universities and the more common appearance of gas and electric kiln. After World War II, Japanese ceramic work shifted in more sculptural, experimental, and expressive directions. == References == Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Japanese women artists Category:Japanese ceramists Category:Japanese women ceramists ","title":"Matsuda Yuriko"},{"id":"46365546","text":"Carlos Martins (born 1961 in Alentejo, Portugal) is a Portuguese saxophonist, jazz musician and composer and a reference in the Portuguese cultural scene. He is known for his artistic works, compositions and collaborations in contemporary music, jazz and world music, both in Portugal and abroad as well as his conceptual works as artistic director and producer. ==Biography== Carlos Martins studied contemporary music, composition and saxophone in Lisbon, Barcelona and New York City. He was teaching at the Conservatório Nacional de Lisboa as well as the Jazz School Hot Clube de Portugal in Lisbon and at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. He founded some of the most important Portuguese jazz groups and performed at a number of national and international festivals. He looks back on numerous collaborations with both Portuguese artists from different disciplines like Bernardo Sassetti, Maria João, Rui Horta as well as international acclaimed artists such as Cindy Blackman and George Garzone. He released seven albums of his own music as band leader, some of them awarded as the best national jazz records in Portugal and appeared on plenty of others as musician. Apart from his own compositions, he composed for films, theatre plays and dance and has contributed to a number of interdisciplinary projects. ==Style== His saxophone sound indicates references to American jazz musicians such as John Coltrane or Sonny Rollins, and European jazz musicians including Jan Garbarek, but his music is deeply rooted in the Mediterranean and lusophone music culture. His style is influenced by different elements, coming as well from the Mediterranean music, especially the Portuguese traditional music, like Fado or Canto Alentejano, but also from other lusophone areas e.g. Brasil, Cabo Verde or Mozambique. ==Work as artistic director== In 1996 he founded the Sons da Lusofonia, a project in which artists from the lusophone world collaborate for a better citizenship. Since 2002 he is artistic director of the Portuguese national jazz festival, Festa do Jazz, and, since 2006, the artistic director of Lisboa Mistura, an intercultural festival with a focus on new cultural tendencies and innovative formats. Apart from his artistic work he is socially engaged in different educational projects and is consulting in urban studies. ==Discography== *2014 - Absence Carlos Martins Quartet with Carlos Barreto, Mário Delgado, Alexandre Frazão *2008 - Agua Carlos Martins Quintet with Bernardo Sassetti, Carlos Barreto, Mário Delgado, Alexandre Frazão *2006 - Do Outro Lado Carlos Martins Quintet with Bernardo Sassetti, Carlos Barreto, Mário Delgado, Alexandre Frazão, with Orchestra *1999 - Sempre Carlos Martins Quintet with Bernardo Sassetti, Carlos Barreto, Mário Delgado, Alexandre Frazão *1998 - Caminho Longe Orchestra Sons da Lusofonia, directed by Carlos Martins *1997 - Outras Indias Carlos Martins and Vasco Martins *1996 - Passagem* Carlos Martins Quartet *1991 - Cem Caminhos Quinteto de Maria João *1983 - Maria João, Quinteto Maria João == References== Category:Living people Category:1961 births Category:Portuguese musicians Category:Portuguese male musicians Category:Portuguese artists Category:21st-century Portuguese musicians Category:20th-century Portuguese musicians ","title":"Carlos Martins (musician)"},{"id":"46365548","text":"Jason Rabedeaux (April 4, 1965 – September 22, 2014) was an American college basketball coach who served as the head coach of the UTEP Miners from 1999 to 2002. Rabedeaux was also a top assistant at Washington State and Oklahoma prior to becoming UTEP's head coach. ==Early life== Rabedeaux was born in Aurora, Illinois, and moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin when he was seven. Rabedeaux attended Eau Claire Memorial High School, playing basketball, American football and baseball; he quarterbacked the Old Abes to the state semifinals in his senior year, while earning All-State in basketball and baseball. He was a walk on at the University of California, Davis, and was named all-conference twice. He ended his UC Davis career with 1,112 points, 15th-most in school history. He holds the school record for the three-pointers in a season (80), most three-pointers in a game (six) and most free throws in a game (14). In 1995, he was inducted into the UC Davis Aggies Athletics Hall of Fame. Rabedeaux holds a bachelor's degree in exercise physiology, and at Washington State in 1991, earned a master's degree in athletic administration. ==Coaching career== Upon finishing his college career, Rabedeaux spent a season as an assistant coach with North Adams State College, then joined Washington State, working with Kelvin Sampson as a graduate assistant (1989–1991) and eventually assistant coach (1992–1994). When Sampson went to Oklahoma, Rabedeaux followed him, working as an assistant coach. With Rabedeaux, the Sooners averaged 20.6 wins over five years, qualifying for the NCAA Tournament each year, including a Sweet 16 appearance in 1999. Rabedeaux, who had served as recruiting director with North Adams, Washington State and Oklahoma, established himself as one of the top recruiters in the nation. Two of his recruits, Nate Erdmann and Corey Brewer, were later drafted by the Utah Jazz and Miami Heat in 1997 and 1998 respectively. Rabedeaux's recruiting also extended into Mexico, with recruit Eduardo Nájera becoming a 2000 Wooden Award candidate. On September 10, 1999, Rabedeaux was hired by UTEP to replace Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins. In his first year, the Miners, with a lack of depth, finished 13–15, six of their losses being by less than three points; the Miners also swept the New Mexico Lobos for the first time in 14 years, and won at the Lobos' home arena, The Pit, the first such win for the Miners in nine seasons. In 2000, the Miners improved to 23–9 with a 10–6 record against conference opponents, while also qualifying for the NIT for the first time in six years. The team ranked seventh in the country in points per game with a school-best 80.3, while leading the Western Athletic Conference in scoring with 22.3 points per game. UTEP also finished seventh in field goal percentage (.492), 14th in free throw percentage (.753) and 17th in scoring offense. At the end of the year, he was named the WAC Coach of the Year by the Sporting News and Houston Chronicle. However, in 2002, UTEP struggled, finishing 10–22. Despite receiving a contract extension through 2007, on October 21, he announced his resignation due to \\"personal reasons\\". In 2004, Rabedeaux was hired by Tom Crean as a coach at Marquette. In 2007, he became the school's Director of Basketball Operations. In 2008, he joined the Jiangsu Dragons of the Chinese Basketball Association, coaching until 2010, when he was suspended for a year after being involved in a bench-clearing brawl during a playoff game. He later became head coach of the Japan Basketball League's Link Tochigi Brex. However, the team, who had been the league's defending champions, went 8–12, and Rabedeaux was fired in December 2010. In 2011, he was hired by the Al-Manama of the Bahrain Premier League, winning the Bahrain Cup and Bahrain Super Cup, though much of his players left the team to join the army due to an uprising. In late 2011, Rabedeaux was hired by the Saigon Heat of the ASEAN Basketball League as an assistant coach under Robert Newson. After seven consecutive losses, Newson was demoted, and on February 23, Rabedeaux was promoted to head coach. During his tenure with the Heat, he coached in China to earn more money. His final game with the Heat was a 72–61 win over the Indonesia Warriors. ==Personal life and death== Rabedeaux and his ex-wife Stephanie had two sons, Beau and Cole, and a daughter, Riley. Beginning during the final year of his coaching career at UTEP, Rabedeaux struggled with alcoholism; former assistant Bobby Champagne recalled Rabedeaux missing a flight to meet with a recruit because he was drunk at a nearby bar. After his divorce, Rabedeaux began gaining a significant amount of weight, reaching as high as . In Vietnam, Rabedeaux met Hong-Nhung Nguyen, nicknamed Eva by foreigners, and the two began a relationship, with plans to marry and return to the United States. After Rabedeaux returned from a trip to Wisconsin, his behavior, which included becoming increasingly hostile and smelling of alcohol, attracted the attention of Heat owner Connor Nguyen, who warned him that should he cause another incident, he would be fired. Nguyen had hired Tony Garbelotto as an assistant and potential interim coach. During games, he appeared to be unstable and dizzy; during his final game against the Warriors, he attempted to draw a play, but was unable to, and Garbelotto had to explain the play. The day after the game, Rabedeaux was found by Eva in the kitchen with cuts on his arms and head, and died while in a local taxicab. His death certificate listed the reason of death as a traumatic brain injury. Toxicology reports revealed that Rabedeaux had been sober at the time of his death. Rabedeaux's funeral was held at the Congregational United Church of Christ in Eau Claire, with Sampson delivering the eulogy. ==Head coaching record== -  left;\\"Link Tochigi Brex  left;\\"2010  20812 center;\\"Fired---  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"- - ==References== Category:1965 births Category:2014 deaths Category:American expatriate basketball people in China Category:American expatriate basketball people in Vietnam Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:ASEAN Basketball League coaches Category:Basketball coaches from Wisconsin Category:Basketball players from Wisconsin Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball coaches Category:Sportspeople from Aurora, Illinois Category:Sportspeople from Eau Claire, Wisconsin Category:University of California, Davis alumni Category:UTEP Miners men's basketball coaches Category:Utsunomiya Brex coaches Category:Washington State Cougars men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Jason Rabedeaux"},{"id":"46365551","text":"Toronto Tool Library (TTL) is a tool library system based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Construction commenced in late 2016, with Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) Sandy launching from the dive structure at the site of the station in October 2017. As part of the project, Dundas Road was closed and realigned between Maida Vale Road and Imperial Street in Forrestfield, in order for the retaining wall for the station to be constructed. Prior to the realignment, the road bisected the construction site which resulted in safety and congestion issues. The new section of Dundas Road opened in August 2018. In September 2018, a leak in a passage between two tunnels caused a sinkhole to develop about north of the station site, forcing the closure of Dundas Road. The leak also resulted in movement within 16 concrete rings and damage to a section of one tunnel, delaying the completion of the project from the end of 2020 to the second half of 2021. Dundas Road was reopened in late December after ground stabilisation works. The station passed the 50 per cent completion landmark in September 2019, with the installation of structures such as the twin escalators, and the 36 concrete walls which make up the platform. Much of the content was locally built, such as the steel beams and columns used to support the roof. A major milestone was achieved in November 2019, with the first delivery of rail arriving at the station site. More than of rail had been unloaded since the end of the month, with welding and installation commencing in the first half of 2020. ==Design== High Wycombe railway station will be located in a cutting with an at-grade entrance, for reasons such as security and convenience to the public. Access to the platform will be via SmartRider fare gates, with escalators, lifts, and stairs taking passengers down to meet the train. The distinctive steel roof will serve as an clearly identifiable entry point, with its matte finish reducing glare to pilots flying overhead. Cyclists will be able to access the station safely with pathways that minimise interaction with vehicles. Bicycles can be stored within 180 weather protected, secure bicycle parking bays constructed near the station entrance. Bus interchange A major bus interchange, consisting of 8 active bays and 4 layover bays will be located directly at the station entry, so that passengers can transfer between train and bus services without the need to cross any roads. It is estimated that the current 70-minute journey from Kalamunda to Perth central business district will be halved to just over 30 minutes with the planned feeder bus service. Parking Due to the large catchment size of the station, a multi-deck car park accommodating 1200 cars will be built to satisfy demand for parking. The three-level car park will be situated between Maida Vale Road and Ibis Place. Initial plans called for an at-grade car park, however, the current design was preferred as it allows for passengers to park within of the station entrance. 80 drop off bays will also be built close to the station entrance. Construction will commence in 2020. ==Services and platforms== High Wycombe will be served by Transperth services operating to and from Perth. ==References * Forrestfield–Airport Link website page for Forrestfield railway station Category:Midland railway line Category:Proposed railway stations in Perth, Western Australia Category:Airport railway line, Perth ","title":"High Wycombe railway station, Perth"},{"id":"46365681","text":"The Craven Park Studios were a British film studio that operated between 1918 and 1926.

In 1858 his father, George Hunt Snr. (1806 – 22 August 1874), took up land (section 1197, Hundred of Onkaparinga) 3 km south-east of Norton Summit, which he subdivided to become the town of Ashton. Around 1866 George started working in the drapery business in Adelaide, and around 1870 started his own shop, later entering into partnership with Samuel Corry (ca.1808 – 27 October 1896) as Hunt, Corry, & Co., with four large shops on Rundle Street opposite the Adelaide Arcade. George carried on business for two years after Corry's death, then retired. His business encompassed branches in Northam, Albany, Esperance Bay, and Perth. George Hunt purchased a substantial block of land on Magill Road, previously owned by George Morphett, where in 1898 he built the mansion \\"Tranmere House\\", surrounded by a magnificent garden.

Bruck has represented several high-profile defendants. ==Early life and education== Bruck was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to an affluent family. Bruck is one of three children of Gerald, a retired textile executive, and Nina, a photographer. While an undergraduate at Harvard College, Bruck became involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement. Bruck was a contributor to The Harvard Crimson. In one piece, he called on students to refuse to take their finals in protest of Harvard University. Bruck earned a Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1971. After college, Bruck attended University of South Carolina School of Law. He went to law school at the University of South Carolina so that he could advise reluctant inductees at the Army's Fort Jackson. During law school, Bruck worked as a welder to pay for his schooling because he didn't want to be beholden to his family. While at the University of South Carolina, he met his friend and colleague Judy Clarke. He earned his J.D. degree cum laude in 1975. Before beginning his law practice, he travelled throughout the United States and Canada. ==Legal career== Bruck eventually returned to South Carolina to represent clients facing the death penalty because he did not believe these defendants were receiving adequate representation. Bruck was also disturbed that the death row population consisted mostly of poor black men. One fellow law school classmates said of Bruck: \\"He wanted to assist people who were defenseless. Many of us felt that way in school, but David was one of the few who devoted his career to it.\\" From 1976-1980, Bruck worked as a public defender in South Carolina. From 1980-1988, Bruck worked in private practice. From 1989-92, Bruck was the Chief Attorney of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense. From 1992-2004, Bruck returned to private practice. Since 1992, Bruck served as Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel to the federal defender program. Bruck represented Zayd Hassan Abd al-Latif Masud al-Safarini who received a life sentence for his role in the 1986 hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Pakistan in which 22 people were killed. David Bruck handled as many death penalty cases as he could in South Carolina. Bruck represented dozens of people charged with capital murder before juries or on post-conviction. Before his representation of Susan Smith in 1995, Bruck had only lost three to death sentences. Bruck saved many of his clients by winning new trials that resulted in life sentences and in one case, an acquittal. Bruck has argued several cases before the United States Supreme Court, prevailing in six of them: Kelly v. South Carolina (2002), Shafer v. South Carolina (2001), Ramdass v. Angelone (2000), Simmons v. South Carolina (1994), Yates v. Evatt (1991), Yates v. Aiken (1988), Skipper v. South Carolina (1986). Susan Smith In 1995, Bruck and Judy Clarke served as co-counsel for Susan Smith, the South Carolina woman who faced the death penalty in South Carolina Circuit Court for killing her two sons. Bruck became friends with Clarke during law school, and recruited her for the case. In their opening statement, Clarke argued Smith was deeply troubled and suffered from severe depression. Clarke told the jury: \\"This is not a case about evil. This is a case about despair and sadness.\\" The defense's theory of the case was that Smith drove to the edge of the lake to kill herself and her two sons, but her body willed itself out of the car. The prosecution, on the other hand, believed Smith murdered her children in order to start a new life with a former lover. It only took the jury two and a half hours to convict her of murdering her two sons. During the penalty phase, Tommy Pope, the lead prosecutor in the Smith case, argued passionately in favor of sentencing Smith to death. But the jury ultimately voted against imposing the death penalty. Law professor In 2002, he began teaching at Washington & Lee University School of Law. Since 2004, he has been a clinical professor of law and director of the Virginia Capital Case Clearinghouse. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev In 2014, Bruck was appointed to the defense team working with Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Clarke described Bruck as \\"one of the most experienced and well-regarded capital defense attorneys in the United States.\\" A federal jury convicted Tsarnaev of all 30 charges against him and found him responsible for the deaths of the three people killed in the 2013 attack and the killing of an MIT police officer three days later. The same jury sentenced Tsarnaev to death. On July 31, 2020, the First Circuit overturned the death sentence and ordered a retrial for the penalty phase of Tsarnaev's trial. Dylann Roof Dylann Roof, the killer of nine people in the Charleston church shooting, represented himself in federal court, with Bruck as stand-by counsel. Roof was convicted by jury on all 33 counts on December 15, 2016. On January 10th, 2017, after three hours of jury deliberation Dylann Roof was sentenced to death. ==Views== Bruck opposes capital punishment. He said of the practice: \\"I find the cold- bloodedness of the whole ritual appalling. To take somebody...and so premeditatedly set about exterminating them.\\" ==Awards== * Significant Contributions to Criminal Justice Award from the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice (2001). * John Minor Wisdom Public Service & Professionalism Award from the American Bar Association (1996). ==Scholarly articles== * Death Watch: Change, Redemption Do Exist, The Champion, June 27, 2003. * A Rarefied Kind of Dread, 5 J.

Taghert is an American chronobiologist known for pioneering research on the roles and regulation of neuropeptide signaling in the brain using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. He is a professor of neuroscience in the Department of Neuroscience in the School of Medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. == Background == Taghert was born on January 13, 1953 in Alexandria, Egypt and grew up in Montclair, New Jersey. He attended Reed College from 1971 to 1975 and went on to pursue a PhD in zoology at the University of Washington in Seattle with Jim Truman. He performed post- doctoral studies with Corey Goodman at Stanford University from 1981 to 1984. As of 2016, he is a professor of neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis. == Research contributions ==  Studies of PDF/PDFR in Drosophila melanogaster  Taghert and colleagues have identified the ~150 circadian clock neurons in the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain. Two distinct regions, the small and large ventral lateral neurons (LNv), express the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF) and contribute to circadian locomotor activity rhythms. Taghert's group has made several contributions including the identification of mutants for the PDF neuropeptide gene - this revealed a specific behavioral syndrome indicating important contributions by this neuropeptide to normal circadian control of locomotor activity. This was the first genetic study identifying secreted substances (and not just clock elements) as critical proteins for circadian neurophysiology. This led the way to many studies by many laboratories that now evaluate how neuronal properties interweave and interact with cell intrinsic clock properties. Taghert's work involves employing the GAL4 activation and GAL80 inhibition of PDF to study PDF's necessity as a circadian pacemaker. Experiments with the LNvs found that ablation of PDF via GAL80 inhibition only affected some aspects of behavioral rhythms, suggesting the presence of other regulators controlling circadian behavior. To further examine the peptidergic pathways regulating PDF, Taghert and his group discovered the PDF receptor (PDFR), a class B1 G protein coupled receptor. Null mutations of PDFR suggests that it is also required for circadian rhythms in Drosophila' melanogaster.  Studies of PER and CRY in Drosophila melanogaster  The Taghert group also demonstrated that PDF signaling influences pacemaker cell synchronicity through PER regulation, identified the PDF receptor, and identified critical PDF receptor signaling components. They have shown that PDF receptor signals differently in different pacemaker groups, and that PDF receptor signaling interact with signals from Cryptochrome (CRY) to help sustain clock rhythmicity.  Studies of DIMM in Drosophila melanogaster  Taghert's work on DIMM addresses the genetic programs underlying neuron diversification. Through a developmental studies approach, his work explores how peptidergic neurons in Drosophila use transcriptional control mechanisms to acquire properties like the selection of a unique neuropeptide phenotype. The bHLH protein DIMM is an example of a transcriptional control mechanism that operates in neurosecretory neurons and is responsible for the cells’ ability to accumulate, process, and package large amounts of secretory peptides. DIMM confers a specific peptidergic phenotype to neurons, referred to as LEAP cells (Large cells that Episodically release Amidated Peptides). To map DIMM expression in Drosophila peptidergic systems, a large panel of peptide antibodies and gene reporters were used. It was found that there is a substantial correlation of DIMM expression with peptidergic phenotypes. At a molecular level, DIMM concerns secretory peptides that are amidated, and at a cellular level, DIMM concerns peptidergic neurons which are neurosecretory. Current research involves molecular pathways by which DIMM levels are induced in response to environmental challenges. ==Notable publications== * * == References  External links == * Washington University in St. Louis Faculty Bio * Hope Center at WUSTL Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:American microbiologists Category:Chronobiologists Category:Reed College alumni Category:University of Washington College of Arts and Sciences alumni ","title":"Paul H.

It first flew in 1923. ==Design and development== The C.91 was a conventional single engine two bay biplane with a wooden structure and fabric covering. The bays were defined by pairs of parallel interplane struts; similar but shorter pairs of cabane struts ran from the upper fuselage to the upper wing centre section. In plan its wings were rectangular, with ailerons only on the upper wing. For its first flights, made in late 1923, the C.91 was powered by a Renault 12F water-cooled upright V-12 engine with a rectangular radiator in the extreme nose behind the propeller, enclosed in a flat sided, slotted cowling. The rest of the fuselage was also flat sided. The pilot had an open cockpit under the wing and behind him the four passengers sat in an enclosed cabin with four windows. Passenger comfort was a priority and up to of baggage could be placed in the hold. At the rear the fin was triangular and broad, carrying a balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. Tailplane and elevators were mounted on top of the fuselage. The C.91 had a tailwheel undercarriage with its mainwheels on a single axle longer than the fuselage width, sprung to a pair of V-struts to the lower fuselage longerons. Rather little is known about the C.91's activities but it did compete in the 1925 Coupe d'Aviation Zenith (Zenith Aviation Cup), awarded for fuel-economical load carrying. It was held in early July 1925, by which time the Renault engine had been replaced with a more powerful Lorraine 12D water-cooled V-12. Bad weather kept most of the competitors, including Bechelet's C.91, grounded and the event was rerun in 1926. ==SpecificationsReferences== C.091 Category:1920s French airliners Category:Biplanes ","title":"Caudron C.91"},{"id":"46365747","text":"Trust the Navy is a 1935 British comedy film directed by Lupino Lane and starring Lane, Nancy Burne and Wallace Lupino.http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv- people/4ce2b6b9179b4 It was made at Cricklewood Studios.Low p.4014 It marked the screen debut of Guy Middleton, who went on to be a leading character actor in British films of the following decades. ==Cast== * Lupino Lane as Nip Briggs * Nancy Burne as Susie * Wallace Lupino as Wally Wopping * Guy Middleton as Lieutenant Richmond * Miki Hood as Andree Terraine * Ben Welden as Scar * Fred Leslie as Chief Petty Officer * Doris Rogers as Martha * Reginald Long as Serge Chungster * Arthur Rigby as Lambert Terrain * Charles Sewell * Arthur Stanley ==ReferencesBibliography== *Chibnall, Steve.

The programme operated in a similar format to Spitting Image, in the use of puppets and comedic impersonators for a variety of well known celebrities of different fields (e.g. politics, entertainment), and basing sketches on current events at the time of each episode's broadcast. However, it differs in that each puppet features no moveable eyes or mouths, as these were applied with the use of CGI during editing. Newzoids featured the voice talents of Jon Culshaw, Debra Stephenson and Lewis MacLeod, all from BBC Radio 4 comedy Dead Ringers, and featured iconic satirical appearances for several noted British celebrities, including Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, and Prince George of Cambridge. ==Characters== All celebrities featured in the show are portrayed through the mixed use of live-action puppets and CGI effects; the puppets are filmed first, with the footage later enhanced with CGI eyes, eyebrows, and mouths. Those depicted are caricatured. One eye of former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage's puppet occasionally swivels around, while US President Donald Trump's hair is represented as a cat on his head, whilst Prince George of Cambridge is depicted with a strong Cockney accent and bosses about his younger sister Princess Charlotte of Cambridge. His catchphrase is \\"oi oi saveloy\\", which loosely references a Cockney football chant. Theresa May appears in trailers for a new film called Despicable May, a reference to the animated film Despicable Me, in which David Davis, Philip Hammond and Boris Johnson play her minions. In other sketches, they also uphold these roles, although very rarely. ==Transmissions== {  center;\\" - ! Series !! Start date !! End date !!

The game started out as a Kickstarter campaign in 2013. The goal of Star Realms is to destroy your opponent or opponents by purchasing cards using \\"trade\\" points and using these cards to attack your opponent's \\"authority\\" using your \\"combat\\" points. The game takes place in a distant future where different races compete to gain resources, trade and outmaneuver each other in a race to become ruler of the galaxy. Star Realms is similar to other deck building games, like Ascension and Dominion. The game is marketed as portable and expandable, as it comes in a small box and contains only cards and no dice or markers. In 2016, White Wizard Games published a fantasy version of this game Hero Realms. ==Cards== The original game (core set) consists of the following: * One 80 card Trade Deck (20 each of 4 different factions, described below) * Two 10 card Personal Decks, consisting of two Vipers and eight Scouts each * 10 Explorer cards * 18 double-sided Authority cards for keeping score * Two Rules Sheets The cards in the core set are divided over four different factions, each with different benefits or strengths. 20 total cards from each faction appear in Trade Deck, though there are only 11 or 12 different cards in each faction because some cards have more than 1 copy. There are also Unaligned ships, consisting of the Viper and Scout cards from the starting Personal Decks and the Explorer cards. * The Trade Federation, focused on trade and growth. Specializes in generating Trade, and they are the only faction able to generate authority. 7 ships and 5 bases. * The Blobs, mysterious alien creatures. Specializes in generating absolutely obscene amounts of Combat and removing undesirable cards from the trade row. 8 ships and 3 bases. * The Star Empire, former colonies of the Trade Federation. Specializes in Combat and drawing new cards and to force opponent to discard cards. 6 ships and 5 bases. * The Machine Cult, a cult of technology focused on robotics and computerization. Specializes in removing undesirable cards and defending from opponent's attacks. 7 ships and 5 bases. All cards have a trade cost, which is used to determine how many trade points the player needs to buy the card. Cards have either a trade value or a combat value or Authority value or a combination, giving the player a boost for purchasing cards, attacking opponents or adding authority to their total. Many cards also have a special ability, e.g. letting the player draw more cards to their hand or forcing an opponent to discard cards. Some cards also have the ability to be scrapped, which removes them from the game entirely but also gives the player some kind of benefit. Cards are either ships, which are used and then placed in the discard pile at the end of the turn, or bases which are played and stay in play until they are destroyed by an opponent and then discarded. Bases are either a normal base or an outpost. Bases have a grey shield, and provide some kind of benefit but no protection to the player's authority or other bases. Outposts have black shields and act as protection in addition to any benefits. Outposts must be attacked first, before an opponent can attack the player or other bases. An opponent's combat points must be above or equal to the base's shield value to destroy it and move it to the discard pile. ==Setup and placement== The \\"game board\\" consists only of cards. Each player has their own draw deck to draw new cards from and their own discard pile where they put used cards. In the middle of the table is the \\"trade row\\", which holds the cards available for purchase. The trade row holds five cards at all times, plus a deck of \\"Explorer\\" cards that are always available for purchase. There is also a trade deck which holds unrevealed cards for purchase and a trash heap where players put cards that are removed from the game. Each player starts out with a starting personal deck of ten ship cards and 50 points of \\"authority\\" cards. The starting deck includes eight \\"Scout\\" cards (each generating 1 trade) and two \\"Viper\\" cards (each granting 1 combat), the most basic ships. The authority cards indicate how much health the player has left. ==Gameplay== At the start of the game the player who goes first draws three cards and the player going second draws five cards. If there are three players, the first one has 3 in their starting hand, the second one has 4, and the third one has 5 cards. The player whose turn it is then plays the cards from their hand in front of them, each card possibly giving a boost in trade, attack, authority, and/or granting a special ability. At the end of every turn, the player moves all played ship cards to the discard pile, then draws five cards and the next player starts their turn. Whenever the draw deck is empty and a card needs to be drawn, the player shuffles their discard pile and places it face down to form a new draw deck. New cards acquired by purchasing with trade points are first placed in the discard pile and then enter the game when the pile is reshuffled. When a card is purchased it is replaced in the trade row with a new card from the trade deck. If a card has a scrap symbol (a trash can) it can be scrapped and permanently removed from the game. Other cards also enable cards to be scrapped without activating a scrap ability. In this way, each player builds up their own deck of cards by adding cards from the trade row and removing cards by scrapping. Each drawn hand will give different opportunities for gaining trade points or attacking the opponents with combat points. ==Winning the game== In order to win the players need to attack their opponents' authority using combat. If a player's authority is reduced to zero they are out of the game. ==Expansions== White Wizard Games have released many expansion packs plus two standalone expansions for Star Realms. Some expansions/promo cards were only available to backers of the Kickstarter campaign while other expansions are available to the public. There are some differences between the online Gambit expansion and the collectible cards. Standalone Expansions * Star Realms: Colony Wars (2015) - Includes new 80 card trade deck plus two 10 card starter decks for the players.

There are 2 gameplay differences between the games: # The digital version has an unlimited number of purchasable Explorers while the physical card game only has 10 Explorer cards. Although the Explorers were always intended to be unlimited for most games, the 10 provided can replicate an unlimited stack by either reusing scrapped Explorer cards, or in a game where players have run out of Explorers the players can use a proxy or decide that players can't buy any more until somebody scraps one. # Cards with ally abilities that include draw effects trigger immediately upon another card of the same faction entering play, rather than at the discretion of the player. The digital game allows the player to play against other players online or play scenarios of varying difficulty against an AI. ==Awards== Star Realms has won many notable table top gaming awards, including: 2014 Golden Geek Awards (as voted by the members of BoardGameGeek.com) * Best 2-Player Game * Best Card Game * Best Indie Game * Best Mobile / Handheld Game 2014 Dice Tower Gaming Awards * Best Small Publisher (White Wizard Games for Star Realms) * Best Two-Player Game 2014 Origins Awardshttp://icv2.com/articles/news/view/31740/2015-origins-award-winners * Fan Favorite Card Game 2015 SXSW's Table Top Game of the Year ==References External links == * The publisher's official Star Realms website * The Kickstarter campaign * Star Realms on BoardGameGeek Category:Card games introduced in 2014 Category:Deck-building card games Category:Origins Award winners Category:Science fiction board games ","title":"Star Realms"},{"id":"46365907","text":"The Unwritten Law is a 1929 British short crime film directed by Sinclair Hill, and made at Wembley Studios in the De Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film system.Low p.472 ==Cast== * Rosalinde Fuller as The Wife * Ian Swinley as The Sweetheart * Robert Bruce as Policeman * Edwin M.

He has had a prolific career, working in television and film in both French and English productions. ==Biography== Bonnière was born in Lyon, France. He first began his film career in France as a director for the French army, working alongside Henri Colpi and composer Georges Delerue. He then worked as an assistant to filmmaking pioneer Marcel L'Herbier. He emigrated from France in May 1955, arriving in New York City with his wife, Claude, via the SS Flandre.Passenger and Crew Lists of Vessels Arriving at New York, NY, 1897-1957 Bonnière spent six months working at a bank on Wall Street before looking north for a return to the film industry. He contacted filmmaker F. R. Crawley and the National Film Board of Canada (NFB); Crawley met him in New York and invited him to move to Canada. From 1956 to 1971, Bonnière worked for Crawley Films, directing dozens of films. His first works were Beaver Dam (short), Maitres artisans du Canada and The Legend of the Raven. He also collaborated with Pierre Perrault, considered one of Canada's finest filmmakers. In 1963, he directed Amanita Pestilens, the first Canadian film in colour and the first to be shot simultaneously in English and French. In a profile on Bonnière, Cinémathèque québécoise notes that his work for Crawley helped bridge the gap between Canada's French and English-language films. He also worked for the NFB, producing several documentaries, many about Canada's indigenous communities.

This represented 13.7% of the adult population. The three most- prevalent forms of disability in Canada are chronic pain issues, mobility, and flexibility limitations. Around 11% of Canadian adults experience one of these disability types, and 40% of those people have had all three at the same time. Disabled people in Canada have historically experienced many forms of discrimination and abuse, such as segregation, institutionalization, and compulsory sterilization. They were not given the same rights as non-disabled people until the end of the 1970s, when the Coalition of Provincial Organizations of the Handicapped (now Council for Canadians with Disabilities) initiated significant changes. Legislation intended to protect disabled Canadians include the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, and the Employment Equity Act. ==Legislation== Currently-existing federal legislation which protects the rights of Canadians with disabilities most prominently includes the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, and the Employment Equity Act. Discrimination against persons with disabilities is prohibited by the Canadian Human Rights Act, which was enacted in 1985. In addition, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, enacted in 1982, guarantees that persons with disabilities are protected by and will receive the same benefits under the law as any other Canadian. The Employment Equity Act aims to ensure that particular groups, including persons with disabilities, enjoy the same employment opportunities and benefits as anyone else. ==History== Largely having to do with the widespread trust of medical authority and the growth of industrialization, Canadian society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the segregation of persons with disabilities. Public institutions, such as psychiatric hospitals, houses for the blind, houses of refuge, and church-run homes, confined and isolated persons with disabilities from the rest of society. Persons with disabilities were seen as being a burden on the rest of society and denied the full exercise of their rights. War wounded After World War I, many veterans returned to Canada with disabilities due to war injuries and had difficulty re-integrating into society. The needs of these veterans gave rise to disability advocacy organizations such as the War Amps, which fought for the need for services like rehabilitation, training in sheltered workshops, and other employment-related services. A disparity formed between the status of veterans with disabilities and that of civilians with disabilities, which would continue to widen until after World War II. In the mid-20th century, civilians with disabilities and their allies advocated for the rights of all persons with disabilities to participate fully in society. The deinstitutionalization of persons with disabilities was among their primary causes. Compulsory sterilization From the end of the 1920s and into the 1970s, provincial legislation in Alberta and British Columbia allowed for persons with mental health disabilities who had been institutionalized to be sterilized for the purpose of preventing them from having children who would inherit the same disabilities. While legislation in British Columbia required the consent of the person in question, their spouse, or a guardian, a 1937 amendment to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta meant that, in certain circumstances, this procedure could be completed without the consent or even the knowledge of the person being sterilized. In Alberta, this legislation was repealed in 1972 under the Progressive Conservative government of Peter Lougheed. David King, the MLA who had tabled the bill for the repeal of the Act, stated that he saw the legislation as being in violation of human rights. In British Columbia, legislation permitting sexual sterilization was repealed in 1973, and the E (Mrs) v Eve Supreme Court decision in 1986 affirmed that, in Canada, it is not legal to sexually sterilize someone without their consent outside of emergency situations. Deinstitutionalization During the 1950s and 1960s, the process continued for the deinstitutionalization of persons with disabilities. Not-for-profit organizations such as the Canadian Association for Community Living (formed in 1958, then called the Canadian Association for Retarded Children) opened group homes for persons with disabilities and advocated that money saved by closing government institutions could be used for the expansion of community services. Disability rights organizations The end of the 1970s marked the establishment of the Coalition of Provincial Organizations of the Handicapped (now the Council for Canadians with Disabilities [CCD]), a prominent advocacy group. This organization stood out from others in that it was composed mainly of persons with disabilities themselves, rather than allies or professionals. In 1981 the United Nations International Year for Disabled Persons drew attention to and triggered an increase in Canadians' awareness of disability issues. The following year the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was amended to include disability as a basis for discrimination, a cause strongly advocated by stakeholder groups such as the CCD. Canada's Human Rights Act came into effect in 1985, and the Employment Equity Act in 1986. As a result of the economic recession, the early 1990s marked a difficult time for persons with disabilities: less funding was available for social assistance and government subsidies were scarce and more difficult to obtain. Developments on disability issues continued to be made at a federal level. In 1991, under the Mulroney government, a five-year strategic action plan was announced for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities. In 1996 Prime Minister Jean Chrétien appointed a Federal Task Force on Disability Issues. The federal government Office for Disability Issues, the Government of Canada's focal point on matters with relation to disability, was founded in 2001. The 1990s marked the emergence of an academic discourse aimed at determining the place of disability in Canadian society.... Twenty-first century developments in disability issues include a 2012 Supreme Court decision which established that persons with mental-health disabilities can provide reliable court testimony, and Canada's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in March 2010. In signing the convention, Canada committed to attempting to improve the social and economic condition of Canadians with disabilities, and in 2014 it submitted a report to the UN detailing its progress. ==Demographics== According to the 2012 Canadian Survey on Disability by Statistics Canada, about 3.8 million or 13.7% of Canadians aged 15 to 64 were regarded as disabled. There is a correlation between disability and age, from 4.4% of those aged 15 24 to 42.5% among those 75 and older. ==Education== Only 20.2% of Canadians with disabilities have a university degree compared to 40.7% of their non-disabled compatriots. ==Income inequality and employment== Disabled men aged 15-to-64 earn $9,557 less than non-disabled men of the same age. In the case of disabled women in the same age-group the income difference is $8,853. In 2006 the unemployment rate among disabled Canadians was 8.6%, compared to the national average of 6.3%. ==Social inclusion== According to a 2004 survey, 10% of Canadians believe disabled people are fully included in Canadian social life. About 1.4 million disabled adults required assistance with activities of daily living in 2006. ==See also== * Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 * The Accessibility for Manitobans Act * Accessible Canada Act ==References== ","title":"Disability in Canada"},{"id":"46365998","text":"Cloud 9 Adventures is a provider of reservations, travel services, marketing, consulting, and brand management for destination music events.

All 39 seats in the Parliament were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in 12 other autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. Both the People's Party (PP) and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) lost 1 seat each to the Regionalist Party of Cantabria (PRC), which won 8 seats. As neither had won an absolute majority, the PRC reinforced its position as parliamentary kingmaker, able to give the government to either of the two parties. The PRC, in a coalition with the PP since 1995, announced that it was not renewing the pact a third time due to \\"deteriorating relations\\" between both parties after 8 years of government, and that it would instead seek an alliance with the PSOE. As a result of the election, PSOE and PRC reached a coalition agreement in which Miguel Ángel Revilla from the PRC was to be elected as regional President. ==Overview== Electoral system The Parliament of Cantabria was the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Cantabria, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Cantabrian Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a President of the Autonomous Community. Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in Cantabria and in full enjoyment of their political rights. The 39 members of the Parliament of Cantabria were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 5 percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. The electoral law provided that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electors registered in Cantabria. Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called. Election date The term of the Parliament of Cantabria expired four years after the date of its previous election. Elections to the Parliament were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 13 June 1999, setting the election date for the Parliament on Sunday, 25 May 2003. The President of the Autonomous Community had the prerogative to dissolve the Parliament of Cantabria and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no nationwide election was due and some time requirements were met: namely, that dissolution did not occur either during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year has elapsed since a previous dissolution. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Parliament was to be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called. Any snap election held as a result of these circumstances would not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remained of their four-year terms. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication.

Robert Brattain (May 21, 1911 – November 17, 2002) was an American physicist at Shell Development Company. He was involved in a number of secret projects during World War II. He is recognized as one of America’s leading infrared spectroscopists for his work in designing several models of spectrophotometer, and for using the infrared spectrophotometer to determine the β-lactam structure of penicillin. His instrumentation work was essential to the subsequent study and understanding of structures in organic chemistry. == Biography == R. Robert Brattain was born May 21, 1911, to Ross R. Brattain and Ottilie Houser Brattain. Both parents were graduates of Whitman College; Ottilie Houser Brattain was a gifted mathematician. During much of Robert Brattain's childhood, the family lived on a cattle ranch near Tonasket, Washington. Brattain attended Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, following his older brother, Walter Houser Brattain. He then completed a master's degree in physics at the University of Washington in 1933. He went on to attend Princeton University, studying physics. There he met John Bardeen, a frequent bridge and bowling partner. Robert Brattain introduced John Barden to his brother, Walter Brattain, with whom Bardeen would win a Nobel Prize. Initially interested in mathematical physics, Robert Brattain soon became interested in experimental physics. After his advisor Edward Condon suggested that he assist R. Bowling Barnes, an expert in infrared spectrometry, Brattain became fascinated with infrared research and instrument design. Brattain, Barnes, and others in the laboratory built a research-quality infrared spectrophotometer, using a rock salt prism, a strip of platinum as an infrared radiation source, a thermopile to measure radiation, and two galvanometers to display results. They used the instrument to begin studying the molecular structure of organic molecules. After Barnes left Princeton for American Cyanamid, he directed funding to Brattain and others to study the infrared absorption spectra of organic compounds such as benzene, toluene, and naphthalene. == Shell Development Company == Due to financial pressures of the Great Depression, Robert Brattain left Princeton in 1938 without completing his degree. He was hired by Otto Beeck and joined Shell Development Company in Emeryville, California. There he began to use infrared spectroscopy to study the molecular structures of petroleum and related products. He was recognized as an early leader in the area. Brattain's work on gas mixtures was \\"one of the first applications [of spectrophotometry] of major importance to the petroleum industry\\".  Aviation fuels One of the areas Brattain studied was isomers of butane, which were used to make high-octane aviation fuel. His goal was to use infrared spectrometry as an analytical tool for industrial chemical process control, reliably measuring the isomers in petroleum mixtures. Brattain again began to build a research-quality infrared spectrophotometer, this time incorporating the ideas of E. Bright Wilson and Harold Gershinowitz at Harvard University. By incorporating two prisms, one of rock salt and one of potassium bromide, it was possible to examine a greater range of infrared wavelengths. By 1939 Brattain was able to use his \\"IRS #1\\" to distinguish between the isomers isobutane and n-butane by measuring a single wavelength of infrared radiation. While continuing to study butanes with the IRS #1, Brattain designed a simpler model, the “IRS #2,” for use in process control in Shell’s refineries. He presented his designs for the IRS #1 (research) and the IRS #2 (process control) to the American Physical Society in Pasadena, California in June 1941. After further development, Brattain proposed a new design for the IRS #4, and approached Arnold Orville Beckman at National Technical Laboratories (later Beckman Instruments) to make it. By partnering with John U. White of Standard Oil, Brattain was able to put together an order of 10 instruments - enough to convince Beckman to go into production. Beckman's chief engineer Howard Cary suggested a simplification to the design, which was approved by Brattain as the Beckman IR-1. The IR-1 used a Littrow prism mounting featuring a single rock salt prism with a mirrored back, and an analog galvanometer for presenting results. Users could quickly select between 18 specified wavelengths. Beckman Instruments shipped the first 1R-1 spectrophotometer to Shell on September 18, 1942. Synthetic rubber Brattain's examination of isomers proved doubly important to the war effort. In addition to the C4 hydrocarbon isomers isobutane and n-butane (important in aviation fuels) Brattain was able to identify a set of four butenes, 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, and isobutene. The butylene isomers were critical for the development of synthetic rubber, another essential material for the war effort. Compared to previous distillation methods, infrared spectrophotometry offered a tremendous time savings, reducing testing time from as much as 15 or 20 hours down to 15 minutes. During World War II, North America was faced with a shortage of natural rubber, because the war cut off supplies from rubber-growing countries. The Office of Rubber Reserve of the United States government recognized a need to develop synthetic rubber. Brattain's former professor R. Bowling Barnes, now at Cyanamid, promoted the use of infrared spectrophotometers in the US synthetic rubber program. In 1942 the Office of Rubber Reserve arranged secret meetings in Detroit between Robert Brattain of the Shell Development Company, Arnold O. Beckman of Beckman Instruments, and R. Bowling Barnes of American Cyanamid, seeking a source of reliable instruments for infrared spectroscopy and the analysis of butadiene polymers. Choosing to adopt Bob Brattain's existing design for a single-beam infrared spectrophotometer, they commissioned Beckman Instruments to mass- produce standardized instruments for scientists to use as part of the U.S. government's synthetic-rubber war effort. Production of the instruments was given a AAA priority rating, which ensured that they had access to limited war-time resources. However, the instruments could only be sold to AAA- certified customers, and the research, the instrument design, and the instruments were kept classified until after the war. No one was allowed to publish or discuss anything related to the new machines. With orders from both government and industry, National Technical Laboratories produced and shipped 77 Beckman IR-1s by 1945. They were a critical contribution to the war effort. This government-supported collaboration led to quick development and rapid transmission of the technology within a network of war-time companies, but the secrecy restrictions limited the extent to which the Brattain-Beckman work became publicly known. Companies such as Perkin-Elmer whose work was not as restricted, were able to publish about their work in infrared spectroscopy before Brattain and Beckman could do so. After the war, such instruments were adopted widely by chemists because they were simple to use, reliable, and reasonably priced. Penicillin Penicillin, a powerful antibiotic, was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Sir Alexander Fleming. During World War II, the drug was in demand to treat both wounds and life-threatening illnesses such as meningitis, pneumonia and syphilis. Production of penicillin increased from 400 million units in early 1943 to more than 650 billion units per month by the end of the war. There was tremendous pressure to find ways to increase production. Researchers hoped that by understanding the chemical structure of penicillin they could a way to synthesize it. Several possible structures were hypothesized, including an oxazalone structure with 2 linked 5-member rings, and a β-lactam structure involving a 4-member ring, something that had not been observed naturally. A transatlantic research project was developed to determine the structure of penicillin. It included infrared spectroscopy researchers at Cambridge (G.B.B.M. Sutherland), at Oxford (Harold Warris Thompson), and universities and companies in the United States (the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan, Shell Development Company, Merck & Co., Pfizer, and the Russell Sage Institute of Cornell University Medical College). The US Office of Scientific Research and Development approached Shell during the summer of 1944, and Robert Brattain assembled a team to study the problem using infrared spectrophotometry. Another team at Shell used chemical synthesis techniques. By November 1944 both teams agreed that penicillin had a β-lactam structure. Only that structure explained the presence of strong bands at frequencies of 1785, 1740, 1667 and 1538 cm-1 on the spectroscopy results. Brattain and his co-workers released a report to the government describing their results in 1944. A full report of the international infrared spectroscopy work appeared in 1949. Working independently in Britain, Dorothy Crowfoot and Barbara Low in Oxford, England used x-ray diffraction to study penicillin's structure, as did researchers at Imperial Chemical Industries. At much the same time as Brattain's group, Dorothy Crowfoot's x-ray crystallography group found results supporting the conclusion that penicillin had a β-lactam structure. Her research was reported in early 1945. For this and other research using x-ray diffraction Dorothy Crowfoot would eventually earn a Nobel Prize. Nerve gas After the war, Brattain was asked to carry out hazardous research studying the structure of German nerve gases that had been used in World War II. After retirement, Robert Brattain lived in Monterey, California. ==References Category:1911 births Category:2002 deaths Category:20th-century American physicists Category:Whitman College alumni Category:University of Washington College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:Princeton University alumni Category:People from Tonasket, Washington ","title":"Robert Brattain"},{"id":"46366055","text":"Abraham Aaron Roback (1890–1965) was a Jewish American psychologist and promoter of Yiddish. ==Life== A.

Kay is a British-born chronobiologist who mainly works in the United States. Dr. Kay has pioneered methods to monitor daily gene expression in real time and characterized circadian gene expression in plants, flies and mammals. In 2014, Steve Kay celebrated 25 years of successful chronobiology research at the Kaylab 25 Symposium, joined by over one hundred researchers with whom he had collaborated with or mentored. Dr. Kay, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., briefly served as president of The Scripps Research Institute. and is currently a professor at the University of Southern California. ==Life== Early life and influences Steve A. Kay was raised on the Isle of Jersey off the coast of Normandy. As a young child, he was fascinated by marine creatures exposed during low tide on Jersey island. His interest in biology deepened when an elementary teacher brought a microscope from mainland England into his small classroom. He spent hours looking through the microscope at swimming critters in pond water, amazed by \\"what was in pond water, or what the edges of a torn piece of paper looked like.\\" By his early teens, Steve Kay knew that biology would be his lifelong passion and aimed to get a PhD. Years later, when his mother died of a progressive motor neuron disease in 2006, Steve Kay was motivated to study a mouse mutant he co- discovered that modeled the disease his mother had. Thus, a tribute to his mother has led to the discovery of the gene Listerin, Ltn1, E3 ubiquitin ligase and its effect on motor and sensory neuron degeneration. Education and scientific pursuits In 1981, Steve Kay earned his bachelor's degree in Biochemistry at University of Bristol, UK. He stayed there in the Trevor Griffiths lab and received his PhD in 1985 exploring the light regulation of chlorophyll synthesis in plants. Kay learned that light changed gene expression, and that circadian clock was also regulating transcription on a daily basis. He would later spend more than two decades pursuing these circadian clocks. Following Griffiths' advice, Kay moved to the United States and worked as a postdoc in the Nam-Hai Chua lab at Rockefeller University. It was at the Nam-Hai Chua lab working with another postdoc named Ferenc Nagy that Kay stumbled upon the discovery that the chlorophyll binding gene CAB was regulated by a circadian clock. In 1989, Kay was appointed to his first faculty position as an Assistant Professor at Rockefeller University. While there, he collaborated with Michael W. Young to identify fly PER gene homologues, which did not exist. Kay then developed glowing Arabidopsis thaliana plants to screen for circadian rhythm mutants, with the help of his student Andrew Millar , and subsequently identified TOC1, the first clock gene identified in plants. He moved several times and became an associate professor in the biology department at the University of Virginia in 1996 where he joined the NSF Center for Biological Timing. 4 years later he moved to The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Ca. There, Kay collaborated with Jeffrey C. Hall and discovered a cryptochrome mutant in fruit flies, also demonstrating that clock genes were distributed all over the body, which was named one of Science's top 10 breakthroughs in 1997. Kay also teamed up with Joe Takahashi to identify fly's CLOCK gene and its binding partner dBMAL1 and complete the transcription-translation feedback loop in flies in 1998. In 1999, Kay established his second lab adjacent to Scripps Research Institute at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation to initiate new work on the mammalian clock. He and his postdoctoral fellow John B. Hogenesch, realized that in order to discover novel mammalian clock genes one would have to leverage high throughput genomics techniques that were being developed at the time. In 2002, Kay's group identified the novel photoreceptor melanopsin (Opn4) and how it worked in conjunction with the visual photoreceptors. Kay's work, along with others in the field, on melanopsin was named one of \\"Science's\\" top 10 breakthroughs that year. Kay and Hogenesch also collaborated with Takahashi to define the mammalian circadian transcription and the large scale orchestration of gene expression by the circadian clocks in most tissues throughout the body. In 2001, Kay served as director for the Institute for Childhood and Neglected Diseases at the Scripps Research Institute.Open Source Initiative Contributor. \\"Steve. A. Kay. Ph.D.\\" . Retrieved on 08 April 2015. He also served as professor and chairman there in subsequent years. In addition to his academic experiences, Kay also founded biotechnology companies like Phenomix Corporation in 2003. In 2007, Dr. Kay became professor and then the dean of the biology department at the UC San Diego. From 2012 to 2015, he served as a professor and the Dean of Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the University of Southern California (USC). In September 2015, he was named president of The Scripps Research Institute. In 2016, he was re-appointed to the University of Southern California (USC). ==Scientific contributions to circadian rhythms== Plants In 1985, Kay and his colleagues found that the Cab gene was under circadian control in wheat and transgenic tobacco plants during his postdoctoral research. In 1991, Kay extended this research into a suitable model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana and found that Cab mRNA levels are also under circadian control in Arabidopsis. He then developed Cab2:luc fusion, the fusion of luciferase open reading frame downstream of the Cab2 promoter region, as a marker for monitoring the circadian phenotype. This fusion marker was widely used in later studies and contributed enormously to the understanding of circadian rhythm regulation in Arabidopsis. Based on this Cab:luc fusion technology, Kay set up luciferase imaging assays for large scale forward genetics screening and identified the first short period mutant of TOC1 gene. TOC1 was proved to be a core clock gene in Arabidopsis and was cloned by Kay lab after a long period of time Kay also revealed the biochemical function of TOC1 and found that TOC1 and LHY/CCA1 reciprocally regulate each other, and further studied the mechanism of this regulation. Kay identified ELF3, GI, Lux, CHE and PRRs as core clock genes and studied their role in the circadian regulation loop. He also profiled clock controlled genes (ccg) in Arabidopsis with several technologies and identified key pathways temporally controlled by circadian clock. His work on functional analyses of core clock genes, as well as ccg, successfully connected circadian rhythm with the control of development, like seedling, growth and flowering. His work on these clock genes contributed significantly to the understanding of repression-based clock regulation loops in plants, which is distinct to the ones in animals that are composed of both positive and negative elements. Kay discovered the mechanism of seasonal time and day-length measurement and flowering time determination in Arabidopsis through the GI/FKF1-CO-FT pathway. Kay found evidence that there are multiple phototransduction pathways, and contributed to the discovery and functional analysis of many photoreceptors, including phytochrome, cryptochrome, ZTL and LKP2 and their roles in circadian rhythms. Flies Kay applied the first clock gene fusion, Per:luc, in Drosophila melanogaster which allows monitoring of its rhythm at the single animal level. Per:luc fusion also helped him understand the phase relationship in mRNA and protein oscillation. He further improved the mathematical method of bioluminescence analysis and made the results quantified. In 1997, his Per promoter driven Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) study suggested that Per is widely expressed throughout the fly body in a rhythmic pattern, and all body parts are capable of light perception. This is one of the first pieces of evidence for a peripheral self-sustaining circadian clock. In 1998, he proposed the translational transcriptional feedback loop model of the circadian clock in flies, analogous to other labs that proposed a same model in mammals and fungi. Kay discovered that cryptochrome is the circadian photoreceptor that directly acts with and sequesters TIM in response to light. Kay did one of the pioneering microarray analyses to study clock controlled genes (ccg), and revealed tissue-specific nature of circadian rhythms by analyzing the ccg of heads and bodies separately. Mice Kay began his extensive research on mice in 1999 at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, with a primary focus on melanopsin (Opn4) and visual photoreceptors. It was here, with the use of automation and large-scale genomics technology, that Kay and collaborating colleagues found that the mammalian clock consisted of more than just one feedback loop. In 2002, Kay and his team were able to show the role of melanopsin, a photosensitive photopigment in retinal ganglion cells, in detecting light for the master circadian oscillator located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus of the brain. Both melanopsin and visual photoreceptors, such as rods and cones, were required for entrainment. However, removing each individually did not result in total blindness in mice, as they retained non- visual photoreception. The enzyme luciferase was utilized by Kay's lab to research clock gene expression in single culture cells and revealed that a variety of cells, including those of the liver and fibroblasts, demonstrate circadian rhythm. As time went on, these rhythms became increasingly out of phase as local oscillators desynchronized and each cell expressed their own pace. In 2007, these findings demonstrated the need to examine single-cell phenotypes along with behaviors of experimental clock mutants. In 2009, inspired by his mother's fatal motor neuron disease, Kay and some colleagues performed a study manipulating the ubiquitin ligase protein Listerin in mice which led to the conclusion that mutations in Listerin caused neurodegeneration. Humans Kay's research on intercellular networks has the potential to contribute to drug therapies by identifying compounds that affect the circadian pathways. His findings and analyses of this mammalian oscillator contribute to our medical understanding of how the clock controls downstream processes and holds clinical significance as a variety of diseases and biological processes are involved, such as aging, immune response, and metabolism. For instance, diabetes and the circadian clock may correlate based on the findings of circadian expression in the liver and glucose output. Using a cell-cased circadian phenotypic screen, Kay and a team of chronobiologist researchers identified a small molecule, KL001, that interacts with cryptochrome to prevent ubiquitin-dependent degradation, which results in a longer circadian period. KL001-mediated cryptochrome stabilization (of both CRY1 and CRY2) was found to restrain glucagon-activated gluconeogenesis. These findings bear the potential to aid in the development of circadian-based diabetic therapeutics.

It is the largest and best-preserved castle in that westernmost Croatian county. It overlooks the deep gorge of the Pazinčica Foiba river, a small karst subterranean river that disappears there through sinkhole and continues underground. The fortified structure was constructed of hewn stone, and, during its 11-century-long history, subjected to several major reconstructions and renovations. There are two museums to be visited in Pazin's castle, the Ethnographic Museum of Istria and the Pazin Town Museum. ==History== The Pazin Castle was first mentioned as Castrum Pisinum on 7 June 983 in a document issued by Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor, confirming the possession of the castle to bishop of Poreč. In the 12th century the bishops of Poreč ceded it to Meinhard of Schwarzenburg, owner of Črnigrad Castle (German: Schwarzenburg), then to Meinhard I, Count of Gorizia, and finally to Meinhard, Margrave of Istria (d. 1193) and his successors. In 1374 Albert IV, Margrave of Gorizia, died without successors and the castle was inherited by the members of the House of Habsburg. They rented or mortgaged it many times during the next few centuries to various noblemen closely related to them, among which were members of families Auersperg, Barbo, Della Torre, Devinski, Durr (Dürrer), Eggenberg, Flangini, Fugger, Khevenhüller, Mosconi, Swetkowitz, Turinetti de Prie and Walsee. The castle was finally sold to Antonio Laderchi de Montecuccoli in 1766 for 240 florins and remained the property of his family until 1945. In the meantime, various countries around the castle changed many times over the last more than 200 years: after the end of the Venetian Republic in 1797, Pazin belonged to the Habsburg Monarchy, then to Napoleon's French Empire, again to the Habsburg Monarchy, in 1918 to Italy, in 1945 to Yugoslavia, and in 1991 to Croatia. For many centuries the castle was the administrative seat of the County of Pazin (Croatian: Pazinska grofovija/Pazinska knežija; Italian: Contado di Pisino; German: Grafschaft Mitterburg) or County of Istria (Croatian: Istarska grofovija/Istarska knežija; Italian: Contea d' Istria; German: Grafschaft Isterreich), governed either by a castle captain castellan, or the count himself. ==Gallery== File:Pazinski kaštel - ploča.jpgEntrance plaque of the castle File:Pazinski kaštel - ulaz.jpgEntrance door with several coats of arms of the former owners File:Pazinski kaštel - jugoistok.jpgSoutheast side of the castle ==See also== * List of castles in Croatia * Timeline of Croatian history * Military history of Croatia * House of Montecuccoli == External links == * Present form of the Pazin Castle was built in the 16th century * Pazin Castle – the largest and best preserved medieval fortified structure in Istria County * Travellers often visit the castle * Pazin Castle – one of the several fortifications in Pazin and its surroundings * Laderchi of Montecuccoli bought the castle in 1766 * Pazin Town Museum Category:Buildings and structures in Istria County Category:Pazin Category:Medieval architecture Category:Castles in Croatia Category:Museums in Croatia ","title":"Pazin Castle"},{"id":"46366224","text":"Maria Emilia Reis Castro (born 1940) is a Portuguese trade union activist.

Syedra was settled in the 7th century BCE, and abandoned in the 13th century CE. The town had a port at sea level and an upper town 400m above. Ptolemy places it in Cilicia. Stephanus of Byzantium assigns it to Isauria. Hierocles places it in Pamphylia. The Roman historians Lucan and Florus both mention Syedra as where the Roman General Pompey held his last war council in 48 BCE, before his fatal voyage to Egypt. The city experienced its height around the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, and in 194 Roman Emperor Septimius Severus praised the city's resistance of ongoing Mediterranean piracy. A first century BCE inscription found in the town relates to the piracy, suggesting that the oracle, possibly of Apollo at Claros, advised the Syedrians to resist pirates with \\"violent battle, either driving away, or binding in unbreakable chains.\\" Coins were minted in Syedra during various time periods going back to that of Roman Emperor Tiberius (r. 14 CE–37 CE). In 374 CE, the early Christian theologian Epiphanius of Salamis wrote his work Ancoratus (the well anchored man) as a reply letter to the Church at Syedra, describing it as needing to be anchored in a safe harbor. Modern excavations began in 1994 under the Directorate of the Alanya Museum, and have excavated the main street in the upper town, as well as a cave decorated with Christian imagery likely used for baptisms. A mosaic found is now on display in the Alanya Museum. Other structures include a temple, a theater, shops, bathhouse, town walls, and several cisterns that provided water to the city. In 2011, archeologist excavating underwater dated relics of a port at Syedra to the Bronze Age, around 5,000 years ago. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Elisabeth Rosenbaum; Gerhard Huber; Somay Onurkan: A survey of coastal cities in Western Cilicia.

Born in Moscow on 12 January 1905, Haeff's family fled to Harbin, China, when he was fifteen years old. He studied electrical and mechanical engineering at the Russian Polytechnic Institute in Harbin, graduating in 1928 and emigrating to the United States to study at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). At Caltech, Haeff was awarded his MSc in 1929 and his PhD in 1932, with a thesis on an ultra-high frequency oscillator he later used in his invention of the traveling-wave tube amplifier. In 1934, Haeff left Caltech to work for RCA's research and development team, where he invented the inductive output tube in 1939. With the United States' entry into the Second World War in 1941, Haeff joined the United States Naval Research Laboratory as a consulting physicist, helping with the development of radar and inventing a pulse jammer. At the war's conclusion, he stayed on at the Naval Research Laboratory as head of the Vacuum Tube Research Section, inventing the electron-wave tube and the \\"memory tube\\" - a cathode ray tube capable of temporarily storing data, later eclipsed by the Williams tube but used in the Tektronix 4014 computer terminals. In 1950, Haeff was the first recipient of the IEEE's Harry Diamond Memorial Award \\"For his contribution to the study of the interaction of electrons and radiation, and for his contribution to the storage tube art\\". Haeff joined the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1950 to lead the Electron Tube Laboratory, where he continued producing memory and travelling-wave tubes and invented the electron-stream amplifier tube and resistive-wall amplifier with Charles Birdsall. The Electron Tube Laboratory was merged with Hughes' other research teams in 1954, becoming the Hughes Research Laboratories, with Haeff as their director. He left in 1961, exhausted, and became an independent inventor and consultant, creating a plasma containment device, a volumetric measuring device, and predicting laser-based scanning.

William Henn of Paradise Hill, County Clare, a future colleague on the Bench, was his cousin.Ball p.175 He was educated at the University of Dublin and at the Middle Temple. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1758. He entered politics but was not at first successful in his political career: although he was elected to the Irish House of Commons for Dungarvan in 1776, he was promptly unseated. In 1783 he stood for Parliament again both Castlemartyr and Charleville and took his seat as member for Castelmartyr. His first judicial office was Recorder of Cork, although the precise dates between which he held this office are uncertain; most probably he was Recorder from 1783 to 1787.

She first appears in the twenty-eighth series episode \\"Once There Was a Way Home – Part One\\", first broadcast on 10 August 2013. Howman's casting was announced four days before her debut. She attended multiple auditions against other actresses for the role. Rita is introduced as a new staff nurse at Holby City Hospital's emergency department (ED). She is characterised as fun, fiesty, blunt and excellent at her job, which means patients are at ease around her. Howman compared the character to a Jack Russell Terrier. Despite being a popular member of staff, Rita struggles to make personal relationships. Rita's first episode features an incident at her flat when her ceiling caves in; Howman liked the introduction and found it dramatic. Throughout her tenure on the show, Rita has been promoted twice: on first instance to senior staff nurse and on second instance to clinical nurse manager. The character's stories have mainly revolved around the exploration of her backstory. Joel Beckett was cast as Rita's estranged husband Mark Richie, who is a convincted child abuser. He is introduced a year after Rita's arrival when she files for divorce and he is admitted to the ED. Mark's appearance has a detrimental effect on Rita's mental wellbeing and she begins heavily drinking, sometimes during shifts. Producers reintroduced the character on two further occasions to challenge Rita and develop her other stories. On one occasion, Mark's appearance coincides with the disappearance of a child and on another occasion, he is admitted to the ED with the girl he abused, bringing a conclusion to the exploration of Rita's backstory. Producers also establish a feud between Rita and lead ED consultant Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) following Mark's first return. Connie blames Rita for her daughter leaving and when Connie is arrested, Rita hides evidence proving her not guilty. The story ends when the truth emerges. Show bosses then romantically paired Rita with paramedic Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) for lighter stories. Writers intertwined Mark's second return with the story to make it darker and Rita lies about being attacked by Mark. The story marks the character's exit in the thirtieth series episode \\"The Fear\\", first broadcast on 16 July 2016. Rita has been generally well received by critics who liked her strong and fiesty personality. However, Radio Times critic Alison Graham branded the character \\"Mother Teresa in trainers\\" and \\"a frowning, joyless nun\\" following her darker stories. == Casting == Rita's introduction was first previewed in a trailer released on the official Casualty website on 3 August 2013. Three days later, it was officially announced that actress Chloe Howman had been cast as nurse Rita Freeman. Howman did not struggle to settle into the cast as they were \\"warm and welcoming\\" towards her. Howman attended multiple auditions for the role and producers saw several actresses for the role. In one audition, Howman performed a screen test with Casualty cast members Patrick Robinson (Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford) and Jane Hazlegrove (Kathleen \\"Dixie\\" Dixon), before being told she had won the role of Rita. For the role of Rita, Howman dyed her hair from brown to blonde, which encouraged the actress to change her wardrobe. == Development ==  Characterisation and career  Rita is introduced as a staff nurse in Holby City Hospital's emergency department (ED). Howman described the character as sympathetic, good with patients, fiery, candid and fun to be around. The actress added, \\"Rita is good at her job as she's efficient in the workplace and doesn't suffer fools gladly!\\" Rita is sociable, flirtatious, a good listener and good at giving advice, which means that patients do not struggle when confiding in her. A BBC Online reporter said that Rita is \\"exactly the person you would want next to you in a crisis\\". However, Rita also lacks in self confidence and does not make personal relationships with others at risk of being hurt. She is a strong character and holds the opinion that \\"what doesn't kill us makes us stronger\\". Howman explained that while Rita is direct, she is not horrible and manipulative and is still popular amongst her colleagues. She said that Rita is good at communicating, commenting, \\"She's very good at voicing what needs to be voiced!\\" Howman later described Rita as a \\"humanitarian\\". The actress thought that she shared similar personality traits to her character, explaining that Rita is \\"feisty and tactile with a passion for truth\\", a trait they share. She compared the character to a Jack Russell Terrier due to her \\"terrier-like\\" status, explaining that she is resilient and courageous. Howman told Tricia Welch of the Daily Express that Rita is a true-hearted and caring person. The costume department style Rita in a leather jacket and jeans, which Howman thought the character is suited to as she is \\"boyish\\". When the vacany arises, Rita secures a job as a senior staff nurse. In January 2015, Rita is appointed the ED's clinical nurse manager. Howman said that Rita's managerial style with the nursing staff would be different to how clinical lead Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) manages the doctors. She explained that Rita does not follow the idea of \\"hierarchy\\" and prefers to work as a team rather than giving orders. The actress added that Rita's new position makes her understand the pressure of Connie's job. Rita has a different uniform for her new job, which Howman found exciting. She liked the dark blue colour and described it as \\"complimentary\\".  Introduction  Rita is introduced in the series 28 episode \\"Once There Was a Way Home – Part One\\", first broadcast on 10 August 2013. As Rita prepares to leave for her first shift, the ceiling of her apartment collapses. She goes to find out what happened and learns that her neighbour Jane's hoarding has caused the collapse. Rita notices that Jane is trapped and assists the paramedics in helping her out. Jane begs with the hospital staff not to inform her father of the accident, creating a clash between Rita and the senior staff nurse, Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw), who disagrees with Rita's view. Howman billed the introduction as \\"very dramatic\\" and \\"very exciting\\". On the introduction, the actress commented, \\"I couldn't have asked for a better way to join the show.\\" She revealed that she watched her first episode with her family as she felt that it was vital that she watched Rita's journey. Rita later works a shift with the paramedic team, Dixie and Jeff Collier (Matt Bardock), to experience their view of life. She struggles with the experience and cannot detach herself from a patient who refuses treatment after taking a heroin overdose. The trio later attend to a man stuck in machinery at a junkyard, who Rita connects with and chats to as they wait for the fire crew. However, in a \\"heartbreaking\\" twist, Rita is told that the man will die when he is released.  Exploration of backstory   Mark's introduction  At the time of Rita's introduction, Howman confirmed that the character has a backstory, which would be explored. She teased, \\"life hasn't been particularly easy for Rita\\". When asked by colleagues about her personal life, Rita claims that she is a widow. However, Rita is actually estranged from her husband, Mark Richie (Joel Beckett), who is alive. Howman clarified that her character did not mean to lie about her marriage, but once she said it, she felt that she could not change her story. The actress likened Rita to \\"a rabbit in the headlights\\" when she is asked about her husband, and pointed out that Rita is in \\"a cornered moment\\" when she says Mark is dead. Mark is a former teacher who was convincted of child abuse after having a relationship with a thirteen-year-old girl. Mark denied the allegations and Rita believed him, defending him at his trial. Howman explained that Rita believed Mark because she \\"loved him, trusted him and genuinely believed him\\". Rita realised the truth when Mark was found guilty. She felt ashamed by her actions and changed jobs as she did not want anyone to find out about her past. Rita lies about Mark because they have not spoken since his imprisonment. Howman carried out research for the storyline and spoke to somebody who went through a similar experience to Rita. She also expressed her compassion for anyone in a similar situation with the character. Mark is introduced to the series in August 2014 shortly after Rita files for divorce. Mark orders an attack on himself in prison so he can be admitted to the ED to see Rita. Howman told Elaine Reilly of What's on TV that Rita wanted to start afresh, but Mark's arrival has distrupted that. Mark then refuses any treatment until he can speak with Rita, although she refuses to speak to him. Howman thought the situation is \\"horrible\\" because Mark is bleeding and won't let anyone treat him. Rita wants to have Mark treated fast and leaving soon, so she decides to speak with him. Howman wanted it to be clear that Rita still loves Mark, which she called \\"the fundamental flaw in the situation\\". She explained that Mark can still \\"manipulate\\" Rita and added, \\"Rita's life unravels before her! It's a devastating story. Rita's shame is intense.\\" Rita and Mark have an emotional discussion, which Howman enjoyed acting out with Beckett. The actress liked exploring the character of Rita as Casualty usually follows the stories of its guest characters. Rita hopes to stop her colleagues from discovering Mark's identity so steals his patient files, an act which could end Rita's career. Howman called it \\"a big slur on her\\". When her colleagues discover that Mark is alive, they are upset with Rita. Howman told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that some of Rita's colleagues feel \\"hurt\\" by the revelation because everything that Rita had told them has become \\"this massive lie\\". The actress described the day as \\"the worst possible day\\" for Rita.  Aftermath of Mark's appearance  Rita's struggle with alcoholism is noticed by Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford, portrayed by Patrick Robinson (pictured). Following the introduction of Rita's husband, series producer Erika Hossington confirmed that the focus on Rita would continue for several months. She told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Rita would \\"face a really tough time and be pushed to her emotional limit\\". Howman described the storyline as \\"a really nice journey for Rita\\" and said that she enjoyed exploring the character's backstory. Hossington praised Howman's performances and opined that she has performed well in the storyline. She thought that the storyline would be fascinating as the character has not been explored. Hossington commented, \\"In medical stories, Rita always wants to know the facts, but when the spotlight is turned on her and she's forced to face up to the truth about herself, she doesn't deal with it too well!\\" Howman enjoyed portraying the bigger material, although admitted that her schedule was \\"mental\\". She was thankful that the bigger storylines were spread between cast members. After Mark's appearance, Rita takes leave from work. When she returns, she receives a \\"frosty reception\\" from her colleagues. Rita subsequently struggles and begins drinking alcohol, resulting in her being repeatedly late and making mistakes on the job. At the end of a shift, Ash sees Rita having a shot of vodka in the ED staff room. The following shift, Rita does not arrive for work as she is afraid that Ash will have her sacked. Ash becomes worried about Rita and visits her, but is shocked to discover the multiple empty bottles in her flat. Howman said that Rita is dealing with her problems how she finds best and added that Mark's appearance has had \\"quite dire consequences\\" for Rita. Rita later recovers from her problems and regains control of her life.  Mark's returns  In January 2015, Beckett reprised his role for another appearance and Mark returns after being released from prison. He returns on the day of Rita's first shift as clinical nurse manager. Howman told Reilly (What's on TV) that Rita sees her new position as \\"a chance to prove her professionalism\\" following Mark's first appearance. Mark wants to reconcile with Rita and tells her that he is a better person than he was, leaving Rita conflicted. Howman sympathised with her character and commented, \\"He hurt her and destroyed their lives. She loves him but hates what he did.\\" Connie's young daughter, Grace Beauchamp (Emily Carey), is at the hospital at the same time as Mark and when she goes missing, Rita considers whether Mark is responsible. Howman called the situation \\"shady\\" and said that although Rita believes that Mark is not responsible, she does question whether Mark is \\"even darker than she thought he was\\". Rita chooses to deal with the problem alone, but soon realises that she cannot. Howman pointed out that while Rita has learned from past errors, Grace's disappearance has massive consequences. Grace returns safe and well and she confirms that she has not been involved with Mark. However, Rita realises that she cannot trust Mark again and cuts ties with him. Howman explained that Rita cuts ties with Mark with \\"as much forgiveness and sincerity as she can muster\\". Howman found the episode hard to film. The actress enjoyed working with Beckett again and thought that they created a convincible chemistry between the couple. Beckett reprised his role again in 2016 and Mark returns in April after being admitted to the ED with his girlfriend, Fiona Holden (Aimee Barrett). Beckett agreed to return after becoming interested in how to explore his character. Fiona, now an adult, is the underage girl who dated Mark before his imprisonment. Howman disliked their relationship and thought it made the characters appear \\"meant to be, but it's definitely not\\". Rita treats Fiona against advice and discovers that she has an ectopic pregnancy and needs surgery; when she informs Fiona, she accuses Rita of sabotaging her relationship with Mark. Fiona locks herself inside an office and refuses to move until she speaks privately with Rita. In a candid conversation, Fiona realises that Mark's actions were wrong and agrees to have a termination. When Fiona ends her relationship with Mark, he confronts Rita alone, leaving her \\"shaken\\". Beckett sympathised with Rita and told a reporter from Inside Soap that Mark ends the episode as \\"a pathetic man who's had his comeuppance and runs out of Holby with his tail between his legs\\". Howman enjoyed working with Beckett again and filming with Barrett. On the story and Barrett, she commented, \\"It's a really hard piece for everyone to play. Each part is difficult, but she was very good.\\"  Feud with Connie Beauchamp  Producers created a feud between Rita and Connie after the conclusion of Connie's previous feud. Hossington believed that Connie worked well with a rival and so, decided to introduce a feud for the character. She opined that the rivalry would be \\"electric\\" and better than Connie's previous feud, suggesting that there could be a violent altercation between the characters. The storyline begins when Connie sparks a feud with Rita following Grace's decision to leave Connie and live with her father. Connie continues a \\"deadly hate campaign against Rita\\" and as Connie implements changes in the ED, Dylan Keogh (William Beck) and Lily Chao (Crystal Yu) begin to suffer as a result, causing Rita to challenge Connie's behaviour. Connie berates Rita, calling her \\"incompetent and a danger to the hospital\\". Howman explained that Connie is attacking Rita because she is upset following Grace's departure. Connie then reveals that she blames Rita for Grace's departure. Howman told Reilly (What's on TV) that Connie completely blames Rita for losing her daughter, which has made her lose \\"all perspective\\". Howman and Mealing enjoyed portraying the characters' feud and wanted the audience to like it too. Outside of her feud with Rita, Connie develops a close friendship with former surgeon Alfred Maxwell (Michael Byrne), who is dying from motor neuron disease. He is later admitted to the ED and Connie does not allow anyone else to treat him. Following Alfred's death, Rita discovers that Connie asked nurse Lofty Chiltern (Lee Mead) to dispose of his blood tests, so she has the bloods tested for drugs. Mealing thought that Rita sees this as her chance to \\"get rid of Connie\\". Rita discovers a drug in Alfred's blood system and after finding out that Connie was visiting Alfred the previous night, she reports Connie to the police for euthanasia. Hospital staff are questioned by the police as part of the investigation and Rita is pleased with Connie's absence. Connie confesses to stealing medication, but states that she only gave Alfred two tablets, which could not kill him. She tells the police that the remaining drugs are in her office. Before the police can arrive, Rita steals the drugs from Connie's office. Mealing called Rita's actions \\"malicious\\". Connie is then charged with Alfred's murder. Senior nurse Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) soon realises that Rita has framed Connie and pressures her into letting him return the drugs to the police without incriminating her. Mealing observed that Charlie \\"puts the moral thumbscrews on Rita\\".  Relationship with Iain Dean  Following her darker storylines, producers romantically paired Rita with paramedic Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) to provide the characters with lighter stories. Hossington told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) that the coupling would be surprising and dissimilar to other pairings on the drama. While remembering Jeff on the one-year anniversary of his death, Iain makes sexual advances towards Rita and asks if she would like a one-night stand, which she agrees to. Reilly (What's on TV) wondered if the couple could become \\"Casualty new favourite couple\\". Howman later told the reporter that Iain is the first person that Rita has loved since Mark, which is important to her following her trauma with Mark. The actress enjoyed working with Stevenson. Hossington confirmed that the storyline would become darker throughout the series. Following his return, Mark begins harassing Rita; when she confides in Iain about the harassment, Iain confronts him, leaving Rita \\"impressed\\". As her relationship with Iain deteriorates, Rita resorts to \\"desperate measures\\" to save the relationship. Howman explained that Rita would struggle with the situation. Iain struggles with his feelings for Rita, but hands her a key to his flat. At the end of the shift, Iain goes on a date with another woman, shocking and upsetting Rita. Howman confirmed that this would spark some darker behaviour for her character as she prepares to fight for her relationship. Rita remains angry with Iain and he tries ending the relationship but changes his mind when he finds Rita scared and upset after discovering that someone has slashed her car tyres. When Rita notices Iain flirting with a nurse, she claims that Mark was responsible for slashing her car tyres and is stalking her, despite being told by police that Mark was not responsible. Howman enjoyed exploring the psychology of Rita and portraying the character's actions. She hoped that the audience would understand that Rita's behaviour stems from her difficult marriage to Mark. The actress opined that Rita was still \\"redeemable\\" because she is \\"human\\". After Iain ends the relationship, a \\"mortified\\" Rita hides from him and hits her face on a car wing mirror. She develops a black eye and blames the incident on Mark, claiming that he assaulted her. Their colleagues berate Iain for leaving Rita, so he decides to defend Rita and confront Mark, causing Rita to confess the truth. Rita's colleagues are shocked by her lies and give her a \\"frosty reception\\" when she attends work. Rita only receives support from consultant Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths), who had experienced a similar incident recently. Rita tries to apologise to Iain, but he rejects her and tells her to resign from her job. She agrees and decides to leave Holby. The scenes, featured in the series 30 episode \\"The Fear\\", first broadcast on 16 July 2016, marked Howman's departure from Casualty after three years on the drama. Reflecting on her character's storylines, Howman told Reilly (What's on TV) that there was \\"always a lot going on with Rita Freeman\\", which she felt made her captivating to an audience. == Reception == Elaine Reilly (What's on TV) described Rita as a \\"gutsy\\", \\"personable and popular nurse\\". Radio Times critic David Brown predicted that Rita would be \\"the dynamic yet sensitive type\\" upon viewing her introduction. Reviewing Rita's first episode, Sue Haasler, a writer for Pauseliveaction, called the character a \\"practical, independent, feisty\\" nurse who \\"knows what she's doing\\". Haasler thought Rita proved that \\"she has both a cool head in a crisis and a head for heights\\" in her introduction. Haasler later praised Howman's performances during the death of the crushed man on Rita's shift with the paramedic team. Brown also reflected on the episode, commenting, \\"You don't send a bubbly, easy-going nurse like Rita out on a shift with the paramedics without her confidence being completely shaken by the end of it.\\" Reilly thought that Rita's life \\"hit rock bottom\\" when Mark arrives at the hospital, while a South Wales Echo reporter named the moment in their \\"3 to see\\" column of the day. Likewise, an Evening Gazette columnist listed its immediate aftermath in their \\"3 to see\\" column of the day. Brown's colleague, Alison Graham, expected that Rita would be promoted to senior staff nurse due to her empathetic nature. She also observed that when Mark is admitted to the ED, \\"Rita's eyebrows shoot up and before long she’s casting furtive glances like death rays.\\" Graham also branded the character \\"Mother Teresa in trainers\\" and \\"Saint Rita\\" in her reviews of Casualty. Haasler reflected on the darker element to Rita following the exploration of her backstory in a review. She deemed the story \\"a somewhat depressing storyline for a woman who was formerly as competent and assured as Rita\\". Graham thought it was obvious that Rita was struggling as she appeared \\"hunched on her sofa drinking too much red wine and watching Countryfile\\" after a challenging shift. She also described the character as someone who \\"never misses a chance to try to improve the life of a hapless stranger\\". Haasler enjoyed Ash's friendship with Rita and sympathised with Rita's dependence on alcohol. Reilly noted that Rita is placed \\"in the doghouse with clinical lead Connie\\" when Grace goes missing. Haasler enjoyed the feud between Rita and Connie, describing it as \\"an interesting set-up for two strong characters\\". On the feud between Rita and Connie, Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy commented, \\"Let's face it, Rita was never a match for Connie but she tried her best to be – and very nearly succeeded.\\" Graham thought that after her darker storylines with Mark and Connie, Rita had become \\"a frowning, joyless nun\\", so was pleased when she was paired with Iain. Haasler disliked the writers' decision to portray Rita as desperate in her pairing with Iain. She thought Rita appeared foolish and opined, \\"I'm cross about that because Rita is worth ten of Iain\\". Reilly observed that Rita went to \\"extreme and sinister lengths\\" to save her relationship with Iain. Graham called Rita's lies prior to her exit \\"appalling\\" and on the character's exit, she wrote, \\"Emergency department personnel are so frequently sent to Coventry there should be a direct bus service from Holby.\\" Similarly, Reilly pointed out that Rita departed \\"under a cloud with only Charlie to wave her farewell\\". == References  External links == * Category:Casualty (TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2013 Category:Fictional nurses Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Rita Freeman"},{"id":"46366323","text":"Mason Thomas Springthorpe (born 1 November 1994) is an English footballer who plays for Shrewsbury Up & Comers as a goalkeeper. He joined Everton for £125,000 from Shrewsbury Town in February 2011 but never played a competitive match, spending a month on loan at Woking in January 2014. After being released that May, he had a brief stint at Ellesmere Rangers before returning to the professional game by signing for Fleetwood Town in January 2015, being released at the end of the season. He went on to play for a series of non- league clubs. ==Early life== Born in Shrewsbury, Springthorpe played as a forward as a child, but at the age of nine his father converted him to be a goalkeeper. He attended Meole Brace School. As a youth, Springthorpe studied the style of play of Joe Hart, another goalkeeper from Shrewsbury who left his local team when he was signed by a top-flight club, in Hart's case Manchester City. ==Career== Everton On 14 February 2011, when still in Shrewsbury Town's youth team, he was signed by Premier League club Everton for £125,000. He told BBC Radio Shropshire \\"The price tag means nothing to me. The regime at Everton will be something else, but if that's what it takes to get to the next level then I'll grab it with both hands\\". He believed that Everton would progress his career, due to the contracts they had given to young players Jose Baxter and Jack Rodwell. He was first included in an Everton matchday squad on 2 March 2013, remaining an unused substitute as they defeated reigning Reading 2–1 at Goodison Park. Tim Howard was injured, so Springthorpe deputised for Ján Mucha. A week later he was again on the bench as they lost 0–3 at home to Wigan Athletic in the sixth round of the FA Cup. On 16 March, his last call-up of the season, he was an unused substitute in a 2–0 home win over reigning league champions Manchester City. After his first season, Springthorpe toured the United States with Everton. He was only in one matchday squad in the following season, a 2–1 home win over Southampton on 29 December. On 20 January 2014, he was loaned to Conference National team Woking for a month. He made his competitive debut the following day, in a 0–1 defeat to Chester. On 25 January he played the only other game of his loan, a 2–2 draw with Lincoln City at Sincil Bank. In May 2014, Springthorpe, who had been a regular for Everton's Under-21 team, was released by manager Roberto Martínez. Ellesmere and Fleetwood On 6 August, Springthorpe returned to his native Shropshire, signing for West Midlands League club Ellesmere Rangers on the day before the start of their season. He returned to the professional game on 3 January 2015, when he was signed for League One club Fleetwood Town by manager Graham Alexander. On the same day, he was an unused substitute for their 2–2 draw against Swindon Town at Highbury Stadium. On 7 May, having not made an appearance, Springthorpe was one of 14 players released by the Lancashire club. Return to non-league Springthorpe then returned again to his home county, signing a one-year deal at Conference North club A.F.C. Telford United on. He moved to Northwich Victoria of the Northern Premier League Division One North on loan in September 2015, having not yet featured for his parent club that season. He transferred to them on a permanent basis the following month. On 5 December, he featured for them in the second round of the FA Cup away to League Two Northampton Town, conceding three goals in the final seven minutes of a 3–2 loss. In November 2016 he joined Southport on dual registration terms, and having made two first-team appearances he was released by the club in March 2017. In June 2017 he joined Alfreton Town on a one-year contract. In August, he signed for Sutton Coldfield Town on loan, which was extended for a second month in September. He was released by mutual consent by Alfreton in October 2017.http://nonleague.pitchero.com/headlines/alfreton-release-keeper- springthorpe/ After spells at A.F.C. Wulfrunians and Market Drayton Town, on 27 February 2019, Springthorpe joined North West Counties League Division One South club F.C. Oswestry Town. After the club went out of business, Springthorpe signed for Shropshire County League side Shrewsbury Up & Comers, whom Springthorpe spent his youth career as a child with. ==References *Profile at Fleetwood Town * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Shrewsbury Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Everton F.C. players Category:Woking F.C. players Category:Ellesmere Rangers F.C. players Category:Fleetwood Town F.C. players Category:A.F.C.

There it has often been ascribed to Aesop's fables, although there is no evidence for this and it does not appear in the Perry Index. Various versions have been given different interpretations over time and artistic representations have been common. ==A question of ascription== Fable collections since the 16th century have ascribed the fable of \\"The Bear and the Bees\\" to Aesop, although in fact its first appearance was under the title De urso et apibus among the hundred short fables in Laurentius Abstemius' Hecatomythium (1495). In 1519 all of these were subsequently included, along with the work of other authors, in the Aesop compilation associated with Martinus Dorpius (1485-1525), which then went into many editions across Europe.Paola Cifarelli, \\"Fables: Aesop and Babrius\\", in The Classical Heritage in France, Brill 2002, p.445 But whereas several of those other authors had only translated from Greek into Latin fables traditionally ascribed to Aesop, the work of Abstemius was largely original. Sometimes Abstemius had taken his ideas from popular material like, for example, already existing proverbs for which he provided an explanatory framework. In the case of \\"The Bear and the Bees\\" he made use of a symbol in an earlier Italian work of pious morality from the first half of the 15th century, the \\"Flowers of Virtue and of Manners\\" (Fiore de virtu e de costumi). There it was stated that “Anger can be connected to the bear eating honey”, followed by a description of how a bear stung by a bee will chase it until another stings him; his anger then becomes diverted and he starts to chase that one and so never kills any. The passage was accompanied by illustrations of bees swarming round the bear's head in both the 15th centuryHarley MS 3448 f.10v British Library and the 16th century.Bibliothèque nationale de France In this instance Abstemius has provided a structured narrative leading to a more general moral conclusion in a text soon to be incorporated into the body of Aesopic lore. ==Interpretations== Diplomacy and politics When Roger L'Estrange compiled his Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists (1692), those of Abstemius and other authors in the Dorpius collection were translated under their own names and kept apart from those ascribed to Aesop in the main body of the book in a rare acknowledgement of his authorship. L'Estrange's version is slightly more condensed even than his: \\"A Bear was so enrag'd once at the Stinging of a Bee, that he ran like mad into the Bee-Garden, and over- turn'd all the Hives in revenge. This Outrage brought them out in whole Troops upon him; and he came afterwards to bethink himself, how much more advisable it had been to pass over one Injury, than by an unprofitable Passion to provoke a Thousand.\\"Fable 290, p.253 Just as Abstemius had seen the moral merit of the Mediaeval symbol of the bear and the bees, so the compilers of Renaissance Emblem books were to follow him in using it to point to the consequences of giving way to anger. Joachim Camerarius the Younger included it under the title Violenta Nocent as Emblem 23 in his Symbolorum et Emblematum Centuriae Quatuor (1595). The accompanying distich warns that violence brings ill to its author and Camerarius goes on to comment that the Italian writer Luca Contile had earlier associated the symbol with violence.Online archive Another who used the emblem was Cristoph Murer under the title of Libido Vindictae (desire for vengeance) in XL emblemata miscella nova, which was posthumously published in 1620. He also noted that rage is immediately followed by a similar reply.Emblem XXXII French and English authors who include the fable in their collections often stay close to the Abstemius version. In Isaac de Benserade's Les fables d'Ésope, mises en françois, avec le sens moral en quatre vers (1678), the warning on which he closes is to beware of calling up many enemies by seeking vengeance on one.p.311 Robert Dodsley tells his version of a bear taking revenge for a single sting and coming to the painful conclusion of how much better it would have been \\"to have patiently acquiesced in one injury, than thus by an unprofitable resentment to have provoked a thousand\\".Fable 54 But beyond the generalised moral message, the Cavalier losers in the English Civil War saw in the fable a further application as advising acquiescence in their own circumstances for a while rather than stirring up endless civil strife and further personal misery. So John Ogilby's “The Bear and Bees” ends by counseling against “Making a private quarrel national”,Annabel Patterson, “Fables of Power” in The Politics of Discourse (University of California 1987), p.283ff while Francis Barlow's illustration of “The Bear and Beehives” is summed up by the verse, “So petty tumults, by the rout persu’d, / Have often mighty common wealths subdu’d\\".Aesopica Nor were they the only ones to realise that the fable was politically adaptable. A poem of the same title as Barlow's was written by one English patriot to refer to the likely result of Napoleon’s Continental System after 1806.The Yorkshireman 37, 18 Jan 1834 p.208 Later in the 19th century, the illustrator John Tenniel, realising that the bear was traditionally the symbol for Russia, used the fable in a cartoon for the satirical magazine Punch to comment on the outcome of Russia's belligerence towards the Turks in 1853.July 16 1853 Self-restraint and religion The fable of the bear and the bees by Jan van Kessel, oil on copper, 1672 A different moral reading of the fable occurs in another Emblem book, Eduard de Dene's De Warachtighe Fabulen der Dieren (true animal fables, 1567). The illustration there of \\"The Bear and the Honey-bees\\" by Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder was eventually used for a trencher in England with a translation of the moral about the rim: “The bees do feircely sting the Beare/ While he their hony Hives do tear/ So some that Pleasure seek in Haste/ With sower Sawce their Sweet do taste.”British Museum It is not the bear's angry response that is emphasised in De Clerck's version of the fable but its despotic greed. English and French writers adopted this interpretation in different ways. When it appeared in George Wither's A collection of emblems: ancient and modern (1635), he was reusing the German plates of Gabriel Rollenhagen from twenty years earlier. Device 23 pictures the bear scrambling up a tree, his head surrounded by angry bees, and has the title Patior Ut Potiar (suffering for success).Online archive The accompanying poem points out that as the bear is prepared to suffer in pursuit of its appetite, so should the virtuous aspire to grow. James Merrick's poem of “The bears and the bees” (1763) introduces two of the animals (as had the 16th century illustration of Flowers of Virtue and of Manners). Though it concludes that “Pleasure’s ever bought with pain”, it does not draw the same moral parallel.Poems on sacred subjects The poem was much reprinted, including by Thomas Bewick in his 1818 edition of Select Fables of Aesop.Fable 130 Meanwhile in France Claude Joseph Dorat versified the story as L’ours et les mouches à miel in his Fables nouvelles (1773).Volume 1, p.95 His conclusion was that we should moderate our desires since, in a reversion of the earlier moral lesson, \\"At the heart of our pleasures, pain is born\\". Advancing further down the religious path, the 18th century churchman Samuel Croxall interpreted the stung bear's self- laceration as the pain of remorse.Fable 126 The Catholic writer William Henry Anderdon followed him in The Christian Æsop: ancient fables teaching eternal truths (1871), seeing in the episode a lesson in the need for confession as the accompaniment of penitent sorrow.p.46ff ==The fable in the applied arts== On both occasions where the fable has been made a subject by painters, it has been as part of a set. In the case of Jan van Kessel the Elder, the other three scenes included \\"The Wolf, the Deer and the Sheep\\", \\"The Lion and the Boar\\" and \\"The Sick Stag\\".Invaluable co. Though he often had a unifying theme when creating such sets, none has been suggested here, other than that all are fables by Aesop. Where the \\"Bear attacked by bees\\"Wikimedia of Georg Ernst Sandner (1736–1811) is concerned, its companion piece, \\"A boar sow and its young”,Artnet is not a fable. Both paintings feature black-coloured animals at the centre of a verdant landscape. Since the fable was short and featured only a single episode, it did not furnish much scope for illustrators who, for the most part, confined themselves to depicting a bear crouching by an overturned skep and trying to protect its muzzle and eyes from the encircling bees. Such illustrations lent themselves to use in ornamenting domestic items, such as the wooden fireplace in Somerset House, Halifax, West Yorkshire, from about 1760Wikimedia or the design on a 1770 Royal Worcester painted plate.Wikimedia A century later, the fable figured on the set of six tiles produced by the Mintons Hollins company.

It was written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton, and directed by Dan Zeff. It first aired on 9 April 2015 on BBC Two. The story follows a 17th-century witch trial. Elizabeth Gadge, played by Ruth Sheen, stands accused of witchcraft by inhabitants of the village of Little Happens, including characters played by Sinead Matthews, Jim Howick, Paul Kaye and Trevor Cooper. The magistrate Sir Andrew Pike, played by David Warner, has summoned the famed witch-finders Mr Warren and Mr Clarke, played by Shearsmith and Pemberton, to try Elizabeth, but is more concerned with bringing visitors to the village than finding the truth. The episode was not intended to be a parody of period dramas, but instead to reflect the absurdity of real witch trials. To that end, the characters take the events of the episode seriously, which leads to much of the humour. The writers' influences included Witchfinder General, The Crucible, Monty Python and Hammer Horror films, while the names of the witch- finders were a tribute to the late actor Warren Clarke. Many critics responded positively to the episode, praising the humour—especially that deriving from the use of archaic language—the writing and the performances. Some, however, considered \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" of lower quality than the previous two episodes. ==Production== The barn at the Chiltern Open Air Museum where \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" was filmed The second series of Inside No. 9 was written in 2014, and then filmed from the end of 2014 into early 2015. The writing process for \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" began with Shearsmith's suggestion of a witch trial as a plot idea, and the writers then worked out the details of the setting. The episode was filmed, mostly in story order,Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 26:24. on location in a barn at the Chiltern Open Air Museum. The same location had previously been used for Doctor Who and Horrible Histories. In addition, concurrent with the filming of \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\", a Drunk History sketch starring Luke Pasqualino—a previous Inside No. 9 guest star—was being filmed nearby.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 23:15. Shot in December, \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" was the first episode of the second series to be filmed. The barn was extremely cold during filming; Pemberton joked that, unlike on Titanic, they would not be digitally adding breath in the production process. \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" was written to mimic genuine witch trials, some transcripts of which Pemberton and Shearsmith had read as part of the writing process. The fixation of the characters on \\"teats\\" and \\"suckling\\", for instance, was something Shearsmith had seen in authentic trials. One writing challenge concerned the need for new information to be revealed with each of the trial's witnesses; this is what shaped the structure of the script.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 2:10. For Shearsmith, given that the trials were already absurd, they cannot be parodied. The humour of the episode, for him, comes precisely from the fact that the characters take the events so seriously, and do not see this absurdity. Pemberton said that the pair aimed for authenticity, and did not seek to produce a spoof of a period piece. To that end, he was complimentary of Yves Barr, a costume designer with whom the writers had worked for a number of years, who did \\"a fantastic job creating this period on a shoestring\\". Given that, in his view, \\"people don't do this period\\", Shearsmith was excited to film something set in the 17th century. The episode was the only period piece in the first two series, but the writers expressed willingness to do another;Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 29:14. they felt that the setting showed that they really could go anywhere with the programme.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 9:20. As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" starred Pemberton and Shearsmith as Mr Warren and Mr Clarke respectively, along with David Warner as Sir Andrew Pike and Ruth Sheen as Elizabeth Gadge. Warner had previously worked with Pemberton and Shearsmith on The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse, and the writers thought him very well-suited to the role as Sir Andrew Pike.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 2:58. Shearsmith considered Sheen a very capable actress, and complimented the way she played Gadge as a serious character; Pemberton felt she added \\"gravitas\\" to the role.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 6:06. Sinead Matthews starred as Sarah Nutter, Jim Howick as Thomas Nutter, Paul Kaye as Richard Two-Shoes, and Trevor Cooper as George Waterhouse. Shearsmith was particularly pleased to have Howick appearing in the episode. As he had appeared in Horrible Histories, he added, for Shearsmith, \\"a weight of royalty\\". The \\"comic coupling\\" of Howick and Matthews had characters who were originally, mistakenly, named \\"Gadge\\", but this did not fit with the characters' relationship with the titular Elizabeth. The couple were renamed \\"Nutter\\", a reference to Alice Nutter of the real-world Pendle witch trials.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 6:27. In addition to the credited actors, the crew had a crowd of extras for one day of filming. Around 12 extras were used; budget constraints allowed this number for a day, or five extras for two days. This constraint led to a change in the script, seeing the crowd removed from the trial.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 5:19. Although uncredited, Goody Two-Shoes was played by an actress who had appeared in Psychoville, one of Pemberton and Shearsmith's previous productions, as Joanne Dunderdale, an understudy.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 10:22. The writers were complimentary of Cooper's performance; they said that he was almost \\"conducting\\" the crowd of extras, in that they were noisy when he was shouting, and quiet when he stopped.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 11:10. In addition to the use of visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were pleased that they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final shot to the opening shot of the episode, as both feature a raven.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 25:24. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after the first day of the trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an explanation about the Devil being found in everyday objects and a discussion about the stages of torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed frustration that these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 1:28.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 19:59. ==Plot== In 17th century England, the magistrate Sir Andrew Pike (Warner) summons the witch- finders Mr Warren (Shearsmith) and Mr Clarke (Pemberton) to the village of Little Happens. Seventy-year-old Elizabeth Gadge (Sheen) has been accused of witchcraft, and Pike is excited that the news has attracted the attention of outsiders. Pike and Warren already seem convinced of Gadge's guilt, but Clarke remains sceptical. Elizabeth's case is brought to trial the following morning, with the assistance of the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth says that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat; Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements. Clarke privately tells Warren that he thinks Elizabeth is innocent and that he is not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves. ==Analysis== \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" is a period piece tribute to Witchfinder General, The Blood on Satan's Claw and The Crucible, while the names \\"Warren\\" and \\"Clarke\\" are a homage to British actor Warren Clarke, who, at time of production and airing, had recently died. The names were selected prior to Clarke's death—specifically because they were amusing but period appropriate, and not because the actor had any link to the episode's themes—but the writers chose to keep them as a tribute upon the death of Clarke, with whom Shearsmith had previously worked.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 4:29. The style and humour is reminiscent of Horrible Histories and Monty Python. For instance, one scene was directly inspired by the \\"laughing guard\\" scene in Monty Python's Life of Brian. Pemberton and Shearsmith themselves, however, did not consider the episode to be particularly reminiscent of Monty Python.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 10:25. The humour is childish, but many of the jokes are \\"bawdy\\" and \\"adult\\". Though one critic said that the episode was \\"the first straight- up comedic episode of the second series\\", another said that the episode's humour was balanced with tragedy and poignancy, arguing that the whole episode has an element of horror. This was especially true given that the story reflects actual happenings; the depiction of torture was described as \\"genuinely upsetting\\". Despite the sole setting of the barn, the episode evokes a degree of folk horror. \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" was described by Jonathan Wright (The Guardian) and Phoebe Jane-Boyd (Den of Geek) as like a Hammer Horror film with added humour, and writers for the Irish Examiner said that the episode should appeal to both horror and comedy fans. Given that Gadge is revealed to actually be a witch, Howick asked Shearsmith whether the former's character, Thomas, truly had witnessed Gadge engaging in some kind of supernatural activity. Shearsmith suggested that Thomas was motivated by greed. However, he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses Gadge being tortured.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 17:19. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must have been based on some level of belief. ==Reception== Critics commended the performance of Warner (pictured, 2013) as Pike Critics generally responded warmly to the episode, but some felt it compared poorly to others in the series. David Chater, writing for The Times, felt that \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" was dissimilar from any previous episode of Inside No. 9, but that it was \\"equally accomplished\\", while in sister publication The Sunday Times, critics suggested that the change in style showed the writers' versatility. Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, called \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" a \\"hilariously dark little half-hour of quintessentially British comedy\\". Rupert Hawksley, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was more critical. He awarded \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" three out of five stars, saying that \\"despite a starry cast and a delightful twist and counter-twist, [the episode] was nothing like as effective\\" as \\"La Couchette\\" and \\"The 12 Days of Christine\\", the previous two episodes of the series. The episode, he claimed, was indicative of a \\"mid-series lull\\". The freelance journalist Dan Owen felt the episode was \\"entertaining fare, but too predictable and clichéd to prove genuinely memorable\\", awarding it two out of four stars. He, too, said the episode felt like \\"a mid-series misstep\\". Shearsmith was unhappy with those who thought the episode a \\"dud\\" or a \\"misfire\\", confessing that it was his favourite episode of the second series. Pemberton felt it was going to be difficult to follow \\"The 12 Days of Christine\\", but Shearsmith was of the view that the episodes should not be in competition with each other.Pemberton and Shearsmith, episode commentary, 12:30. The episode's humour was praised by the majority of commentators. Julia Raeside, writing for The Guardian, said the writers \\"managed to pull together a loving tribute to [their] cult horror source material with an all-out gag rate that most sitcoms would fail to keep up with\\", claiming that \\"they get the look and tone just right and then inject it with the kind of comedy that is perfectly tailored to puncture the fictional world without deflating it\\". Similarly, Debnath felt that the jokes, including \\"anachronistic references\\" and \\"dark punnery\\", were \\"bang on\\". By contrast, Hawksley claimed that the episode had several \\"inspired moments\\", including a \\"perfectly pitched\\" joke about selfies, but that the writers had failed to properly exploit the 17th-century setting. Overall, though finding it \\"occasionally funny\\", Hawksley thought the episode \\"fell some way short of what we have come to expect from Pemberton and Shearsmith\\". For the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, the episode was \\"all the more hauntingly funny because it is played pretty straight\\", but he noted that the character of Sir Andrew Pike allowed \\"some offbeat humour\\". Chater called the episode \\"very, very funny\\", and Philip Cunnington, of the Lancashire Evening Post, called it \\"one of the funniest half-hours of TV so far this year\\" after the conclusion of the series. Television critics praised the writing and acting of \\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\". Though Owen felt that the ending \\"held little surprise\\", Paddy Shennan, of the Liverpool Echo, said he \\"loved the fact that, for the third week running, [he] couldn't work out the twist\\". For Debnath, \\"the best was saved till last\\", but the whole episode was \\"tightly written\\". Patrick Mulkern (Radio Times), too, said that \\"this dark tale soon works a devilish spell\\". Christine Brandel, writing for entertainment website PopMatters, particularly praised the episode's \\"beautifully done\\" dialogue, saying that \\"it feels authentic in its phrasing, even during the more bizarre (and hilarious) court scenes\\". Owen, similarly, said \\"the dialogue was also frequently hilarious, with Shearsmith and Pemberton having a fine ear for the rhythms of Olde English and how best to have characters deadpan their way through some ridiculous sentences.\\" Hawksley praised Warner's \\"effortlessly batty\\" performance as Sir Andrew Pike, and claimed that Sheen \\"brought an unsettling complexity\\" to the title character. Gerard Gilbert, of The Independent, claimed Warner was clearly \\"having a ball\\" as Pike, and Wright (The Guardian) said \\"Warner quite brilliantly makes the most of every line he's given\\". Brandel considered Warner one of the best guest stars of the series. ==References== Cited sources * ==External links== *\\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" at BBC Programmes *\\"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\\" at the British Comedy Guide * Category:2015 British television episodes Category:Inside No. 9 episodes Category:Television episodes about murder Category:Television episodes about witchcraft Category:Television episodes about dysfunctional families Category:Works set in the 17th century ","title":"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge"},{"id":"46366458","text":"Timothy Mather Cooley (March 13, 1772 – December 14, 1859) was an American pastor. He was son of William Cooley, and was born at East Granville, Massachusetts on March 13, 1772. At his graduation he delivered an oration in Hebrew, and he retained a familiar acquaintance with this tongue through life. He graduated from Yale University in 1792. While he was a senior, one of the Berkeley Scholarships was awarded to him, and after graduation he remained in New Haven, Connecticut one year as resident scholar, and engaged in teaching. He studied theology with Rev. Charles Backus of Somers, Connecticut, and in May 1795, he was licensed to preach. He preached a short time in his native town and in Salisbury, Connecticut. Receiving from both places a call to settle as pastor, he chose the smaller place with the smaller salary, and on February 3, 1796, he was ordained pastor of the church in East Granville. He continued to discharge in full the duties of this office, until 1854, when, having completed his 82nd year, was released from the charge of the pulpit, and a colleague was employed. He retained his activity until a fortnight before his death. In fulfilment of a promise exacted of him many years previous, a discourse was preached at his funeral by Rev. Dr. Sprague of Albany. This has since been published. (Albany, 1860, pp. 38, 8vo.) Soon after his settlement, Cooley opened a classical school in his own house, and continued it during most of his life. More than eight hundred youth have thus enjoyed the benefit of his personal tuition. He also superintended the studies of several young men preparing for the ministry. For 57 years he was an active and influential member of the board of trustees of Westfield Academy, and for 47 years he held the same relation to Williams College. Several of his sermons and addresses have been printed. The number of his publications, including his articles in the journals of the day, is not far from sixty. About twelve years ago, he prepared, with the assistance of Hon. James Cooley, a collection of the memoirs of all the members of the class of 1792, and in 1850 he presented the volume in manuscript to the Library of Yale College. He died in East Granville on December 14, 1859, aged 87. ==External links== * * http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Cooley%2C%20Timothy%20Mather%2C%201772-1859 Category:1772 births Category:1859 deaths Category:Yale University alumni Category:People from Granville, Massachusetts ","title":"Timothy Mather Cooley"},{"id":"46366466","text":"The 2015 Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team represented the University of Hawaii at Mānoa in the 2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

She first appeared in the eleventh series episode \\"Spin\\", broadcast on 22 September 2009. The character was introduced by Tony McHale. Between her arrival and January 2013, Mary Claire appeared on a recurring basis, sometimes with months between appearances, as an agency nurse on Keller and AAU wards. McGrady was promoted to a regular cast member in early 2013 by newly appointed executive producer, Oliver Kent - alongside the introductions of three characters. Her first appearance, as a regular cast member, aired on 23 April when Mary-Claire received a staff nurse job on the AAU ward. She is characterised as a blunt and easily distracted character, yet a brilliant nurse. Her strong point is not diplomacy, but scratch between the surface and you'll find a heart of gold. McGrady has described her as \\"cheeky, flirtatious, and trouble.\\" In 2013, whilst a recurring cast member, McGrady filmed the first series of The Fall and the following year, chose to film a second series. In order to film the new series, McGrady temporarily departed Holby City and scenes airing on 22 April 2014 showed Mary-Claire depart to look after her sick mother in Ireland. Just over four months later, on 7 October, Mary-Claire's return scenes aired. Her main storyline following her return was her on-off relationship with Harry Tressler (Jules Knight), which fans took a strong liking to. In the episode airing on 14 April 2015, Mary-Claire and Harry departed from the show for their new life in Chicago, America after being engaged. Knight's exit was announced in February, while McGrady's decision to leave the show was not announced prior to the premiere of the episode, but revealed she had planned to leave. ==Casting== McGrady became a fan of Holby City while she was in a relationship with fellow actor Jalaal Hartley, who played Tom O'Dowd in the show from 2008 to 2009. She thought that it would \\"a brilliant gig\\" if she was cast in a role. When the character of Mary-Claire came up, McGrady knew she had to have the part. ==Development== Characterisation Mary-Claire has been described as \\"cheeky, flirtatious and good fun, yet vulnerable.\\" Her independent side brings out an \\"determined and strong\\" nature. Executive producer, Oliver Kent said how Mary-Claire brought \\"charm, warmth and comedy\\" to the programme. McGrady has said how she shares some qualities with Mary- Claire, both being \\"gregarious, social and flirtatious\\" as well as \\"cheeky, lazy and naughty\\" McGrady also said how Mary-Claire needs to learn the true meaning of friendship. Departure In February 2015, McGrady's co-star Jules Knight (who plays Mary-Claire's love interest, Harry Tressler) announced his departure from the show. This left fans speculating whether the show planned to end the much-loved Harry and Mary-Claire's relationship. In the build-up to his exit, Mary-Claire had been offered as new job in Chicago by Colette Sheward (Louise Delamere) and Harry had been left facial disfigured following a fall from the hospital building. In scenes airing on 14 April 2015, Harry proposed to Mary-Claire in the back of an ambulance and when she accepted, they left for Chicago together. McGrady had left the series after five and a half years of playing Mary-Claire and to celebrate this a video was released on the Holby City website, reminding fans of the best bits from Harry and Mary-Claire. In an interview with Holby TV, McGrady spoke about her decision to leave the series, stating that she was \\"ready to go\\" and that she felt she had done \\"everything\\" she could do with the character. McGrady also revealed that show bosses waited until after she had returned from her break to write out both her and Knight's characters, commenting that it was a \\"good\\" decision and how \\"great\\" it was to see Mary-Claire and Harry develop prior to their exit. ==Reception== A reporter for the Daily Mirror stated \\"'Easily distracted' is a description that could have been invented for Mary-Claire Carter\\". A columnist for What's on TV commented, \\"Holby's Harry and Mary- Claire have been on and off more times than a light switch\\". ==References *Mary-Claire Carter at BBC Online * Mary-Claire Carter on IMDb Category:Holby City characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Fictional nurses Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Mary-Claire Carter"},{"id":"46366479","text":"William Hahne William Eric Viking Hahne (born April 19, 1992, Stockholm) is a Swedish politician who was the Deputy Chairman of the party Alternative for Sweden.

There are two known species: Bannana crassispina and B. parvula, both described in 2015. Individuals are pale yellow and unpatterned, and range from around 1.0 to 1.8 mm in body length, with females being slightly larger than males. The eyes are reduced or entirely absent. Known only from a nature reserve in Xishuangbanna, Bannana belongs to a group of Asian goblin spiders known as the \\"Dysderoides complex\\", that ranges from China to Pakistan and south to Indonesia. ==Description== Side view of female B. crassispina specimen showing sclerotized abdominal scutum. Scale bar=0.4 mm Species of Bannana are generally similar in overall appearance, although B. parvula is smaller. The body color is yellow, without pattern. Eyes are absent or highly reduced, visible only as remnants in B. crassispina. The cephalothorax or prosoma is broadly oval when viewed from above, and the abdomen or opisthosoma is somewhat oval-shaped, and rounded at the rear. A strongly hardened plate (scutum) covers the upper abdominal surface. B. crassipina males are around 1.5 mm in body length (tip of the cephalothorax to end of the abdomen), while females are slightly larger at 1.8 mm. B. parvula are smaller, with males and females measuring around 1.0 and 1.1 mm, respectively. In addition to size, male B. crassispina can be distinguished from male B. parvula by the presence of two large bristles (setae) on the palpal tibiae (the penultimate segments of the pedipalps) and two rows of setae on the sternum (the ventral portion of the cephalothorax). Females can be distinguished by a relatively smaller abdominal scutum in B. crassispina. ==Distribution and habitat== Bannana spiders are known from Menglun Nature Reserve, in Xishuangbanna's Mengla County, where they are found in leaf litter of tropical rainforest at elevations around above sea level. Specimens have been collected by pitfall trapping and by manually sorting through litter. ==Etymology== The genus name Bannana is derived from the last few letters of the word \\"Xishuangbanna\\". The specific name crassispina is derived from Latin crassus (\\"thick\\") and spinus (\\"bristle\\"), referring to two thick bristles on the tibiae of male pedipalps, while the specific name parvula, from Latin parvus (\\"small\\"), refers to the smaller size of this species. Both species, as well as the genus, were named in 2015 by Chinese biologists Yanfeng Tong and Shuqiang Li. ==Classification== Bannana spiders are in the family Oonopidae, a large family of spiders with over 1,500 species worldwide. Within the Oonopidae, Bannana is placed in a lineage called the \\"Dysderoides complex\\", which also contains the genera Dysderoides, Himalayana, and Trilacuna, and spans a large part of Asia from Pakistan to China and south to Sumatra. The \\"Dysderoides complex\\" is united by shared similarities of the mouth parts and male reproductive structures. Morphologically, Bannana is very similar to Dysderoides, which also has reduced eyes. ==References== Category:Oonopidae Category:Spiders of China Category:Endemic fauna of Yunnan Category:Araneomorphae genera Category:Taxa described in 2015 ","title":"Bannana"},{"id":"46366537","text":"Oebares was a Persian officer of Cyrus the Great (fl. c. 6th century BCR Waterfield - The Expedition of Cyrus (p.xxvii) Oxford University Press, 8 Sep 2005 [Retrieved 2015-0409]).

It was an extremely bright burst that was successfully localized to supernova remnant N49 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This event is now interpreted as a magnetar giant flare, more related to SGR flares than \\"true\\" gamma-ray bursts. It is the first observed SGR megaflare, a specific type of short GRB. It has been associated with the magnetar PSR B0525-66. ==The event== On 5 March 1979, Soviet spacecraft Venera 11 and Venera 12, then drifting through the Solar System, were hit by a blast of gamma radiation at approximately 10:51 EST. This contact raised the radiation readings on both the probes from a normal 100 counts per second to over 200,000 counts a second, in only a fraction of a millisecond.Kouveliotou, C.; Duncan, R. C.; Thompson, C. (February 2003). \\"Magnetars \\". Scientific American; Page 35. This burst of gamma rays quickly continued to spread. Eleven seconds later, Helios 2, a NASA probe, which was in orbit around the Sun, was saturated by the blast of radiation. It soon hit Venus, and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter's detectors were overcome by the wave. Seconds later, Earth received the wave of radiation, where the powerful output of gamma rays inundated the detectors of three U.S. Department of Defense Vela satellites, the Soviet Prognoz 7 satellite, and the Einstein Observatory. Just before the wave exited the Solar System, the blast also hit the International Sun-Earth Explorer. This extremely powerful blast of gamma radiation constituted the strongest wave of extra-solar gamma rays ever detected; it was over 100 times more intense than any known previous extra-solar burst. Because gamma rays travel at the speed of light and the time of the pulse was recorded by several distant spacecraft as well as on Earth, the source of the gamma radiation could be calculated to an accuracy of about 2 arcseconds. The direction of the source corresponded with the remnants of a star that had gone supernova around 3000 B.C.E.Kouveliotou, C.; Duncan, R. C.; Thompson, C. (February 2003). \\"Magnetars \\".

It is part of the subregion of Eastern Antioquia. La Ceja borders the Rionegro and Carmen de Viboral municipalities to the north, La Unión to the east, and Montebello and Retiro to the west. It is located approximately 41 kilometers from Medellín, one of the main cities of the department. The town is known for being well-connected with other towns and municipalities in Antioquia through its extensive roads and highways, including the Medellin-Bogota highway, the Las Palmas roads, and the Medellín Santa Elena road. It also has a dirt road that leads to the Mesopotamia neighborhood of La Unión. Father Germán Montoya wrote the hymn for the town, called \\"Hymn of La Ceja del Tambo\\". Donato Duque Patiño created the flag. ==History== The territory today known as \\"La Ceja\\" was first inhabited by the Tahamíes. Tahamíes is an indigenous people dedicated to agriculture, specifically the cultivation of maize. By 1541 the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the town, led by Álvaro de Mendoza, deputy to Marshal Jorge Robledo. On arrival to this region, Mendoza discovered a vast and fertile valley full of green meadows furrowed by abundant and clean water. He called it the \\"Valley of Santamaría\\", which today is known as the \\"Valley of La Ceja del Tambo\\". Since the early 17th century, many people from Antioquia, especially residents of Medellín and Santa Fe de Antioquia, moved to the area due to its natural attractions and fertile land suitable for agricultural industry and livestock. In 1683, a path was cleared between San Nicolás de Rionegro and Santiago de Arma, which in turn led to Popayán. The locals built a shelter, or \\"tambo\\" to the side of this route, which originated the subsequent naming of this town as \\"La Ceja del Tambo\\". The town was founded as \\"La Ceja\\" on 7 December 1789. It was founded by María Josefa Marulanda Londoño and Father José Pablo de Villa. By 1824, the town had 2,012 inhabitants, of which 98 were slaves. La Ceja was elevated to the status of municipality in 1855. In 1905, the first studies for the installation of an aqueduct were made and in 1927 came into operation the first aqueduct and sewerage systems. ==Demography== Total population: 48,879 inhabitants (2009)Proyecciones de Población Municipales por área * Urban population: 41,587 * Rural population: 7,292 Ethnography According to figures presented by DANE census in 2005, the ethnic makeup of the township is the following:Censo oficial DANE 2005, Perfiles Departamentos y Municipios * Mestizo & White: 92.1% * Afro- Colombian: 7.9% ==Economy== Unlike other towns in eastern Antioquia that focus on mining, La Ceja has traditionally been a town of agriculture and raising livestock. The main agricultural products of the Municipality are tamarillo, bananas, blackberries, caturro and coffee, and other fruits and vegetables. Traditionally, dairy farming has been a very important part of the economy. Currently about 70,000 litres of milk per day are produced in the region. To the north of the city, there are many cut flower growers and exporters, which provide the main source of employment for La Ceja's inhabitants. The majority of the production from these flower farms is exported to the United States. The main flower varieties in production are chrysanthemums, hydrangeas, gerberas, and asters. ==Places of interest== Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Carmen The town has more than a thousand commercial establishments: restaurants, cafes, bars, entertainment centers, newsstands, clothing stores, Internet cafes, drugstores, supermarkets, hotels, shops, travel agencies and leases, health centers, schools, and more.

The cause of death was determined to be high levels of sodium leading to swelling in his brain. ==Murder case== After his death, Garnett's mother, Lacey Spears, was charged with second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter of her 5-year-old son. On March 2, 2015, a jury found Spears guilty of murdering her son by poisoning him with table salt, which she had administered to him from infancy through his feeding tube. On April 8, 2015, a judge sentenced Spears to 20 years to life in prison for the death of her son. The judge in the case, Robert Neary, acknowledged that Lacey Spears suffers from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and therefore did not sentence her to the maximum of 25 years in prison before parole eligibility. Her murder conviction was upheld in state appellate court and the state's highest court declined to review her conviction. She is imprisoned at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women. ==Lacey Spears== Lacey Spears was born and raised in Decatur, Alabama. Lonely as a single mother and desperate for attention, Lacey constantly posted on social media about her son's health struggles, even going so far as to start a blog devoted to chronicling her search for a cure for whatever illnesses plagued him. Telling friends she wanted to leave Alabama, Lacey moved with Garnett to Florida to live with her maternal grandmother, Peggy. While there, Lacey became friendly with Kim, a neighbor. Lacey confided in Kim that her father had raped her and Garnett was the product of said assault. Eventually, she moved with her son to the town of Chestnut Ridge, New York, 14 months prior to Garnett's death. In New York, Lacey and Garnett lived in a community called The Fellowship for elderly and disabled people. In explaining her son's paternity, she created a fictional character, police officer Blake, who died in a car accident, to be Garnett's father.

Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force DIG Kantha Rao said that the smugglers attacked the team with sickles, rods and axes. Asked if the attack could have been quelled without such fatalities, Rao said, \\"We gave them several warnings but they did not stop attacking us. There were over a hundred of them.\\" Asked how many of his men were grievously injured, he said, \\"Nobody is seriously hurt from our side. Their superior training saved their lives.\\" Human rights activists did not believe the police version of the shootings. They say some of the bodies had burn marks and others had bullet injuries in the chest and head. Witnesses said that some of those killed were pulled off a bus by the policemen. == Incident == The incident occurred at two places Eetagunta and Vachindou Banda in Seshachalam forest area of Chandragiri mandal in Chittoor. Nine labourers were killed in Eetagunta, eleven in Vachindou Banda. As per Andhra Pradesh Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) R. P. Thakur, \\"Police had received information that a large number of smugglers were on the prowl in the forest. Teams of Red Sanders Task Force laid ambush at two places. The Task Force consisted of forest officials and armed reserve policemen too. When our teams asked them to surrender, the smugglers retaliated by hurling stones and they were armed with sickles and axes. When the task force opened fire, twenty of them were killed but many escaped. The smugglers were carrying red-sandalwood logs.\\" According to reports, nearly 500 coolies, hired by a red sanders smuggler belonging to Chittoor district were felling the trees when the police fired on them. The accounts of two witnesses given before the National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC) say \\"at least 12 of those shot dead were pulled off a bus by Andhra policemen and arrested hours before the controversial encounter\\". == Investigation == The post-mortem team of five doctors at the Venkateswara Ramnarain Ruia Government Hospital, however, said the men \\"were shot at close range\\". On 10 April 2015, Hyderabad High Court ordered the Andhra Pradesh government to register a case of murder for the killing of 20 alleged red sandalwood smugglers. \\"Why should not a case of unnatural death under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code be filed?\\" the court asked.Chittoor killings: Hyderabad High Court asks Andhra govt why no case for unnatural death of 20 'smugglers' A fact-finding team led by the Coordination of Democratic Rights Organisation (CDRO), after visiting the spot on 11 April 2015, maintained that there were several inconsistencies in the version put forward by officials and termed the killing of 20 red sanders coolies as a 'fake encounter' and sought a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the issue. \\"There were no visible signs of conflict at the location. The distance between bodies of coolies is less than 10 feet and blood marks were not found elsewhere. It is surprising that there were no injuries, when the task force men have opened fire on a group of 150 coolies,\\" they said. Three men, who survived the alleged 'encounter' testified to the NHRC on how their friends and family members were wrongly detained and later shot dead. An eight-member fact- finding team found instances where the bodies of some victims in the encounter were brutally disfigured and tortured. One of the members of this team and former member of NHRC, Satyabrata Pal, said that he has seen hundreds of cases while serving as a member in the NHRC for five years but rarely had he come across as brutal and as inhuman an act as the killings. Many members found this encounter is fake because it does not have any encounter signs. On 17 April, Hyderabad High Court ordered the re-postmortem of five more victims and Saikumar of the alleged encounter, it also directed the Osmania Medical College principal to form a team of not less than three doctors to conduct the postmortems in Tamil Nadu. National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) vice chairperson Ravi Thakur, visited the site, with forest department officials, where the 20 Tamil Nadu woodcutters were shot dead, and expressed dissatisfaction over the failure of officials in explaining the reason behind the massacre. The NHRC decided to send its team for investigation where killing happened and favoured a judicial enquiry by Andhra Pradesh Government into firing incident The Hyderabad High Court had directed the Andhra Pradesh Police to furnish the case diary before the court, relating to the case registered in connection with the killing of the 20 people in police firing. Expressing dissatisfaction over the case diary that was produced by the investigating officer to the court, it ordered Special Investigation Team(SIT) to be constituted to probe the killing and wants SIT to complete its investigation in 60 days and submit a report to the court. K. Kranthi Chaitanya, State executive member of the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee (APCLC) stated that \\"We have always maintained that it was a fake encounter and that the workers were brought to the spot and killed. The forensic report, call data records, SIT report, etc. all prove our stand,\\". == Reaction == O. Panneerselvam, the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister in a letter to the Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, called for a probe to fix responsibility for possible human rights violations. \\"Many of these persons are reportedly from Tiruvannamalai and Vellore districts of Tamil Nadu. While it is possible that these persons may have been engaged in illegal activities, the occurrence of such high casualties in the operation raises concerns whether the (AP) Task Force personnel acted with adequate restraint.\\" The Andhra Pradesh government has been ordered by the Hyderabad High Court to file a case that murder of 20 alleged red sandalwood smugglers. The incident exposed as an extrajudicial killing since an eyewitness claim that some of them were taken off from a bus and killed. It is mentioned that no security personnel was killed or injured that deny the police interview. The killings sparked uproar in the victims' home state of Tamil Nadu. It brought protest outside Tamil Nadu among activists. They mentioned that the bodies had burn marks and bullet holes that implied that the men were shot at a close range. The People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) condemned the shootings and termed it a massacre. It also demanded the immediate registration of a FIR under charges of 'murder' and 'conspiracy to murder' against the officials who were responsible. == See also == * 2009 Chitrakoot Shootout * List of cases of police brutality in India == References  External links == * India red sandalwood: Questions over 'smuggler' killings * Killing of Red Sanders Smugglers in Andhra Pradesh: Were They Woodcutters, Killed in 'Fake' Encounter?

All 39 seats in the Parliament were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in 12 other autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. ==Overview== Electoral system The Parliament of Cantabria was the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Cantabria, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Cantabrian Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a President of the Autonomous Community. Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in Cantabria and in full enjoyment of their political rights. The 39 members of the Parliament of Cantabria were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 5 percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. The electoral law provided that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electors registered in Cantabria. Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called. Election date The term of the Parliament of Cantabria expired four years after the date of its previous election. Elections to the Parliament were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 25 May 2003, setting the election date for the Parliament on Sunday, 27 May 2007. The President of the Autonomous Community had the prerogative to dissolve the Parliament of Cantabria and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no nationwide election was due and some time requirements were met: namely, that dissolution did not occur either during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year has elapsed since a previous dissolution. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Parliament was to be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called. Any snap election held as a result of these circumstances would not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remained of their four-year terms. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 20 seats were required for an absolute majority in the Parliament of Cantabria. ; { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" !

The film is a remake of the 2010 German film, Vincent Wants to Sea. The film premiered at the 2014 Los Angeles Film Festival and was picked up by Well Go USA Entertainment and given a theatrical release in April 2015. ==Plot== After his mother's death, Vincent (Robert Sheehan), a teenager with Tourette syndrome, is enrolled in a behavioural facility by his father. While there he rooms with Alex (Dev Patel), a Briton with obsessive compulsive disorder, and meets Marie (Zoë Kravitz) who is in recovery for an eating disorder. After a child films Vincent with his cellphone and Vincent attacks him, he and Marie are called into the office of Mia Rose, a doctor, where she chastises them and Marie steals her car keys. When Alex discovers Marie and Vincent running away in the middle of the night, he attempts to warn Rose and is kidnapped by them. The three of them head towards the ocean where Vincent hopes to scatter his mother's ashes. However Vincent does not remember the exact location of the beachside trip he and his mother made years ago. The trio finally settle on Santa Cruz as their destination. Rose informs Vincent's father, Robert, that his son has gone missing and rather than allow the police to apprehend them, she and Robert attempt to track them down. Along the way Marie and Vincent develop a crush on each other. When they finally reach the ocean Marie collapses before they can reach the water. Marie is hospitalized and while there, the three are reunited with Rose and Robert. Marie, who is being force fed and has been restrained asks Vincent to run away with her but Vincent refuses. Instead he has a conversation with his father, who apologizes for treating him poorly and decides to stay in Santa Cruz so he can be near Marie. Rather than leave with Rose, Alex decides to stay with him. ==Cast== * Robert Sheehan as Vincent * Dev Patel as Alex * Zoë Kravitz as Marie * Robert Patrick as Robert * Kyra Sedgwick as Mia Rose ==Development== Wells was inspired to remake the movie based only on the trailer for Vincent Wants to Sea. She also stated that she was compelled to make the movie due to her own history of disordered eating. Zoë Kravitz dropped to 90 pounds for the film and explained she had been drawn to the role due to her own struggles with anorexia. ==Reception== Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 45% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 5.04/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The Hollywood Reporter praised all three of the lead actors but criticized the \\"formulaic nature of the piece.\\" Similarly, Variety had positive words for the \\"bristling and committed performances by Robert Sheehan, Dev Patel and Zoe Kravitz\\" while noting that \\"there remains a nagging tidiness to the whole endeavor that leaves a strained, cloying aftertaste\\" that kept the movie from truly succeeding. ==References* Category:2014 films Category:2010s road comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American road comedy-drama films Category:American remakes of German films Category:Films about mental disability Category:Films about eating disorders Category:Works about Tourette syndrome Category:Obsessive–compulsive disorder in fiction Category:Films scored by the Newton Brothers Category:2014 directorial debut films Category:2014 comedy films Category:2014 drama films ","title":"The Road Within"},{"id":"46367019","text":"Thomas Kimberly Brace (October 16, 1779 – June 14, 1860) was an American insurance executive and politician.

It is located in the eastern side of the main square of La Ceja, Colombia, and belongs to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Sonsón-Rionegro. The chapel contains the remains of some prominent Colombian people, such as the poet Gregorio Gutiérrez González and his wife Julia de Isaza, former President Juan de Dios Aranzazu, the first president of Colombia from Antioquia, and political and business leader José María Bernal. The building has a colonial style, with a singular rectangular nave. It houses a collection of paintings of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, among which include works by the Colombian master Gregorio Vasquez de Arce y Ceballos. For that reason, in 1968, Monsignor Alfonso Uribe Jaramillo, bishop of Sonsón-Rionegro, declared the church a \\"Temple Museum of Religious Art\\". On November 2, 1995, the national government also declared it a National Monument of Colombia. ==History== In 1820, construction of the chapel began on land donated by María Josefa Marulanda. The project was financed by Bárbara Villegas, whose family was devoted to the Virgin Mary of Chiquinquirá. This chapel replaced one that was built in El Hato in the 18th century, which was dedicated to La Chinca and was demolished in 1792. Goods that belonged to the chapels of El Burro, El Hato and Chaparral were brought to this chapel for its endowment. The bishops of Antioquia, Fray Mariano Garnica y Orjuela, during his first pastoral visit to La Ceja in 1829, ordered that all be moved to the parish church built by Father Mateo Cardona. As a result, the chapel was dismantled and abandoned. In 1853, due to the expansion of the church of Our Lady of Carmen, worship returned to the chapel for five years. ==References== Category:National Monuments of Colombia Category:Churches in Colombia ","title":"Chapel of Our Lady of Chiquinquirá"},{"id":"46367066","text":"The Hay Standard was an English language newspaper published in Hay, New South Wales, from 1871 to 1900. It was the first newspaper published at Hay. The initial full title of the newspaper was The Hay Standard and Advertiser for Balranald, Wentworth, Maude, Booligal, Wilcannia, Menindie, Bourke, &c.;, reflecting its wide catchment area incorporating townships and districts in a broad arc to the north and west of Hay on the Murrumbidgee, Lachlan and Darling rivers. ==History== The first issue of The Hay Standard was on 9 August 1871. The earliest extant issue is No. 13, published on 1 November 1871. The newspaper was initially published every Wednesday and could be subscribed to for 7s 6d each quarter (postage added). It contained agricultural information, news and advertisements for goods and services in the area. The newspaper included correspondents’ reports from outlying districts.The Hay Standard, 1 November 1871, The first publisher of The Hay Standard was John Andrew (1828 - 1902) who printed and edited the newspaper for the proprietors D. G. Jones and Co., owners of The Pastoral Times newspaper in nearby Deniliquin (of which Andrew had been the publisher for the previous eight years ). Caroline Levinia Jones was proprietor for four years after her husband died in 1876. In the early years of its existence the office of The Hay Standard was located at the Government Wharf at Hay. John Andrew was replaced by Frederick Jellieffe Steane in June 1873 when Andrew briefly left Hay. John Andrew returned by the end of that year to start The Riverine Grazier newspaper at Hay in opposition to The Hay Standard.Obituary – John Andrew [Riverine Grazier, 7 March 1902, 2(4)]. By January 1880 Frederick Steane had moved the Standard to an office in Lachlan Street. In May 1881 Steane was replaced by Richard Chambers as publisher. By January 1890 the newspaper was being published twice weekly, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and the name had been shortened to The Hay Standard. Richard Chambers continued as publisher until October 1900 when he was replaced by John Andrew (the founding publisher in the early 1870s), who renamed the paper The Hay Standard, Riverina Times and Journal of Water Conservation and relocated the office to Alma Street. The last issue of The Hay Standard was published on Wednesday, 28 November 1900; the very next day John Andrew published the first issue of a new newspaper, with the re-arranged title Riverina Times, Hay Standard and Journal of Water Conservation. Even though this newspaper carried the main title of Riverina Times, Andrew obviously considered it a continuation of the newspaper he had started in 1871 as the new publication carried a banner reading \\"Thirtieth Year of Publication\\".Riverina Times, Hay Standard and Journal of Water Conservation, 29 November 1900, page 1, ==Digitisation== Extant issues of the newspaper have been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program project hosted by the National Library of Australia. ==See also== * List of newspapers in New South Wales * List of newspapers in Australia ==References * ==Bibliography== * Holden, W Sprague 1961, Australia goes to press, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne. * Mayer, Henry 1964, The press in Australia, Lansdowne Press, Melbourne. * Walker, R B 1976, The newspaper press in New South Wales 1803-1920, Sydney University Press, Sydney.

This causes them to get angry at him so he must try to make it up to them by turning the island into a perfect vacation spot. ==Reception== Critical reception has been mixed. Gamezebo reviewed the game and wrote \\"Much of Minions Paradise will seem familiar to anyone who’s played other free city/town/base/resort building games before. You stock up on money, resources, and premium currency in order to build fancier things and expand your territory so that you can stock up on even more money, resources, and premium currency. But beneath the simple setup is a game that’s honestly kind of refreshing in its approach to free-to-play.\\" Forbes criticized Minions Paradise in a review about Star Wars: Battlefront, where they called it a \\"familiar and formulaic phone and tablet game built around timers, tapped icons, and insidious invitations to skip forward in a build queue by buying fake currency in bundles that cost anywhere from $2.99 to $99.99\\" and wrote that \\"The imposed bottle necks on upgrades and item acquisition makes tapping both incessant and detached from any dramatic significance, something that feeds a recursive loop of player presence.\\" Apple'N'Apps gave Minions Paradise a score of 3.5, praising it for its mini- games, theme and flow of quests and objectives while also criticizing it for being too similar to other freemium simulation games. ==References * Category:2015 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Casual games Category:City-building games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:IOS games Category:Video games based on films Category:Despicable Me (franchise) Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Minions Paradise"},{"id":"46367228","text":"Krëban or Krëbans may refer to: *Krëbans (Kashubian: Krëbanë, ), an ethnic subgroup of Kashubians *Krëbane (\\"Krebans\\"), a Kashubian folkloric ensemble and a socio-cultural association with the same name * Krëban z Milachòwa, pen name of Stanisław Pestka ","title":"Krëban"},{"id":"46367266","text":"Esmé is a French given name.

Bryer and D. Winfield, The Byzantine Monuments and Topography of the Pontos, pp.300 and court official of the Empire of Trebizond in the early 14th century. He served as protonotarios and protovestiarios for Emperor Alexios II, which made him effectively Alexios' prime minister.N. Oikonomides, \\"The Chancery of the Grand Komnenoi: Imperial Tradition and Political Reality\\", Archeion Pontou, 35 (1979), pp. 312f == Life == The date of Loukites' birth is not known, although a marginal note states he came from Macedonia. He received his education in Constantinople; his teachers included Theodore Hyrtakenos. By 1301 he had arrived in Trebizond, for in November of that year he escorted emperor Alexios II in the campaign against the \\"Amitiotai\\", Turkomans from Diyarbakır (Amida), who had penetrated deep into Trebizond's territory to sack Kerasous (modern Giresun), the second most important city of the Empire. One important relationship Loukites developed while living in Trebizond was with the astronomer Gregory Choniades: of Choniades' 16 surviving letters, four were to Loukites. Two surviving manuscripts, one a copy of the Iliad (Ambros. I 58 sup.) the other a copy of Thucydides (Vatican. Ottob. gr. 211), that had been part of Choniades' library, also bear Loukites' bookplates.L. G. Westerink, \\"La profession de foi de Grégoire Chioniadès\\", Revue des études byzantines, 38, (1980), pp. 235f Loukites maintained a high position in the Imperial court into the reign of Emperor Basil; the latest evidence that he was still alive is a letter Nikephoros Gregoras wrote to him, dated between 1335 and 1340. His funerary inscription is reportedly in the Hagia Sophia of Trebizond, on the eastern side of the church in the arch behind the sanctum. == Writings == Two of his works have survived: * An encomium to Saint Eugenios the patron saint of Trebizond, whose cult had been promoted during the rule of the Grand Komnenoi. * A funeral oration for Alexios II Komnenos, which Loukites delivered nine days after Alexios' death on 3 May 1330. In that speech, Loukites mentions all but two of the ancestors of Alexios II, asking them to accept the late emperor among their ranks; the order and selection has led some writers to believe he was describing a series of portraits painted on the walls of the hall where Loukites delivered the oration.Oikonomides, \\"The Chancery\\", pp. 322-324; Rosenqvist, J.O., \\"Three Trapezuntine Notes\\", Byzantinoslavica, 54 (1993), pp. 294-299 Athanasios Papadopoulos-Kerameus published an edition of this work in his Analekta Hierosolymitikes Stachyologias (St. Petersburg, 1891). == References  External links == * Vathi Theodora, \\"Constantine Loukites\\", Encyclopaedia of the Hellenic World, Asia Minor Category:14th-century Byzantine people Category:People of the Empire of Trebizond Category:Byzantine letter writers Category:13th-century births Category:14th-century deaths Category:Greek Macedonians Category:Byzantine poets ","title":"Constantine Loukites"},{"id":"46367323","text":"The Sisterhood of Night is a 2014 American mystery thriller film directed by Caryn Waechter from a screenplay by Marilyn Fu, based on a 1994 short story by Steven Millhauser. The film premiered at the 2014 Woodstock Film Festival. It was released in select theaters and through video on demand on April 10, 2015, by Freestyle Releasing. ==Plot== The story begins in Kingston, New York where Emily Parris (Kara Hayward) decides to get back at classmate, Mary Warren (Georgie Henley), for ruining her school play audition. While Mary holds her audition, Emily steals her phone and publishes all of Mary's texts on her blog. Mary retaliates by calling Emily a \\"blog whore\\" in front of the whole school, which lands both girls a meeting with the guidance counselor, Gordy Gambhir (Kal Penn), in his office. Later that night, Mary writes on Facebook that she will be taking a \\"vow of silence\\" and deletes her social media accounts. She forms the idea to create a \\"Sisterhood\\", and recruits classmates Catherine Huang (Willa Cuthrell) and Lavinia Hall (Olivia DeJonge) as its first members. Together, the three girls venture into the forest at night, beginning their ritual. By the following school year, the Sisterhood has become common knowledge among school and all girls wish to join. However, no one knows what the group ritual is due to a vow of silence each member takes. New members are chosen by Mary and given a paper square as an invite. Emily, upset about being rejected, follows the girls into the woods and hides as the group ritual begins. While snapping a photo, she gets spotted by Mary. The scene cuts to her in her bedroom, posting a new blog post. The post describes how she heard the girls chant dirty things, perform sexual acts on each other, and claims they cut her hand with a knife before molesting her. Later, Emily runs into Mary during Mass at church and makes a scene in front of everyone before fainting. However, Mary simply declares she will never be in the Sisterhood. Mary, Catherine, Lavinia, and the rest of the Sisterhood uphold their vow of silence when parents, teachers, and reporters ask about the Sisterhood activities. Lavinia's mother, Rose, searches Lavinia's room and discovers a doll with a pentagram-like symbol drawn on it. After Lavinia returns home, she is confronted by her mother, who finds the same symbol tattooed on her stomach. Two more girls come forward and claim the Sisterhood girls molested them as well, causing more public hysteria. Emily and the two girls come up with a plan to get the fragile Lavinia to make a confession about the Sisterhood. The same night, Mary finds herself alone while trying to avoid being caught for skipping curfew. She goes to see her boyfriend, Jeff, but he refuses to talk to her. She goes to Gambhir's house to confide in him, unaware they are being observed by Sue Parris (Jessica Hecht), Emily's mother. She snaps a picture of them and, assuming they're in a sexual relationship, sends the photo out. Mary spends the night on his couch before being awoken by her mother the following morning, who saw the photo. Gambhir is fired from his teaching job, even after he and Mary insist nothing inappropriate happened. Feeling that things are spinning out of control, Catherine and Lavinia try to convince Mary to tell everyone the truth of the Sisterhood, but Mary promises that she'll fix it. At a small press conference, Mary tries to talk to parents and reporters to dispel the situation. Despite her efforts, Mary is unable to settle the scandal as Gambhir defends the girls. Mary fashions the now- infamous Sisterhood paper square and gives it to Gambhir, inviting him to see their ritual. After getting Rose to come with him, they watch as the girls stand in a circle around a fire, share their personal thoughts out loud before burning pieces of paper with their written secrets. Through a montage of Sisterhood meetings, Catherine and Mary reveal their biggest secrets; Catherine misses her mother (who is implied to have cancer and getting treatment) and wishes she would die or get better, Mary wants to lose her virginity to someone she loves and Lavinia fears never being kissed. Emily, invited to speak on a radio show about sexual abuse, begins to feel guilt and decides to pull out of her plan to ambush Lavinia with her two friends. The two girls are dismayed, deciding to go ahead with the plan without her. Emily tries to warn Lavinia, but it's too late. Lavinia has been lured into the woods by Travis, a boy she has a crush on. In the woods, Travis convinces her to take her shirt off, and she is ambushed by Emily's friends. While filming her, they hold her down while putting a witch hat on her, force her to say the Sisterhood girls are witches, and make her touch herself. They upload the video to the Internet, drug Lavinia, and take her to a Halloween party. At the party, they spread the video around while calling Lavinia cruel names. A now emotionally broken Lavinia commits suicide by overdosing on her mother's pills. During Lavinia's funeral, Mary, knowing Lavinia's last wish was to be kissed, asks Jeff to do so out of respect. A distraught Emily confesses that she made the whole thing up. She admits how she wanted to be in the Sisterhood so badly, she was outraged when Mary rejected her and lied about their activities as revenge. She then begs for forgiveness. Emily, whose blog is revealed to be a hoax, is persecuted by those who hate her for the damage she caused. However, others focus on how she still helped sexual abuse victims despite the false pretense that made her blog popular. Catherine shaves off her hair and finally visits her sick mother while Mary and Jeff reconcile their differences. She and Catherine decide to do a dance they had prepared for school, choreographed to Lavinia's original music, and proceed to dance through town in Lavinia's memory as local residents watch them. Emily stands nearby and Mary approaches her, giving her the Sisterhood paper square and inviting her to join their dance. Emily happily accepts and the Sisterhood girls dance down the streets of Kingston and into the woods. The movie ends with a narrative about how the Sisterhood will continue to be a secret to outsiders and the secret will be passed down to new members and soon disappear into the darkness. ==CastReception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 6.55/10 On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Many critics highlighted Georgie Henley's performance in the film, commenting that she has come a long way from her role as Lucy Pevensie in The Chronicles of Narnia. Inkoo Kang of TheWrap wrote in her review that \\"there's no dethroning Henley as the film's queen bee, with the Chronicles of Narnia actress doing a pretty good impersonation of Foxfire-era Angelina Jolie: sexy but open-faced, curious but scheming, intimidating but inviting.\\" ==References * Category:2014 films Category:2014 independent films Category:2014 thriller drama films Category:2010s mystery drama films Category:2010s mystery thriller films Category:2010s teen drama films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American mystery drama films Category:American mystery thriller films Category:American teen drama films Category:American thriller drama films Category:Films about bullying Category:Films about social media Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Teen mystery films Category:Teen thriller films ","title":"The Sisterhood of Night"},{"id":"46367325","text":"The Burano is a river in the Umbria and Marche regions of Italy.

He was born August 13, 1904, in Farrell, PA, and died May 23, 1979, at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, CA, due to cardiovascular disease at the age of 74. Caldwell and his wife, Ruth, were married September 2, 1934, in Toledo, OH, in a ceremony performed by Ruth's father, the Reverend B. T. Burnworth. Their son, Stanley Russell Caldwell, was born in Wooster, OH, where Caldwell was teaching in the high school before the family moved to southern California. Their daughter, Ruth, taught for many years at Luther College (Decorah, IA). == Education == Caldwell received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hiram College (OH) in 1927. While at Hiram, he was involved in the Delphic Literary Society, Pi Kappa Delta Debate Society, and the Men's Self-Government Society. He taught at Wooster (OH) High School from 1930 to 1944. Caldwell received his Master of Arts and Ph.D. degrees in History from the University of Southern California (USC) in 1933 and 1948, respectively. His Master's thesis was titled An Historical Study of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux as Persecutor of Abelard; his doctoral dissertation was on The Influence of the Federal Bar Upon the Interpretation of the Constitution Under John Marshall. == Academic career == Caldwell joined the USC faculty in 1945 as a member of the Department of History specializing in Early American History, American Intellectual-Cultural History, and European-American Relations. In 1946, he also became Chair of the Department of General Studies in American Civilization and Institutions. His honorary and professional organization memberships included: The American Historical Society; the Mississippi Valley Historical Association; Phi Kappa Phi (all-university national scholarship society); Phi Alpha Theta (national history honor society); Pi Kappa Delta (national speech and debate honor society); Tau Kappa Alpha (national honor society in journalism and mass communications); and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). While on the USC faculty, Caldwell served as secretary and later president of the local chapter of the AAUP; president of what was renamed the Faculty Center after he successfully pressed for the merger of the Men's Faculty Club and the Women's Faculty Club; member of the University Faculty Senate; member of the University Committee on Directed Teaching; and faculty sponsor for numerous student organizations. He also served as president of the USC Retired Faculty Association in 1978–1979. He initiated and taught history classes in Europe during summer sessions. These courses combined travel with the study of European history and included interviews with leading European personalities involved in national and international affairs. (SOURCE: USC News Bureau, n.d.; from the USC University Archives). After formally retiring from USC, he was invited to create an institute for the study of U.S. presidential history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, but he declined and taught courses part-time on journalism, law, and government at USC until his death. Among numerous students that he mentored, one, Carole Shammas, now holds a chair in the Department of History at USC. His students also included football star Frank Gifford, who recalled his girlfriend urging him to take Caldwell's course \\"Man and Civilization.\\" == Political Activism == During the 1950s, Caldwell was an outspoken critic of the U.S. House of Representatives Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC) and of Senator Joseph McCarthy and his pursuit of alleged Communists through the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He was shunned by many of his USC colleagues as well as by many USC alumni, publicly rebuked by USC President Fred D. Fagg, Jr., and had his classes infiltrated by California un-American activities committee investigators (Eisley, Cindy. 1974. \\"Russell Caldwell: Up Against the World,\\" Campus [U.C. Santa Barbara] (October 23): 1–3). He also was able to force the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to rehire several of its faculty who had been terminated for their supposed political beliefs. He was publicly labelled a Communist on television in a broadcast of the Freedom Forum. In 1955, Caldwell organized a petition drive, signed by 135 of his USC faculty colleagues as well as ministers who were members of the Southern California Baptist Ministers Union, protesting the selection of Texas Governor Robert Allan Shivers (1949–1957) as USC Commencement speaker at the graduation ceremonies. In 1954, Shivers had been an outspoken critic of the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (KS) U.S. Supreme Court decision (347 U.S. 483). The petition to cancel the appearance of Gov. Shivers was rejected by USC President Fagg. There was speculation that these faculty protestors would stage an organized demonstration at the commencement ceremonies, but this did not take place. == Community Involvement == Caldwell and his family lived in the neighborhood just north of the USC University Park Campus at 825 West 32nd Street. The location is at the current intersection of University Avenue and West 32nd Street on land now occupied by Troy (Residence) Hall and across the street from the 32nd Street USC Magnet School. Caldwell wrote and narrated 65 radio programs on American history for the Storer Broadcasting Co. of Miami and KGBS Los Angeles. In 1959, Caldwell became active in the Hoover Urban Renewal Project. He was appointed by the Mayor of Los Angeles as secretary of the Hoover Urban Renewal Advisory Committee (HURAC). Later he was named to the Mayor's Committee of Consultants on Urban Renewal. Caldwell also organized unsuccessful neighborhood efforts to block construction of the Harbor Freeway (US 110) just east of the University Park Campus. Freeway construction required demolition of much low-income housing throughout South Los Angeles. In June 1971, Caldwell received a commendatory resolution from the Los Angeles City Council. The commendation was presented by Councilmember Pat Russell, herself a long-time advocate on behalf of residents threatened with displacement by urban renewal. Caldwell served as president of the Board of Trustees of the West Adams Presbyterian Church, located just a few blocks north of the University Park Campus, which he and his family attended. == Awards == Caldwell and his high school debate team received the Lowell Thomas Award for Outstanding Achievement in Oratory in 1940. In that same year, Caldwell received the Bruno E. Jacob Commendation for his Wooster High School accomplishments in National Forensic League competitions. A Russell L. Caldwell Memorial Research Award was established at Hiram College in 1983. Funded by gifts from Caldwell's former speech students at Wooster High School, it is awarded in alternating years to students in the Departments of History and of Speech Communications to enhance their creativity and independent research during their final year in college. The fundraising campaign was spearheaded by 1942 Wooster High School graduate Dr. William R. Miner (B.A., Hiram College, 1945; M.S.W., University of Michigan, 1950; Ph.D., Brandeis University, 1976; LL.D., honoris causa, The College of Wooster, 1969). Caldwell was inducted into the Debate Coaches Hall of Fame at Wooster High School where he developed the debate team while teaching history and speech from 1931 to 1946. (USC Retiree Community Newsletter, May 2013, p. 4). == The Watts Riot and the Origin of the Russell L. Caldwell Neighborhood Scholarship Program == The Watts riot (also known as the Watts rebellion) of August 11–17, 1965, began with the arrest of a young African-American man in this predominantly segregated area of South Central Los Angeles, south of the USC University Park Campus. Residents of the low-income area held deep-seated resentment for what was perceived as longstanding brutality by law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department. The weeklong rioting resulted in 34 deaths, 1,032 injuries, and 3,438 arrests. Russell Caldwell, as an educator and resident of South Central Los Angeles, perceived one small step that could be taken to address the area's longterm problems. He and three of his colleagues launched what he called the USC Neighborhood Scholarship in December 1965, four months after the rioting. In a letter to USC faculty and staff, Caldwell invited his colleagues \\". . . to join in this positive kind of demonstration . . .\\" (alluding to the street demonstrations of the Watts riot) by authorizing a $5.00 per month tax-deductible contribution to what he termed the \\"Faculty-Staff Scholarship for worthy students in the University's neighborhood who would not otherwise hope to attend USC\\" by filling in the payroll-deduction form at the bottom of the letter. He hoped to raise $2,000 annually for this scholarship. The first USC Neighborhood Scholarship was awarded to Preston Mike, Jr., a mid-year graduate of Manual Arts High School (located between USC's University Park Campus and the Watts area of South Los Angeles) who enrolled at USC in the Spring Semester 1968. He was awarded an initial grant of $549 to help pay for books and tuition and was granted additional awards until his graduation in 1972. Since the program was founded, more than 400 USC undergraduates from the 10 designated high schools adjacent to the USC campuses have received Caldwell Scholarships totaling more than $1 million while working toward their degrees.https://ignite.usc.edu/project/15572 Like Caldwell himself, the vast majority have been the first in their families to receive a college degree. After Caldwell's death, a special USC memorial service was held at the Faculty Center (of which Caldwell had served as president) on June 8, 1979. His family requested that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the USC Neighborhood Scholarship Fund. Also, per his wishes, the USC Retired Faculty Association (RFA) became the sponsor of the scholarship and changed its name to the Russell L. Caldwell Neighborhood Scholarship Program in his honor. The program continues to provide support to qualifying undergraduates. == Publications and Professional Papers == \\"Building a Program of Extracurricular Speech in High School.\\" Quarterly Journal of Speech 22:3 (1936): 397–400.

Chambers in Palo Alto, California.Woody-1977 places the founding year as 1968. However, Staff-1970 places the foundation date in May 1969. It was described by one journalist in 1977 as \\"the world's leader in manufacture and sale of equipment for processing water for municipal systems and liquids in industrial processes.\\" ==Organization and operations== The company was composed of a number of operational divisions. The Eimco division, based in Salt Lake City, Utah and the largest of the company's divisions, focused on the manufacture of water and liquid waste processing equipment, but also produced underground loaders for tunneling and mining operations. The company also had a manufacturing and engineering presence in Europe focused on water treatment, with facilities in England, France, Germany and Italy, which it sold a >80% stake in to Estel in 1975 in order to raise capital for expansion in other areas; products and services acquired by Estel were subsequently provided to customers through its EMSIL subsidiary. In 1971, the company consolidated the majority of its research and development operations to a site in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. In regard to geographic structure, the Envirotech International unit was formed in 1975 as an umbrella for the company's non-United States operations, with Paul R. Gibson named as the first head of the unit. Other foreign units included Envirotech Asia- Pacific, which Gibson presided over starting in 1972, and Envirotech Australia, of which Gibson was the managing director in 1970. Buell In 1974, Buell or Buell-Envirotech was noted as being the company's \\"air quality division\\", based in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. A noted product of the unit is an electrostatic precipitator used in energy generation facilities. Three years later, in 1977, The Buell Emission Control Division was noted as being involved in the R&D; and manufacture of bag-based industrial smokestack emissions control solutions. This division pre-dates formation of Envirotech, having been established in Lebanon County in 1963 following acquisition of the Union Boiler Shop. The division began with 135 employees and expanded to 570 in 1974. Prior to this, in 1972, Buell had been noted as being one of three units (the others being Norblo and Arco) which were bound together into a new Air Pollution Control Group, the first president of which was Robert E. Stanaway. ==History== The driver behind formation of Envirotech was \\"to create in one corporation a total systems capability to handle major environmental pollution problems.\\" Envirotech was founded as a private concern by \\"a syndicate of private investors\\". The \\"syndicate\\" consisted of founder Chambers, the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and the conglomerate North American Rockwell (an ancestor of Rockwell International). Rockwell's major contribution was in the form of knowledge and intellectual property in the areas of pollution control and waste water treatment. The first form of the company was as a set of manufacturing units pulled from other companies: Ogden, Bangor Punta and Arthur G. McKee. The company went public in September 1971 and was traded over-the-counter until August 1972, when it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Envirotech diversified into air pollution control in mid-1971 when it acquired three companies: Buell Engineering (of Lebanon, Pennsylvania), Norblo and AMBUCO (of England). Both Buell and AMBUCO were acquired from Consolidated Gold Fields. In early 1972 this was followed by a fourth acquisition, the air pollution unit of Arco Industries Corporation.It is unclear whether Arco Industries Corporation is related to ARCO or not. In 1975, the company agreed to have Estel, a major European steel manufacturing concern, acquire up to 25% of the company's outstanding stock as an investment move to raise capital to support needed expansion of manufacturing operations aimed at addressing a growing backlog of unmet orders. ==Personnel== At the time of the company's consolidation of R&D; facilities in Salt Lake City in 1971, Donald Dahlstrom was the company's head of research and development. Also at this time, Jerry Schell held the subordinate post of R&D; director for sanitary engineering. Corporate governance As of 1977, founder Chambers was the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, and Berne A. Schepman was the company's chief operating officer (COO). Earlier, in 1971, Schepman was reported to have held the position of president. ==NotesReferences== Category:Technology companies established in 1968 Category:1968 establishments in California Category:Manufacturing companies based in California ","title":"Envirotech (company)"},{"id":"46367410","text":"La belle excentrique (The Eccentric Beauty) is a dance suite for small orchestra by French composer Erik Satie. A parody of music hall clichés, it was conceived as a choreographic stage work and by modern standards can be considered a ballet.A contemporary balletic performance of La belle excentrique is \\"An Eccentric Beauty Revisited\\", presented by the New York Theatre Ballet in 2012. See http://www.balletdance.com/201105/NYTB10Mar2012.htmlThe Bibliothèque nationale de France, which holds the bulk of Satie's manuscripts, categorizes La belle as a ballet. See http://data.bnf.fr/14794222/erik_satie_la_belle_excentrique__piano/ Satie gave it the whimsical subtitle \\"fantaisie sérieuse\\" (\\"A Serious Fantasy\\"). It was premiered at the Théâtre du Colisée in Paris on June 14, 1921, conducted by Vladimir Golschmann. The composer later arranged it for piano duet. ==Music== Erik Satie by Alfred Frueh Satie composed this set of solo dances between July and October 1920. It was a high-spirited throwback to his turn-of-the-century cabaret idiom after a brief \\"serious\\" period that had produced the cantata Socrate (1918) and the piano Nocturnes (1919). The suite consists of three dances (march, waltz, can-can) and an instrumental ritornello:http://imslp.org/wiki/La_belle_excentrique_(Satie,_Erik) :1. Grande ritournelle (Grand Ritornello) :2. Marche franco-lunaire (Franco-Lunar March) :3. Valse du mysterieux baiser dans l'œil (Waltz of the Mysterious Kiss in the Eye) :4. Cancan Grand-Mondain (High-Society Cancan) Early sketches show that Satie originally planned La belle as \\"a musical tour through three periods of Parisian popular entertainment\\" under the following headings: \\"1900: Marche pour une Grande Cocotte\\"; \\"1910: Elégance du Cirque (Ecuyère)\\"; and \\"1920: Cancan Moderne.\\"Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, pp. 320-321. He soon dropped the chronological scheme and proceeded to delve into his own musical past, giving the dances quirky titles that recalled his humoristic piano pieces of the previous decade. For the Grande ritournelle he recycled material from one of his unpublished cabaret songs, Légende californienne, a cakewalk from 1905.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 289. Satie registered the music with SACEM on August 18, 1905. The lyrics by Contamine de Latour are lost. In all the numbers Satie overruled his customary dry irony in favor of a robust (some called it vulgar) vaudeville sensibility.Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, pp. 103-104.

Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. The melodies are popular-inspired, the matter-of-fact dance rhythms occasionally whipped along by galloping or stentorian percussion. Despite the lowbrow subject matter Satie was as always scrupulous in his composing methods. He rewrote the opening bars of the Marche 25 times before achieving what he felt was the right level of off-kilter dissonance to mark the title character's first appearance onstage.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 77. Pianist-musicologist Olof Höjer observed that the function and place in the suite of the ritournelle are not entirely clear.Olof Höjer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6, Swedish Society Discofil, 1996. Satie evidently intended it as a recurring interlude between the dances to give the performer time to change costumes, but in the first production only one costume was used.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 344. The ritournelle also makes an effective introduction and is commonly performed as such, especially in recordings. The suite is scored for 1 piccolo, 1 oboe, 1 clarinet, 1 horn, 1 trumpet, 1 trombone, percussion for 2 players (snare drum, cymbals, bass drum), and strings. Without reprises of the ritournelle the music lasts about 8 minutes. ==History== Caryathis, poster by Leon Bakst La belle excentrique was commissioned by the avant-garde dancer and choreographer Élisabeth (Élise) Toulemont (1889-1971), who performed under the stage name Caryathis. A student of Léo Staats, she won notoriety during World War I with her outré interpretations of contemporary music. Her style was rooted in character dance and served up an eclectic mix of classical technique, popular and international dance forms, pantomime, eroticism, and ironic humor.Lynn Garafola, \\"Legacies of Twentieth-Century Dance\\", Wesleyan University Press, 2005, pp. 88-89. In the early 1920s she threw orgiastic parties at her Paris home, some of which the usually hyper-moral Satie attended with voyeuristic fascination.Robert Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", Faber and Faber Ltd., 1995, p. 125. She later married the novelist Marcel Jouhandeau. For her first major postwar recital Caryathis collaborated with author and artist Jean Cocteau, who at that time was a spokesman for Satie and the composers of Les Six, and the program they assembled focused primarily on their music.The finalized program consisted of La belle excentrique, Francis Poulenc's Le Jongleur, Georges Auric's Paris-Sport, Maurice Ravel's Rapsodie espagnole, and an unnamed Spanish dance by Enrique Granados, along with non-choreographed works by Darius Milhaud (Symphonie pastorale) and Arthur Honegger (Pastorale d'été). See Michel Duchesneau, François de Medici, Sylvain Caron, \\"Music and Modernity in France (1900-1945)\\", PUM, 2006, p. 103. Satie was paid 500 francs each for his three dance numbers; he threw in the Grande ritournelle for free.Erik Satie, letter to Caryathis dated November 1, 1920. Cited in Yuri Khanon, \\"Erik Satie - Retroactive Memories\\", Faces of Russia, 2010, pp. 675 - 682. The title La belle excentrique was coined by Cocteau.Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 505. Caryathis began her choreography in October 1920, with Satie protégé Francis Poulenc assisting as a rehearsal pianist. Poulenc wrote to Belgian music critic Paul Collaer that it was \\"a work of genius.\\"Carl B. Schmidt, \\"Entrancing Muse: A Documented Biography of Francis Poulenc\\", Pendragon Press, 2001, p. 65. An invitation-only preview was given at the home of actor Pierre Bertin on January 8, 1921.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 320-321. Satie was closely involved in all phases of the project. Couturier Paul Poiret and artists Marie Laurencin, Kees van Dongen, and Jean Hugo were approached to create Belle's costume, but the composer rejected their designs as too charming or too crass. \\"My music calls for something outrageous,\\" he remarked, \\"a woman who is more like a zebra than a doe.\\"Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", p. 125. Cocteau solved the problem by designing a midriff-baring outfit he described as befitting \\"a mad American woman from the Salvation Army out for revenge.\\"Ornella Volta (editor), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, pp. 166-168. Nicole Groult (Poiret's sister) provided a creepy face mask that hid all but the dancer's eyes.Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Erik Satie: Correspondance presque complete\\", Fayard, Paris, 2003, pp. 700-701. Caryathis in the 1921 premiere of La belle excentrique. Costume designed by Jean Cocteau, with face mask by Nicole Groult Cocteau also wrote a programmatic text for La belle that caused friction between the collaborators. He envisioned Belle as an African-American jazz dancer and tried to influence the choreography accordingly, while Satie was adamant that she be thoroughly Parisian. \\"It's not our fault if Cocteau is stuffed full of his 'jazz' - quite stuffed\\", Satie told Caryathis.Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", p. 505. The text does not appear to have been used and no trace of it survives.Michel Duchesneau, François de Médicis, Sylvain Caron (editors), \\"Musique et modernité en France (1900-1945)\\", PUM, 2006, pp. 103-104. The June 14 premiere of Caryathis' one-woman show at the Colisée was well received. One critic noted of her work on La belle, \\"It seems that what unfolds before our eyes is not ballet, but one of the nightmarish visions of Baudelaire or Edgar Allan Poe.\\"Ornella Volta, \\"L'Ymagier d'Erik Satie\\", Paris, Francis van de Velde, 1979, p. 115. In July 1921 the program moved to Paul Poiret's fashionable garden theatre L'Oasis, where Satie made a rare appearance conducting his music.Mary E. Davis, \\"Classic Chic: Music, Fashion, and Modernism\\", University of California Press, 2006, p. 218. The original orchestral score and Satie's reduction for piano 4-hands were published by Éditions de La Sirène in 1922. An arrangement of three of the numbers for solo piano (excluding the Cancan Grand-Mondain) also exists. Caryathis became so identified with her role that she later titled her autobiography The Joys and Sorrows of an Eccentric Beauty.Elise Jouhandeau, \\"Joies et douleurs d'une belle excentrique\\", Paris-éditions Flammarion, 1960. In it she recalled how, in the early summer of 1925, she decided to quit the stage and consigned all the mementos of her career to a fire in her backyard. Her costume for La belle had just started to burn when she received a telegram from composer Georges Auric that Satie was terminally ill in a Paris hospital. She rushed to his bedside for a final reunion, and he died not long afterwards.On July 1, 1925. \\"Satie appeared not to care about others,\\" she reminisced, \\"but he had a kind heart, even if it was, certainly, intolerant of stupidity, which he dealt with by irony...His existence was governed by music and his whole life sacrificed to the toil of inspiration and to the pursuit of true knowledge.\\"Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", pp. 125-126. Like much of Satie's music, La belle excentrique slipped into obscurity until after World War II. His earliest biographers, Pierre-Daniel Templier (1932) and Rollo H. Myers (1948), found the piece superficial.Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, pp. 103-104. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932.Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 59. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. It was first heard in England on June 14, 1949, with Constant Lambert conducting the London Symphony Orchestra in a broadcast for the BBC Third Programme.Stephen Lloyd, \\"Constant Lambert: Beyond the Rio Grande\\", Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2014, p. 519. Pianists Francis Poulenc and Jacques Février made a commercial recording in 1959 (Musidisc). Since then the piano duet version has been more frequently performed, though La belle remains one of Satie's lesser-known compositions. ==Recordings== For Orchestra: Maurice Abravanel - Utah Symphony Orchestra (Grande ritournelle only, Vanguard, 1968), Friedrich Cerha - Ensemble \\"Die Reihe\\" (Vox, 1970), Bernard Herrmann - London Festival Players (Decca, 1971), Toru Yuki - Danceries Ensemble (Denon, 1987), Michel Plasson - Orchestre Du Capitole De Toulouse (EMI, 1988), and Yutaka Sado - Orchestre Des Concerts Lamoureux (Erato, 2001).

The restaurant owner gave her a metal purse hook instead to allow her to hang the purse on the table, and she got the idea to create something more fashionable for women to hang their purses. In 2005, she researched the market, finding that there were already purse hooks sold in the U.S., but realized she could improve the design. With a team of designers, she created the Luxe Link, designing it to be a charm that hangs on a purse strap that doubles as a purse hanger when needed. ==Launch== Later in 2005, Yap invented and eventually patented Luxe Link.

The band consists of Shawn Holley (guitar and vocals), and Jest Commons (formerly of The Moldy Peaches, drums). The band was founded in Anchorage, Alaska in 2003. Mythological Horses have released two full studio albums on Hovercraft Records, plus multiple EPs and singles on various other record labels. They have continually toured the United States since 2005, playing and headlining at many festivals, most notably the New York Antifolk Festival in 2010. ==History== Mythological Horses first came about in the mid 1990s when founder Shawn Holley and his childhood friend Chris Vanbibber began writing and performing songs. Both age 16, they started playing the punk/coffee house scene in Anchorage, Alaska under the name Churpbleepuh. Drawing heavily on such influences as Nirvana, The Cars, Sonic Youth, and The Dead Milkmen, Churpbleepuh played shows until 2000. At this time Holley left Alaska and began pursuing a solo career as an anti-folk artist, touring the United States excessively, performing over 200 shows per year. As his writing style began to lean back toward his punk and rock roots, Holley reformed the band and started performing officially as Mythological Horses in 2005. Over the next decade, Mythological Horses continued consistent touring, sharing the stage with such bands as The Pharmacy, Blowfly, Joe Genaro of The Dead Milkmen, Mickey Avalon, Eagles Of Death Metal, Mike Watt, MC Lars, Kimya Dawson, T.S.O.L., and Smoke And Smoke featuring Spencer Moody of The Murder City Devils and members of godheadSilo. During this time, Mythological Horses released four albums (Idaho -2008/ Fairview Luvin-2008/ Fuck It-2009/ Super Joe Long Cocaine Mountain-2010) on Shawn Holley's label Lime Street Records. The bands posters (created by artist Pat Moriarity) were featured in two episodes in season 6 of the Showtime hit show Weeds. In May 2013, Mythological Horses entered Witch Ape Studios and recorded their first full-length studio album under the production of Tad Doyle of Subpop band TAD, Andrew Crowley of Organica Recording, and Jack Endino who has worked closely with Nirvana and other Subpop artists. This album was released on vinyl record and digital download in 2014 on Hovercraft Records out of Portland, Or. The band received high praise in international press, and was featured on a KEXP Music That Matters podcast, Young Reckless Hearts, in April 2014. In December 2017 Mythological Horses returned to Witch Ape studios in Seattle, WA. to record their second full-length studio album. It was engineered and produced by Tad Doyle (TAD) with Kurt Danielson (TAD) on bass, Kurt Block on lead guitar. The album was recorded in 7 days. ==Discography== Albums * Fairview Luvin (October 2008) Lime Street Records * Idaho (December 2008) Lime Street Records * Fuck It (May 2009) Lime Street Records * Super Joe Long Cocaine Mountain (March 2010) Lime Street Records * Mythological Horses (January 2014) Hovercraft Records * YYYMF!

The geysers could provide easy access for sampling the moon's subsurface ocean, and if there is microbial life in it, ice particles from the sea could contain the evidence astrobiologists need to identify them. An organic-rich world, Titan has a methane cycle comparable in atmospheric and geological processes to Earth's water cycle. tiger stripes' feature. The JET orbiter mission concept was proposed in 2011 by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to NASA's Discovery Program Mission #13. During the orbiter's one-year mission, it would perform high-resolution mass spectroscopy mapping that would determine what processes have shaped and are shaping the moons, and it would permit assessment of the habitability potential of Enceladus and Titan. In order to meet the $450 million cost cap, the orbiter would carry only two instruments. It would orbit Saturn and make a total of 16 flybys of Enceladus and Titan, the closest ones at 900 km from Titan's surface. In June 2015 NASA announced a list of five finalists for the current competition, but the Journey to Enceladus and Titan proposal was not selected. Lucy was selected on January 4, 2017 and is planned to launch in October 2021. ==Objectives== Titan's mystery clouds Titan's hydrocarbon seas. The three goals of the mission are to determine the processes that have shaped and are shaping Enceladus and Titan, to assess their astrobiological potential, and to investigate their formation and evolution. At Enceladus, the mission will determine composition and flux of material in the plume, and will produce temperature maps of the faults, tectonics and interior dynamics. At Titan, it will characterize of the organic molecules in the upper atmosphere at different altitudes (> 900 km) and latitudes, and will produce high-resolution images for detailed study of features forming at different time-scales. ==Launch and trajectory== If using an Atlas V rocket, JET would reach Saturn in 8.5 years using a Venus–Earth–Earth gravity assist trajectory. ==Payload== The orbiter payload consists of two instruments: *Infrared camera: 'Titan Imaging and Geology, Enceladus Reconnaissance' (TIGER) – This high-heritage thermographic camera exploits infrared wavelengths to image through Titan's thick atmosphere and would image the heat of Enceladus's fractures known as 'tiger stripes', permitting a detailed thermal modeling. It would provide 10× better imaging resolution of Titan's surface than Cassini, yielding 50 m/pix images of 15% of Titan's surface. *Mass spectrometer: 'Spectrometer for Titan and Enceladus Astrobiology Mission' (STEAM) – It would characterize elements and molecules, including complex organic molecules with 100× higher resolution, and 1000× better sensitivity than Cassini.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj.

Its large, red flower spikes and long flowering period contribute to its popularity as a garden plant. There are two subspecies, distinguished mainly by the shape of the leaves. ==Description== Melaleuca macronychia is an open, erect, many-stemmed shrub usually growing to a height of . Its leaves are arranged alternately, are long and wide oval to narrow elliptic in shape and taper to a point. The flowers are crimson and arranged in spikes on side branches, the spikes up to long and about in diameter. Each spike contains between 10 and 80 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers open. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 15 to 25 stamens. Flowers appear mostly from February to December varying somewhat with subspecies. The fruit are woody, roughly spherical capsules about in diameter, forming clusters along the branches.Melaleuca macronychia fruit ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca macronychia was first described in 1852 by Nikolai Turczaninow in \\"Bulletin de la classe physico-mathematique de l'Academie Imperiale des sciences de Saint-Petersburg\\". There is disagreement about the etymology of the specific epithet (macronychia). In a Melaleuca monograph, Craven give it as from the Ancient Greek makros meaning “long” and onyx meaning \\"fingernail\\", \\"claw\\" or \\"talon\\", referring to the dried leaves which look like long, narrow human fingernails. Sharr considers onychius to be an adaptation of the Greek onyx, onychos meaning \\"a nail or claw\\", referring to the stamen claw of this species. There are two subspecies varying in their distributions, flowering time and leaf size and shape: * Melaleuca macronychia subsp. macronychia has narrow oval to elliptic leaves that are up to ten times longer than they are wide and it occurs in and between the Kalannie and Hyden districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions. * Melaleuca macronychia subsp. trygonoides has broad oval leaves which are less than twice as long as they are wide and it occurs in the Coolgardie, Lake Johnston and Widgiemooltha districts in the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions. ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca macronychia occurs in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions growing in scrub and heath on a wide range of sandy and gravelly soil types. ==Conservation== This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife although the subspecies trygonoides is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. ==Use in horticulture== Melaleuca macronychia subsp. macronychia is frequently cultivated because of its profuse red flower spikes which appear over long periods. It is also a hardy plant, including in the temperate areas of the more humid east coast when grown in well-drained soil with a sunny aspect. ==References== macronychia Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1852 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Taxa named by Nikolai Turczaninow ","title":"Melaleuca macronychia"},{"id":"46367855","text":"Edmund William Molesworth (1847 - 2 June 1923) was an English-born Australian politician.

Google aimed to empower young women in middle and high schools with computer programming skills. Made with Code was created after Google's own research found out that encouragement and exposure are the critical factors that would influence young females to pursue computer science. It was reported that Google is funding $50 million to Made with Code, on top of the initial $40 million invested since 2010 in organizations like Code.org, Black Girls Code, and Girls Who Code. The Made with Code initiative involves both online activities as well as real life events, collaborating with notable firms like Shapeways and App Inventor. == Projects == Made with Code revolves primarily around providing online activities for young girls to learn coding on its website. Many of Made with Code's projects use Blockly programming, a visual editor that writes programs by assembling individual blocks. Step by step instructions are provided to guide users. Along the way, works may either be discarded or saved and downloaded.  Dance Visualiser  Dance Visualiser mixes dance with code by modelling a visualiser that mirrors a dancer's motions. Through the application of Blockly programming, users track the different parts such as the head, chest, hip and four limbs of the dancer's body. After inputting the necessary details, a customized visualization is generated accordingly.  Music Mixer  In Music Mixer, users manipulate the number of notes and set the speed of each instrument to produce a colorful rotating visual music mixer. The range of instruments that are available include Acapella, Country, Electronic, HipHop, Pop and Rock.  Beats  Beats connects Blockly programming language and virtual instruments together to produce a string of beats. Users set the speed from a minimum of 30 to a maximum of 300 beats. The range of virtual instruments available include hi- hat, clave, cowbell, cymbal, tom, kick, snare and clap.  Avatar  Project Avatar allows users to customize their own avatar. Through Blockly programming language, users input different shapes on a virtual 2D work space, then arrange the shapes into a 3D avatar.  Accessorizer  Accessorizer allow to accessorize (put accessories on) a selfie with Blockly programming language. The first step is selecting an image, either by snapping a picture or selecting the available characters including Dorothy, Rose, Smoosh, Raul and Blanche. The next step is to position the accessories on top of the character or image. Accessories include the eyes, mouths, shirts, hats and wigs.  GIF  GIF lets users make a custom animation with a background and a series of frame. With the Blockly programming language, four images can be constructed which will then cycle so as to form an animation. The first step is to select the background, which includes characters such as Licky Ricky, Mayday Mary, Puss in Moon Boots, Purple Mess, Flappy the Uni-Horn, Tonsil Tammy, Bucky, Long Lidia, Permy and Mr. Hula Hips. The next step is to select frame(s), which includes various shapes and colors.  Kaleidoscope  Kaleidoscope lets users manipulate the size, speed, and images of a kaleidoscope animation. After selecting an animation, either star, cross or flower, users pick an image and select a rotation speed. Next, select the image size by entering a percentage value.  Yeti  Yeti project allows users to create an animated Yeti with Blockly programming language. The first step is to drag and insert the YETI block onto the work space, followed by the character design block. Select the fur and skin color of your Yeti, as well as the hand and feet sizes. Next, select the animation command from the various range of actions provided.  Past notable projects   Code a Bracelet  Made with Code collaborated with Shapeways to allow girls to create their own customised bracelet. After designing the bracelet with Blockly, Shapeways prints the bracelets using nylon plastic on their 3D EOS printers. == Mentors and makers == Made with Code website features videos of mentors, who are females in different industries who have used computer coding in their career, and makers, who are young females who have made a difference in society using their coding skills. Some of the mentors and makers were also invited to hold talks such as during Made with Code's kick off event in New York City. Over 100 teenage girls from local organizations and public schools worked on coding projects and witnessed first-hand how women use code in their dream jobs.

Her father was a wine merchant who focused on supplying her with a solid education, which she cultivated with natural talent and curiosity. She earned her primary living as a private tutor and teacher and became well-known through Mentoria: or, The Young Ladies Instructor (1778). In 1785, she opened a boarding school for young girls in Hampstead with the involvement of two of her sisters and Charles Dilly, a noted London bookseller. Additionally, many of her books were printed for Dilly and the two were well-acquainted. At some point after the opening of her boarding school, Murry moved on to more private tutoring work, working for famous figures such as Sir William Pulteney's daughter, Laura, and the Princess Royal. Murry continued to be active in teaching and writing through the end of the 18th century and into the 19th. Her date of death is unknown, but her last recorded writing was in 1818, an introduction to An Abridgement of the History of France. ==Career== Over her career, Murry wrote six books, mostly for the education of her pupils. Her first and by far most famous book was Mentoria: or, the Young Ladies Instructor, first published in 1778. This book presents itself as a conversation between a teacher, called Mentoria, and her pupils. Murry covers many subjects in this book, including history, grammar, religion, arithmetic, and proper conduct. Before its publication, Murry requested and received the Princess Royal's approval, which she also did with Mentoria's sequel in 1799. Murry was also involved in poetry. She composed a poetry book of her own in 1779 and filled Mentoria with her own poetry and that of other famous poets, including John Milton, James Thomson, and Alexander Pope. Her works were fairly well-received during her era, with positive reviews of her books frequently appearing in literary journals of the period. Additionally, she had many famous subscribers to her books, including the Duchess of Bedford and David Garrick. Murry's works strongly displayed her moral and social ideology, especially Mentoria. She supported the American Rebellion, detested the practice of slavery, encouraged virtuous behavior in young ladies, and displayed great amounts of religious devotion. However, she harshly condemned Roman Catholicism, Islam, and Judaism, believing them to be misguided. == Full list of works == *Mentoria: or, the Young Ladies Instructor,1778 *Poems on Various Subjects, 1779. *A Concise History of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, 1783. 2 vols. *The Sequel to Mentoria; or, the Young Ladies Instructor, 1799. *Mentorian Lectures on Sacred and Moral Subjects, 1809. 8 vols. *An Abridgement of the History of France, c. 1815 ==References== Category:1750 births Category:19th-century deaths Category:English children's writers Category:18th-century English poets Category:English women poets Category:18th-century women writers ","title":"Ann Murry"},{"id":"46367975","text":"Join Jim Dale was a British television comedy series aired 1969 on ITV.

View of the church ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1326, but it was not new that year. The church was likely a stave church. The location must have been an important site on which to build a church since this location includes the largest pre-Christian burial site in Etne with more than 200 burial mounds. Today most of it is cultivated farmland and only some large mounds remain. To the far south is a large site with small mounds dating from the Bronze Age. By 1722, the old stave church was described as having a nave with a choir and a square tower at the west end of the building. Shortly after this, in 1723-1724, the old stave church was torn down and a new church building was constructed on the same site. The church bells in the tower date from 1628 and 1751, respectively. The building was extended to the west in 1854. In 1954–55 the church was renovated and restored. The Grindheim stone stands near the north exterior wall. It is a tall stone and it was found in the cemetery wall. It is a memorial stone from around the year 1050 with a carved cross and the runic inscription: \\"Tormod erected this stone in honour of Tormod Svidade, his father\\".

Though she is still married to Gus, Fiona has begun a sexual relationship with Sean. When Fiona unexpectedly finds out she is pregnant (and does not know who the father is), she ultimately decides to get an abortion. Carl gets an early release from juvie and begins going on a tough persona, selling weapons around the school and getting involved in the drug business. In the process, Carl begins dating a classmate, Dominique, whom he loses his virginity to. When Carl witnesses his friend, Nick, killing a neighborhood boy over a stolen bike, Carl decides he no longer wants to be in the \\"criminal life\\" and confides in Fiona. Meanwhile, Debbie has decided to keep her baby, but Derek, not ready to become a father, suddenly abandons her. When Fiona refuses to support Debbie through her pregnancy, Debbie gets assistance from Frank, who has been mourning the loss of Bianca. When Sammi's mother, Queenie, comes into town following Chuckie's release from juvie, Debbie and Frank briefly travel with Queenie to her family's rural commune, where they grow opium poppies. Lip continues his relationship with his professor, Helene, but Amanda gets revenge on Lip by exposing a naked picture of Helene in Lip's dorm that goes viral. Lip simultaneously loses his dorm and job, and Helene promises to break off all contact with Lip at a disciplinary hearing. With Lip's drinking habits worsening, he befriends Professor Youens, who acts as Lip's mentor. Lip's descent into alcoholism gets him expelled from college for assaulting a campus guard; Youens convinces Lip to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Ian puts his relationship with Mickey behind him and begins dating a firefighter, Caleb. With Caleb's encouragement, Ian begins working to become a firefighter and lands an EMT job at the end of the season. With Mickey in prison, Svetlana faces deportation; in order to keep Svetlana in the United States, Veronica voluntarily marries her. In the process, Kevin, Veronica, and Svetlana begin a polyamorous relationship. Fiona faces even more problems when the Gallaghers are given an eviction notice on their house. The house is bid for auction, but the family loses the bid and are forced to move out. Fiona briefly moves in with Sean and attempts to connect with his young son, Will. When the family who initially bought the house rescind the bid, Fiona attempts to get Gus to sign a sheet that recognizes his lack of property claim. But Gus refuses, resentful of Fiona for her past infidelity, and requests for an amicable divorce. At the divorce suit, Sean shows up in front of Gus and his lawyers and proposes to Fiona, who happily accepts. With Carl's help, the Gallaghers are able to reclaim their house, and Sean moves in with Fiona. As Fiona begins preparing for her wedding, Debbie and Frank return from Queenie's rural commune just in time for Debbie to give birth. The whole family surrounds Debbie in the kitchen as she gives birth to a baby girl. To Fiona's surprise, Debbie names her daughter Frances \\"Franny\\" Gallagher, after Frank. Days before the wedding, Sean clashes with Frank over his behavior towards his own kids, and challenges Frank's authority as head of the household. After the two get into a nasty argument, Frank vows for revenge against Sean; he sneaks into Sean's office and finds out that Sean is still shooting heroin, something that is unknown to Fiona. During Fiona's wedding ceremony, Frank shows up - uninvited - and reveals to the entire congregation that Sean is still doing heroin, upsetting Fiona. Will angrily leaves the ceremony. Sean confronts a heartbroken Fiona, admitting that he had been using for months, and tells Fiona to \\"take care of herself.\\" While Sean leaves to fight for custody of Will, the rest of the family - including Caleb, Svetlana, Kevin, and Veronica - kidnap Frank and angrily throw him into the freezing river. They flee the area, hoping for Frank's death, to guarantee he is out of their lives forever. ==Cast and characters== Main * William H.

It is a major route for holidaymakers and tourists which has access to some of New Zealand's most idyllic beach holiday spots. The summer period around Christmas and New Year's Eve is a particularly busy period for the highway. The road is very scenic, but also windy in many parts as well as single carriage on the entire route, and is prone to accidents. It is New Zealand's third longest two-digit state highway, after and . It is part of the Pacific Coast Highway. There is one spur road, SH 25A, that crosses the peninsula west to east, almost intersecting SH 25 at both ends. ==Route== SH 25 begins at 3 km north of Mangatarata at a roundabout intersection. The highway travels eastwards across the Hauraki Plains where it crosses the Waihou River on the new Kopu Bridge, it hits the junction with and moves northwards through the township of Thames. The road continues north, skirting the Firth of Thames into the small township of Coromandel before travelling eastwards across the peninsula to the Bay of Plenty side towards Whitianga. SH 25 veers south-west on the Whitianga Bypass, through Coroglen and Whenuakite and over windy hill roads into Tairua, where Pauanui is accessible. SH 25 then continues southwards, past the intersection of the spur highway SH 25A and towards Whangamatā. The road bypasses Whangamatā on the west side and continues southbound until it reaches its final terminus in Waihi at the intersection of Kenny Street & Rosemont Road.State Highway 25 on Google Maps ==Spurs== State Highway 25A (SH 25A) traverses the Coromandel Peninsula from west to east directly. This 28.2 km road begins at the intersection of only 400m away from the SH 25/SH 26 intersection. It terminates on SH 25 between Tairua and Whangamatā.State Highway 25A on Google Maps ==Route changes== SH 25 once went through the town centres of Whitianga and Whangamatā. In Whitianga, the bypass was constructed carrying traffic away from the original route via Buffalo Beach Road, Albert Street, and South Highway. In Whangamatā, SH 25 bypasses the town via Tairua Road instead of using Harry Watt Drive, Hetherington Road and Port Road. In the early 2000s the last sections of the highway were sealed, particularly around the northern end of the Coromandel Peninsula between Coromandel township and Whitianga. In 2011 NZTA completed the new Kopu Bridge, a two lane structure, across the Waihou River. It replaced the previous one-lane bridge, where at times holidaymakers had to queue for hours to cross. The old bridge, which was built in 1928, is scheduled to be deconstructed although a key part of its history will still be preserved. ==Major junctions== {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Territorial authority !

The white, stone and wood church was built in a long church style in 1160 using designs by an unknown architect. The church has been renovated and expanded several times over the centuries, and it currently seats about 245 people. View of the church ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1329, but the church was likely built around the year 1160. It is believed that the church may have originally been a private church for the family of Erling Skakke, a Norwegian Jarl, who lived in Stødle during the 12th century. For centuries it was a stone church, but since an expansion in the first half of the 1600s, a portion of the church is now wooden. The church was purchased by J.F. Tuchsen in 1723, when the King sold many churches to pay for the expenses from the Great Northern War. After several different private owners, the church was purchased by the parish in 1860 and was no longer privately owned. In 1879, a tower was added on the west end. In 1957-1958, the church underwent a major renovation. ==See also== *List of churches in Bjørgvin ==References== Category:Etne Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Stone churches in Norway Category:12th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in the 1160s Category:12th- century establishments in Norway ","title":"Stødle Church"},{"id":"46368181","text":"Wilfred Joseph Spruson (1870 - 16 August 1939) was an Australian politician and patent attorney.

Later, the school was renamed as Hunan First United County-owned High School, Changjun State-owned school, Hunan Changjun United High School, Changsha First High School (in 1951), Changsha Second High School and Changjun High School in 1984. In the fall of 2009, Changjun new campus formally opened. It cost 320 million yuan and was invested by Changsha Municipal Government. The new campus is located in the leading area of “the two-oriented society” called Octagon Area, covering an area of 150 acres. Changjun 2 campuses in the east and west of Xiangjiang River take off together and the school’s development has turned a new page. ==References== *Changjun School Category:Schools in China Category:Education in Changsha Category:High schools in Hunan Category:Educational institutions established in 1904 Category:1904 establishments in China ","title":"Changjun High School"},{"id":"46368273","text":"Latambarcem is a village located in the North Goa district in the state of Goa, India.

She became a leading artist in Japan founding an art school and displaying her art throughout the country. In 1891, at the age of fifty-five, Seiko decided to retire to a country village. The paintings created by Seiko following her retirement are highly regarded and considered to be some of her finest work. == Biography == Born into the samurai class and renowned for her success as a painter, Seiko resided primarily in Edo-Tokyo, a political and social center of her time. She continued to reside in Edo, where she taught painting and lived in her later years with her companion and student, Watanabe Seiran (1855-1918). Her work is influenced by the Kanō school, but is categorized as within the nanga literati school. Seiko, like most successful Japanese artists of her time, adapted Chinese literati styles to Japanese tastes. Untitled Seiko is notable for her established and well-recognized career during the Meiji period, as well as her reputation within the primarily male literati school. Early in her career, she changed her name from Setsuko to the gender- neutral Seiko. Her work has been characterized as \\"masculine\\" in both painting and calligraphy, which may be attributed both to the liberal lifestyle she maintained and the role of women painters at the time. Seiko was also noted for wearing masculine clothing and short hair, deliberately eschewing a feminine persona. As a famous female bunjin (literati artist) artist, she is renowned for earning her own success with her art without literary or artistic connections, much like her contemporary Noguchi Shohin. Both artists also omitted the feminine character ‘joshi’ in their signatures, like many female artists. She and Noguchi Shohin were friends of the statesman Kido Takayoshi and they enjoyed his patronage. Kido and the two of them would create gassaku which are collaborative paintings that include both pictures and text. Notably, research about female painters in East Asia during the 19th and 20th century is lacking. Historians have suggested that this is not due to a dearth in practicing female artists, which began to be more widely accepted in the 18th century, among the daughters of the gentry. Although women were celebrated as authors and poets, paintings by female artists may have been characterized by Japanese historians as effeminate. == Style == She was a minor pupil of Tani Bunchō, but because of her gender, was not allowed to enter into an apprenticeship. Part of her artistic training involved the copying of funpon (pictorial models), which may be seen in her work and were also later used in her teaching. The use of funpon was derived from the Chinese, as the literati practice followed a Chinese example. Seiko was celebrated for her individual style, which drew from a variety of artistic elements and examples. During Japan at the time, learning through imitation in order to best achieve personal style and expression was reflective of the literati culture. == Works == Although many of her works remain in private hands there is a major collection at the Koga City History Museum with additional pieces held by Tokyo National Museum, the Ibaraki Museum of Modern Art and the Prefectural History Museum, Mito, and the Saitama Prefectural Museum of Modern Art. == References == Category:1837 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Japanese women artists Category:19th-century Japanese painters Category:20th-century Japanese painters Category:LGBT artists from Japan Category:20th-century women artists Category:19th-century women artists ","title":"Okuhara Seiko"},{"id":"46368351","text":"Caryn Waechter is an American filmmaker best known for her 2014 debut film The Sisterhood of Night. ==Education== Waechter initially attended Columbia University to earn a degree as a film critic.

The George Cross (GC) is the highest civil decoration of the United Kingdom and other member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. It is the highest gallantry award for civilians of any rank or profession, and is primarily intended to be a civil award. Military personnel may be awarded the George Cross for actions not in the face of the enemy or for actions not normally meriting a purely military award. The George Cross was officially constituted on 24 September 1940 by King George VI as a way to recognise civilian courage. It recognises \\"acts of the greatest heroism or of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme danger\\". Initially, the Empire Gallantry Medal recognised acts of the highest bravery. The George Cross succeeded the Empire Gallantry Medal and all those living that had been awarded the medal, and all posthumous awards from the outbreak of World War II, were obliged to exchange their medal for the George Cross. In 1971, the living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal were invited to exchange their medals for the George Cross; 24 recipients elected not to exchange their medal. In recent years, the George Cross has often served as the highest-level military decoration for recognition of peacetime heroism, or for wartime actions of gallantry not in the face of the enemy. Prior to 2017, when Dominic Troulan received the decoration for heroism during a 2013 terrorist attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya, no civilian awards of the GC had been made since 1978, when it was awarded to Victoria Police constable Michael Pratt. Previously, the last civilian award in the UK to a living recipient had been to Metropolitan Police inspector Jim Beaton in 1974 for his efforts in protecting Anne, Princess Royal from a mentally ill man attempting to kidnap her. Certain Commonwealth realms have replaced the GC with their own equivalent awards. The Cross of Valour has been awarded to Canadian citizens since its establishment in 1972, and the identically named Cross of Valour has been awarded to Australian citizens since 1975. Both allow the wearer to use the postnominal letters CV. Since 1999, the New Zealand Cross has been awarded to New Zealand citizens, which allows the wearer the postnominal NZC. Awards of the George Cross made prior to the establishment of their replacements in each nation are not exchanged. Until 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth, the George Cross and its precursors were awarded to Indian civilians and military personnel in the government and princely states forces. All British awards were discontinued after 26 January 1950. In 1952, the Ashoka Chakra replaced the George Cross.Peacetime Military Awards == Living recipients == The following people are living recipients of the George Cross. { class=\\"sortable \\" - !

Walsh grew up in Doodlakine, Western Australia, where he was a wheat and sheep farmer. He was elected to the Australian Senate in 1974, and served as Minister for Resources and Energy from 1983 to 1984 and Finance Minister from 1984 to 1990. He was noted for his pro-free market views. In his 1995 memoirs, Confessions of a Failed Finance Minister, Walsh was critical of his colleagues and of political processes in general for failing to curb what he saw as wasteful government expenditure, and unnecessary government intervention. Also in his book he corrected errors made in Whatever It Takes, the book written by former ministerial colleague and fellow Senator Graham Richardson. After leaving politics, Walsh was a columnist for the Australian Financial Review and was particularly critical of environmentalism. He was one of the founders of the Lavoisier Group which opposes the Kyoto protocol on global warming. Walsh also expressed criticism over the Rudd government's National Broadband Network scheme.Leaders with no instinct for numbers: The Advertiser 9 January 2010 Walsh died at a hospital in Perth after a short illness on 10 April 2015.

Like most of Platt's designs for the university, the building has a Georgian Revival plan. The gymnasium originally provided expanded facilities for the women's physical education department, which had outgrown its space in the Woman's Building. The new gymnasium's facilities included two general-purpose spaces, several specialized facilities, and a physical education laboratory. Louise Freer, the women's physical education director for whom the building was later renamed, added a lounge area in 1932 to provide a social space in the building. The building is still used as a gymnasium and hosts intramural sporting events and physical education classes. Freer Hall has served as the home venue for the Illinois Fighting Illini women's swimming and diving team.

This was the last budget before the 2015 federal election. The budget was supposed to be presented in February or March before the fiscal year began on April 1, but was delayed because of the steep drop in oil prices in the winter of 2014–15. A surplus of $1.4 billion was projected for the fiscal year 2015-2016, however this was adjusted by the new government to a deficit of $1.0 billion by end of March 2016. This was later adjusted to $2.9 billion after reflecting a change requested by the Auditor General dating back 10 years' worth of federal budgets, specifically with regards to the discount rate methodology used to determine the present value of the Government's unfunded pension obligations. == Programs ==  Child care  The Universal Child Care Benefit will be increased to $1,920 per year for each child under the age of 6, and will introduce a new benefit of up to $720 per year for children aged 6 through 17. This measure will be paid for in part by the elimination of the existing Child Tax Credit.  Seniors  The budget will lower the minimum annual withdrawal rate for seniors from their Registered Retirement Income Fund. The minimal withdrawal rate starts at 7.38% at age 71 and increases to 20% by age 94. The budget would lower the rate for those aged 71 to 5.28% to start, and will lower the rate to 18.79% by age 94. The budget also announces a new Home Accessibility Tax Credit of up to $1,500 for the cost of home renovations for seniors or people with disabilities. The government is proposing to extend the Employment Insurance Compassionate Care leave from six weeks to six months for Canadians caring for gravely ill family members.  Security and defence  The budget will spend $439 million from 2015 to 2019 on various national security measures, including counterterrorism programs at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), increased Parliament Hill security, and an extra $2 million a year for the Security Intelligence Review Committee to enhance its oversight of CSIS's expanded operations. The federal government will also spend $360 million in 2015 on its deployment in Iraq and $7.1 million to train Ukraine's security forces. The military budget will be increased by $1.1 billion over three years starting in fiscal year 2017–18, from $20 billion in 2014–15. Ottawa is raising to from 2% to 3% the yearly escalator clause in the Department of National Defence's budget.  Public transit  In the budget is a proposal for a new approach to mass transit capital funding that would be based on long-term loans and private sector involvement. The government will establish the Public Transit Fund that would start at $250 million in 2017–18 and grow to $1 billion a year by 2019–20. The government states municipalities could borrow from this fund. Previously, the federal government had provided of the capital funding for infrastructure projects. The fund is not established by the budget.  Manufacturing investments  The budget also provides $100 million over five years to help auto parts makers develop new products.  Post-secondary grants  The government is putting an extra $1.3 billion over six years into the Canada Foundation for Innovation, which provides grants for research infrastructure, mainly at colleges and universities. == Taxes ==  Couples  The budget proposes to allow parents to split their income for tax purposes, which is expected to reduce tax revenues by $4.5 billion a year.  Small businesses  The government proposes to reduce the corporate income tax rate on businesses with less than $500,000 in annual income from 11% to 9% in 2019. This is expected to reduce tax revenues $1.2 billion a year when it is fully implemented.  Agricultural businesses  The government proposes to increase the lifetime capital gains exemption for farmers and fishing businesses from $800,000 to $1 million for all property sold on or after budget day.  Manufacturing  The government had introduced a temporary tax break during the Great Recession to encourage manufacturers to write off part of the cost of modernizing machinery and equipment over a short period of time. The accelerated Capital Cost Allowance has been repeatedly extended since 2007. This budget proposes to extend the measure until 2024, reducing government tax revenues by up to $360 million a year.  Banking  The budget proposes to close a loophole used by financial institutions on derivatives contracts, that the government estimates will generate as much as $365 million in the current fiscal year and $1.24 billion over the next four years. Banks would no longer be able to claim an income-tax deduction on dividends paid by Canadian companies under certain derivatives contracts. These \\"synthetic equity arrangements\\" have the \\"potential to significantly erode the Canadian tax base\\" according to the budget document. == Civil service reforms == The government will save an estimated $900 million this year by targeting a \\"failing\\" and \\"antiquated\\" system that allows federal bureaucrats to bank their sick days. The government wants to replace the existing practice with a formal disability plan by collective bargaining. If negotiations fail, the government will implement a modernized sick leave and disability regime \\"within a reasonable time frame\\". == References == * == External links == *2015 Budget at Department of Finance Canada Category:Canadian budgets Category:41st Canadian Parliament Category:2015 in Canadian politics Canadian federal budget federal budget ","title":"2015 Canadian federal budget"},{"id":"46368700","text":"Jonathan F.

It is also the name of an area in the Sturt Plateau, known as the Beetaloo Sub-Basin or Beetaloo Basin, around south-east of Darwin, between Mataranka to the north and Elliott to the south. This area is rich in natural gas, which can be exploited by fracking, which has caused controversy. ==Beetaloo Station== Beetaloo Station is situated about north east of Elliott and south west of Borroloola. The property is surrounded by other pastoral leases including Hayfield, Amungee Mungee and Tanumbirini Stations to the north, Hayfield and Newcastle Waters Station to the west, Tandyidgee, Ucharonidge and Mungabroom to the south and the Mambilya-Rrumburriya Aboriginal Land Trust to the east. The Carpentaria Highway crosses the property through the north east corner and the Newcastle Creek flows through a good portion of the lease from east to west. The property currently occupies an area of and was purchased by the Dunnicliff- Armstrong family in 2002 for 20 million. at a cost of 20 million. The Station was established in the 1890s by Harry M. Bathern who had overlanded cattle to many other properties in the Territory including Brunette Downs, Eva Downs and Emu Downs. When Bathern died in 1928 the property occupied an area of . Several bushfires in 1951 burnt out a total of across Beetaloo and neighbouring Newcastle Waters stations, with Beetaloo reported to be one of the worst affected. Compounding the immediate loss of stock and grazing pasture, drought followed the fires leading to further losses of the surviving stock. The manager, Wally Bathern, expressed concern that when the wet season arrived, bogs would form around waterholes and the weakened cattle were at risk of becoming stuck. ==Beetaloo Basin== The Beetaloo Basin, is situated in the Sturt Plateau region, between Mataranka to the north and Elliott to the south. Exploration for gas in the area started before 2008, but the Scientific Inquiry into Hydraulic Fracturing which concluded in April 2018 found that the recent discoveries of shale gas were very significant. However, both pastoralists and the traditional Aboriginal caretakers of the land alike fear that rivers and water sources in the region could be polluted by the waste produced in the fracking process. The Indigenous rangers working in the new Mimal Indigenous Protected Area are very concerned about the level of greenhouse gases which would be released by the fracking work, potentially jeopardising Australia's Paris emissions reduction target. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations ==References== Category:Stations (Australian agriculture) Category:Pastoral leases in the Northern Territory ","title":"Beetaloo"},{"id":"46368713","text":"was a university with two campuses in Hokkaido, Japan: the Sapporo campus in Minami-ku, which housed the School of Engineering and the School of International Cultural Relations; and the Asahikawa campus, which housed the School of Art and Technology.\\"DIRECTIONS TO HOKKAIDO TOKAI UNIVERSITY (HTU)\\" ().

Orr and Loveless play the gorgeous new roommates who share an obsession with food. == Plot == Jealous of her thin supermodel roommate Jennifer, the plus-sized Jill binges and purges in an attempt to maintain her weight. Their relationship becomes even more strained as Jennifer mocks Jill's issues. Overcome with hatred, Jill lashes out at her roommate and chains Jennifer to the wall, where she taunts her with food. As Jill falls further into madness, her hygiene suffers, as does the cleanliness of the apartment.http://horrorfreaknews.com/excess-flesh-2015-review None of this seems to concern the women's neighbors and the love interest of the movie as they come to try to check on the women, and Jennifer continues to insult Jill even while restrained. Jennifer manages to escape at one point and Jill manages to catch up to her on the street just as police officers in passing notice the girls' state of near undress. Despite having officers there, Jennifer says nothing. Jill attributes Jennifer's catatonic state to insomnia and stress and manages to get Jennifer back to the apartment. Jill bathes Jennifer, telling her how she was worried and scared about her. Jennifer finally tries to call for help and Jill strangles her into unconsciousness. Pushed to the edge by Jennifer's continual abuse, Jill finally stabs her to death and envisions taking her place on the modeling stage; however, Jill is seen still alone in the dirty apartment, implying that Jennifer only existed in Jill's mind. == Cast == * Bethany Orr as Jill * Mary Loveless as Jennifer * Wes McGee as Rob * Sheresade Poblet as Cathy * Jill Jacobson as Beverly * Dana L. Wilson as Becky * Kristin Minter as Nina * Robert Maffia as Officer Jimmy * Jules Bruff as Office Marie * Juan Riedinger as Sebastian * Doug Locke as Terence * Saif Xnaydra as Young Hollywood *Allen Rueckert as Trevor == Production == Kennelly came up with the idea for the film ten years prior its release after reading about eating disorders and how they can physicalize mental issues. The isolation of living in Los Angeles was another inspiration, and Kennelly said that the situations in the story came from his and co-writer Gilmer's experiences. Kennelly wanted to create a horror film using the tropes of romantic comedies and sitcoms, genres that he said he found scary. Kennelly enjoys films that confront and challenge audiences, and he wanted this film to do the same. Kennelly had gone to school with Loveless and believed that she would be good for the role of Jennifer. Orr was cast after auditioning. The film was shot mostly in sequence. Orr and Loveless said that this contributed to developing a better understanding of their characters. There was also a practical reason: the apartment had to be progressively destroyed throughout the story. Due to the trashed set and food that was required to be left out, the crew wore masks. Orr said that she found her character to be an unlikely hero despite her being \\"brutally flawed\\". Shooting lasted for three weeks, and many scenes were done in four or less takes. Orr said that she spent so much time getting into character that it was difficult for her when shooting ended. Kennelly said of the film, \\"Excess Flesh is a visualization of what goes on inside a woman's head. It's about the nightmare of the self in the modern world.\\" The film's score was composed and produced by Jonathan Snipes, best known as a member of noise-rap group clipping. == Release == Excess Flesh premiered at South by Southwest on March 13, 2015. Midnight Releasing will release the film on DVD and video on demand on March 8, 2016. == Reception == Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle compared it to Nick Zedd's Cinema of Transgression and said that it is \\"nauseating, perceptive, and an altogether damning indictment of a hyper-consumerist society run amuck\\". Writing in The Daily Beast, Marlow Stern called it \\"the most twisted movie at SXSW—and of the year, so far\\". Susanna Jackson of WBUR-FM wrote that it is \\"handled both thoughtfully and perhaps over gratuitously\\". Shock Till You Drop's Samuel Zimmerman wrote, \\"This is a film as informed by the veneer of Los Angeles as it is sickened by it; a layer cake of aggression, shame and madness. It's pretty exhilarating.\\" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Excess Flesh starts out by asking the right questions about body shaming, but it quickly crumbles like a stale, tasteless fruitcake that's meant only for decoration.\\" Heather Wixson of Daily Dead rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the film is not as clever or insightful as it seems to think it is. == References  External links == * * * Video interview at Collider.com Category:2015 films Category:2015 horror films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:American body horror films Category:Films about food and drink ","title":"Excess Flesh"},{"id":"46369030","text":"Comin' Through is an album by American jazz trumpeter Eddie Henderson recorded in 1977 and released on the Capitol label.

A cortijo is a type of traditional rural dwelling (akin to the German Bauernhof, also known as a Farmhouse in English) in the Southern half of Spain, including all of Andalusia and parts of Extremadura and Castile-La Mancha.Antonio Alcalá Venceslada, Vocabulario Andaluz, El Mundo-Unidad Editorial, Barcelona 1999, p. 173 Cortijos may have their origins in ancient Roman villas, for the word is derived from the Latin cohorticulum, a diminutive of cohors, meaning 'courtyard' or inner enclosure.Manuel-Antonio Marcos Casquero, Marcus Terentius Varro, De lingua Latina: edición bilingüe, Anthropos Editorial, 1990, , pg. 69. They are often isolated structures associated with a large family farming or livestock operation in the vast and empty adjoining lands. ==Description== Ruins of an abandoned cortijo in the Archidona municipal term, Málaga Province. A cortijo would usually include a large house, together with accessory buildings such as workers' quarters, sheds to house livestock, granaries, oil mills, barns and often a wall limiting the enclosure where there were no buildings surrounding it.Antonio López Ontiveros et al. Geografía de Andalucía, Ed. Ariel, Barcelona 2003 It was also common for isolated cortijos to include a small chapel. In mountain areas, rough stone was often used for wall construction and ashlar for corners, doorways, windows and arches. In ancient cortijos, mud or slaked lime were used as mortar. However, the traditional materials were replaced by cement and brick construction in more recent ones. In places where stone was hard to come by, adobe was more common as a construction material. Usually cortijos were whitewashed. Roofs were built with wooden beam structures and covered with red ceramic roof tiles. The master of the cortijo or \\"señorito\\" would usually live with his family in a two story building when visiting, while the accessory structures were for the labourers and their families —also known as \\"cortijeros\\". The latter buildings were usually of more simple construction.Gemma Florido Trujillo: Poblamiento y hábitat rural: Caracterización, evolución y situación actual, p. 337 The cortijo as a habitat is surrounded by cultivated lands, such as olive trees or other kind of agricultural exploitation. In certain desolate areas of the southern Central Meseta, Extremadura and Sierra Morena, a cortijo would be the only inhabited center for many miles around. Thus, most of them were self-sufficient units, as far as that was possible. Many cortijos became deserted following General Franco's Plan de Estabilización and the abandonment of traditional agricultural practices by the local youth, including the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.Xavier Tafunell, (2004).

Busey Hall was built in 1916, while Evans Hall was built in 1926; a connector wing links the two buildings, and they are considered part of the same dormitory complex. James A. White designed Busey Hall, while Charles A. Platt designed Evans Hall; both architects played an important role in designing other buildings on the university's campus, and both chose the Georgian Revival style for their designs to match the campus's architectural theme. The Women's Residence Hall was the first residence hall on the university's campus; the all-female dormitory filled a need for women's housing at the university, which had been privately maintained and in short supply. The hall quickly filled up, and the West Residence Hall was built to provide additional space for female students. In 1937, the buildings were renamed for university trustees Mary E. Busey and Laura B. Evans. The residence halls were still in use as all-female student housing until the fall semester of 2019, when the Evans hall was designated as all male for the first time in its history to accommodate the closure of another all male residence hall on campus. The residence halls were added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 5, 2003. ==References== Category:University and college dormitories in the United States Category:University and college buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Georgian Revival architecture in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1916 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Champaign County, Illinois Category:Buildings and structures of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign Category:Buildings and structures in Urbana, Illinois ","title":"Busey–Evans Residence Halls"},{"id":"46369078","text":"To Release Is to Resolve is the fifth Byzantine album, released independently on April 7, 2015.

She is best known for her collaborations with Italian fashion house Dolce & Gabbana. == Early life == Hennink was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands to a Dutch mother and a Surinamese father of partial black African ancestry. She was raised by her mother, who happened to be a hippie. From as young as the age of four, Hennink expressed an interest in modeling, though she did not begin working as a model until she turned sixteen, after having been discovered by a magazine editor in her native Amsterdam. This happened despite being rejected by the Eileen Ford agency during a casting call. == Career == Among the first fashion designers that Hennink modeled for were Kenzo and Yohji Yamamoto. She credited the late fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez with recommending her to some of the prominent designers, such as Azzedine Alaia, and Karl Lagerfeld of the fashion house Chanel. Most notably, Hennink walked the runway for Dolce & Gabbana's first fashion show in 1985, at the beginning of their career as designers. The same year, she appeared in the music video for Bryan Ferry's song, \\"Slave to Love\\", directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino. Hennink went on to walk the runway for many other designers including Versace, Christian Lacroix, Valentino, Christian Dior, Gianfranco Ferré, Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Issey Miyake, Moschino, Claude Montana, Salvatore Ferragamo, Comme des Garçons, Lanvin, Thierry Mugler, Donna Karan, Trussardi, Mila Schön, Rifat Özbek, Bruce Oldfield, Ted Lapidus, and Betty Jackson. She was given the nickname \\"the Catwalk Contessa\\". In 1987, Hennink was chosen by Dolce & Gabbana to star in the advertising campaign for their Fall/Winter collection. It was the first campaign for the label, and Hennink agreed to do it for free. The campaign was photographed in Sicily by Ferdinando Scianna of Magnum Photos. The photographs from the campaign made such an impression that Hennink came to be seen as an icon of Mediterranean femininity. In October of that year, Hennink was named \\"Model of the Year\\". She was sometimes paired with model Veronica Webb in fashion shows and in magazine photo spreads. Some of the magazines that Hennink has been featured in include various international editions of Vogue, as well as other publications such as Elle, Glamour, Time, Vanity Fair, Marie Claire, L'Officiel, and Photo. In 1993, Hennink retired from modeling, having been put off by the arrival of the grunge fashion trend. Upon her retirement, she moved to Ibiza, Spain, where she began a career as an interior decorator. She made a return to the fashion runways in 2004, where she closed the Fall/Winter show for designer Antonio Marras. In January 2011, Hennink was chosen to walk in a special fashion show held by designer Alberta Ferretti in Florence, Italy. Then, in May 2011, she walked in the \\"Fashion for Relief\\" benefit show in Cannes, France. The following year, Dolce & Gabbana launched a line of made-to-measure clothing called \\"Alta Moda\\", and chose Hennink as the global ambassador for that line. == Personal life == Hennink speaks six languages. In her spare time, she enjoys photography. She considers Inès de La Fressange, Diana Vreeland, and Madeleine Castaing as her style icons. In 2005, Hennink gave birth to a daughter. == References == Category:Living people Category:1964 births Category:Dutch female models Category:Dutch expatriates in Spain Category:Dutch people of Surinamese descent Category:People from Amsterdam Category:People from Ibiza ","title":"Marpessa Hennink"},{"id":"46369164","text":"The Göteborg Masters was a women's professional golf tournament on the Ladies European Tour that took place in Sweden.

This vessel was once one of the finest and fastest steamboats on the Columbia River and Puget Sound. As newer vessels came into service, Emma Hayward was relegated to secondary roles, and, by 1891, was converted into a Columbia river tow boat. In 1900, the machinery was stripped out of the boat, which was used as a floating workshop and storeroom until 1905, when it was sold to be converted into a barge. Emma Hayward was involved in a wide variety of maritime work, including the transport of troops to Seattle when martial law was declared in that city to counter anti-Chinese riots. ==Dimensions== Emma Hayward was measured over the hull (not including the stern extension of the deck to mount the stern wheel), with a beam (width), again measured over the hull and exclusive of the guards (wide protective beams of heavy timber along the upper edge of the hull), of , and a depth of hold of . ==Construction== In 1871, Emma Hayward was built at Portland, Oregon by John J. Holland (1843-1893) for the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, to operate on the lower Columbia river from Portland and the Cascades to Astoria. Accounts from that time sometimes refer to this vessel as the A. Hayward. Holland was an accomplished steamboat builder, who would build many of the largest and best known steamers. Up until this time, the Astoria route had been somewhat neglected by the O.S.N. in favor of more profitable operations upriver to the Cascades. According to one non- contemporaneous source, the machinery was fitted by engineer David Pardun (1830-1890). According to a contemporaneous source, the machinery was \\"put up\\" by John Gates, chief engineer of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. The twin horizontal steam engines for Hayward came from the dismantled steamer Webfoot. Each engine had a bore of and stroke of . In January 1878, new boilers were built for the Hayward and another sternwheeler, the New Tenino, at the Willamette Iron Works. Each boiler would be 30 feet long and contain 150 tubes, each 2.5 inches in diameter. Hayward was said to \\"dwarf\\" all other boats on the river in size. The vessel has been described as having \\"good cabins and comfortable parlors.\\" ==Launch== Hayward was launched on May 31, 1871. The boat was later towed upriver to the O.S.N. dock, where on the afternoon of July 31, 1871, the boiler was installed. Hayward was then taken back downriver to the O.S.N. boatyard (called the \\"boneyard\\" because of the accumulation of old steamers there) for completion. Hayward made its trial trip on September 28 of the same year. ==Initial service on the Columbia== Advertisement published May 8, 1872, for an excursion of the Improved Order of Red Men to Sauvie Island. Emma Hayward was first placed in service, for a short time, on the Columbia on the route to the Cascades, taking the place of the sidewheeler Oneonta. This was to allow Oneonta to be laid up for repairs. The route from Portland to the Cascades was 86 miles long. As of July 1872, Hayward was on this route, running daily except Sundays, for which the passenger fare was $2.50. According to the July 1872 schedule, Hayward departed Portland at 5:00 a.m. for Vancouver, departed Vancouver at 6:30 a.m., and arrived at the Cascades at 10:30 a.m. Returning, Hayward was scheduled, perhaps optimistically, to depart the Cascades at 10:30 a.m., the same minute as the boat arrived, return to Vancouver by 2:00 p.m., and from there back to Portland by 3:30 in the afternoon. Hayward was later reassigned to the Portland-Astoria run, where the vessel served for the next ten years. In the first years on this run, the Hayward ran on alternating days with the \\"less elegant\\" Dixie Thompson, also built in 1871. As of August 12, 1873, the Haywood ran downriver to Astoria every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and returned to Portland the following day. At the same time, the alternate boat, Dixie Thompson left Astoria for Portland every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, returning to Astoria the next day. The Portland terminus of the run was at the O.S.N. dock at the foot of Ash street. Haywood was also reported to have been engaged in towing work in 1873, towing the brig Orient up the Columbia on October 27, 1873. Orient was carrying iron for the Northern Pacific Railroad, to complete its line into Tacoma, W.T. Although considered a luxury passenger vessel, Hayward also transported livestock, such as 30 head of mules on April 30, 1875, from Portland to Kalama, W.T.. On one trip, on April 17, 1876, Hayward made 44 landings on the trip downriver from Portland to Astoria. In later years on this route, Hayward was placed in service as a night passenger boat. ==Competition from Ben Holladay== In the early 1870s, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, which for about 10 years had held a monopoly on river transport on the Columbia, was challenged by the People’s Transportation Company, which was controlled by the unscrupulous businessman Ben Holladay. In 1874, Holladay put the sternwheelers Willamette Chief and the newly constructed Beaver in competition with the Hayward and another O.S.N boat, the Josie McNear. As a result of the competition, passenger fares were driven down to $1, and freight rates were lowered to $1 a ton. There were numerous collisions between the rival vessels. One of these collisions, between the Hayward and the Beaver, was reported to have been \\"serious.\\" By 1876, however, the O.S.N. had bested Holladay and acquired all of his boats. ==Speed== When built, Emma Hayward was said to have been the finest boat on the lower Columbia river. For a time, Emma Hayward was the fastest vessel on the river. As of December 1878, Hayward’s fastest time from Portland to Vancouver, a distance of 18 miles, was 65 minutes. ==Ownership change== In 1879, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company sold most of its assets, including Hayward and other vessels, to the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. The O.R.&N; had just completed a rail line along the Columbia river, making it difficult for the steamboats to compete for business. The formal deed of sale was executed and filed with the office of the Multnomah County clerk on March 31, 1880. As a result of the sale, the O.R & N controlled every steamboat of note on the Columbia River except for the Lurline, owned by Jacob Kamm, and a few smaller vessels operating on routes out of Portland. ==Rescue of the Edith== On March 10, 1880, the towboat Edith was proceeding upriver under the command of Capt. Archie Pease. Edith was towing a log raft when the boat caught fire when the vessel had nearly reached St. Helens. The fire was discovered in the wood around the boiler, and it was this proximity which apparently caused the blaze. The wood was packed so tightly that it couldn’t be removed to be thrown overboard. It was necessary to cut loose from the log raft and beach the vessel. The crew on Edith saw the Emma Hayward coming upriver, and signaled to the sternwheeler, and the larger vessel, with Captain Babbidge at the wheel, came to the aid of the beached towboat. The crew on Hayward hooked up the firehose to the steam pumps, and used it to spray water on the Edith. Even so, it was still necessary to cut two holes in the towboat's deck to extinguish the fire. Edith probably would have been destroyed had Emma Hayward not intervened. As it was, damage to Edith was estimated at $500. The log raft was secured by the dispatch of a small steamer from St. Helens. ==Fare war with Fleetwood== Advertisement for the steamers, including Emma Hayward, by the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, circa 1878. The O.R.&N; did not complete the eastbound rail line out of Portland until 1882. During the interval between the O.R.& N's acquisition of the O.S.N. fleet in 1880 and completion of the railway in 1882, river traffic was booming, and profits were very great, even though fares were much lower than under the O.S.N. In May 1881 the O.R.& N’s river division had gross revenue of $178,450, and net revenue, after deducting all expenses, was $88,450. By comparison, Emma Hayward was valued at $10,000 on July 1, 1881. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, the O.R. & N's river division carried 131,665 passengers and 422,082 tons of freight. This level of profit attracted competitors, of which the most capable was Captain U.B. Scott, who, with his associates, had been very successful in operations on the Willamette river. Scott and his allies set up a competitor to the O.R.&N;, using the newly built propeller-driven Fleetwood on the Columbia below the Cascades, and competing above the Cascades with the Gold Dust, which they had hauled overland around the rapids at the Cascades. The O.R.&N.; responded with a tactic typical of its predecessor, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, that is, a predatory rate cut. O.R. & N. cut fares from Portland to The Dalles down to 50 cents. But Fleetwood was so much faster than the O.R.& N’s boat on the lower river, the Dixie Thompson, that Scott was able to meet the competition for several weeks, but eventually the big company overwhelmed him on the middle Columbia, and Scott was forced to sell Gold Dust to the O.R.&N.; This however left Scott with Fleetwood on the lower river, which included the now-booming route to Astoria. The growing demand for riverine transport was fueled by the rapidly developing salmon and logging industries. Fleetwood cut two hours off the time on the Astoria route, and forced the O.R.& N to run not one but four boats against Scott’s steamer. Emma Hayward and Bonita, plus whatever freight they could quickly load, followed along behind Fleetwood trying to pick up passengers from the landings, while the slower Dixie Thompson and Willamette Chief picked up whatever freight that Hayward and Bonita could not load. This was very expensive for the O.R.& N, which was forced to reduce fares on the route from $5 to $2. ==Transfer to Puget Sound== Emma Hayward, center (next to pier), moored in Seattle, June 6, 1891. Large steamer on left is T.J. Potter. The O.R.&N; wished to expand its newly acquired steamboat operations to Puget Sound. To this end in 1882, under Capt. J.E. Denny and Engineer Pardun, the Hayward was taken out across the Columbia Bar into the open Pacific Ocean and then around the Olympic Peninsula, arriving in Seattle on October 24, 1882. Business was booming on the Sound, and the Hayward handled \\"an immense traffic,\\", making a round trip every day from Olympia to Tacoma, where a connection would be made with the trains of the Northern Pacific Railway. As of October 15, 1887, Emma Hayward was placed on a schedule running from Seattle to Olympia. Under the new schedule, Emma Hayward would run daily except Sunday, departing Seattle at 4:00 a.m, and reaching Tacoma at 6:15 a.m., where connections would be made with the train running to Portland. The boat would then proceed to Olympia, reaching that port at 11:30 a.m. Departing Olympia at 1:00 p.m., the boat would reach Tacoma at 4:00 p.m., and remain there until 6:30 p.m. to connect with the train coming from Portland. After that, the steamer would return to Seattle, arriving at 8:45 p.m. On April 21, 1889, the Hayward began making regular runs from Tacoma to Whatcom. When newer, faster, and finer vessels, such as the City of Kingston and the big sidewheeler Olympian began to be placed in service on the Sound, the Hayward was relegated to secondary status. Hayward also worked on Bellingham Bay and ran between Seattle and Tacoma. One of the masters of the Hayward while on Puget Sound was the Captain Theophilus Green (1848-1910), who commanded a number of sternwheelers on the Sound, and trained many men who later became steamboat masters themselves. Green himself was to later perish in the pilot house of the propeller Vashonian, dropping dead just after he gave the signal over the engine room telegraph to stop engines at Chatauqua Landing on Vashon Island. ==Transport of troops to suppress anti-Chinese riots== Emma Hayward probably on Puget Sound, between 1882 and 1891. As a result of anti-Chinese riots in Seattle in early 1886, President Grover Cleveland declared martial law, and ordered Gen. John Gibbon to proceed to the city with 300 troops to suppress the rioting. The troops, consisting of eight companies of the 14th Infantry regiment, under the command of Lt. Col. I.D. De Russey, were transported to Seattle on the Emma Hayward. They arrived at about 3:00 pm on February 10, 1886. They were met at the pier by a detachment of the Home Guards and the Seattle Rifles. ==Loss of deckhand== On June 18, 1891, somewhere en route from Whatcom to Tacoma, a deckhand fell overboard from the Hayward. It was not known where the man had disappeared from the vessel, nor was it determined whether the hand had fallen overboard or committed suicide. ==Return to the Columbia== Emma Hayward with a Benson raft in tow. A few months before September 1891, Hayward sustained a broken stern wheel shaft in an accident while bound from Whatcom to Seattle. At this time, the boat was owned by the Union Pacific and operated as part of the railroad’s steamship division. After the accident, Hayward was towed to Tacoma, where Union Pacific port captain, one Clancy, ordered that repairs be made. This required the sternwheel to be removed from the boat. Work was suspended after the wheel was removed. The new Union Pacific Puget Sound port captain, E.R. Rathbone, decided to send Hayward to the Columbia River. On September 25, 1891, Hayward was towed from Tacoma to Seattle, where immediate preparations were made for the boat be towed to the Columbia, with the departure scheduled to occur on September 29, 1891. According to a Seattle newspaper, the reason for the transfer was that \\"the people of the Sound demand more elegant and faster means of navigation than is afforded in steamers of the Hayward’s class.\\" Hayward was towed back around to the Columbia river by the large ocean-going steam tug Escort, also known as Escort No. 2 (built 1882; 146 tons). This was the first time in the history of the Northwest that a sternwheeler had made the voyage without a wheel in place and without having steam up. Sternwheel propelled-boats, in addition to being lightly built for inland work, would have difficulty keeping the sternwheel in the water as ocean swells would lift the paddles clear from the water. Towing was expected to alleviate these difficulties. Hayward and Escort No. 2 arrived in Astoria in September. Upon return to the Columbia, Hayward was placed into service as a towboat. ==Towboat work== Use as a towboat appears not to have prevented Hayward from being used as a troop transport. On September 15, 1892, the boat transported five companies of the 14th infantry regiment from Portland to Vancouver. The companies were returning from the Coeur d’Alene mines, where they had been stationed for two months. Wheat grown in the farming regions of the Pacific Northwest was an important export from Portland. Towboats like Emma Hayward played their role. For example, on November 16, 1894, Hayward towed out the British three-masted ship Evesham Abbey, loaded with wheat, from Portland downstream to Astoria. Hayward remained a useful vessel for a long time. For example, on September 28, 1898, Emma Hayward brought the British ship Lord Kinnaird upriver from Astoria in 12 hours, picking up the tow at 8:00 a.m. and reaching Portland at 8:00 p.m. This was not a record-breaking time, but it was considered good for a vessel as old as Hayward. ==Last years== Until about 1900, Hayward was owed by the O.R.&N.; In 1900, the O.R.&N; sold Hayward to the Shaver Transportation Company. The Shaver firm removed the engines, installed them into another vessel, reportedly the Sarah Dixon. The Shaver firm then moored the hulk at the foot of Washington Street in Portland, and used it as a workshop and storeroom. On June 5, 1905, the Shavers sold the unpowered Hayward to Capt. James Good, who owned two small propeller-driven steamers, both built in 1899, America (99 tons) and Republic (88 tons). Good planned to dismantleHayward, and convert it into a barge to transport slabwood into Portland. The conversion work was to be done in St. Helens, Oregon. ==NotesSee also== *Steamboats of the Columbia River *Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet Category:Passenger ships of the United States Category:Steamboats of the Columbia River Category:Steamboats of Oregon Category:Steamboats of Washington (state) Category:Ships built in Portland, Oregon Category:1871 ships Category:Oregon Steam Navigation Company Category:Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company ","title":"Emma Hayward"},{"id":"46369184","text":"Paspampres Resident or Perumahan Paspampres is the Housing in the Bogor Regency of West Java, Indonesia.

During that time, his fastballs already sparked the interest of some scouts as it reached the 145 km/h levels, but in the end, none of the 12 NPB teams drafted him when he graduated high school. Wanting to pursue a career in baseball, he joined the industrial leagues under Shin Nittetsu Sumikin Kashima. However, he began experiencing lower back pains shortly after he joined the team. Apparently, this was brought about by the strain that resulted from his overhead pitching form, and as a solution, he decided to alter his delivery form to a lower arm angle. With a stroke of luck, the altered form worked to his advantage, bringing his pitches to a maximum of 151 km/h, making him indispensable to the team. ==Hanshin Tigers== On October 2014, he was chosen as the Hanshin Tigers 2nd pick in the annual professional baseball draft. He signed with the Tigers on November 17 for an estimated 12 million yen annual salary, and a 70 million yen signing bonus.

The Randolph Square Matter was used as a euphemism for the dust up which eventually led George Washington to fire L'Enfant, and turn the design project over to Ellicott. The square would have been located near the current Shaw Library between 7th and 9th streets NW and R and S streets NW. ==History== After the Revolutionary War, George Washington involved himself personally in the building of a federal capital on the Potomac River, spanning the Maryland border with Virginia. After L'Enfant had served under Washington in the Revolutionary Army, Washington had hired the young architect to perform various services in New York, including converting the old city hall into Federal Hall, then the seat of Congress. In 1791, Washington appointed L'Enfant to design the layout of the new capital city, and Andrew Ellicott, another revolutionary veteran, to survey the existing land on which the city would be built. Also heavily involved in the planning of the capital city was Thomas Jefferson, whose image for the future capital was egalitarian and simple, even understated.Miller, pp. 40-43. It was the tension between Jefferson's simplistic model for the city and L'Enfant's ostentatious image of a grand capital city, as well as Jefferson's preference for Mr. Ellicott, which would lead to the downfall of L'Enfant, and Square No. 15. Over the course of 1791-1792, L'Enfant created his plan for the city, full of symbolic design elements and sweeping vistas (see: L'Enfant Plan). Jefferson, though his humble image for the city's design contrasted strongly with the grand vision of L'Enfant, successfully coordinated the project and facilitated communication between L'Enfant, Ellicott, and Washington.Miller, p. 34. But as L'Enfant began to run into road blocks related to cost and just how grand he intended the new city to become, he began to lose control of the project. Washington attempted to intervene on L'Enfant's behalf, but eventually the tide had turned too far against the French architect.Miller, p. 35. The final straw occurred when L'Enfant invoked the power of eminent domain to demolish the partially constructed mansion of Daniel Carroll, a wealthy landholder from an even wealthier family, when the home protruded seven feet into the roadway at New Jersey Avenue SE. After that, and several other missteps, Jefferson approached Ellicott privately and entreated him to improve upon L'Enfant's plan for the city, and submit what would be called the Ellicott Plan to President Washington for approval. L'Enfant was effectively removed from the project and would spend the rest of his life living off of friends, his grand vision unrealized and uncredited. ==The Plans and Square No. 15== Detail of L'Enfant's 1791 plan for Washington with Square No. 15 outlined in red L'Enfant's plan for the city included a simple grid plan, overlaid with diagonal avenues radiating from the President's House and the Capitol. Due to the large intersections created when diagonal streets met grid intersections, L'Enfant installed a number of squares and plazas (now traffic circles) to his design. Among these squares was a square bordered by 7th and 9th streets NW and by S and R streets NW. The Square, labeled \\"Square No. 15\\" on the L'Enfant map, was sliced at a perfect diagonal by Rhode Island Avenue NW.Miller, p. 37. Importantly for the story of Square No. 15, L'Enfant feared that the longest avenues, especially Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, would challenge elements of his design strategy, and therefore he created small angles at the larger intersections to break up the longest avenues.Miller, p. 45. Among the most dramatic changes to the map, Rhode Island Avenue no longer crossed through Square No. 15 at the perfect angle that it had in the L'Enfant plan, and as such was eliminated from Washington, DC.Miller, p. 46. At HathiTrust Digital Library. Detail of Ellicott's 1792 plan for Washington with the space where Square No. 15 would be, outlined in red There are various theories as to why the changes were made to the city in Ellicott's new map. In her book, Washington in Maps, Iris Miller suggests it may have been due in no small part to Ellicott's lack of vision. \\"Examine Elements from L'Enfant's plan that Ellicott declined to grasp. One finds that Ellicott's engravings reflect the hand and mentality of an American-trained surveyor- not a European urban artist. In L'Enfant's late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth-century France, inventive composition of loosely gridded streets and radiating diagonal avenues was perfected by Andre Le Notre based upon philosophies of Descartes, Pascal and others. These responded to variations in topography that influenced spatial perception. Ellicott's regularized application of this plan neglected to account for design illusions that enhance urbanism.\\"Miller, p. 44. It cannot be ignored, however, that L'Enfant was extremely unpopular by the time Ellicott took over the project. He was known as \\"the crazy Frenchman,\\" blew through his budget, made demands on officials and landowners alike, and made life generally unpleasant for many around him. Ellicott had been working with L'Enfant throughout the project and was a close personal confidant of Jefferson who had become a strong critic of the architect. It is unclear, therefore, whether those small changes to the map may have been made merely out of spite, or whether the spite was merely a side dish to the Iris Miller's explanation above, but the spite gave rise to the lost square's name. The changes between the two maps were largely subtle, and therefore the four square block missing square was one of the more noticeable changes between L'Enfant and Ellicott's plan and became something of a symbol for those who had become fed up with L'Enfant's antics, of which there were many. Washington mourned the removal of his friend from the position of architect of the Capital city, and therefore praise of Jefferson for his hand in removing the L'Enfant were subtle. Rather than make direct reference to Jefferson, therefore, those who wished to gloat referred to the \\"Randolph Square\\" matter, referring to the disappearing square in the Ellicott Plan by the name of Jefferson's Mother, the well known Jane Randolph Jefferson. ==Randolph Square Today== Today, the area which would have been Randolph Square is located in the Shaw Neighborhood in Washington.

On 28 June 1914, Mayor Čurčić welcomed Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg to Sarajevo and was present later the same day at their assassination, the event that sparked World War I. He died aged 50 in an Austrian sanatorium. ==Early life== Fehim Čurčić's father Ragib pictured in 1888 shortly before his death Čurčić was born into a prominent family of ethnic Bosniaks who relocated to Sarajevo from Livno in the late 17th century. His father Ragib Čurčić (1824 – 4 July 1888) was a statesman in the Ottoman Empire, and the final mayor of Sarajevo under Ottoman rule from March 1875 until the Austrian occupation in August 1878. Fehim Čurčić had a brother named Muhamed, and two sisters. The family was Muslim. ==Politics== Čurčić was working as a political aspirant in administrative country service. He attended course for officers and became a spare officer. Čurčić, who was repeatedly elected to Sarajevo's City Council, will go down in history as the last mayor of Sarajevo during the Austro-Hungarian rule over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Coincidentally, his father Ragib was the last mayor of Sarajevo in 1878 during Ottoman rule. In the 14 November 1910 election for Mayor of Sarajevo, incumbent mayor Esad Kulović won a third term by an \\"overwhelming\\" majority, but refused post, thus the position was handed over to 44-year-old Fehim Čurčić. Coincidentally the last Bosnian census during Austro-Hungarian rule was conducted in the 1910 election year. Sarajevo at that time had 51,919 inhabitants. He took post on 29 December 1910. During his tenure, Čurčić opened the Chamber of Education in 1911. A year later the Kino Apolo (Apollo Cinema) was opened. Also, the city's main post office was constructed by Josip Vancaš, while the Museum of Sarajevo, as well as the Judicial Palace and the Faculty of Law building at the University of Sarajevo were constructed by Karel Pařík. Čurčić held post until 1915 when the City representation was dismissed. ==1914 assassination== On 28 June 1914, Mayor Čurčić delivered a keynote address at City Hall (which is today the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina), where he welcomed the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo with Governor Oskar Potiorek. The first attempt on the life of the archduke failed. Čurčić rode in the first car with the Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde and was unaware of what had transpired at the bridge. The noise of the motorcade had drowned out the bomb. Gavrilo Princip managed to assassinate Ferdinand and his wife in the second attempt, an event that sparked the First World War that changed the world. ==References== Category:1866 births Category:1916 deaths Category:People from Sarajevo Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Mayors of Sarajevo Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina politicians ","title":"Fehim Čurčić"},{"id":"46369644","text":"Metius (1571–1635) was a Dutch geometer and astronomer.

Teitiota's case became a cause célèbre for environmentalists and human rights activists as it made its way towards the Supreme Court. Teitiota was declined application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in July 2015. In September 2015 Teitiota was placed in police custody and deported back to Kiribati. Teitiota's case gained international media attention as being that of the world's first climate change refugee. As Kenneth R. Weiss wrote, \\"Consequently, over the past year, this 38-year-old migrant farmworker has become an unlikely international celebrity, a stand-in for the thousands of people in Kiribati—as well as millions more worldwide—expected to be forced from their homes due to rising seas and other disruptions on a warming planet. Teitiota is a contender to become the world’s first climate refugee, albeit an accidental one.\\" Teitiota challenged his removal under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In October 2019, the UN Human Rights Committee declared his communication admissible but found no violation of Teitiota's right to life. ==Background== Teitiota and his wife arrived in New Zealand from Kiribati in 2007 and continued to reside in the country illegally after the expiration of their permits.Teitiota v Chief Executive of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [5]. The couple have two children who were born in New Zealand but are not entitled to New Zealand citizenship.Teitiota v Chief Executive of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [5]. After being arrested, Teitiota applied for refugee or protected person status, which was declined by an immigration official.Teitiota v Chief Executive of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [6]. Teitiota appealed the decision of the immigration official to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal, Counsel for Teitiota sought leave to appeal the judgment of the Tribunal on questions of law unsuccessfully in the High Court before seeking the leave of the Court of Appeal. ==Judgment== As an extremely low-lying country, surrounded by vast oceans, Kiribati is at risk from the negative effects of climate change, such as sea-level rise and storm surges. Counsel for Teitiota raised six questions of law in their application for leave to appeal. The Court dismissed the application for leave to appeal as they found no arguable case on any of the questions of law raised. The judgment of the Court was delivered by Justice Wild. The first question of law dealt with by Wild J was > As the word “refugee” constitutes and incorporates those who are refugees by > way of climate change and its effects, did the Tribunal err in law in using > the term “sociological refugee” to distinguish what could amount to valid > grounds for Mr Teitiota to seek refugee status?Teitiota v Chief Executive of > Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [11]. Wild J held that the Tribunal had correctly defined refugee in the context of the Immigration Act 2009, which imports the definition of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Refugees were those persons, > … owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, > religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political > opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing > to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that > country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of > his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, > owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.Teitiota v Chief Executive > of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [13]. Furthermore, Wild J held that the Tribunal had correctly defined the meaning of, \\"being persecuted\\" [which] rested on human agency, although it could encompass non-state actors. It accepted the requirement for some form of human agency did not mean climate change could never “create pathways into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction\\".Teitiota v Chief Executive of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [18]. And Wild J held that Tribunal's reasoning that Teitiota would not be persecuted if returned to Kiribati was legally sound. The second question dealt with by the Court concerned whether the Tribunal's ruling erred in law when it found that because everyone in Kiribati would suffer from climate change, Teitiota was disqualified from refugee status.Teitiota v Chief Executive of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [27]. Wild J held that the second question was a reformulation of the first, and that the part of the judgment Teitiota was appealing merely expressed the view that he was not being persecuted under one of the five protected grounds - race, religion, nationality, membership of a social group, or holding a political opinion.Teitiota v Chief Executive of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [28]. The third question concerned whether the Tribunal had erred by not failing to consider that climate change was caused by indirect human agency. Wild J said, \\"the question is not open for serious argument\\".Teitiota v Chief Executive of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [31]. Questions four and five concerned the effect of returning to Kiribati on Teitiota's children. On these questions Wild J approved the decision in the High Court where Priestly J had ruled that on these points there was no identifiable error of law.Teitiota v Chief Executive of Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment [2014] NZCA 173 at [35]. Kiribati comprises 33 atolls and reef islands and one raised coral island, Banaba. They have a total land area of 800 square kilometres (310 sq mi), and are dispersed over 3.5 million square kilometres, (1,351,000 square miles). The sixth question concerned whether the Tribunal had made an error of law by finding that in Kiribati supplies of food and water are adequate. Wild J held this question was not open to serious argument, Wild J concluded the judgment by stating, ==References * The Making of a Climate Refugee, Ioane Teitiota profiled by Foreign Policy (January 2015). * Teitiota v Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment [2015 NZSC 107 (20 July 2015)] Category:Court of Appeal of New Zealand cases Category:2014 in New Zealand law Category:2014 in case law Category:Environmental law in New Zealand Category:Politics of climate change Category:Right of asylum in New Zealand Category:Kiribati–New Zealand relations Category:Right of asylum case law Category:I-Kiribati emigrants to New Zealand fr:Réfugié écologique#Ioane Teitiota ","title":"Teitiota v Chief Executive Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment"},{"id":"46369821","text":"Yauza is a Moscow Railway station on the Yaroslavsky suburban railway line in Moscow, Russia.

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged.

It was published by Shogakukan, with serialization on Sho-Comi magazine and with seven volumes compiling the chapters released between 2013 and 2015. ==Synopsis== Ai just loves her big brother, Yuzuru! He's so kind, so reliable, and so cool! He always protects Ai from trouble and when she cries, he cheers her up! He's the perfect big brother. But, bad things happen soon. Her parents divorce and she and her brother are separated! Now, after 9 years, one day Ai, now 14-years-old, finds a tall boy in front of her school! Who is this boy? ==Plot== As children, siblings Yuzuru and Ai have had a close relationship. Yuzuru was known as the doting and protective older brother, and defended Ai from bullies. However, their parents’ frequent arguments troubled them yet seemingly brought the two closer together. When they were 8 and 5 years old, their parents took them on a family vacation and all seemed to go well until they overheard their parents decision to divorce. Despite their fear of losing their family, Yuzuru promised to Ai they will be together forever. Shortly after, their parents officially divorce and the children are separated; Yuzuru moved to America with their father and Ai remained in Japan with their mother. Nine years later, Ai is 14-years-old and still wonders about her brother, whom she hasn’t had contact with other than a recent postcard. When she arrives at school, she finds an older boy who says Ai's name and she quickly realizes he is Yuzuru, and the share a happy reunion. Although they briefly get into an argument over how different they have become, they reconcile and decide to focus on reconnecting. Yuzuru explains he has lived in several different countries but he recently convinced their father to relocate to Japan for his job. Their mother tells Ai that she and her ex-husband have decided to remarry and the family begins living together again. The siblings are glad their parents reconciled and they will be able to be a family again. A year after reuniting, however, while they are moving into their new apartment, Ai accidentally falls on top of Yuzuru and kisses him. Ai immediately tries to pull away but Yuzuru kisses her again. When she questions him why he did it, he says it is a habit due to seeing people from overseas kiss as greetings, and he deduces it was Ai's first kiss. Yuzuru also reveals he will be living in his own apartment to be closer to his school. Ai begins to feel awkward around Yuzuru after the kiss and is sad he is living separately from her. She meets Nanoya at her entrance ceremony and they quickly become friends. However, Nanoya reveals she has had a crush on Yuzuru for a long time and hopes Ai can help her get closer to him, although Ai secretly feels jealous. Ai agrees to help Nanoya nevertheless. This and the gap between her and Yuzuru prompts Ai to realize she is falling in love with him, which deeply ashames her. Shortly after, she visits his high school and meets his best friend, Shuuji, who takes an instant liking to her. Ai tells Yuzuru he has an admirer but he brushes this off because he has a trail of fan girls. Nanoya persuades Ai to introduce her to Yuzuru and the four bond together. Their schools attend a two-day camping trip, through Ai will have to spend it studying. Nanoya announces her decision to confess to Yuzuru during the trip. However, during the trip, Ai struggles to hide her despair at being unable to show her feelings for Yuzuru and breaks down. Yuzuru finds her and tries to comfort her, but when she attempts to subconsciously kiss him, he sends her away and asks Nanoya to be his girlfriend. When Ai finds out, she is very sad but tries to hide this. Yuzuru returns home to celebrate Ai's 16th birthday but he invites Nanoya, who clings to Yuzuru and this ruins Ai's happiness at being able to celebrate with her brother. Ai begins to avoid Yuzuru, who decides to make up for this by taking her to Shibuya and spending the day with her, and gives her a heart-shaped hair ornament as a birthday gift. Ai is so touched by this that she kisses Yuzuru, who pushes her away and takes her home. The next day, Ai is met by Shuuji, who says he saw the kiss but promises to keep it a secret for her sake. At school, Yuzuru tells her they need to forget what happened but Ai finally breaks down and confesses she loves him. Yuzuru tries to rationalize with her but he also ends up confessing he loves her too, and they share an embrace. They begin a secret relationship although Ai feels unsecured about their parents finding out. To cheer her up, Yuzuru starts taking her out on dates after school and breaks up with Nanoya, who is devastated but tells Ai she refuses to give up on him. Shuuji asks Yuzuru if he is dating Ai and when he confirms this, Shuuji condemns him for committing incest but he is silenced when Yuzuru's anger intimidates him and he vows to steal Ai front Yuzuru. The four of them go to the beach for summer vacation, during which Nanoya witnesses Ai call him ‘Yuzuru’ rather than ‘Onii-chan’ and suspects they are closer than siblings, though Ai brushes this off when she questions Ai. They attend a festival and Nanoya gives Ai a flower hair ornament. Ai reluctantly helps Nanoya watch the fireworks with Yuzuru, who switched places with Shuuji so he could be with Ai. They share a kiss during the fireworks show but when a silhouetted picture of them surfaces, Nanoya realizes Yuzuru and Ai are a couple. She avoids Ai after ending their friendship and gives the picture to their mother. Yuzuru and Ai deny its them in the picture and their mother seems to believe them but Ai quickly realizes she doesn’t and warns Yuzuru. Ai tries to avoid Yuzuru to not draw suspicion and feels uncomfortable when Shuuji starts making romantic advances towards her. However, Shuuji tries to help them by introducing himself as Ai's boyfriend to her parents and he is the one kissing Ai in the picture. He then asks Ai to go on a date with him in return and she agrees. However, while going to meet him for the date, she sees Yuzuru and ditches Shuuji. Yuzuru and Ai go to Karuizawa and visit a church, where Yuzuru proposes to her and suggests they go somewhere no one knows them, and she accepts. However, they learn from their mother than their father has been killed in a plane crash while returning to America for work. Upon returning home, their mother lashes out at them for going out during such a tragic event and forbids them from seeing each other, to the point of keeping Ai confined to the apartment and taking her cell phone. Yuzuru meets his mother for the funeral but she largely avoids him. He later overhears her plan to move away with Ai but Yuzuru decides not to intervene. Once she is allowed to return to school, Ai learns Nanoya was responsible for telling her mother and Nanoya condemns Ai for being a hypocrite and she will never forgive her for lying to her. Ai also learns of her mother's intent to move away and rushes to Yuzuru. Although both want to be together, he acknowledges it is impossible. Ai compromises that she will end the relationship if she becomes his lover, and they have sex for the first time. Afterwards, they bid farewell and Ai gives back the heart-shape ornament. A year and a half later, Ai has established a closer relationship with her mother but she still misses Yuzuru. Her mother suggests Ai apply for college in Tokyo, which she agrees to. While there, Ai runs into Shuuji, who is a first year university student. When he mentions Yuzuru, Ai tells him that Yuzuru lives in America and she hasn’t heard anything from him in over a year. Ai insists she is trying to move on but when she thinks she sees Yuzuru but is sad when she realizes it wasn’t him, Shuuji knows she still can’t forget about Yuzuru. Meanwhile, Yuzuru attends a lab research university in America but although he is praised for his intelligence and gifted work skills, he refuses to associate with women, as he too is struggling to cope with his feelings for Ai. Yuzuru remembers when he was secretly leaving for America but Shuuji found out and demanded an explanation, which Yuzuru said he only came to Japan to see Ai and if he continued to stay, he would never forget about her and he is unsure if he will ever return. Ai is unsure if she should apply to such an expensive university and her mother reveals she and her husband got married and started their family while they were still students, and suggests Ai try an omiai. Although Ai is not interested in marrying someone she doesn’t know or like, she agrees to give a chance. The next day, Shuuji meets with his associate professor, who announces he is meeting Ai for the omiai. Shuuji immediately calls Yuzuru to tell him this but Yuzuru tries to brush it off because he only wants Ai to live her life. Shuuji runs into Nanoya at a restaurant and when she asks about Ai and Yuzuru, Shuuji asks her if she thinks it's possible for them to move on and reveals Ai's decision. Ai gets a job at a bakery and Nanoya finds her to confront her. Nanoya is still unable to forgive Ai but she finally understand why she and Yuzuru kept their relationship a secret, and she truly hopes Ai can live a happier life. She then asks Ai if she intends to go through with the omiai and Ai says she doesn’t want to get married but sees it as necessary to forget Yuzuru. Nanoya arrives in America for college and meets with Yuzuru, who is disappointed to see her. Nanoya tells Yuzuru she still has feelings for him and asks him to be her boyfriend. He rejects her because he doesn’t love her, and Nanoya begs him to stop Ai from marrying someone she doesn’t love but Yuzuru refuses because he blames himself for how Ai's life turned out. While talking to his professor, Yuzuru shows a photo of his father but the professor points out Yuzuru's father is the other man in the picture. The professor says he knew Yuzuru's parents and shows him another picture of them with Mr. Souda and a baby, and he gives Yuzuru a letter Mr. Souda left behind before he died. After reading it, Yuzuru rushes to the airport to get to Japan. The next day, Ai goes to the same church she and Yuzuru visited before and tries on a wedding dress. She is overwhelmed by her memories of Yuzuru and breaks down crying until Yuzuru surprises her by hugging her. Ai tries to reject him and Yuzuru reveals they are not siblings. In the letter, Mr. Souda wrote he knew about their relationship all along when he saw them holding hands and supported it, and he also revealed that Yuzuru's biological parents were siblings who left Japan and moved to America but were killed in a car accident shortly after Yuzuru's birth and Mr. Souda, who was a close friend, took the child in. Yuzuru tells Ai they are allowed to get married and they share an emotional embrace. Their mother admits she knew about this, as she was introduced to Yuzuru on her first date with Mr. Souda and was eager to raise him as her own. Yuzuru still decides to continue his studying in America and Ai agrees to have a long distance relationship because she is only happy they can be together. Several months later, Ai visits Yuzuru in America for Christmas and he had planned a romantic night for them but their plans are cancelled when he is called to the lab for work. Some of the women there make fun of Ai for looking so childish and Ai learns Yuzuru allowed a little girl to have her heart-shaped ornament but she is later given it back by the girl. Yuzuru purchases promise rings for him and Ai, and after vowing to love her forever, they spend the night together. They later visit Yuzuru's parents’ graves before Ai has to return to Japan. The following year, Nanoya gets married and everyone wonders if Ai and Yuzuru will get married. Ai says she understands Yuzuru's job in America is important to him and is content with a long distance relationship. Shuuji questions Yuzuru about this and Yuzuru says he doesn’t want to bring Ai to America and leave their mother alone. After spending the night together, Yuzuru tells Ai he will be staying in America for his job and Ai supports his decision. Their mother, who heard about the situation from Nanoya, confronts them, telling them to not give up their dreams for her and Yuzuru thanks her for raising him. A couple of years later, Ai and Yuzuru are happily married and living in America; Ai is still working as a baker, and Yuzuru has become a doctor. Shuuji is busy working and Nanoya is expecting her first child. Ai narrates how happy she is to have met Yuzuru because he is her true love. ==Characters== ;Ai Souda :The female protagonist.

Initially overjoyed to have her big brother back, Ai started to see Yuzuru less as a brother and more as a man, and gradually fell in love with him. Realizing how wrong her feelings were, she tried to resist them but couldn't help feel jealous as her friend, Nanayo, showed an interest in Yuzuru. After receiving her first kiss from him, Ai and Yuzuru confess their feelings to each other and tried to keep their relationship a secret. However, with their secret being discovered by their friends and mother who opposed them, Ai decided to break off the relationship on the condition that she become Yuzuru's lover, and loses her virginity to him. In a time-skip, Ai, in high school, agrees to an arranged marriage in order to forget Yuzuru. On the day of the wedding, they find out they are not biologically related and are free to be together.

She becomes increasingly jealous at Ai that she ends their friendship and attempts to tell her mother about her dating Yuzuru. ;Asahi Nashuuji :A classmate of Ai and Yuzuru, and he is best friends with Yuzuru. He has a crush on Ai and tries repeatedly to get her to go out with him. Ai, on the other hand, simply sees him as a dear friend, in addition to being in love with Yuzuru.

Following the death of her ex-husband, she is further distraught when she discovers the relationship and forbids them from being together, and wanted Yuzuru to return to America. She later arranges a marriage for Ai, but when Yuzuru tells Ai the truth of them not being related, it turns out Mrs. Souda knew Yuzuru was adopted. Seeing how happy Ai is with Yuzuru, she allows them to be together. ;Mr. Souda :Ai and Yuzuru's father.

However, Balaji is against any sort of cordial relationship with the Bhils, and opposes any favourable treatment given to them. This upsets the Patil, who falls ill. He realises the consequence of Balaji succeeding him and regrets his decision made earlier to that effect. He wants to send a message to the Diwan (Chief Minister) that Balaji should not become the Patil following his death. The letter is intercepted by Balaji. The old chief dies, making Balaji the new Patil. The story then focuses on the animosity that develops between the two clans. Balaji usurps the Bhils land and makes them work for him. Maruti, the chief of the Bhils and Kanhayia's (Ashok Kumar) father asks the Bhils to leave. The clash between the two clans turns Kanhaiya into a bandit, who is then hunted by the Marathas. When Balaji tries to molest Radha (Devika Rani), Kanhaiya's beloved, Kanhaiya kills him and lets himself be captured by the Maratha police as he does not want any further atrocities against his tribe. He is sentenced to be hanged. Radha comes to meet him in the jail but dies. Kanhaiya goes to his hanging being hailed as a martyr. ==Cast== * Devika Rani as Radha * Ashok Kumar as Kanhaiya * Kamta Prasad * Chandraprabha * P. F. Pithawala * Mumtaz Ali * Sunita Devi * N. M.

He owned famous trotting horses and he was a prominent supporter of the Presbyterian Church and Pastor John Hall. Bonner was born in Ireland near Derry; his ancestors were Scottish Presbyterians. He arrived in America in 1839, where his uncle owned land in Hartford, Connecticut. Bonner became an apprentice in the printing trade and worked at the Hartford Courant. There he was an extraordinarily fast compositor. Completing his apprenticeship in 1844, he moved to New York and worked for the organ of the new American Republican Party (later Native American; Know-Nothing) while he lived by \\"practicing the most rigid economy\\". When it suspended operation he found work at The Evening Mirror, a daily launched in 1844. He began writing and contributed to various newspapers in other cities. He worked at The Merchant's Ledger, a financial weekly, in the advertising department and became involved with printing that newspaper. He purchased it in 1851 and changed the name to The New York Ledger in 1855, when he sought a wider readership by running articles by well-known writers. He also used advertising to raise the profile of the paper and increase the circulation. ==Harness racing owner== Around 1856 Bonner became interested in horses and, in particular, the \\"trotting\\" form of harness racing. He paid large sums for his horses; one of the most famous was Dexter, a gelding that cost him £35,000. He did not gamble or race for money, but there was a rivalry between Bonner and Commodore Vanderbilt over who had the best horses. Bonner was a philanthropist who preferred not to make his donations public, but he was a known supporter of Princeton University and contributed $131,000 towards the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. He was also president of the Scotch-Irish Society of America. Bonner married Jane McConlis in 1850 and they had six children although one child, Martha Agnes, died in infancy. Bonner's wife Jane died in 1878. In 1887 he passed the Ledger to his three sons. Robert Bonner's Sons published dime novels, too. Pastor John Hall died September 1898 in Ireland and one son, Andrew Allen Bonner, died in December 1898. According to his obituary, Bonner never recovered from the shocks; his health and interest failed. He was confined to a bed at times during June and he died on July 6, 1899. He was survived by sons Robert Edwin and Frederick and daughter Mrs. Francis Forbes. Bonner is the namesake of the city of Bonner Springs, Kansas. ==References * Scotch- Irish Society of the USA Category:1824 births Category:1899 deaths Category:19th-century American newspaper editors Category:American publishers (people) Category:American racehorse owners and breeders Category:American Presbyterians Category:American people of Scotch-Irish descent ","title":"Robert E.

It was written and produced by Minogue, with additional production credits to Brothers in Rhythm. The song is a drum and bass song where Minogue describes her anger and frustration through its lyrics. It contains elements of club music and breakbeat music, and employs spoken word techniques. Critical reception towards \\"Too Far\\" has been universally acclaimed; some critics favoured its commercial appeal, while some felt it was one of Minogue's best dance tracks. Critics have highlighted it as an album and career stand out. \\"Too Far\\" failed to chart on any record charts, and no music video was directed. Minogue has performed the track on two of her concert tours; Intimate and Live Tour and Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour, and has been included on her greatest hits albums including Artist Collection (2004) and Confide in Me: The Irresistible Kylie (2007). ==Background and Release== \\"Too Far\\" was one of the first tracks written for Minogue's sixth album, Impossible Princess. Minogue stated that she left her home for an entire day, and stayed at a local cafe for the morning to write the song's lyrics. Minogue felt that her home was a \\"negative atmosphere\\", and wanted to \\"get rid of bad energy\\". She later stated that she wrote the song \\"very quickly and at a very bad state.\\" Minogue stated that the lyric \\"Caught up in this house, trapped my very own self in the snare of my mind,\\" explained her \\"very well at the time\\". Minogue felt the lyrics were claustrophobic-like, feeling that she \\"couldn't find a way out\\". Although Minogue commented the song was \\"nothing I have ever done before,\\" she felt the song was a \\"good form of release\\" of emotions. Interviewed with the magazine Music Week, Minogue reiterated that it was \\"the strangest thing I have ever written.\\" Originally, Minogue wanted to release \\"Limbo\\" as the lead single because she felt it was a \\"good choice\\", but her creative director Steve Anderson felt either \\"Too Far\\" or \\"Jump\\" were better offerings to promote Impossible Princess. Deconstruction reviewed both their views, but did not promote any them and released \\"Some Kind of Bliss\\" as the lead single; \\"Limbo\\" appeared as its b-side. In January 1998, \\"Too Far\\", alongside five other album tracks, were included on an exclusive cassette tape and given to Deconstruction members to select their opinion on which should be the third single; \\"Too Far\\" lost respectively to \\"Breathe\\". Following the release of Impossible Princess, popular reception towards \\"Too Far\\" and demand for a release soon prompt Deconstruction to announce the track as the album's fourth single. However, Minogue's distribution label Sony BMG released \\"Too Far\\" themselves, both as a promotional vinyl and airplay single in the UK on 21 May 1998, and later North America on 26 May, her first single released in the US since her 1994 hit \\"Confide in Me\\". The song in its original album length was only released as airplay and excluded from the 12\\" release, instead it being occupied by two new remixes commissioned by Brothers in Rhythm and Junior Vasquez. Deconstruction then called off the single's promotion, and refused to promote it further after BMG released it without discussion. ==Composition== Minogue co-produced/composed it with British duo Brothers in Rhythm. The song was recorded at DMC Studios, Real World Studios and Sarm West Studios in London, England during 1997. Steve Anderson played synthesizers, keyboards and drum machines, Boguaslaw Kostecki played the fiddle, Pete Lale and Martin Loveday incorporated string arrangements, and Minogue played the grand piano. Primarily a drum and bass song, it also contains elements of house and breakbeat. A reviewer from X-Press Magazine said \\"With all these tracks along with the speaking in toungues-style opening of \\"Too Far\\", Kylie shows she's open to moving on and widening her pop arc.\\" ==Critical reception== Showgirl: The Homecoming tour (2007) \\"Too Far\\" achieved critical acclaim from most music critics. Chris True from Allmusic had highlighted the track as an album stand out from Impossible Princess. Sarah Smith from FasterLouder.com highlighted the song as an album stand out and praised Minogue's experimentation on the \\"spoken word\\" effect. Gary James from Entertainment Focus praised all her written tracks and had especially praised \\"Say Hey\\", \\"Too Far\\", \\"Cowboy Style\\" and \\"Limbo\\" for her being able to portray a \\"sense of claustrophobia and uncertainty.\\" A reviewer from Who was positive, stating \\"As epic an opening as \\"Confide in Me\\" was to Kylie Minogue. A rich, rambling, speedy, chaotic onslaught whose composition is credited solely to one K.Minogue.\\" Susan Corrigan from I-D had said positively stated that \\"Too Far\\" \\"shimmer[ed]\\". Robin Bresnek from Melody Maker had discussed their parent review, and said that \\"Too Far\\" and \\"Drunk\\" were immediate highlights for Minogue showing her \\"schizophrenic self-disgust\\" nature that \\"spins dizzily in the shadow of fluttering heartbeats and inspired rushes of sound.\\" Sam Upton from Select magazine was particularly positive towards the track, saying \\"'Too Far' sets out the stall perfectly with beats that want to be jungle when they grow up and Kylie slipping between half-rap and the usual sensual breathing's.\\" Upton, however, gave the parent album an overall mixed review. Larry Flick from Billboard commented \\"From the haunting, almost unsettling drum'n'bass undertow of the set's lead cut, \\"Too Far,\\" it's clear that the days of kewpie-doll ditties like \\"The Loco-Motion\\" and \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" have dissolved into a gratefully distant memory.\\" Additionally, the Brothers in Rhythm remix of \\"Too Far\\" received favourable reviews from most music critics, and became popular with clubs and fans alike. Reviewing Mixes, Charlie Porter from Amazon.co.uk was positive towards the remix, stating \\"Brothers in Rhythm work their slinky magic on \\"Too Far\\", and further highlighted it as a stand out track. ==Live performances== Minogue included \\"Too Far\\" on a musical medley that contained several songs from her back catalog on the Mushroom 25 Live Tour on 14 November 1998; it was later included on a live CD release. Minogue has performed the track on one of her concert tours; the Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour. In 2005, Minogue went on her Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour. Minogue was unable to complete the tour as she was diagnosed with early breast cancer and had to cancel the Australian leg of the tour. After undergoing treatment and recovery, she resumed the concert tour in the form of Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour in 2007, and included \\"Too Far\\" on the setlist. Minogue also performed a mash-up of both the Brothers in Rhythm remix and the original on her Intimate and Live concert tour, and featured Minogue rising up on the stage inside a rainbow-colored cone, similar to the artwork of the parent album, wearing black overalls. Like the rest of the costumes on the tour, it features Minogue with a \\"princess\\"-inspired outfit that were created by her and her long-time friend and Fashion designer William Baker. The performance was recorded on 30 June and 1 July at Capitol Theatre in Sydney, and appeared on the related CD and DVD. ==Legacy== \\"Too Far\\" has been featured on many of Minogue's compilation albums; first appearing on her 2002 BMG greatest hits compilation album Confide in Me, a compilation of her songs from her Deconstruction period. It then appeared on her 2004 compilation album Artist Collection, which included most of her Impossible Princess era. The track's last appearance was on the first disc of Confide in Me: The Irresistible Kylie released in July 2007 by UK independent label Music Club. With the reissue of Impossible Princess in 2003, a second disc containing various remixes and b-sides was included. Among these remixes are two brand new ones of \\"Too Far\\" by Philip Steir: the \\"Inner Door Mix\\", and the \\"North Pole Mix\\". Additionally, the previously unreleased \\"Junior's Riff Dub\\" was included as well. ==Track listing== ;Promotional 12\\" vinylhttps://www.discogs.com/Kylie-Minogue-Too-Far/release/133390 #\\"Too Far (Brothers in Rhythm Mix)\\" – 10:21 #\\"Too Far (Junior Vasquez Remix)\\" – 11:44 ==Remixes== ;Brothers in Rhythm Mixes *\\"Too Far (Brothers in Rhythm Mix)\\" – 10:21 *\\"Too Far (Brothers in Rhythm Dub)\\" – 8:39 ;Junior Vasquez Mixes *\\"Too Far (Junior Vasquez Remix)\\" – 11:44 *\\"Too Far (Junior's Riff Dub)\\" – 5:50 ;Philip Steir Mixes *\\"Too Far (Inner Door Mix)\\" – 6:22 *\\"Too Far (North Pole Mix)\\" – 5:47 ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the album's liner notes and the singer's official website. *Songwriting – Kylie Minogue *Production – Brothers in Rhythm *Vocals production – Minogue *Recording – Alan Bremner and Paul Wright; DMC Studios, Real World Studios and Sarm West Studios, London, England. 1997 *Keyboards, synthesizers, other instruments – Steve Anderson *Fiddle – Bougaslaw Kostecki *Viola – Pete Lale *Cello – Martin Loveday *Mixing, engineering – Alan Bremner *Mixing – Paul Wright ==Release history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Country !scope=\\"col\\" Date !scope=\\"col\\" Format !scope=\\"col\\" Label - Australia  rowspan=\\"2\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" Contemporary hit radio  rowspan=\\"2\\" Mushroom Records - New Zealand -  rowspan=\\"2\\"United Kingdom   rowspan=\\"2\\" Deconstruction Records -   rowspan=\\"2\\" Vinyl - North America   Sony BMG } ==References * Category:1997 songs Category:Kylie Minogue songs Category:Songs written by Kylie Minogue ","title":"Too Far"},{"id":"46370381","text":"Everybody Loves a Winner is an album by American jazz pianist Freddie Redd recorded in 1990 and released on the Milestone label.Fitzgerald, M., Freddie Redd Leader Entry, accessed April 8, 2015.Fitzgerald.

It is distinguished by its large, hemispherical heads of yellow and white flowers on the ends of the branches and the overlapping brown bracts under them. ==Description== Melaleuca megacephala is an erect, bushy shrub with rough bark and brittle branches which grows to high and wide. Its leaves are arranged alternately on the stems, oval to elliptic in shape, concave, long, wide and with 3 to 5 longitudinal veins. The flowers are arranged in hemispherical heads, mostly on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. Papery brown, overlapping bracts surround the flower buds and remain under the open flowers. The filaments of the stamens are white but the anthers on their ends are yellow or cream coloured, giving the appearance of pale yellow flowers. The heads contain 4 to 12 groups of flowers in threes and are up to wide. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle usually containing 12 to 16 stamens. Flowering occurs from June to November but mainly in early spring and the fruit which follow are woody, cup shaped capsules long that are clustered along the stem. M. megacephala leaves and flowers M. megacephala fruit ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca megacephala was first formally described in 1862 by Ferdinand von Mueller in \\"Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae\\". The specific epithet (megacephala) is derived from the Ancient Greek words μέγας (mégas) meaning “large” or \\"great\\" and κεφαλή (kephalḗ) meaning \\"head\\", referring to the large heads of flowers of this species. ==Distribution and habitat== This melaleuca occurs in the Geraldton and Kalbarri districts in the Geraldton Sandplains and Yalgoo biogeographic regions growing in sand on sand plains and rocky hills. ==Conservation== This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==Uses== Horticulture Although not common in cultivation, this species has been known in horticulture for a long time. It is hardy in well- drained soil and responds well to pruning to ensure good flower set in the following season. Essential oils The leaves of M. megacephala contain significant quantities of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. ==References== megacephala Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1862 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ","title":"Melaleuca megacephala"},{"id":"46370431","text":"The Biel Solothurn Symphony Orchestra (Sinfonie Orchester Biel Solothurn / Orchestre Symphonique Bienne Soleure) was founded in 1969 and has since gained an important place within the Swiss music scene.

Slack formerly wrote regularly for BloodyElbow.com, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Unibet. Due to successful Patreon support, he independently writes on his blog fightprimer.com and bi-weekly broadcasts his podcast Fights Gone By (FGB) on YouTube. ==Background== Slack describes himself as “a martial arts fanatic from the U.K. who got involved in karate very young, then boxing, then most recently jiu-jitsu\\". Initially he started researching and writing for his own training improvement in order to compensate for his \\"shortcomings in his own physicality\\", and later, by motivation to showcase to the casual fan and the mainstream media how MMA is a highly skillful art form. In a 2012 AMA, Slack wrote \\"I've been analysing techniques since I realised that coaches couldn't or wouldn't tell me everything they knew or even what they most liked doing themselves. I knew there had to be more to it than just the same basic techniques performed at the opponent so I started watching boxing. When I started in boxing in my early teens I loved scrapping but I couldn't stand watching a boxing match - watching guys like Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson and Jersey Joe Walcott soon improved me so much that I couldn't stop watching old fights.\\" Slack's pen name is a reference to Jack Slack the \\"Norfolk Butcher\\", the 1743 Norfolk boxing champion who defeated famed English boxing champion Jack Broughton in 1750 as a heavy underdog and remained undefeated as champion until 1760. Slack has said that he does not particularly admire the man, whose life was \\"more than a little shady\\", but that the name has \\"a ring to it\\". ==Career== Slack's first public contribution to analysing striking came in the form of sharing passages from published authors from his book collection. The first one posted on MMASHARE forum August 2011 titled Jimmy Wilde - The Art of Boxing. From January 2012 onwards he started to write and publish his analytical breakdown on his newly opened blog FightsGoneBy, while promoting his articles on major MMA forums and gaining popularity. In January 2012 he started using the pen name Jack Slack, submitting Fanposts regularly to SB Nation's websites Bloodyelbow.com (MMA) and the now defunct HeadKickLegend.com (kickboxing), and also writing an article for CagePotato. In April 2012, Slack's article was first published on BloodyElbow front page, and soon he became a stipend author for the website. In that same month he was interviewed by sports announcer and commentator Mauro Ranallo on The MMA Show radio podcast. From July 2012 onwards he focused his writing on more popular fighters in order to increase his readership. In March 2013 Slack was hired to write regularly for Bleacher Report; initially as a featured columnist and later as \\"Lead MMA Analyst\\".https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/jack-slack/88/796/568 The editor of Fightland contacted Slack and offered him a position as a writer. Though Slack's initial intention was to write two articles a month for Fightland while continuing writing regularly for Bleacher Report, which he started doing from November 2013, on March 31, 2014, Slack left Bleacher Report and was writing eight articles a month only for Fightland. Though a regular writer, Slack was not exclusive to Fightland, and wrote articles for Fighters Only magazine and Unibet UK blog. Slack is known for his use of animated GIFs in his articles. Moving to Fightland allowed Slack to embed UFC parent company Zuffa's copyrighted fight footage in his articles. In February 2019, Slack left Fightland and Vice Sport, and wrote regularly for Unibet. Since July 2020, due to successful Patreon support, Slack writes independently on his blog Fightprimer.com. Podcaster Since August 2016, Slack is the host of Fights Gone By (FGB) podcast, which he independently finances via Patreon. Book author Slack has written and self-published four ebooks: * Elementary Striking: Strategies for Boxing, Kickboxing and MMA (2012) * Advanced Striking: Tactics of Kickboxing, Boxing and MMA Masters (2012) * Fighting Karate (2014) * Finding the Art: Essays on the Principles, Tactics and Techniques Which Govern Combat Sports (2015) And one printed book (published by John Blake Books): * Notorious: The Life and Fights of Conor McGregor (2017) ==Striking analysis== While Slack is known for analyzing MMA fighters, he has also published articles on professional boxing such as Pulling Back the Curtain on Muhammad Ali, on Kickboxing such as The Finest Striker on the Planet: Giorgio Petrosyan, on Muay Thai such as Eight Limbs: The Masters of Each Strike in MMA, on Karate such as Glory 19: Why Karate Doesn't Work in the Ring, on Wing Chun such as Wing Chun and MMA: Controlling the Center, articles on the history of martial arts such as Interpreting the Bubishi: One Thousand Pounds Falls to the Ground. and critical articles such as Wushu Watch: Lessons to learn from Aikido. He has also published semi satirical articles such as Star Trek: The illogical fighting style of James T. Kirk and Street Fighter in the UFC: Hadoukens and Izuna drops. Slack also published articles about fighting techniques in the Animal Kingdom such as Jack Slack: Street Fighting Roos. Slack has stated in his July 2014 article Jack Slack: Four Strikers That Every MMA Fan Should Be Watching: \\"Top level grappling, boxing and Muay Thai are light years ahead technically of what we see in mixed martial arts competition, but progress in MMA is shockingly rapid.\\" On FGB podcast #212 (July 2020) Slack has criticised the current state of Women's MMA (WMMA) on the following points: * Most WMMA is missing an “alive element” that a fight should have because they fight like they’re hitting pads and not actually in a fight, meaning both women punching like they’re hitting pads while disregarding any strikes coming back at them. * Most WMMA striking involves a series of repetitive combinations that don’t change or evolve as the fight goes on. * They throw multi punch combinations head first, not thinking about counter strikes. * Just because you can pump hands doesn’t mean you’re a good puncher/striker for example Ronda Rousey. * Eye vs Calvillo displayed that movement is key in a fight, and if they just stand in front of each other, it’s gonna be the same exchange over and over again. Slack stated that good striking comes from not only hitting pads, but also faking out the opponent, anticipation and expectations of the opponent, going high and low, body language, trickery, etc. As good examples, Slack praised Rose Namajunas and Valentina Shevchenko because they understand movement and building combinations is key to good striking. Slack's popular series of articles titled Killing the King, which break down the current UFC champions weaknesses, and how they could potentially be beat, have spanned through three different MMA websites during his career: BloodyElbow.com, Bleacher Report and Fightland. Slack lists former MMA Heavyweight Fedor Emelianenko as the top striker on the feet and on the ground, in MMA history. He has published a three part article series titled Analyzing Fedor. According to Slack, the 2003 film Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior starring Tony Jaa; \\"is perhaps the finest martial arts movie of this generation\\", and that Tony Jaa's multiple attackers scene in the 2005 film Tom-Yum-Goong (The Protector); \\"[is] the best fight in movie history\\". ==Reception== Matt Saccaro of CagePotato describes Slack as \\"by far the greatest assessor of in-cage techniques that has graced the keyboard\\", and Ben Fowlkes of MMAjunkie describes Slack's work as existing \\"in that rare sports writing space where the reader comes away with a better understanding of the sport itself, rather than merely the people in it\\". Mike Johnston of Sportsnet wrote \\"There aren’t many people on the planet better capable of analyzing a fighter’s strengths, weaknesses and evolution than Jack Slack\\". Joel Snape of Men's Fitness magazine, wrote \\"He’s a scholar of the fight game, an excellent technician, and I fully recommend checking out his books and blog – even if you aren’t interested in improving your own striking, it’ll give you a huge understanding and appreciation of the fight game.\\" Graham Barlow of The Tai Chi Notebook wrote \\"I’d go as far to say that he’s totally changed my appreciation of the depth of the technicalities of Mixed Martial Arts\\". Mark Serrels of Kotaku (Australia) describes Slack as a \\"peerless\\" writer who is \\"so on the ball it is unbelievable — to the point where fighters will often approach him for help with strategy or read his articles in an attempt to improve\\".http://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/09/punch-out- is-more-realistic-than-you-might-think/ Former UFC bantamweight champion TJ Dillashaw stated that he used Slack's article Killing the King: Renan Barao in preparation for his fight against then title holder Barao. MMA coaches, fighters and UFC color commentator Joe Rogan have been reading Slack's articles and have found them to be educational.The Joe Rogan Experience (hour 1.06) Tristar owner Firas Zahabi stated \\"He's an expert at what he does and I recommend his material\\". George Mills of BT Sport in reference to Slack's 2016 article Justin Gaethje thriving amid chaos, wrote \\"Looking back in 2020, those words are almost prophetic in describing Gaethje’s ascent through the UFC ranks\\". Pundit Arena describe Slack as a \\"brilliant technical analyst\\". John Franklin of Combat Press has listed Slack as one of the five best MMA analysts, and stated that \\"Slack has made Fightland relevant as a place for analysis\\".http://combatpress.com/2016/01/the-biggest-difference-makers-in- mma-2015-edition-nos-11-20/ Singapore Evolve daily has listed Slack's podcast Fights Gone By #1 on it's 4 Of The Best Martial Arts Podcasts You Need To Start Listening To Immediately article. Following 3 podcasts included Ariel Helwani's MMA Hour, The Joe Rogan Experience and MMAjunkie Radio. They describe Slack as knowledgeable, writing: Jeremy Brand of MMASucka.com has recommended following Slack's Twitter account on his top 10 MMA Twitter Accounts You Should Follow list, stating \\"If you don’t follow Jack Slack, then you may not want to know about MMA on a deeper level. This guy is a wealth of knowledge. His 20.4k followers are treated to some great fight breakdowns and more.\\" ==Awards== Slack was a World MMA Awards nominee for MMA Journalist Of The Year 2014 award. ==References * The Fight Primer - Jack Slack Blog. * Fights Gone By - Jack Slack Podcast. * I'm a Jack Slack AMA - Jack Slack AMA Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:Mixed martial arts journalists ","title":"Jack Slack"},{"id":"46370606","text":"First rank insignia of the Soviet armed forces from August 1918, here: enlisted men/privates of the Red Guard and \\"Army of Taman\\" OF5-OF9, 1924–1935 In the period from 1918 to 1935 of the young Soviet Union any bourgeois military thoughts were put under general suspicion by the communists, the new political establishment. Among others, the Old Russian tradition to wear epaulets and shoulder straps as rank insignia was rigorously abolished and was replaced with a new tradition of rank designations and insignia for the new Red Army and the nascent Soviet Navy. ==First rank insignia == In the early period of the October revolution new uniforms were used and new units structured on the basis of the former Imperial Russian Army and Navy. The levelling of military grades and neglecting of rank designation were symptomatic of the new order. The first common rank designation throughout the Red Army was \\"Red Army man\\" () or, in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Navy, \\"Red Fleet man\\" (). Personnel designated to command a military unit were unofficially named \\"red commander\\" (Russian: красный командир; krasnyi komandir, abbreviated краском; kraskom). Commanders of major units (army or corps sized) were designated \\"army commander\\" (Russian: командующий армией; komanduyushchy armyye; abbreviated командарм; komandarm). For more detailed graduation komandarm I and komandarm II were adopted. Commanding officers of major units below army and corps level were known as: * Commander of a division: komdiv (Russian:комдив) * Commander of a brigade: kombrig (Russian:комбриг) In the navy from December 1917 until 1918, naval officers of the Imperial Russian Navy who joined its ranks were addressed by their tsarist rank with the addition of front abbreviation \\"b.\\", which meant \\"former\\", while new officers had to wait till 1924 for their rank designations to be issued. With no formal Red Army insignia designated, red bows, cap peaks, sleeve patches and the red soviet star were worn, first by the so-called Red Guard units, later by all other Red Army units. In 1920 all the ranks and rank insignia of the Red Army and Navy were regulated by the orders of the Defence Commissar, Leon Trotsky. Red star  The first official emblem of the Red Army was a chest badge (red textile bend and oak leaves twig, in the middle a star with sickle and hammer), introduced in April 1918. From summer of the same year the cap cockade, in form of a five-pointed star with hammer and sickle, was designated. At first two of the points were uppermost, before it was directed that a single point of the star should face the 12 o'clock position. By orders number 953Order number 953 of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Red Army from April 13, 1922 on structure and design of the \\"Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\" cap cockade. and 1691Order number 1691 of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Red Army from July 11, 1922 on structure and design of the \\"Workers' and Peasants' Red Army\\" cap cockade. of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Red Army on structure and design of the cap cockade in shape of a red star, the official design was introduced for use by all personnel of the Red Army. { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px; text-align:center\\" - - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" !

In November 29, 1918 the All- Russian Central Executive Committee approved these proposals and agreed to the rank designations as follows to be used, by both the Red Guards and the Red Army's ground forces as a whole:Decision of the \\"All-Russian Central Executive Committee\\" from November 29, 1918 on uniforms and rank designations of the so- called Red Guards.

Among other three versions of caps and various rank insignia were adopted, in order to emphasize several appointments. It was followed by the official approval by order number 116 of the \\"Revolutionary Military Committee\\" from January 16, 1919 (see pictures 1 to 11).

He lives in San Sebastián with his mother Maritxu (Ane Gabarain), the classic absorbent, dominant Basque matriarch who sees Iñaki as a perennial child unable to move forward in life on his own. Iñaki runs a bar he inherited from his father, where his only affective exchange is the weekly game of mus with his longtime friends, although Nekane (Alazne Etxebarria), the waitress, is madly in love with him but fails to tell him time and time again.

In March 2015, it was announced that Freshly Squeezed had signed a publishing deal with the Dutch video game publisher SOEDESCO. The release date was originally expected to be in Q3, 2015, for PC. However, the release date was pushed back and released on Steam on January 29, 2016. In December 2017, the game was released for PS4 and Xbox One. In January 2018 it was added to the Windows Store. These ports were done by Soedesco Studios, the in-house porting studio of SOEDESCO. On September 13, 2018, a port for the Nintendo Switch was released. It is scheduled for release in Japan on May 14, 2020. ==Gameplay== The game is set on a post-human Earth, where the player plays as an old, broken racing robot. Players are barely able to move by themselves and are therefore required to use the environment for propulsion by utilizing the \\"Gravitize\\" ability to increase their gravitational pull. By turning this ability on when going downhill, the player will go faster; turning it off when going uphill will result in less of a decrease in speed. There are speed boosts throughout the levels, either in the shape of little orbs which give the player a short burst of speed or as bottles or pools of \\"Enerjuice\\" which fill up a blue meter and can be used whenever the player chooses. The player also has the ability to \\"Magnetize\\" which allows the player to stick to surfaces when going upside down or vertically. ==Reception== On Metacritic, the Nintendo Switch version of Defunct received an user score of 6.0 out of 10, based on 4 reviews.

He was known for his work designing newspapers, most notably as first editor of the Style section of The Washington Post. He was also known for his shy and humble style, being called an \\"unlikely mogul\\". ==Early life and family== Laventhol was born into a journalist's family in Philadelphia, the middle child of three to Clare (née Horwald) and Jesse Laventhol, Harrisburg bureau chief on the Philadelphia Record. Later the family moved to Washington, D.C. where Jesse was in charge of Major Legislative Actions. David went to Woodrow Wilson High School, where he edited the school's paper the Beacon, and then went to Yale where he majored in English and was elected managing editor of the Yale Daily News. He graduated in 1957 and later received a master's from the University of Minnesota in 1960. David Laventhol was the cousin of painter Hank Laventhol. ==Career== Laventhol joined the St. Petersberg Times (Florida) in 1957 as a reporter, and after taking a break for a master's degree, became national news editor before going to the New York Herald Tribune as city editor in 1963. In 1966, Ben Bradlee brought him to the Washington Post as night managing editor, and in 1968 gave Laventhol the task of redesigning the \\"For and About Women\\" section. They created the Style section, described as a \\"monumental achievement\\", later \\"imitated in every paper in America\\", and which concentrated on vibrant writing and feature articles. Laventhol then moved to Newsday in 1969, soon becoming editor under publisher Bill Moyers. In that period he designed Part II, its counterpart to the Style section, and introduced a Sunday edition in 1972. During Laventhol's editorship, Newsday won four Pulitzer Prizes, including the 1974 Public Service prize for its massive 33-part investigation \\"The Heroin Trail\\", uncovering heroin from its production in Turkey to addiction on the streets of Long Island, described by Floyd Abrams as the \\"single most daunting and expensive series in the institution's history\\". Laventhol rose to publisher in 1978 and launched a New York City edition in 1985. Called New York Newsday, it won critical praise for its mix of news and entertainment, with some calling it the \\"most enterprising and in many respects the best daily newspaper in New York City\\". Newsday was at that time owned by the Times-Mirror corporation, and Laventhol moved to California 1989 as publisher of the Los Angeles Times and president of the corporation. The Los Angeles Times won three Pulitzer Prizes under Laventhol's leadership, including the Spot News prize \\"for balanced, comprehensive, penetrating coverage under deadline pressure of the second, most destructive day of the [1992] Los Angeles Riots.\\" The paper opened new regional editions and a Spanish-language edition. ==Retirement== Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Laventhol retired from Times-Mirror in 1994. Many of his expansions were reversed in the contraction of the newspaper industry, most notably New York Newsday, which was closed in 1995 for financial reasons, with some sources citing its loss-making and others contending it was about to break even. During his retirement, Laventhol was publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, contributing a number of articles critical of the direction of the news industry, and the effects of modern media being simultaneous with the events they are reporting — having been a passenger on Jet Blue Flight 292, which showed live news of its own troubled flight. ==Freedom of the Press== Laventhol was a strong advocate of press freedom, and had a long association with the International Press Institute, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the Pulitzer Prize committee, chairing each of these at various periods. Laventhol is known for his long role in promoting press freedom in South Africa. As editor of Newsday in 1976, he sent Les Payne, one of the undercover reporters from \\"The Heroin Trail\\", to Soweto to cover the riots. As a black man, Payne was able to report more accurately on the number of deaths during that uprising, leading to Payne and Newsday being banned in South Africa, only returning to cover Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990. After Mandela's speech at the International Press Institute in Kyoto in 1991, Laventhol took the 1994 congress to Cape Town very shortly before South Africa's first free elections. Mandela and F.W. de Klerk gave the opening speeches, with Mandela thanking the international press for keeping apartheid in the news and saying: \\"We are confident that your presence will, as in the past, assist in the birth of the democratic new order.\\" ==References== Category:1933 births Category:2015 deaths Category:20th-century American newspaper publishers (people) Category:Los Angeles Times publishers (people) Category:The Washington Post people Category:Newsday people ","title":"David Laventhol"},{"id":"46370660","text":"Eadmuna esperans is a species of moth of the family Mimallonidae.

The length of the forewings is 17–20 mm. The forewings are light silvery brown, suffused with darker brown postmedially except near the apex. There is a weakly pronounced hyaline discal spot which is yellowish opaque rather than clear due to a covering of yellowish scales. The postmedial line is bulging in the costal half, scalloped, narrowly interrupted by the veins and weaker on the costal third except for a dark wedge on the costa.

He began work as a journalist, first in Ballarat, and then in Perth, Western Australia where he founded the Western Australian branch of the Australian Journalists' Association. By 1915, Hanlon was in Brisbane and began a long association with The Worker newspaper. In February 1908, Hanlon married Mary Cotter and together they had 2 children. ==Political career== When the Labour Party starting forming governments in Queensland, it found much of its legislation being blocked by a hostile Council, where members had been appointed for life by successive conservative governments. After a failed referendum in May 1917, Premier Ryan tried a new tactic, and later that year advised the Governor, Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, to appoint thirteen new members whose allegiance lay with Labour to the Council.Goold-Adams, Sir Hamilton John (1858–1920) – Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 10 April 2015. The Council, however, continued to reject the government's money bills and in 1918 Ryan advised Goold-Adams to appoint additional Labour members, but this time he refused the request. In 1920, the new Premier Ted Theodore appointed a further fourteen new members to the Council with Hanlon amongst the appointees. He served for two years until the Council was abolished in March 1922. ==After politics== Hanlon continued his work with The Worker for another 20 years and becoming its editor. In 1921, while serving in the Council, Hanlon was made a member of the University of Queensland senate, holding the role until 1943. Hanlon moved to Sydney in 1943 to continue his work as an editor, this time with The Australian Worker newspaper. His final appointment came in 1945 when he was made a member of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, serving until his death four years later. Hanlon died of pneumonia in Sydney in September 1949. ==References== Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Council Category:1883 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Queensland Category:People from Creswick, Victoria Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Deaths from pneumonia ","title":"John Stanislaus Hanlon"},{"id":"46370750","text":"Genic (stylized as _genic) is the twelfth studio and third Bilingual (English–Japanese) album by Japanese recording artist Namie Amuro. It was released on June 10, 2015 in three physical formats, and for digital consumption; additionally, it serves as the singer's final studio record since her retirement announcement for September 2018. The album was handled by Western producers, including David Guetta, Bardur Haberg, Joacim \\"Twin\\" Persson, Sophie, amongst others. Stylistically, Genic divides its sound between electronic dance music and R&B;, and focuses on themes of self- empowerment, having fun, glamour and fashion. Genic received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Majority of the reviews praised Genic's production values and mixture of genres, although Amuro's English deliveries and certain collaborations were noted as flaws to the album. Additionally, the album was received nominations and accolades for its success in various forms. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, peaking at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart and Billboard Chart. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 250,000 units. Although not physical singles were released, Amuro's rendition of Guetta's track \\"What I Did for Love\\" was distributed as a promotional recording on July 1, 2015. In order to promote the album, Amuro shot music videos for the album material \\"Golden Touch\\", \\"Birthday\\", \\"Fashionista\\", \\"B Who I Want 2 B\\", \\"Stranger\\" and \\"Anything\\", all receiving global attention after their release. Furthermore, Amuro performed the album's content on her Livegenic and her annual Live Style concert tours, which traveled throughout Japan; a live DVD with the same name was distributed the following year. ==Background== In 2013, Amuro launched her own record label Dimension Point, in partnership with Avex Trax and their management. Originally, the singer had intended to depart from Avex and the management company Vision Factory after seventeen years together. However, Avex confirmed that Dimension Point would be put in place to allow Amuro to take control of her music and personal ventures. This led to the release of her eleventh studio and second Bilingual album Feel (2013). After this, she returned to releasing maxi-singles, commencing with \\"Tsuki\\" the following year and \\"Brighter Day\\" in November. In January 2015, Amuro purchased a home in Los Angeles, California in order to improve her English skills, rumored to effect her upcoming record. That same month, she departed from her management Rising Productions—formally Vision Factory—after 22 years together, and started a private agency with Dimension Point called Stella88. In May, Amuro revealed a special video from her YouTube account, confirming the release of Genic. The visual—featuring lyric videos for all 12 unpublished recordings—were placed on a trial period from the start of May to its ending date, and Amuro's website also hosted a special website dedicated to the album's material. ==Development and production== Genic is Amuro's first and only studio album to be handled by Western and European musicians—whereas her previous Bilingual records would include a mixture of Western and Asian-based producers and songwriters. However, Japanese singers Tiger and Emyli, whom worked with Amuro in previous efforts, served as additional songwriters to the tracks \\"Photogenic\\", \\"Birthday\\", \\"Fashionista\\" and \\"Stranger\\". Production on Genic started in mid-2014 whilst touring for her Live Style shows. Amuro commented to Japanese fashion magazine Sweet that she wanted to create an album that sounded as it was in \\"trend\\", and stated that \\"My staff understands my vision and made a selection of demo’s for me. As always, I chose the songs which instantly felt right to me.\\" In the end, Amuro felt that choosing the final songs was easy because she favored the demo's intro's rather than its entire form; producers changed and distorted the selected tracks that appealed to her. She commented that the \\"full song was different from the impression the intro left on me.\\" Additionally, two collaborations made the final cut: a track titled \\"B Who I Want 2 B\\" that featured Japanese vocaloid Hatsune Miku—whom went under the anagram U Hum Speak It, prior to the album's announcement—and a cover version of Guetta's track \\"What I Did for Love\\", which featured original vocals from English singer Emeli Sande. Furthermore, Genic is Amuro's first album not to feature any pre-released singles, her to do so since her debut record Dance Tracks Vol.1 (1995). The tracks \\"Tsuki\\" and \\"Brighter Day\\", alongside digital releases \\"Neonlight Lipstick\\", \\"Ballerina\\", \\"Sweet Kisses\\" and \\"Still Lovin' You\\", were put up for discussion by Stella88 to be included in the album. However, Amuro declined, and their status as \\"commercial tie-ins\\" and their sonic similarities to unpublished songs on Genic were the reason for its omission. In total, more than 200 demos were created during the music sessions, including additional productions by Guetta and German-Russian DJ Zedd. This is her first record that includes no full- length Japanese song, with the exceptions of \\"Golden Touch\\", \\"B Who I Want 2 B\\" and \\"Stranger\\" featuring very few lyrics in Japanese. Every other song were purely written and recorded in English language, making it her third Bilingual record after Uncontrolled (2012) and Feel (2013). The content was recorded at Prime Sound Studios, LAB Recordings, ABS Recordings, and Bunkamura Studios in Tokyo, Japan, with the final material mixed by D.O.I. at Daiminion Recordings, and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound Studios in New York City. ==Music and songs== Stylistically, Genic divides its sound between 1970s–1980s electronic dance music, and 1990s R&B;, with lyrical content focusing on themes of self-empowerment, having fun, glamour and fashion. Lauren du Plessis, writing for Electric Bloom Magazine, opined that the album encompasses every genre from her career, \\"there’s some ultra-fluffy teen pop, flashes of her R’n’B phase, and plenty of popular dance elements.\\" Similarly, though The Japan Times reporter Patrick St. Michel found the album influenced by EDM, he also noted \\"diverse\\" genres such as europop and contemporary pop music. In a similar review, Kenichi Shirahara from Utalabo.com compared the sound to Amuro's previous studio album Feel (2013) but identified musical elements such as new wave and disco music in Genic. The album opens with \\"Photogenic\\", a Westernized R&B; number that includes live electric guitars and bass. Lyrically, the track's use of \\"narcissis[tic]\\" themes was noted as one of key themes to the record. \\"Time Has Come\\"—a dance tune that incorporates elements of 8-bit—features various tempo changes through its composition, and discusses her ambition to escape a \\"sleeping town\\" and have fun. \\"Golden Touch\\" returns to R&B; with a \\"goofy\\" production, whereas du Plessis believes it was one of the tracks heavily inspired by the 1980s music era. The cheerful composition of \\"Birthday\\", the album's fourth track, was compared to another titular song by American singer Katy Perry, and was noted for its very \\"girly\\" appeal. The song \\"It\\" was described as a love song by critics, and features uptempo instrumentation and various whistles through its hook \\"Be it, I just wanna be it,\\". \\"Scream\\" is the first track on the album that delves into EDM, namely electro house sounds; the track talks about having fun, and enjoying the music at night. According to du Plessis, \\"Fashionista\\" shared a similar theme of narcissism and glamour with \\"Photogenic\\", but included subtle elements of dubstep in its composition. A reviewer at CD Journal pointed out a blend between R&B; and upbeat EDM music. \\"Fly\\" discusses Amuro's sense of high lifestyle, using the lyric \\"Don't have to pay my flight / I'm living my own life / I've got my hands up, feeling free,\\" as an example. Additionally, it is another EDM addition, with elements of dubstep and rock music. An alternative version was uploaded on the singer's YouTube channel. \\"B Who I Want 2 B\\", featuring Hatsune Miku, was produced by UK musician Sophie, and was described as one of the \\"weirder\\" additions to a major-pop album. Moreover, it was noted for its sonic influence of Computer music, more so described as \\"artificial\\". The dubstep-inspired \\"Stranger\\" was noted for its uptempo beat, alongside notes of reggaeton through its composition. \\"Every Woman\\" and \\"Space Invader\\" were noted as both \\"party\\" songs, the former described as a female empowerment anthem, while the latter incorporating elements of R&B;, reggaeton and compared to the song \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on it)\\" by American artist Beyonce. The album's only ballad, \\"Anything\\", incorporates acoustic instrumentation, whereas the \\"formulatic\\" club anthem \\"What I Did for Love\\" closes the record. ==Release and artwork== Genic was released on June 10, 2015 in three physical formats, and for digital consumption. All three physical formats include a standard package that includes a 14-track compact disc, whereas two of the packaging's are DVD and Blu-Ray bundles that include 5 music videos, respectively. Included in the DVD/Blu-Ray formats are the visuals for her songs \\"Golden Touch\\", \\"Birthday\\", \\"Fashionista\\", \\"Stranger\\" and \\"Anything\\"; secret parts of these formats also feature access to a special selfie video for \\"Birthday\\", and a dance-only visual to \\"Fashionista\\". Additionally, art direction and the album's booklet was designed by Jun Hirota. First-press editions come with a digipak and a generic poster of the album's photoshoot. The album's artwork was photographed by Tisch, and features Amuro in black clothing and wearing a black-lace veil. The title Genic refers to the title track \\"Photogenic\\"; however, Amuro felt that the term \\"genic\\" could be interpreted in various establishing meanings. ==Critical reception== Genic received favorable reviews from most music critics. An editorial review at Billboard Japan commended the album's \\"colorful\\" mixture of genres, and described it as a \\"whole body of work\\". Japanese magazine CD Journal gave the album an honorary star rating, and commended Amuro's decision not to release any singles from the album, giving it an overall \\"bullishness\\" quality. They called the album \\"smart\\" and complimented the collaborations with David Guetta and Hatsune Miku. Lauren Du Pressis from Electric Bloom Magazine praised the singer's musical exploration and mature image, finding her a \\"chameleon force to the music industry\\". Although De Pressis was critical about the collaborations and the album's \\"repetitive\\" nature, she concluded \\"Any listeners of J-pop looking for something a little more mature should give it a go... You can't hide from an album this contagious.\\" Patrick St. Michel had reviewed the album with two publications, in two perspectives: Pitchfork Media (June 2015) and The Japan Times (November 2015). With Pitchfork Media, he awarded the album 6.7 points out of 10. He praised the album's \\"confident\\" and \\"inspired\\" vibe, and felt this was her best EDM offering after her previous efforts that he described as \\"cheap replicas\\". Although he was ambivalent towards her English deliveries, and some productions—namely \\"Every Woman\\", \\"It\\" and \\"What I Did for Love\\"—he concluded that Genic's best moments was its \\"most straightforward.\\" Five months later, he published a second review with The Japan Times, and stated, \\"Her busy EDM songs don’t always work and her English delivery still needs practice, but Genic is a solid collection of catchy pop tunes... It’s a heck of a comeback, and a well-earned one at that.\\" Selective Hearing gave a positive review, saying \\"Overall this should please many Amuro fans immensely.\\" Genic has garnered Amuro with several accolades and awards. The music video for \\"Anything\\" was recognized by the FWA Designs Awards for website of the day, and month (June 15, 2015). At the 2015 Asia Design Awards, it received three specific ranking strategies: creativity (8.4 points), its content (8 points), and its visuals (7.8 points). The visual won the best innovative integration bronze award at the Spike Asia 2015 Awards, Amuro's first recognition at that ceremony. Moreover, the video to \\"Birthday\\" was nominated for MTV Japan Music Video Award \\"Best Female Video Award\\", and independently for \\"Best Creativity Award\\" on October 15, 2015. Although Amuro won both awards respectively, she did not attend the ceremony. On December 18, the music video for \\"Golden Touch\\" was nominated for Song of the Year and Music Video of the Year by the Hello Asia! Music Awards. ==Commercial performance== Billboard Japan reported a statement by Nielsen SoundScan Japan that Genic had a high chance at debuting at number one on both Japan's Oricon Albums Chart and Billboard's Top Albums Sales chart, pushing back entries by Japanese band Mr. Children and Japanese solo artist Superfly. As predicted, Genic topped both the Billboard Top Albums and Top Albums Sales chart on chart week June 22. World Music Awards tallied up the sales around the world, and Genic was the second best-selling effort with sales of 160,000 copies sold. The album slipped to number three and number four during the chart week of June 29. In total, the album spent a duration of 25 weeks on both charts, exiting outside the top 90 in its final week on both charts. Genic debuted at number one on the daily Oricon Albums Chart with sales of 81,491 units. Moreover, it opened at number one on the weekly chart with 160,474 units sold, her third lowest first week sales for a studio album since 2001's Break the Rules (157,850 first week sales), and her 2003 album Style (93,142 first week sales). Despite this, Genic became the highest selling album by a female artist of 2015, which surpassed Superfly's entry White (2015). Genic fell to number the five the following week with 29,474 units, being replaced by Golden Bomber's No Music No Weapon (2014) and number six in its third week with 14,509 units. By the end of June, the album ranked at number two on Oricon's monthly chart. After a six-month sales duration, Genic was ranked the 16th best-selling album with over 246,269 units sold; this made it the best selling album by a female solo artist, and the third best selling album by a female performing artist/group. As of May 2016, Genic has sold over 249,266 units, and was certified platinum in July 2015 by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for physical shipments of 250,000 units. ==Promoted songs== Although not physical singles were released, Amuro's rendition of David Guetta's track \\"What I Did for Love\\" was distributed as a promotional recording through iTunes on July 1, 2015. Nevertheless, several tracks on Genic were promoted. Amuro and vocaloid Hatsune Miku appeared on the cover of fashion magazine Nylon as digitized characters; the former singer confirmed that a music video would be produced with the two. (Note: Check out the new cover of the November issue for the online version of NYLON JAPAN (on sale Sept. 28th) with the virtual Namie Amuro & Hatsune Miku☆ Inside you'll also find photos from the fashion shoot!! The new collaborative music video \\"B Who I Want 2 B\\" will be released in October!!) Nylon TV premiered the music video for \\"B Who I Want 2 B\\" in mid-October 2015, presenting the singers in two- dimensional and 3D Anime form. As aforementioned, the music videos to \\"Golden Touch\\", \\"Birthday\\", \\"Fashionista\\", \\"Stranger\\" and \\"Anything\\" were promoted on Amuro's YouTube channel. Both \\"Birthday\\" and \\"Golden Touch\\" experienced success on two Billboard Japan charts; the former peaking at number 36 on Japan Hot 100, and the latter reaching number 43 on the Radio Songs chart. The visual for \\"Golden Touch\\" was widely recognized by Western publications, noting it as the singer's breakthrough. According to the video's director, Masashi Kawamura, it was shot over a three-month period. Elle magazine compared the video to the sensation of optical illusions, calling it \\"Colorful, fun, gay ... but especially interactive.\\" Japantrends.com believed that \\"Golden Touch\\" is \\"a good marketing stunt for a dying industry and overseas media has picked the story up too.\\" Several international blogs and magazines, including Buzzfeed, Adobo magazine, Australia's Hello Asia website, and Australia's Hello Asia publicized the video positively, and was listed as music video of the month by Creative Review in the United Kingdom. On June 5, \\"Golden Touch\\" debuted in North America on SiriusXM Hits 1 as part of their YouTube 15 schedule, hosted and selected by American blogger and YouTube personality Jenna Marbles. After the original music video achieved 10 million views on YouTube, a second video premiered that included shots of Amuro. In collaboration with Google Chrome, Amuro's music video \\"Anything\\" was publicized as the first music video to be strictly produced through a Google extension. According to a detailed review by Business Wire, \\"The new music video leverages Google Chrome Extensions to allow viewers to easily enjoy an enhanced version of the video. The Google Chrome version offers a brand new experience, unraveling mysteries in the standard version, and uses windows and tabs to express the music featured in the video.\\" To activate the music video, it had to be downloaded through the Google Play store or through Amuro's website. The song's lyrics appeared on the URL address bar, and after watching the entire music video without skipping or interruptions, a special zip file was made available to download; it included a special message by Amuro in several different languages. ==Promotion and live performances== Amuro premiered the album throughout several radio stations in Japan, days before the album's release. Amuro announced her Livegenic tour in early mid June. The dates were confirmed via a flyer given out with the purchases of Genic, enclosed in the album's booklet. A total of 47 shows in several cities in Japan were scheduled, spanning from September 5 at the Saitama Super Arena, Saitama, and finishing the first leg on February 10 at the Makuhari Messe Event Hall in Chiba. An Asian leg was added to the tour, having Amuro play two dates in Taipei, Taiwan, and a sole show in Hong Kong. This was the singer's first visit since her 2012 5 Major Domes Tour: 20th Anniversary Best, where she traveled throughout various regions in Asia. A special website was hosted by Amuro's label Dimension Point, featuring various photos, digest films and other content supporting the tour. A live album and DVD/Blu-Ray were recorded at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium on December 8. A total of 29 songs were added on the track list, including two bonus tracks \\"Break It\\" and \\"Arigatou\\", which was recorded at the Miyagi Super Arena, and a hidden video track of Amuro's song \\"Birthday\\". Titled Namie Amuro Livegenic 2015–2016, the formats were a success in Japan; it reached the top spot on the Oricon DVD chart and Blu-Ray Chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 100,000 copies.

It was the second final of the Gillette Cup, which was the first English domestic knock-out competition between first-class sides. Sussex won the match by eight wickets. ==Background== The Gillette Cup had first been contested during the previous season, in response to falling crowds at County Championship matches. Sussex won the first tournament, defeating Worcestershire in the final. In 1964, the tournament was reduced from 65 to 60 overs per side with individual bowlers restricted to a maximum of 13 overs each, down from 15 in the initial 1963 competition. Both Sussex and Warwickshire had first round byes, and thereafter, Sussex beat Durham, Somerset and Surrey to reach the final, while Warwickshire knocked out Hampshire, Northamptonshire and Lancashire. ==Match== Summary Warwickshire won the toss and chose to bat first, but lost early wickets, falling to 21 for three. Their captain, Mike Smith steadied the innings to an extent, scoring 28 runs. The bowling of Ian Thomson, who took four wickets for 23 runs across his thirteen overs, conceding less than two runs per over, helped to restrict Warwickshire to a reasonably low total. The batting team were buoyed slightly by a score of 35 not out from Alan Smith, batting at number nine. They were eventually bowled out for 127, with 12 of their 60 overs still remaining. In their response, Sussex's opening batsman, Ken Suttle and Les Lenham, scored 42 and 47 runs respectively, to help move their team close to the target. After they were each dismissed, the team captain, Ted Dexter, and Jim Parks, Jr. came to the crease and carried their team over the line. Sussex finished on 131 for two, reaching the target with eight wickets and almost 19 overs to spare. Thomson was selected as the man of the match for his bowling performance, by a panel consisting of Len Hutton, Alec Bedser and Freddie Brown. Scorecard ==Aftermath== By winning the 1964 Gillette Cup, Sussex held onto their title from the previous season, but they did not win the competition again until 1978, despite final appearances in 1968, 1970 and 1973.

Smallman was also a significant figure at the University of Birmingham, serving as its vice-principal between 1987 and 1992 and helping to establish its reputation as a leading modern research university. ==Early life and education== Smallman was born in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, the third of five children of a working-class couple. Smallman spent much of his childhood near Cannock, Staffordshire, working at his father's fish and chips shop while his father served with the Royal Air Force during World War II. Between 1939 and 1947, Smallman attended a grammar school in Rugeley, Staffordshire, on a scholarship. He then obtained a first-class honours degree in metallurgy at the University of Birmingham, supervised by Alan Cottrell. Smallman completed his PhD on the structure of cold worked metals, again under Cottrell's supervision, in 1953. ==Research and career== After completing his doctorate, Smallman went to work as a metallurgical researcher at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) in Harwell, Oxfordshire. At AERE, Smallman and his colleagues were among the first to study the structure of metals using electron microscopy, discovering previously unknown microstructures and defects including dislocation \\"loops\\". In 1958, in collaboration with scientists from Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, Smallman published a groundbreaking paper on these dislocations, which provided key evidence for an emerging theory of metal fatigue with important implications for metallurgy and engineering. Thereafter, Smallman returned to the University of Birmingham as a lecturer in physical metallurgy, and oversaw the development of a highly successful metallurgical research team. In 1964, he was appointed Chair of Birmingham's Department of Physical Metallurgy, becoming the Head of the Department of Metallurgy and Materials in 1980. In 1985, Smallman oversaw the founding of an independent, research-focused Faculty of Engineering at Birmingham, and subsequently became the new faculty's Dean. ISmallman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1986, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1991. In 1987, Smallman became the Vice-Principal of the university, a position he held until 1992. As Vice-Principal, he implemented numerous university-wide administrative and academic reforms, and helped to strengthen the university's links to industry and commerce. Smallman's reforms were credited with helping to raise Birmingham's national and international profile as a major research university. In his later years, Smallman was a visiting lecturer at numerous universities and scientific societies worldwide. ==Honours and awards== * 1969: awarded Beilby Medal and Prize from the Royal Society of Chemistry * 1992: appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. ==Personal life== Smallman married Doreen Faulkner in September 1952. They remained married for the rest of Smallman's life; she survived him, as did their two children. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2015 deaths Category:British metallurgists Category:Alumni of the University of Birmingham Category:Academics of the University of Birmingham Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering ","title":"Raymond Smallman"},{"id":"46370980","text":"Gottlieb Paludan Architects is a Danish architectural firm that provides consultancy services within infrastructure, construction and landscape architecture.Company overview Bloomberg Business.

All 59 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with local elections all throughout Spain. The Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) emerged as the most voted party, but in a seat tie with the second force, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), at 25 seats. As neither had an absolute majority of seats, it was up to the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) 9 seats to decide which party was to govern in Madrid. Finally, an agreement between the PSOE and PCE resulted in Enrique Tierno Galván being named as the first democratically elected Mayor of Madrid. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Madrid () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their civil and political rights. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the eldest one would be elected. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within fifteen days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one-thousandth of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election—with a compulsory minimum of 500 signatures—disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. ==Results== {  right; font- size:95%;\\" + Summary of the 3 April 1979 City Council of Madrid election results → -  colspan=\\"7\\" 285px - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! left;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"500\\" Parties and coalitions ! colspan=\\"3\\" Popular vote ! colspan=\\"2\\" Seats - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"75\\" Votes ! width=\\"45\\" % ! width=\\"45\\" ±pp ! width=\\"35\\" Total ! width=\\"35\\" +/− -  width=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD)  632,329  40.29  n/a  25  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE)  619,772  39.49  n/a  25  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Communist Party of Spain (PCE)  230,651  14.69  n/a  9  n/a -  colspan=\\"7\\" bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Workers' Revolutionary Organization (ORT)  37,396  2.38  n/a  0  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Spanish Phalanx of the CNSO (FE–JONS)  25,038  1.60  n/a  0  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (historical) (PSOEh)  5,317  0.34  n/a  0  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Communist Unification of Spain (UCE)  5,251  0.33  n/a  0  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Spanish Communist Workers' Party (PCOE)  5,241  0.33  n/a  0  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Communist Movement–Organization of Communist Left (MC–OIC)  2,401  0.15  n/a  0  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"white\\"  align=\\"left\\" Socialist Party (PS)  2,298  0.15  n/a  0  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Liberal Party (PL)  2,132  0.14  n/a  0  n/a -  bgcolor=\\"\\"  align=\\"left\\" Revolutionary Communist League (LCR)  1,784  0.11  n/a  0  n/a -  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Blank ballots  0  0.00  n/a  bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" colspan=\\"2\\" -  colspan=\\"7\\" bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" - style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\"  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Total  1,569,610  bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  59  n/a -  colspan=\\"7\\" bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" -  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Valid votes  1,569,610  100.00  n/a  bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"5\\" -  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Invalid votes  0  0.00  n/a - style=\\"font- weight:bold;\\"  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Votes cast / turnout  1,569,610  65.98  n/a -  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Abstentions  809,331  34.02  n/a - style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\"  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Registered voters  2,378,941  bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" colspan=\\"2\\" -  colspan=\\"7\\" bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" -  align=\\"left\\" colspan=\\"7\\" Sources } ==References== Madrid Category:Elections in Madrid Category:1970s in Madrid ","title":"1979 Madrid City Council election"},{"id":"46371152","text":"The 1931 Paris–Roubaix was the 32nd edition of the Paris–Roubaix, a classic one-day cycle race in France.

It is a rare species with unusual foliage and profuse small yellow flowerheads, making it a plant that is suitable for cultivation, if only to protect it from extinction. == Description == Melaleuca micromera is an erect, rounded shrub growing to about high and wide with twisted branches. The leaves are tiny, in rings of three around the stem and pressed against it, long, wide and broad oval to almost circular in shape except for a small point at the end. The leaves are thick for their size and have two or three distinct oil dots. The flowers are arranged in small heads at or near the ends of the branches which continue to grow after flowering. The heads are up to in diameter and contain between 3 and 18 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are yellow, arranged in five bundles around the flowers with 3 to 5 stamens in each bundle. The small heads of yellow flowers can make the plant look like a wattle from a distance. Flowering occurs in early spring sometimes as early as July and is followed by fruit which are woody, cup-shaped capsules, long and wide, arranged in small groups along the stem.M. micromera in the Tone-Perup Nature Reserve ==Taxonomy and naming== This species was first formally described in 1844 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet (micromera) is from the Ancient Greek words mikros (μικρός) meaning \\"small\\" and meros (μέρος) meaning \\"part\\",Backer, C.A. (1936). Verklarend woordenboek der wetenschappelijke namen van de in Nederland en Nederlandsch-Indië in het wild groeiende en in tuinen en parken gekweekte varens en hoogere planten (Edition Nicoline van der Sijs). apparently referring to the very small leaves of this species. ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca micromera has a restricted distribution in the Mount Barker, Stirling Range and Green Range districts in the Esperance Plains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. It grows in clay or sandy gravel. ==Conservation status== Melaleuca micromera is listed as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife which means that it is a poorly-known species known from several locations but does not appear to be under imminent threat. ==Uses== Horticulture This species is an interesting feature plant because of its extremely small leaves, unusual twisted branches and colourful flower heads. It has proven to be reliable in cultivation and is suitable for growing in rockeries or tubs, responding to a light annual pruning. Essential oils The oil from the leaves of this species consists mainly of monoterpenoids. ==References== micromera Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Rosids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1844 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Taxa named by Johannes Conrad Schauer ","title":"Melaleuca micromera"},{"id":"46371238","text":"Ward No. 36, Kolkata Municipal Corporation is an administrative division of Kolkata Municipal Corporation in Borough No. 5, covering parts of Beliaghata (Barafkal), Sealdah and Rajabazar neighbourhoods in north-central Kolkata, in the Indian state of West Bengal. ==History== Attempts were made to establish a municipal corporation at Kolkata from the middle of the 19th century. The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15.

Born in Ankara, he began his club football career with the capital club Ankara Güneşspor in 1976. Prosperous goalkeeper continued to play respectively in Ankara Şekerspor, MKE Ankaragücü, İstanbulspor and Adana Demirspor until his retirement in 1995. He successfully inserts 23 national team caps. Peçenek who is associated with MKE Ankaragücü and perceived as one of the greatest players in the club's history inserts more than 200 caps for this club. With 192 first division inserts Peçenek is in the list of players with most premier league inserts for MKE Ankaragücü in 13th place.Şan ve Şerefle Dolu 100 Yıllık Büyük Ankaragücü Tarihi After ending his football career, he moved into coaching specialist. He assisted in Vanspor, Adanaspor and again Vanspor the head coach Ali Osman Renklibay as an assistant coach. In 1999/2000 season Peçenek took over Türk Telekomspor as his first head coaching experience. He supervised subsequently Körfez Belediyespor, Ankara Şekerspor and Kızılcahamam Belediyespor. From 2005 to 2010, he held the Youth Academy Development Coordinator with the MKE Ankaragücü. In November 2012, he was introduced for the TKI Tavşanlı Linyitspor. He died on 29 January 2013 due to a heart attack in Ankara. ==Playing career== Peçenek began his club football career with the capital club Ankara Güneşspor in 1976. He was discovered in 1978 to the Turkish U-18 national team and completed four games. Through these games, several teams were aware of him. The second division Ankara Şekerspor reacted fastest and secured the services of the young goalkeeper before the 1979/1980 season. The change has been reported in several newspapers and Peçenek found nationwide attention. The reason for this considerable attention to a change was the extraordinary handling of the transfer. In return for the release of Peçenek no money paid, but exchanging them for one Holstein Cattle from Ankara Güneşspor.Bir Garip Transfer Hikayesi This curious trading took Peçenek himself with humor and said: \\"End of the season remains to be seen who will be more productive\\". This transfer still considered as one of the seven most interesting transfers in the world. MKE Ankaragücü For the summer of 1981 he moved to city rivals MKE Ankaragücü. Peçenek spent 13 years under the roof of MKE Ankaragücü. Currently, he remains as one of the ten players with the longest period in the club’s history. In his first two seasons Peçenek had sat over the team captain and the goalkeeper Adil Eric is left with almost always on the bench. Starting from the 1983/1984 season, he became the captain of the team, to be called as a legend and he escalated to the national team. He took over long parts of the number one position, and received the title of the most jersey capped goalkeeper with more than 200 caps in the MKE Ankaragücü history until his left in 1993. In the 1984/85 season Peçenek saw the highlight of his career. In addition to his regular place in the number one the following three seasons proceeded to grow by Peçenek. He was appointed to the Turkish national team and was part of the permanent players for the national team. Within this period, he nominated for 13 times and inserted the number one for eight times. In the summer of 1989/1990 season, he had a herniated disc surgery and missed almost a half season. For the new season MKE Ankaragücü committed the Yugoslav goalkeeper Rade Zalad due to the surgery of Peçenek. The ascended Peçenek-Zalad competition in the seasons of 1990/1991 and 1991/1992 has ended with the takeover of Peçenek. Although, he had the number one position again in the 1992/93 season, he left after thirteen seasons MKE Ankaragücü in the cause of having troubles with the board. İstanbulspor and Adana Demirspor The summer of 1993 Peçenek moved to second division İstanbulspor, although his 17 successful inserts, İstanbulspor missed the chance of promotion to the first division with the last match. After working for İstanbulspor, he moved to the first division Adana Demirspor, and played just three games due to the injuries. The summer of 1995, Peçenek ended his active career as a professional footballer. ==Coaching career== After ending his football career, he moved into coaching specialist. He assisted in Vanspor, Adanaspor and again Vanspor the head coach Ali Osman Renklibay as an assistant coach. In 1999/2000 season Arif Peçenek took over Türk Telekomspor as his first head coaching experience. He met the expectations and ended the season with a championship.

The game is a follow-up to Dissidia Final Fantasy and Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, released for PlayStation Portable, and similarly allows players to battle one another using many characters from the Final Fantasy series. The game is a console port of the 2015 Japanese arcade game Dissidia Final Fantasy, and it was released worldwide in January 2018. ==Gameplay== Dissidia Final Fantasy NT's battle system was redesigned from the ground up, though some elements from the previous titles have been retained. Characters are divided into four combat classes: power-based Vanguards, agility-based Assassins, range-based Marksmen, and unique trait-based Specialists. Characters can perform Brave attacks, which increase the player's Bravery level based on the amount of damage done. If an opponent is attacked while their Bravery is at zero, a Bravery Break will be triggered, giving the player a substantial Bravery boost. Players can also perform HP attacks that will do direct damage to an opponent based on their current Bravery level. Using HP attacks will reset the player's Bravery back to zero, forcing them to perform more Brave attacks before they can directly attack their opponent again. The previous games' EX Mode has been tweaked, with players able to equip one HP attack and two EX Skills per character in battle. Unlike past Dissidia titles, NT places a focus on three- on-three combat, with players actively controlling one character while the in- game AI controls the other two. Each character has its own HP meter, along with a Party HP meter, Stamina meter, and Summon meter for the whole team. When a character is defeated, a segment will be removed from their team's Party HP meter; when the meter is depleted, the team loses the battle. Energy from the Stamina meter is expended when the player performs a dash or dodge to limit overuse; the meter will quickly recharge if the player remains on the ground for a short time. Players can use their shield or dodge to defend themselves, though the shield will deteriorate over time. Players can also fill their Summon gauge by attacking foes or destroying Summoning Crystals. By filling their team's Summon gauge, players can perform summons to call one of seven creatures such as Ifrit or Bahamut to attack their enemies, as well as grant passive buffs to the player's team. In addition to Standard Battles, NT features a second battle type in the form of Core Battles. These involve each team being given a large crystal to protect, which their opponent must attempt to destroy; the team whose crystal is destroyed first loses the battle. The game features several types of single-player arcade ladders, in which a player's team must defeat a series of increasingly-difficult AI opponents. These will sometimes conclude with a Bonus Battle, in which the player's team must defeat one of the game's seven Summons in a battle for additional points. The game also supports online multiplayer battles, with players able to form teams of three to battle opposing teams. By participating in online and offline battles, players will earn experience points to increase their Player Level and individual character levels. As characters level up, they will receive rewards such as new HP attacks and chat messages. Increasing the Player Level will grant additional rewards such as new EX Skills, Summons, and Memoria Tokens, the latter of which must be acquired to progress in the game's Story Mode. Players will also earn Gil that can be spent in the in-game shop to purchase new character costumes, weapons, and battle music. ==Plot== Set long after the events of the previous two Dissidia titles, but before the arcade version, the dimension of World B is revitalized for a conflict between , the goddess of protection, and , the god of destruction, who respectively summon the warriors of Cosmos and Chaos as their champions. Unlike their prior involvements, the summoned warriors retain their memories of both the previous war and their original worlds, which are used to expand World B, while the mystical energy created from their battles maintains it. Suspicious of the gods' unfamiliarity with their world and each other, Materia's warriors immediately separate to investigate the reason behind the new conflict. They learn from the world's summons that both gods were created from Cosmos's desire to protect the world. They also discover a separate threat in the form of \\"planesgorgers\\"—manifestations of Shinryu, the draconic being responsible for creating the previous cycle of war between Cosmos and Chaos—which threaten to absorb the world's energy and eradicate the world. When the world becomes overwhelmed by planesgorgers, the two sides form a truce to vanquish Shinryu himself, leading to a deliberate clash that lures him out. The warriors destroy Shinryu and return to their respective worlds, leaving behind duplicates of themselves with their memories of World B so that they may continue fighting on the gods' behalf. Characters Dissidia Final Fantasy NT features 38 playable characters. The arcade version featured fourteen characters at launch, including thirteen heroes from the previous Dissidia titles and a new hero from Final Fantasy XIV, with new characters continuously added to the roster via post-launch updates. The base roster of NT included every character available in the arcade version at the time of its release, totaling 28. Ten new characters were added to the arcade version first before releasing on PlayStation 4 as DLC after a short window of exclusivity. NT is the first Dissidia game to include characters from Final Fantasy spin-offs such as Tactics and Type 0. New characters to the franchise are listed below in bold. {  - ! Final Fantasy Game !

It was originally announced as an arcade title during the Japan Amusement Expo (JAEPO) trade show in Chiba, Japan on February 14, 2015. The game was developed with the core technology of the PlayStation 4. Square Enix wanted to release it for arcades first, while a console version would not be in development until at least a year after the launch of the arcade version. During development, Team Ninja considered using their 'soft engine' that allowed skin textures to appear softer, but decided not to due to not enough characters taking advantage of the benefits. The Arcade version launched in Japan on November 26, 2015. Director Takeo Kujiraoka hinted at the possibility of adding Noctis Lucis Caelum to the cast once Final Fantasy XV was released; Noctis was officially revealed at Sony's Tokyo Game Show conference on September 19, 2017. Kujiraoka also mentioned the possibility of the game becoming an eSport and being released outside of Japan. A console version was discussed as being in development but required features such as a story mode and further gameplay refinement before release. In June 2017, the PlayStation 4 port was formally announced under the name Dissidia Final Fantasy NT. The NT in the title was confirmed to have multiple meanings such as \\"New Trial\\", \\"New Tournament\\", and \\"New Tale\\". The scenario for Dissidia NT was written Kazushige Nojima—who also acted as a supervisor for the game—based on a draft by Dissidia and Final Fantasy XV writer Saori Itamuro. The PlayStation 4 version was released on January 30, 2018. On March 12, 2019 a free-to-play version was released for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows via Steam. On February 18, 2020, it was announced that updates for the game would cease and no additional characters would be added, with no current plans for a sequel. The developers initially targeted a total roster of 50 characters, including all those from the previous Dissidia titles. Characters not returning from Dissidia 012 include Gilgamesh, Laguna, Prishe, and Feral Chaos. Dataminers previously revealed the aforementioned characters, excluding Feral Chaos, as well as Zack Fair and Vivi Ornitier may have been planned to be implemented at some point. ==Reception== The original arcade version, called Dissidia Final Fantasy, sold over 3,000 arcade cabinets and generated strong revenue in Japan during the fiscal year 2015. The game was included at the Evo 2017 eSports event. The PlayStation 4 version, Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, sold 105,667 copies within its first week on sale in Japan, making it the best-selling game of the week in the country. It sold 134,100 units in Japan by January 28, 2018. The game was well received by Famitsu on their issue 1521, scoring 9/9/9/8 [35/40], but received mixed reviews outside of Japan. It received praise for its innovative three-on-three combat system and fan service, but received criticism for its user interface, online matchmaking and lack of content. In the company's 2018 third-quarter results presentation, Square Enix stated the game's sales were below expectations, adding that they hoped future promotions will be able to grow the game, along with new updates and additional content. The game was nominated for \\"Costume Design\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards. ==NotesReferences * Category:2015 video games Category:3D fighting games Category:Arcade games Category:Crossover video games Category:Fighting role-playing video games Category:Final Fantasy video games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Windows games ","title":"Dissidia Final Fantasy NT"},{"id":"46371311","text":"The 1933 Paris–Roubaix was the 34th edition of the Paris–Roubaix, a classic one-day cycle race in France.

At the request of the previous administration, a boundary review took place during 2014 with a view to make every ward represented by one councillor. The total number of councillors remained at 38, meaning that the final proposals from the Local Government Boundary Commission for England replaced 20 single-, double- and triple-member wards with 38, single-member. The local Conservative governing group increased their previous majority of two gained at the previous election. The Labour Party were the only other party fielding a full slate of 38 candidates, the first time since the election four council terms ago. Five independent candidates stood, two of whom were successfully returned. Local Liberal Democrats taking in 16 candidates had one councillor before the election, who was returned (re- elected) and made no gains.

All 57 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) won with an absolute majority of 30 councillors and 48.7% of the vote, the only time to date it would do so. The People's Coalition, the electoral alliance led by the People's Alliance (AP) and including the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the Liberal Union (UL), consolidated its gains made in the 1982 Spanish general election and emerged as the second political force in the city, with 38.0% and 23 seats in the City Council. Meanwhile, the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) vote fell as a result of PSOE's growth, losing over half of its councillors down to 4. The Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) had collapsed in the October general election and was disbanded in early 1983. Several UCD split parties such as Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) or former Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez' Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) contested the election but failed to win any representation. As a result of the election, Enrique Tierno Galván, was re- elected as Mayor of Madrid for a second term in office. Tierno Galván would die halfway throughout his term of natural causes, being substituted by party colleague Juan Barranco. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Madrid () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their civil and political rights. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the eldest one would be elected. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within fifteen days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one-thousandth of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election—with a compulsory minimum of 500 signatures—disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 29 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Madrid. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" center; font- size:95%; line-height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! style=\\"width:250px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Polling firm/Commissioner ! style=\\"width:125px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Fieldwork date ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Sample size ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Turnout ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" UCD ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PSOE ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PCE ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" AP–PDP–UL ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" CDS ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PDL ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Lead - ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" -  colspan=\\"11\\" A0A0A0\\" - EFEFEF;\\"  1983 municipal election  8 May 1983   70.8  –   48.4  6.8  37.8  3.0  2.6  style=\\"background:; color:white;\\" 10.6 -  colspan=\\"11\\" A0A0A0\\" -  Sofemasa/El País  23–26 Apr 1983 ?
